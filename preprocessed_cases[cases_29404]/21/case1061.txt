edward mills pleaded guilty to a information charging him with racketeering in violation of c.at sentencing,the district court considered the government motion under sentencing guideline asking for a departure on account of mills substantial assistance,but refused to depart.mills argues that the district court misled him at the plea hearing into believing his disclosures about a murder conspiracy would be used only for reducing his sentence the government breached its plea agreement with him by failing to argue that information provided by mills pursuant to the agreement should not be considered by the court the district court erred by invoking a categorical murder is different sentencing policy,ignoring its responsibility to consider the guideline factors as enumerated in sentencing guideline and the district court erred under by refusing to consider the full extent of assistance rendered by mills girlfriend at mills behest.we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
on march,in his plea hearing before the district court,edward mills waived his right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty to a charge under c.the information alleged that mills agreed to participate with a group of individuals in an organization whose primary purpose was to coordinate the distribution of crack cocaine.the underlying predicate acts included two acts of money laundering,conspiracy to murder,and interstate travel in aid of racketeering.
the government had originally offered mills a plea bargain in which he would serve a maximum of twenty years,with credit for state time served.the government had also discussed with mills in a proffer letter the possibility of his providing information about local drug trafficking and several unsolved murders.mills chose to cooperate with the government investigation in exchange for a favorable government recommendation at sentencing,which he hoped would result in a lower sentence than the twenty years the government offered if he did not cooperate.mills and the government eventually arrived at an agreement which included the following 
notwithstanding the provisions of b and the commentary thereto,the attorney agrees to take the position that,at the time of sentencing,information provided by defendant pursuant to this agreement should not be used either in determining where within the applicable guideline range to sentence defendant or in determining whether,or to what extent,a departure from the sentencing guidelines is warranted.
at the plea bargain hearing,the district court stated that under c,mills could face up to a sentence and that the court was under no obligation under the plea agreement to grant a downward departure.
mills cooperated with authorities and testified at the trial of john tibbs,an associate of mills who committed several murders in its motion,the government emphasized that prior to mills cooperation,the government had no evidence of who had committed these murders,and that mills had helped free an innocent man who had been wrongly convicted of one of these murders.the government also stated that mills had limited involvement in one murder and his involvement in another consisted only of driving tibbs to and from the scene.in its supplemental sentencing memorandum,the government took the position that based on mills cooperation,the danger he exposed himself to,the relative culpability of his,and the sentences they received,the court should depart downward and mills should receive a sentence of ten years.later,during mills sentencing hearing,the district court acknowledged that mills had displayed enormous personal courage and that the extent of his cooperation equaled or exceeded anything the court had ever seen.however,the court declined to follow the parties sentencing recommendations in light of mills involvement in several of the murders and his leadership role in a dangerous,violent enterprise.the court then sentenced mills to twenty years,with a credit for time served on a state sentence for drug trafficking.
mills first argues that the court misled him at the plea hearing into believing that his disclosures regarding the murder conspiracy would be used only for the purpose of reducing his sentence.during the plea hearing,the court discussed the possibility of using information about the murder conspiracy in its departure analysis.mills did not object.since he did not object,we have limited power to correct an error that was not timely raised before the district court.united states olano,d.an error not objected to at the plea hearing is reversible only where the error is plain,affects the defendant substantial rights,and seriously affects the fairness of the proceeding.also united states vonn,d.
mills does not dispute that the district court is permitted,for the purposes of departure,to consider information he provided pursuant to the plea agreement his involvement in the murder conspiracy.see ussg b.rather,he claims that the court misinformed him at the plea hearing about how it would use this information in its departure calculus 
the court and i will go into the melange of factors that i try to balance and that i take responsibility for.but,because he accepted responsibility,if you will for this fourth predicate act the conspiracy to murder now,can i consider that at all as to where the appropriate sentence is or,am i not to consider that at all 
heinrich assistant attorney well,your honor,let me answer it this way.in terms of setting your base,i do think that you should consider it.in terms of considering all the factors and however you weigh those both,whatever internal processes and external,mills cooperation would be,would include in both this instance and in other instances admitting responsibility for other criminal activity.and i think that the court in any case would take account of what it is he cooperating on,how he knows about it,whether he participated in it 
the court all right.
heinrich and the like in determining how far to come down in that connection.
mills argues that based on the assistant attorney description of the law and based on the court approval of this description he was led to believe that his involvement in the murder conspiracy would be used only in determining how far to come down in a departure,not in denying a departure altogether.mills cites conway,cir,in support of his argument that we should remand for because the district court misinformed him about its departure calculus.
a district court must not misinform the defendant entering a guilty plea about the court role at sentencing.the court is not bound to comply with the prosecutor recommendation for sentencing,and the defendant should be aware of this.see conway,at.to prevent confusion on the defendant part.c provides that 
before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere,the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands,the following 
the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered,the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law,if any,and the maximum possible penalty provided by law,including the effect of any special parole or supervised release term,the fact that the court is required to consider any applicable sentencing guidelines but may depart from those guidelines under some circumstances emphasis added.
in conway,this court held that the district court explanation of the plea agreement was misleading when the court made no distinction between the government obligation to follow the plea agreement and the court freedom to sentence according to the guidelines regardless of the parties recommendations.the defendant was mistakenly given the impression that information he gave pursuant to the plea agreement could not be used against him by the court,so we remanded for the court to rehear the motion for departure and to make new findings.
in mills case,on the other hand,the district court made it clear that the court was under no obligation to depart under the plea agreement.the district court repeatedly told mills that a substantial assistance motion by the government did not guarantee a departure 
the court now,if they do ask me for a departure,assuming what said here about how the guidelines work out is right,then i have no way of going lower than years.
do you understand that 
the court let consider it the other way.even if they do ask me,i not part of this plea bargain between you and the government.
do you understand that 
the court and i do have to go lower than the years.i know i ca go higher than years,but i do have to go lower.you understand that 
the court and you understand,i mean,i certainly will try to be fair and just,but i not bargaining now,i not part of any of this,i just trying to make sure you know what may happen to you.
do you understand that 
mills yes,i do.emphasis added.
mills was thus informed that the court was not bound by the plea agreement,and that in determining how far to depart,the court could choose not to depart at all.in light of the record as a whole,mills could not reasonably have understood the court to have promised to consider evidence only for purposes of deciding the length of a granted departure.we conclude that there is no error in this respect.
second,mills argues that the government breached its plea agreement.mills concedes that he did not raise this issue below.when a defendant has knowledge of conduct ostensibly amounting to a breach of a plea agreement,yet does not bring the breach to the attention of the sentencing court,we review only for plain error.united states saxena,cir.in order to show plain error,mills must establish that an error occurred,the error was plain,it affected his substantial rights,and it adversely impacted the fairness,integrity or public repute of judicial proceedings.united states riggs,cir.
the government had promised to take an affirmative position that information provided pursuant to the plea agreement should not be used at sentencing.in particular,the plea agreement stated 
notwithstanding the provisions of b and the commentary thereto,the attorney agrees to take the position that,at the time of sentencing,information provided by defendant pursuant to this agreement should not be used either in determining where within the applicable guideline range to sentence defendant or in determining whether,or to what extent,a departure from the sentencing guidelines is warranted.
mills argues that the government failed to take the agreed upon position.
the record shows that the government did,in fact,argue vigorously that the court should not use the information discussed in the plea agreement as part of its departure calculus.at sentencing,the government advanced two arguments in asking the court not to consider mills involvement in the murder conspiracy.first,the assistant attorney pointed out that given the nature of the agreement and given the nature of law enforcement,the court should not punish mills for admitting more serious conduct in the process of helping solve gang and homicides.second,the prosecutor argued that although the proffer agreement protected mills from being prosecuted for statements,he still took tremendous risks in confronting and exposing other persons involved in violence.furthermore,the government told the court that without mills assistance,the prosecution would have had no information or evidence that mills was involved in these murders.these arguments indicate that the government was encouraging the court not to consider mills role in the murder conspiracy for purposes of punishment,but rather to consider his role only insofar as his cooperation had aided the murder investigation and prosecution.
under the sentencing guidelines,the government could not withhold the information about mills involvement in the murder conspiracy from the court,and the court was free to consider it on its own under the provisions of and commentary on ussg b a provision explicitly referred to in the plea agreement itself.
moreover,although the government acknowledged mills role in the murder conspiracy by disclosing his involvement the government could only explain his remarkable assistance in the context of his involvement.the government did not violate or renege on its agreement with mills instead,it tried to make a compelling argument to the court as to why mills deserved a departure.we conclude that the government did not breach the plea agreement.
third,mills argues that the district court based its decision not to depart on a per se rule that was inconsistent with sentencing guideline.mills claims that the district court erred by stating a categorical rule that a downward departure for substantial assistance would not be granted,no matter what the circumstances,in cases involving murder.
in general,a district court denial of departure is discretionary and not appealable.see united states mariano,cir.there are,however,three situations in which a refusal to depart is appealable,including the refusal to depart involves an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines the refusal to depart otherwise violates the law,or the district court mistakenly believed that it lacked the discretion to depart.united states dewire,cir citations omitted.mills raises a challenge of the first kind,arguing that the district court failed to apply or misapplied sentencing guideline to his sentence 
before a court can consider a departure for substantial assistance,the government must first move for a downward departure under.see wade united states,d.the district court must then determine whether or not to depart from the sentencing guideline range,and if so,how far to depart.mariano,at.sentencing guideline requires the district court to consider a range of factors in evaluating a substantial assistance motion.it states 
a t he appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for reasons stated that may include,but are not limited to,consideration of the following 
the court evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant assistance,taking into consideration the government evaluation of the assistance rendered 
the truthfulness,completeness,and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant 
the nature and extent of the defendant assistance 
any injury suffered,or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance 
the timeliness of the defendant assistance.emphasis added.
we have held that a district court,faced with a section motion,must at a bare minimum indicate its cognizance of these factors.mariano,at.
the use of the phrase may include,but are not limited to in indicates that the district court may also examine factors beyond those enumerated in a.see united states chestna,cir.and since the court is not limited to the factors alone,the court may also look at other factors which touch upon the degree,efficacy,timeliness,and circumstances of the defendant cooperation.mariano,at.
in mariano,we explained that in authorizing departures for substantial assistance,section serves a dual purpose.in addition to permitting ex post tailoring of defendants sentences to reflect meaningful assistance rendered between the dates of apprehension and sentencing,it provides defendants,ex ante,with an incentive to cooperate in the administration of justice.at emphasis in original.this second and obtaining particularly important in the government investigation and prosecution of gang violence and drug trafficking.
in mills case,the district court showed its awareness of the requirements of.the court explained how it would hear arguments in evaluating the government motion 
there is a motion under.that motion is allowed.as you understand,do anyone take any particular comfort from that.what that does is give me the discretion to depart downward.
the court looked at mills sentencing memorandum,paying particular attention to the section of mills memorandum which analyzed reductions for substantial assistance.the court found that the information provided was accurate by a fair preponderance of the evidence.in addition,the district court discussed the government motion and found that mills assistance as described in the government motion was as great,if not
