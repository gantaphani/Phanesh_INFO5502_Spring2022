the armed career criminal act acca imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who also has three prior state or federal convictions for a violent felony,including burglary,arson,or extortion.e,e b ii.to determine whether a prior conviction is for one of those listed crimes,courts apply the categorical approach they ask whether the elements of the offense forming the basis for the conviction sufficiently match the elements of the generic or commonly understood version of the enumerated crime.see taylor united states.elements are the constituent parts of a crime legal definition,which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction they are distinct from facts,which are mere things extraneous to the crime legal requirements and thus ignored by the categorical approach.
when a statute defines only a single crime with a single set of elements,application of the categorical approach is straightforward.but when a statute defines multiple crimes by listing multiple,alternative elements,the required by the categorical approach is more difficult.to decide whether a conviction under such a statute is for a listed acca offense,a sentencing court must discern which of the alternative elements was integral to the defendant conviction.that determination is made possible by the modified categorical approach,which permits a court to look at a limited class of documents from the record of a prior conviction to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of before comparing that crime elements to those of the generic offense.see,shepard united states.this case involves a different type of alternatively worded statute one that defines only one crime,with one set of elements,but which lists alternative factual means by which a defendant can satisfy those elements.
here,petitioner richard mathis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.because of his five prior iowa burglary convictions,the government requested an acca sentence enhancement.under the generic offense,burglary requires unlawful entry into a building or other structure.taylor,at.the iowa statute,however,reaches any building,structure,or land,water,or air vehicle.iowa code.under iowa law,that list of places does not set out alternative elements,but rather alternative means of fulfilling a single locational element.
the district court applied the modified categorical approach,found that mathis had burgled structures,and imposed an enhanced sentence.the eighth circuit affirmed.acknowledging that the iowa statute swept more broadly than the generic statute,the court determined that,even if structures and vehicles were not separate elements but alternative means of fulfilling a single element,a sentencing court could still invoke the modified categorical approach.because the record showed that mathis had burgled structures,the court held,the district court treatment of mathis prior convictions as acca predicates was proper.
held because the elements of iowa burglary law are broader than those of generic burglary,mathis prior convictions can not give rise to acca sentence enhancement.
a this case is resolved by this court precedents,which have repeatedly held,and in no uncertain terms,that a state crime can not qualify as an acca predicate if its elements are broader than those of a listed generic offense.see,taylor,at.the underlying brute facts or means by which the defendant commits his crime,richardson united states,make no difference even if the defendant conduct,in fact,fits within the definition of the generic offense,the mismatch of elements saves him from an acca sentence.acca requires a sentencing judge to look only to the elements of the offense,not to the facts of the defendant conduct.taylor,at.
this court cases establish three basic reasons for adhering to an inquiry.first,acca text,which asks only about a defendant prior convictions,indicates that congress meant for the sentencing judge to ask only whether the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,at,not what he had done.second,construing acca to allow a sentencing judge to go any further would raise serious sixth amendment concerns because only a jury,not a judge,may find facts that increase the maximum penalty.see apprendi new jersey.and third,an avoids unfairness to defendants,who otherwise might be sentenced based on statements of fact s that are prone to error because their proof is unnecessary to a conviction.descamps united states.
those reasons remain as strong as ever when a statute,like iowa burglary statute,lists alternative means of fulfilling one or more of a crime elements.acca term convictions still supports an inquiry.the sixth amendment problems associated with a court exploration of means rather than elements do not abate in the face of a statute like iowa alternative factual scenarios remain just that,and thus to sentencing judges.finally,a statute listing of disjunctive means does nothing to mitigate the possible unfairness of basing an increased penalty on something not legally necessary to a prior conviction.accordingly,whether means are listed in a statute or not,acca does not care about them rather,its focus,as always,remains on a crime elements.
b the first task for a court faced with an alternatively phrased statute is thus to determine whether the listed items are elements or means.that threshold inquiry is easy here,where a state supreme court ruling answers the question.a state statute on its face could also resolve the issue.and if state law fails to provide clear answers,the record of a prior conviction itself might prove useful to determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense.if such record materials do not speak plainly,a sentencing judge will be unable to satisfy taylor demand for certainty.shepard,at.but between the record and state law,that kind of indeterminacy should prove more the exception than the rule.

richard mathis,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the armed career criminal act acca or act,e,imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on certain federal defendants who have three prior convictions for a violent felony,including burglary,arson,or extortion.to determine whether a past conviction is for one of those offenses,courts compare the elements of the crime of conviction with the elements of the generic version of the listed offense,the offense as commonly understood.for more than years,our decisions have held that the prior crime qualifies as an acca predicate if,but only if,its elements are the same as,or narrower than,those of the generic offense.the question in this case is whether acca makes an exception to that rule when a defendant is convicted under a statute that lists multiple,alternative means of satisfying one or more of its elements.we decline to find such an exception.
acca prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence if a defendant is convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm following three prior convictions for a violent felony.e.absent that sentence enhancement,the statute sets a maximum penalty.see a.acca defines the term violent felony to include any felony,whether state or federal,that is burglary,arson,or extortion.e b ii.in listing those crimes,we have held,congress referred only to their usual or in our terminology generic versions not to all variants of the offenses.see taylor united states.that means as to burglary the offense relevant in this case that congress meant a crime contain ing the following elements an unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building or other structure,with intent to commit a crime.ibid.
to determine whether a prior conviction is for generic burglary or other listed crime courts apply what is known as the categorical approach they focus solely on whether the elements of the crime of conviction sufficiently match the elements of generic burglary,while ignoring the particular facts of the case.see,at.distinguishing between elements and facts is therefore central to acca operation.elements are the constituent parts of a crime legal definition the things the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.black law dictionary ed.at a trial,they are what the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant,see richardson united states,and at a plea hearing,they are what the defendant necessarily admits when he pleads guilty,see mccarthy united states.facts,by contrast,are mere things extraneous to the crime legal requirements.we have sometimes called them brute facts when distinguishing them from elements.richardson,at.they are circumstance s or event s having no legal effect or consequence in particular,they need neither be found by a jury nor admitted by a defendant.black law dictionary.and acca,as we have always understood it,cares not a whit about them.see,taylor,at.a crime counts as burglary under the act if its elements are the same as,or narrower than,those of the generic offense.but if the crime of conviction covers any more conduct than the generic offense,then it is not an acca burglary even if the defendant actual conduct,the facts of the crime fits within the generic offense boundaries.
the comparison of elements that the categorical approach requires is straightforward when a statute sets out a single or indivisible set of elements to define a single crime.the court then lines up that crime elements alongside those of the generic offense and sees if they match.so,for example,this court found that a california statute swept more broadly than generic burglary because it criminalized entering a location even if lawfully with the intent to steal,and thus encompassed mere shoplifting.see,at descamps united states,slip,at.accordingly,no conviction under that law could count as an acca predicate,even if the defendant in fact made an illegal entry and so committed burglary in its generic form.see,at slip,at.
some statutes,however,have a more complicated sometimes called divisible structure,making the comparison of elements harder,at slip,at.a single statute may list elements in the alternative,and thereby define multiple crimes.suppose,for example,that the california law noted above had prohibited the lawful entry or the unlawful entry of a premises with intent to steal,so as to create two different offenses,one more serious than the other.if the defendant were convicted of the offense with unlawful entry as an element,then his crime of conviction would match generic burglary and count as an acca predicate but,conversely,the conviction would not qualify if it were for the offense with lawful entry as an element.a sentencing court thus requires a way of figuring out which of the alternative elements listed lawful entry or unlawful entry was integral to the defendant conviction that is,which was necessarily found or admitted.see,at slip,at.to address that need,this court approved the modified categorical approach for use with statutes having multiple alternative elements.see,shepard united states.under that approach,a sentencing court looks to a limited class of documents for example,the indictment,jury instructions,or plea agreement and colloquy to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of.see taylor,at.the court can then compare that crime,as the categorical approach commands,with the relevant generic offense.
this case concerns a different kind of alternatively phrased law not one that lists multiple elements disjunctively,but instead one that enumerates various factual means of committing a single element.see generally schad arizona,plurality opinion l egislatures frequently enumerate alternative means of committing a crime without intending to define separate elements or separate crimes to use a hypothetical adapted from two of our prior decisions,suppose a statute requires use of a deadly weapon as an element of a crime and further provides that the use of a knife,gun,bat,or similar weapon would all qualify.see descamps,at slip,at richardson,at.because that kind of list merely specifies diverse means of satisfying a single element of a single crime or otherwise said,spells out various factual ways of committing some component of the offense a jury need not find or a defendant admit any particular item a jury could convict even if some jurors conclude d that the defendant used a knife while others conclude d he used a gun,so long as all agreed that the defendant used a deadly weapon.see descamps,at slip,at describing means,for this reason,as legally extraneous circumstances and similarly,to bring the discussion back to burglary,a statute might indeed,as soon discussed,iowa burglary law does itemize the various places that crime could occur as disjunctive factual scenarios rather than separate elements,so that a jury need not make any specific findings or a defendant admissions on that score.
the issue before us is whether acca treats this kind of statute as it does all others,imposing a sentence enhancement only if the state crime elements correspond to those of a generic offense or instead whether the act makes an exception for such a law,so that a sentence can be enhanced when one of the statute specified means creates a match with the generic offense,even though the broader element would not.
petitioner richard mathis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.see g.at sentencing,the government asked the district court to impose acca minimum penalty based on mathis five prior convictions for burglary under iowa law.
iowa burglary statute,all parties agree,covers more conduct than generic burglary does.see brief for petitioner brief for united states.the generic offense requires unlawful entry into a building or other structure.taylor,at supra,at.iowa statute,by contrast,reaches a broader range of places any building,structure,or land,water,or air vehicle.iowa code emphasis added.and those listed locations are not alternative elements,going toward the creation of separate crimes.to the contrary,they lay out alternative ways of satisfying a single locational element,as the iowa supreme court has held each of the terms serves as an alternative method of committing the single crime of burglary,so that a jury need not agree on which of the locations was actually involved.state duncan,iowa see state rooney,iowa discussing the single broadly phrased element of place in iowa burglary law.in short,the statute defines one crime,with one set of elements,broader than generic burglary while specifying multiple means of fulfilling its locational element,some but not all of which,buildings and other structures,but not vehicles satisfy the generic definition.
the district court imposed an acca enhancement on mathis after inspecting the records of his prior convictions and determining that he had burgled structures,rather than vehicles.see app.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed.it acknowledged that iowa burglary statute,by covering vehicles in addition to structures,swept more broadly than generic burglary.see,at.but it noted that if structures and vehicles were separate elements,each part of a different crime,then a sentencing court could invoke the modified categorical approach and look to old record materials to see which of those crimes the defendant had been convicted of.see,at.and the court of appeals thought nothing changed if structures and vehicles were not distinct elements but only alternative means whether such locations amount to alternative elements or merely alternative means to fulfilling an element,the eighth circuit held,a sentencing court must apply the modified categorical approach and inspect the records of prior cases,at.if the court found from those materials that the defendant had in fact committed the offense in a way that satisfied the definition of generic burglary here,by burgling a structure rather than a vehicle then the court should treat the conviction as an acca predicate.and that was so,the court of appeals stated,even though the elements of the crime of conviction,in encompassing both types of locations,were broader than those of the relevant generic offense.see,at.in this circumstance,the court thus found,acca usual inquiry would yield to a one.
that decision added to a circuit split over whether acca general rule that a defendant crime of conviction can count as a predicate only if its elements match those of a generic offense gives way when a statute happens to list various means by which a defendant can satisfy an element we granted certiorari to resolve that division,and now reverse.
as just noted,the elements of mathis crime of conviction iowa burglary cover a greater swath of conduct than the elements of the relevant acca offense generic burglary.see supra,at.under our precedents,that undisputed disparity resolves this case.we have often held,and in no uncertain terms,that a state crime can not qualify as an acca predicate if its elements are broader than those of a listed generic offense.see,taylor,at.how a given defendant actually perpetrated the crime what we have referred to as the underlying brute facts or means of commission,richardson,at makes no difference even if his conduct fits within the generic offense,the mismatch of elements saves the defendant from an acca sentence.those longstanding principles,and the reasoning that underlies them,apply regardless of whether a statute omits or instead specifies alternative possible means of commission.the itemized construction gives a sentencing court no special warrant to explore the facts of an offense,rather than to determine the crime elements and compare them with the generic definition.
taylor set out the essential rule governing acca cases more than a quarter century ago.all that counts under the act,we held then,are the elements of the statute of conviction.at.so,for example,the label a state assigns to a crime whether burglary,breaking and entering,or something else entirely has no relevance to whether that offense is an acca predicate.see,at.and more to the point here the same is true of the particular facts underlying the prior convictions the means by which the defendant,in real life,committed his crimes,at.that rule can seem counterintuitive in some cases,a sentencing judge knows or can easily discover that the defendant carried out a real burglary,even though the crime of conviction also extends to other conduct.no matter.under acca,taylor stated,it is impermissible for a particular crime to sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not,depending on the facts of the case.at.accordingly,a sentencing judge may look only to the elements of the offense,not to the facts of the defendant conduct.ibid.
that simple point became a mantra in our subsequent acca decisions at the risk of repetition perhaps downright tedium,here are some examples.in shepard acca refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior convictions and the element s of crimes.at alteration in original.in james united states w e have avoided any inquiry into the underlying facts of the defendant particular offense,and have looked solely to the elements of burglary as defined by state law.in sykes united states w e consider only the elements of the offense,without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.quoting james,at emphasis in original.and most recently and tersely in descamps the key under acca is elements,not facts.at slip,at.
our decisions have given three basic reasons for adhering to an inquiry.first,acca text favors that approach.by enhancing the sentence of a defendant who has three previous convictions for generic burglary,e rather than one who has thrice committed that crime congress indicated that the sentencer should ask only about whether the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,and not about what the defendant had actually done.taylor,at.congress well knows how to instruct sentencing judges to look into the facts of prior crimes in other statutes,using different language,it has done just that.see united states hayes,concluding that the phrase an offense committed charged sentencers with considering facts nijhawan holder,construing an immigration statute to call for a,not a categorical interpretation but congress chose another course in acca,focusing on only the elements of the statute of conviction.taylor,at.
second,a construction of acca allowing a sentencing judge to go any further would raise serious sixth amendment concerns.this court has held that only a jury,and not a judge,may find facts that increase a maximum penalty,except for the simple fact of a prior conviction.see apprendi new jersey.that means a judge can not go beyond identifying the crime of conviction to explore the manner in which the defendant committed that offense.see shepard,at plurality opinion,at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in judgment stating that such an approach would amount to constitutional error he is prohibited from conducting such an inquiry himself and so too he is barred from making a disputed determination about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea or what the jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory of the crime.see,at plurality opinion descamps,at slip,at.he can do no more,consistent with the sixth amendment,than determine what crime,with what elements,the defendant was convicted of.
and third,an avoids unfairness to defendants.statements of fact in the records of prior convictions are prone to error precisely because their proof is unnecessary,at slip,at.at trial,and still more at plea hearings,a defendant may have no incentive to contest what does not matter under the law to the contrary,he may have good reason not to or even be precluded from doing so by the court.ibid.when that is true,a prosecutor or judge mistake as to means,reflected in the record,is likely to go uncorrected.see ibid such inaccuracies should not come back to haunt the defendant many years down the road by triggering a lengthy mandatory sentence.
those three reasons stay as strong as ever when a statute,instead of merely laying out a crime elements,lists alternative means of fulfilling one or more of them.acca use of the term convictions still supports an inquiry indeed,that language directly refutes an approach that would treat as consequential a statute reference to factual circumstances not essential to any conviction.similarly,the sixth amendment problems associated with a court exploration of means rather than elements do not abate in the face of a statute like iowa whether or not mentioned in a statute text,alternative factual scenarios remain just that and so remain to judges imposing acca enhancements.and finally,a statute listing of disjunctive means does nothing to mitigate the possible unfairness of basing an increased penalty on something not legally necessary to a prior conviction.whatever the statute says,or leaves out,about diverse ways of committing a crime makes no difference to the defendant incentives or lack thereof to contest such matters.
for these reasons,the court below erred in applying the modified categorical approach to determine the means by which mathis committed his prior crimes,at.acca,as just explained,treats such facts as irrelevant find them or not,by examining the record or anything else,a court still may not use them to enhance a sentence.and indeed,our cases involving the modified categorical approach have already made exactly that point.t he only use of that approach we have ever allowed,we stated a few terms ago,is to determine which element s played a part in the defendant conviction.descamps,at,slip,at,emphasis added see taylor,at noting that the modified approach may be employed only to determine whether a jury necessarily had to find each element of generic burglary.in other words,the modified approach serves and serves solely as a tool to identify the elements of the crime of conviction when a statute disjunctive phrasing renders one or more of them opaque.see descamps,at slip,at it is not to be repurposed as a technique for discovering whether a defendant prior conviction,even though for a crime,rested on facts or otherwise said,involved means that also could have satisfied the elements of a generic offense.
the government and justice breyer claim that our longtime and exclusive focus on elements does not resolve this case because so they say when we talked about elements,we did not really mean it.t he court used elements,the government informs us,not to distinguish between means and elements,but instead to refer to whatever the statute lists whether means or elements.brief for united states see,at.in a similar vein,justice breyer posits that every time we said the word element,we used the word generally,simply to refer to the matter at issue,without intend ing to set forth a generally applicable rule.post,at dissenting opinion.
but a good rule of thumb for reading our decisions is that what they say and what they mean are one and the same and indeed,we have previously insisted on that point with reference to acca approach.in descamps,the sole dissenting justice made an argument identical to the one now advanced by the government and justice breyer that our prior caselaw had not intended to distinguish between statutes listing alternative elements and those setting out merely alternative means of commission,at slip,at opinion of alito,the court rejected that contention,stating that a ll those decisions rested on the explicit premise that the laws contain ed statutory phrases that cover several different crimes,not several different methods of committing one offense in other words,that they listed alternative elements,not alternative means,at,slip,at,ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted see,johnson united states,nijhawan,at.that premise was important,we explained,because an acca penalty may be based only on what a jury necessarily found to convict a defendant or what he necessarily admitted.descamps,at,slip,at.and elements alone fit that bill a means,or as we have called it fact,is by definition not necessary to support a conviction.at,slip,at,see supra,at accordingly,descamps made clear that when the court had earlier said and said and said elements,it meant just that and nothing else.
for that reason,this court including justice breyer recently made clear that a court may not look behind the elements of a generally drafted statute to identify the means by which a defendant committed a crime.see descamps,at slip,at.consider if iowa defined burglary as involving merely an unlawful entry into a premises without any further elaboration of the types of premises that exist in the world,a house,a building,a car,a boat.then,all agree,acca would apply.no matter that the record of a prior conviction clearly indicated that the defendant burgled a house at maple road and that the jury found as much because iowa hypothetical law included an element broader than that of the generic offense,the defendant could not receive an acca sentence.were that not so,this court stated,the categorical approach would be at an end the court would merely be asking whether a particular set of facts leading to a conviction conforms to a generic acca offense.at slip,at.that conclusion is common ground,and must serve as the baseline for anything justice breyer or the government here argues.
and contrary to his view,that baseline not only begins but also ends the analysis,because nothing material changes if iowa law further notes much as it does that a premises may include a house,a building,a car,or a boat.that fortuity of legislative drafting affects neither the oddities of applying the categorical approach nor the reasons for doing so.on the one hand,a categorical inquiry can produce the same consequences however a state law is written.whether or not the statute lists various means of satisfying the premises element,the record of a prior conviction is just as likely to make plain that the defendant burgled that house on maple road and the jury knew it.on the other hand and as already shown,the grounds constitutional,statutory,and equitable that we have offered for nonetheless using the categorical approach lose none of their force in the switch from a generally phrased statute leaving means implicit to a more particular one expressly enumerating them.see supra,at.in every relevant sense,both functional and legal,the two statutes one saying just premises,the other listing structures and vehicles are the same.and so the same rule must apply acca disregards the means by which the defendant committed his crime,and looks only to that offense elements.
the first task for a sentencing court faced with an alternatively phrased statute is thus to determine whether its listed items are elements or means.if they are elements,the court should do what we have previously approved review the record materials to discover which of the enumerated alternatives played a part in the defendant prior conviction,and then compare that element along with all others to those of the generic crime.see ibid.but if instead they are means,the court has no call to decide which of the statutory alternatives was at issue in the earlier prosecution.given acca indifference to how a defendant actually committed a prior offense,the court may ask only whether the elements of the state crime and generic offense make the requisite match.
this threshold inquiry elements or means is easy in this case,as it will be in many others.here,a state court decision definitively answers the question the listed premises in iowa burglary law,the state supreme court held,are alternative method s of committing one offense,so that a jury need not agree whether the burgled location was a building,other structure,or vehicle.see duncan,at supra,at.when a ruling of that kind exists,a sentencing judge need only follow what it says.see schad,at plurality opinion.likewise,the statute on its face may resolve the issue.if statutory alternatives carry different punishments,then under apprendi they must be elements.see.stat.stat,tit,cum.supp.see also,at requiring a jury to agree on any circumstance increasing a statutory penalty supra,at.conversely,if a statutory list is drafted to offer illustrative examples,then it includes only a crime means of commission.united states howard,see united states.and a statute may itself identify which things must be charged and so are elements and which need not be and so are means.see,cal.penal code ann.west.armed with such authoritative sources of state law,federal sentencing courts can readily determine the nature of an alternatively phrased list.
and if state law fails to provide clear answers,federal judges have another place to look the record of a prior conviction itself.as judge kozinski has explained,such a peek at the record documents is for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether the listed items are element s of the offense.rendon holder,opinion dissenting from denial of reh g en banc only if the answer is yes can the court make further use of the materials,as previously described,see supra,at.suppose,for example,that one count of an indictment and correlative jury instructions charge a defendant with burgling a building,structure,or vehicle thus reiterating all the terms of iowa law.that is as clear an indication as any that each alternative is only a possible means of commission,not an element that the prosecutor must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.so too if those documents use a single umbrella term like premises once again,the record would then reveal what the prosecutor has to and does not have to demonstrate to prevail.see descamps,at slip,at.conversely,an indictment and jury instructions could indicate,by referencing one alternative term to the exclusion of all others,that the statute contains a list of elements,each one of which goes toward a separate crime.of course,such record materials will not in every case speak plainly,and if they do not,a sentencing judge will not be able to satisfy taylor demand for certainty when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a generic offense.shepard,at.but between those documents and state law,that kind of indeterminacy should prove more the exception than the rule.
our precedents make this a straightforward case.for more than years,we have repeatedly made clear that application of acca involves,and involves only,comparing elements.courts must ask whether the crime of conviction is the same as,or narrower than,the relevant generic offense.they may not ask whether the defendant conduct his particular means of committing the crime falls within the generic definition.and that rule does not change when a statute happens to list possible alternative means of commission whether or not made explicit,they remain what they ever were just the facts,which acca so we have held,over and over does not care about.
some have raised concerns about this line of decisions,and suggested to congress that it reconsider how acca is written.see,chambers united states,alito,concurring in judgment descamps,at slip,at kennedy,concurring.but whether for good or for ill,the approach remains the law.and we will not introduce inconsistency and arbitrariness into our acca decisions by here declining to follow its requirements.everything this court has ever said about acca runs counter to the government position.that alone is sufficient reason to reject it coherence has a claim on the law.
because the elements of iowa burglary law are broader than those of generic burglary,mathis convictions under that law can not give rise to an acca sentence.we accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.
it is so ordered.
kennedy,concurring 
richard mathis,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice kennedy,concurring.
the court opinion is required by its precedents,and so i join it,with one reservation set forth below.
in no uncertain terms,the court has held that the word burglary in the armed career criminal act acca refers to the elements of the statute of conviction,not to the facts of each defendant conduct.taylor united states.an enhancement is proper,the court has said,if a defendant is convicted of a crime having the elements of generic burglary,regardless of its exact definition or label under state law,at.see also descamps united states,slip,at t he categorical approach central feature is a focus on the elements,rather than the facts,of a crime in the instant case,then,the court is correct to conclude that an approach remains the law.ante.at.and it is correct to note further that it would introduce inconsistency and arbitrariness into our acca decisions by here declining to follow its requirements,without reconsidering our precedents as a whole.ibid.
my one reservation to the court opinion concerns its reliance on apprendi new jersey.ante at.in my view,apprendi was incorrect and,in any event,does not compel the elements based approach.that approach is required only by the court statutory precedents,which congress remains free to overturn.
as both dissenting opinions point out,today decision is a stark illustration of the arbitrary and inequitable results produced by applying an elements based approach to this sentencing scheme.it could not have been congress intent for a career offender to escape his statutorily mandated punishment when the record makes it clear beyond any possible doubt that he committed generic burglary.post,at opinion of alito.congress also could not have intended vast sentencing disparities for defendants convicted of identical criminal conduct in different jurisdictions.
congress is capable of amending the acca to resolve these concerns.see,nijhawan holder,interpreting the language congress used in a m i as requiring a rather than categorical approach.but continued congressional inaction in the face of a system that each year proves more unworkable should require this court to revisit its precedents in an appropriate case.
thomas,concurring 
richard mathis,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice thomas,concurring.
i join the court opinion,which faithfully applies our precedents.the court holds that the modified categorical approach can not be used to determine the specific means by which a defendant committed a crime.ante,at.by rightly refusing to apply the modified categorical approach,the court avoids further extending its precedents that limit a criminal defendant right to a public trial before a jury of his peers.
in united states,the court held that the existence of a prior conviction triggering enhanced penalties for a recidivist was a fact that could be found by a judge,not an element of the crime that must be found by a jury.two years later,the court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum is an element of a crime and therefore must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi new jersey,see,at.but apprendi recognized an exception for the fact of a prior conviction,instead of overruling.see,at.i continue to believe that the exception in apprendi was wrong,and i have urged that be reconsidered.see descamps united states,thomas,concurring in judgment slip,at.
consistent with this view,i continue to believe that depending on facts in armed career criminal act acca cases violates the sixth amendment and is irreconcilable with apprendi.acca improperly allows the judge to mak e a finding that raises a defendant sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.descamps,supra,at opinion of thomas,slip,at brackets in original internal quotation marks omitted.this sixth amendment problem persists regardless of whether a court is determining whether a prior conviction was entered,or attempting to discern what facts were necessary to a prior conviction.at slip,at citation omitted.
today,the court at least limits the situations in which courts make factual determinations about prior convictions.ibid.as the court explains,the means of committing an offense are nothing more than various factual ways of committing some component of the offense.ante,at.permitting judges to determine the means of committing a prior offense would expand.therefore,i join the court opinion refusing to allow judges to determine,without a jury,which alternative means supported a defendant prior convictions.
breyer,dissenting 
richard mathis,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg joins,dissenting.
the distinction that the court draws should not matter for sentencing purposes.i fear that the majority contrary view will unnecessarily complicate federal sentencing law,often preventing courts from properly applying the sentencing statute that congress enacted.i consequently dissent.
the federal statute before us imposes a mandatory minimum sentence upon a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm if that person also has three previous convictions for among several other things burglary.e b ii.the petitioner here has been convicted of being a felon in possession,and he previously was convicted of three other crimes that qualify him for the federal mandatory minimum if,but only if,those previous convictions count as burglary.to decide whether he has committed what the federal statute calls a burglary,we must look to the state statute that he violated.
the relevant state statute,an iowa statute,says that a person commits a crime if he enters an occupied structure,having no right to do so,with the intent to commit a felony.iowa code.it then goes on to define occupied structure as including any building,structure,land vehicle,water vehicle,or air vehicle,or similar place.the problem arises because,as we have previously held,see taylor united states,if the structure that an offender unlawfully entered with intent to commit a felony was a building,the state crime that he committed counts under the federal statute as burglary.but if the structure that the offender unlawfully entered was a land,water,or air vehicle,the state crime does not count as a burglary.thus,a conviction for violating the state statute may,or may not,count as a burglary,depending upon whether the structure that he entered was,say,a building or a water vehicle.
here,if we look at the court documents charging mathis with a violation of the state statute,they tell us that he was charged with entering,for example,a house and garage.app.charging documents.they say nothing about any other structure,say,a water vehicle.thus,to convict him,the jury which had to find that he unlawfully entered an occupied structure must have found that he entered a house and garage,which concededly count as building s.so why is that not the end of this matter why does the federal statute not apply 
just to be sure,let us look at how we previously treated an almost identical instance.in taylor,a state statute made criminal the breaking and entering of a building,booth,tent,boat,or railroad car.at.we explained that breaking into a building would amount to burglary under the federal statute,but breaking into a railroad car would not.but the conviction document itself said only that the offender had violated the statute it did not say whether he broke into a building or a railroad car.see,at.we said that in such a case the federal sentencing judge could look at the charging papers and the jury instructions in the state case to try to determine what the state conviction was actually for building,tent,or railroad car.we wrote that 
in a state whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile as well as a building,if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building,and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict,then the government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.at.
we later added that where a conviction rests upon an offender guilty plea,the federal judge can look to the facts that the offender admitted at his plea colloquy for the same purpose.see shepard united states.
so,again,what is the problem the state burglary statut e include s entry of a vehicle as well as a building.taylor,at.the conviction document might not specify what kind of a structure the defendant entered,whether a building or an automobile.but the federal sentencing judge can look at the charging documents or plea colloquy to see whether the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building.ibid.and here that was so.in addition,since the charging documents show that the defendant was charged only with illegal entry of a building not a tent or a railroad car the jury,in order to find as it did that the defendant broke into an occupied structure,would necessarily have had to find an entry of a building.ibid.hence,the government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.ibid.
the majority,however,does not agree that the two cases i have described are almost identical.to the contrary,it notes correctly that our precedent often uses the word element to describe the relevant facts to which a statute refers when it uses words such as building,tent,boat,or railroad car.see,ante,at.it points out that,here,the iowa supreme court described those words as referring,not to elements of a crime,but rather to means through which a crime was committed.see ante,at.and that fact,in the majority view,makes all the difference.see ante,at.but why i,of course,see that there is a distinction between means and elements in the abstract,but for sentencing purposes i believe that it is a distinction without a difference.
i begin with a point about terminology.all the relevant words in this case,such as building,structure,water vehicle,and the like,are statutory words.moreover,the statute uses those words to help describe a crime.further,the statute always uses those words to designate facts.whether the offender broke into a building is a fact whether he broke into a water vehicle is a fact.sometimes,however,a state may treat certain of those facts as elements of a crime.and sometimes a state may treat certain of those facts as means of committing a crime.so far,everyone should agree.see richardson united states,describing both elements and means as facts where we disagree is whether that difference,relevant to the application of state law,should make a difference for federal sentencing purposes.
whether a state considers the statutory words boat or building to describe elements of a crime or a means of committing a crime can make a difference for purposes of applying the state criminal law,but it should not make a difference in respect to the sentencing question at issue here.the majority,i believe,reasons something like this suppose the jury unanimously agreed that the defendant unlawfully entered some kind of structure with felonious intent,but the jury is deadlocked six to six as to whether that structure is a boat or a house.if the statute uses those two words to describe two different elements of two different crimes,breaking into a boat,and breaking into a house then the defendant wins,for the jury has not found unanimously each element of either crime.but if the statute uses those two words to describe two different means of committing the same crime,breaking into an occupied structure that consists of either a house or a boat then the defendant loses,for as long as the jury decides unanimously that the defendant broke into an occupied structure of whichever kind the jury need not decide unanimously which particular means the defendant used to commit the crime.see ante,at.
i accept that reasoning.but i do not see what it has to do with sentencing.in the majority view,the label means opens up the possibility of a jury split,and it believes that fact would prevent us from knowing whether the conviction was for breaking into a building or a boat.see ante,at.but precisely the same is true were we to use the label element to describe the facts set forth in the state statute.the federal sentencing judge may see on the defendant record a conviction for violating a particular provision of the state criminal code that code may list in a single sentence both buildings and boats the state may interpret the two words as separate elements of two separate crimes and the federal judge will not know from the simple fact of conviction for violating the statute without more which of the two crimes was at issue that is,was it the one aimed at burglaries of buildings,or the one aimed at burglaries of boats.that is why the court said in taylor that in such a case the federal judge may look to the indictment or information and jury instructions to determine whether the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building,rather than a boat,to convict.at.if so,the federal judge may count the conviction as falling within the federal statutory word burglary and use it for sentencing.
in my view,precisely the same is true if the state courts label the facts building,boat,as means rather than elements.the federal judge should be able to look to the charging documents and the plea agreement to see if the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building,rather than a boat,to convict.ibid.if so,the federal judge should be able to count the conviction as a burglary conviction and use it for sentencing.
of course,sometimes the charging documents will not give us the answer to the question.but often they will.if,for example,the charging document accuses smith of breaking and entering into a house and does not mention any other structure,then the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a house,if house is an element,and the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a house,if house is the only means charged.otherwise the jury would not have unanimously found that he broke into an occupied structure,which is an element of the statutory crime.
suppose,for example,that breaking into a building is an element of iowa burglary crime and suppose the state charges that smith broke into a building located in des moines and presents evidence at trial concerning only a des moines offense,but the jury returns its verdict on a form showing that six jurors voted for guilt on the theory that he broke into a building located in detroit not des moines.the conviction would fail at least in iowa,would it not see,state bratthauer,iowa if substantial evidence is presented to support each alternative method of committing a single crime,and the alternatives are not repugnant to each other,then unanimity of the jury as to the mode of commission of the crime is not required.at the root of this standard is the principle that the unanimity rule requires jurors to be in substantial agreement as to just what a defendant did as a step preliminary to determining whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged emphasis added citation,brackets,and internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,we would know that if the charging documents claim only that the defendant broke into a house,and the government presented proof only of that kind of burglary the jury had to find unanimously that he broke into a house,not a boat.and that is so whether state law considers the statutory word house to be an element or a means.i have not found any nonfanciful example to the contrary.
consider the federal statute before us the statute that contains the word burglary from a more general sentencing perspective.by way of background,it is important to understand that,as a general matter,any sentencing system must embody a host of compromises between theory and practicality.from the point of view of pure theory,there is much to be said for real offense sentencing.such a system would require a commission or a sentencing judge to determine in some detail the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged,what the defendant really did now and in the past.united states sentencing commission ussc,guidelines manual ch,pt.a.such a system would produce greater certainty that two offenders who engaged in and had previously engaged in the same real conduct would be punished similarly.see ibid.
pure real offense sentencing,however,is too complex to work.it requires a sentencing judge or a sentencing commission to know all kinds of facts that are difficult to discover as to present conduct and which a present sentencing judge could not possibly know when he or she seeks to determine what conduct underlies a prior conviction.because of these practical difficulties,the ussc created guidelines that in part reflect a charge offense system,a system based upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted.ibid.
a pure charge offense system,however,also has serious problems.it can place great authority to determine a sentence in the hands of the prosecutor,not the judge,creating the very nonuniformity that a commission would hope to minimize.hence,the actual federal sentencing system retains a significant number of real offense elements,allowing adjustments based upon the facts of a defendant case,at.and the commission is currently looking for new ways to create a better compromise.see,ussc,amendments to the sentencing guidelines,at effective,creating a model for determining whether prior convictions count for purposes in the context of certain immigration crimes.
with this background in mind,turn to the federal statute before us.the statute,reflecting the impossibility of knowing in detail the conduct that underlies a prior conviction,uses in certain cases involving possession of weapons the fact of certain convictions including convictions for burglary as conclusive indications that the present defendant has previously engaged in highly undesirable conduct.and,for the general reasons earlier described,it is practical considerations,not a general theory,that would prevent congress from listing the specific prior conduct that would warrant a higher present sentence.practical considerations,particularly of administration,can explain why congress did not tell the courts precisely how to apply its statutory word burglary.and similar practical considerations can help explain why this court,in taylor and later cases,described a modified categorical approach for separating the sheep from the goats.those cases recognize that sentencing judges have limited time,they have limited information about prior convictions,and within practical constraints they must try to determine whether a prior conviction reflects the kind of behavior that congress intended its proxy,burglary to cover.
the majority approach,i fear,is not practical.perhaps the statutes of a few states say whether words like boat or building stand for an element of a crime or a means to commit a crime.i do not know.i do know,however,that many states have burglary statutes that look very much like the iowa statute before us today.see.stat.code ann,stat.ann.cent.code ann,ohio code ann,lexis.cons.stat.ann,codified laws.stat.ann,see also ali,model penal code,taylor,at burglary in the federal statute should reflect the version of burglary used in the criminal codes of most states i also know that there are very few states where one can find authoritative judicial opinions that decide the question.in fact,the government told us at oral argument that it had found only two states that,in the context of burglary,had answered the question.tr.of oral arg.see,at.
the lack of information is not surprising.after all,a prosecutor often will charge just one,a building of several statutory alternatives.see descamps united states,slip,at.a jury that convicts,then,would normally have to agree unanimously about the existence of that particular fact.see richardson,at our decision whether something is an element or a means will make a difference where the government introduces evidence that the defendant has committed more underlying drug crimes than legally necessary to make up a series hence,it will not matter for that particular case whether the state,as a general matter,would categorize that fact to which the statute refers as an element or as a means.
so on the majority approach,what is a federal sentencing judge to do when facing a state statute that refers to a building,a boat,a car,the charging documents will not answer the question,for like the documents at issue here they will simply charge entry into,say,a building,without more.but see ante,at suggesting that a defendant charging documents will often answer the question.the parties will have to look to other state cases to decide whether that fact is a means or an element.that research will take time and is likely not to come up with an answer.what was once a simple matter will produce a legal tangle.see,state peterson,there is simply no rule by which the courts can determine whether the legislature intended to provide alternate means of committing a particular crime.instead,each case must be evaluated on its own merits brackets omitted state brown,the alternative means definition is in its application that is why lower court judges have criticized the approach the majority now adopts.see,omargharib holder,niemeyer,concurring because of the analysis and the increasingly blurred articulation of applicable standards,we are being asked to decide,without clear and workable standards,whether disjunctive phrases in a criminal law define alternative elements of a crime or alternative means of committing it.i find it especially difficult to comprehend the distinction emphasis deleted.
the majority bases its conclusion primarily upon precedent.in my view,precedent does not demand the conclusion that the majority reaches.i agree with the majority that our cases on the subject have all used the word element in contexts similar to the present context.but that fact is hardly surprising,for all the cases in which that word appears involved elements or at least the court assumed that was so.see descamps,at,slip,at.in each of those cases,the court used the word generally,simply to refer to the matter at issue,without stating or suggesting any view about the subject of the present case.see,at slip,at sentencing courts may look only to the statutory definitions,the elements of a defendant prior offenses internal quotation marks omitted shepard,at using the terms statutory definition and statutory elements interchangeably taylor,at a n offense constitutes burglary for purposes of the armed career criminal act if either its statutory definition substantially corresponds to generic burglary,or the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary 
the genius of the common law consists in part in its ability to modify a prior holding in light of new circumstances,particularly where,as justice holmes said,an existing principle runs up against a different principle that requires such modification.see holmes,the path of the law,harv.a fortiori,we should not apply this court use of a word in a prior case a word that was not necessary to the decision of the prior case,and not intended to set forth a generally applicable rule to a new circumstance that differs significantly in respect to both circumstances and the legal question at issue.
does apprendi new jersey,s,require the majority result here there we held that any fact o ther than the fact of a prior conviction that must be proved in order to increase the defendant sentence above what would otherwise be the statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,at.where,as here,the state charges only one kind of occupied structure namely,entry into a garage that criterion is met.the state must prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully entered a garage.and that is so,whether the statute uses the term garage to refer to a fact that is a means or a fact that is an element.if the charging papers simply said occupied structure,leaving the jury free to disagree about whether that structure was a garage or was,instead,a boat,then we lack the necessary assurance about jury unanimity and the sentencing judge consequently can not use that conviction as a basis for an increased federal sentence.and that is true whether the state statute,when using the words garage and boat,intends them to refer to a fact that is a means or a fact that is an element.
what about descamps the statute there at issue made it a crime to ente r certain locations with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.the statute made no distinction between lawful entry,entering a department store before closing time and unlawful entry,breaking into a store after it has closed.see ibid.the difference matters because unlawful entry is a critical constituent of the federal statute version of burglary.if the entry is lawful,the crime does not fall within the scope of that word.
we held that a conviction under this statute did not count as a burglary for federal purposes.we reasoned that the statute required the government only to prove entry,that there was no reason to believe that charging documents would say whether the entry was lawful or unlawful,and that,most important ly,even if they did,the jury did not have to decide that the entry was unlawful in order to convict that is,any description in the charging document that would imply or state that the entry was illegal,say,at in the morning,would be coincidental,at slip,at see,at slip,at.
here,by way of contrast,the charging documents must allege entry into an occupied structure,and that structure can consist of one of several statutory alternatives.iowa code.the present law thus bears little resemblance to the hypothetical statute the majority describes.that hypothetical statute makes it a crime to break into a premises without saying more.ante,at.thus,to apply the federal sentencing statute to such a nonspecific,hypothetical statute would require sentencing judges to imaginatively transfor m every element of the statute so that the crime is seen as containing an infinite number of corresponding to all the possible ways an individual can commit the crime an impossibly difficult task.descamps,at slip,at.
but the iowa statute before us contains explicit not hypothetical statutory alternatives,and therefore it is likely not unlikely that the charging documents will list one or more of these alternatives.indeed,that is the case with each of mathis charging documents.see app.and if the charging documents list only one of these alternatives,say,a building,the jury normally would have to find unanimously that the defendant entered into a building in order to convict.see bratthauer,at.to repeat my central point in my view,it is well within our precedent to count a state burglary conviction as a burglary within the meaning of the federal law where the statute at issue lists the alternative means by which a defendant can commit the crime,burgling a building or a boat and the charging documents make clear that the state alleged and the jury or trial judge necessarily found only an alternative that matches the federal version of the crime.
descamps was not that kind of case.it concerned a statute that did not explicitly list alternative means for commission of the crime.and it concerned a fact extraneous to the crime the fact whether entry into the burgled structure was lawful or unlawful was neither a statutory means nor an element.as the court in that case described it,the fact at issue was,under the state statute,a legally extraneous circumstanc e of the state case,at slip,at.but this case concerns a fact necessary to the crime regardless of whether the iowa supreme court generally considers that fact to be a means or an element.
precedent,by the way,also includes taylor.and,as i have pointed out,taylor says that the modified categorical approach it sets forth may permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.at.taylor is the precedent that i believe governs here.because the majority takes a different view,with respect,i dissent.
