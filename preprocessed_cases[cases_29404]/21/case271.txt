sometimes it better to quit while you ahead.the district judge twice conducted plea colloquies and thrice imposed sentences for carlos sevilla oyola sevilla,each one shorter than the last.still dissatisfied,sevilla asks us for another bite at the sentencing apple before a different district judge.to support his claim before this court,sevilla says the district judge lacked authority for actions taken after entry of the first sentence,and flaws in the initial plea colloquy warrant vacation of the first judgment.alternatively,he says that even if the judge later actions were authorized,they were plagued by additional errors.
we agree that the district judge lacked statutory authority to act after he entered the original sentence and that the initial plea colloquy was flawed.but we can not say that the imperfections sevilla cites justify setting aside the first judgment.nor can we say,based on the arguments sevilla puts forth before us,that the first sentence was unreasonable.accordingly,the first and most severe sentence imposed by the district judge months plus a consecutive term of life imprisonment stands.and sevilla who until today was facing a total sentence of months will likely find himself wishing he had left well enough alone.
background 
on july,sevilla and codefendants were indicted as part of a vast drug ring operating in and around several public housing projects in bayamón,puerto rico.the indictment charged sevilla with conspiring to possess narcotics with intent to distribute,in violation of a,count one,and aiding and abetting his coconspirators in the use and carriage of firearms in relation to a crime,in violation of c a count two.it singled out sevilla as a leader,manager,and enforcer for the organization.
a.the first guilty plea 
on august,sevilla entered into an agreement with the government,pleading guilty to both counts of the indictment.the parties stipulated that sevilla was accountable for conspiring to possess at least but less than kilograms of cocaine.this amount pegged sevilla base offense level at under the sentencing guidelines the guidelines.see.the parties further agreed that sevilla would be subject to a twolevel increase,see id.a a twolevel leadership enhancement,see id.c and a reduction,see id,resulting in a total offense level of.the parties did not come together on sevilla category,but they agreed to forgo seeking further adjustments or departures.
in the agreement,sevilla acknowledged that the district judge retained his sentencing discretion and was not bound by the parties accord.sevilla also waived his right to appeal if the judge accept ed the agreement and sentence d him according to its terms,conditions,and recommendations.
at the hearing that same day,the district judge advised sevilla of the statutory penalties for the charged offenses based on the stipulated drug quantity a mandatory minimum term of five years and a maximum term of eighty years of imprisonment as to count one,see b ii,and a consecutive minimum term of five years of imprisonment as to count two,see c a i 
the judge failed to inform sevilla that count two carried the possibility of a life sentence.see united states ortizgarcia,cir explaining that the maximum penalty for an offense under c a is life imprisonment and is derived from case law however,he did draw sevilla attention to the penalties mentioned in the plea agreement,which correctly stated that the maximum penalty for count two was life imprisonment,and sevilla said he understood.the judge also neglected to tell sevilla that he did not qualify for probation,a suspended sentence,or parole 
pitufo enters the scene 
the probation office filed sevilla investigation report on november.it applied a leadership enhancement,rather than the two levels agreed upon by the parties,bumping sevilla total offense level up to.based on sevilla five prior convictions including two violent felonies it also labeled sevilla a career offender and set his category at vi 
shortly thereafter,sevilla filed objections to the presentence report as well as a memorandum disputing the augmented leadership enhancement and his designation as a career offender.the probation office followed up with an addendum standing by its recommendations.
then,on january,the probation office dropped a bombshell on the proceedings.in a second addendum to the presentence report,the office alleged for the first time that sevilla had murdered josé manuel torres morales,pitufo or,in english,smurf,in front of the federal courthouse in hato rey,puerto rico,on november.pitufo was a fellow member who was then under federal supervision.the brazen murder of a federal supervisee outside the courthouse rocked the puerto rican legal community to its core.
no one has ever been charged with this notorious murder.the probation office learned of sevilla alleged involvement from a cooperating witness,carlos manuel burgos rodriguez burgos,also a fellow member,who claimed that sevilla admitted to killing pitufo after reading the allegations in the second addendum,the district judge ordered the government to produce burgos at sevilla sentencing hearing.sevilla did not object to this order,did not argue the judge could not consider the pitufo information,and did not ask for a continuation of the hearing.
c.the first sentencing hearing 
sevilla first sentencing hearing took place on january.burgos took the stand to testify about sevilla alleged role in the pitufo murder.he was questioned by the government and by defense counsel.notably,defense counsel did not argue that burgos testimony was impermissible and instead objected only on the basis that she needed more time to prepare.the district judge denied the objection because the second addendum to the report,filed twelve days prior,provided sufficient notice,and because counsel had not sought a continuance before the hearing.sevilla subsequently testified on his own behalf,disclaiming any involvement in the pitufo murder and challenging the trustworthiness of burgos testimony.
at the hearing conclusion,the judge made several findings.first,considering sevilla serious criminal past especially his prior violent felony convictions,the judge confirmed sevilla designation as a career offender who belonged in category vi then,considering burgos testimony about sevilla alleged role in the pitufo murder,as well as sevilla testimony denying any involvement,the judge found that the and labels underrated the seriousness of sevilla criminal past accordingly,the judge departed upward to offense level,which is accompanied by a guidelines sentence range of months to life.given the depraved nature and devastating impact of sevilla offenses,the judge determined that the highest available sentence was appropriate.consequently,he sentenced sevilla to life imprisonment.
the following day,the judge issued an order apportioning sevilla sentence into months on count one and life imprisonment on count two,to run consecutively judgment entered against sevilla on january.
subsequent proceedings 
a few days later,on february,sevilla moved to set aside the judgment and to correct,reduce,and reconsider his sentence,citing federal rule of criminal procedure a rule a sevilla said the district judge had erred at the sentencing hearing by considering the pitufo murder where that crime had not been included in the indictment,and according to sevilla,defense counsel had not been given adequate time to prepare to refute the allegations before the hearing.
soon after filing,sevilla lawyer fell ill and had to undergo emergency surgery.as a result,the district judge could not hold a hearing on sevilla motion before rule a strict deadline expired.
however,on february,one day before the buzzer sounded,the district judge sua sponte issued an order purporting to correct sevilla sentence under rule a on different grounds.the order sought to rectify two alleged sentencing mistakes.first,the judge said he had intended to sentence sevilla to months on count one,followed by life imprisonment on count two,but he had erroneously entered only months on count one.second,the judge pointed out that the sentence imposed on count two was defective under federal rule of criminal procedure rule because he had not informed sevilla during the plea colloquy that count two carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.to correct these errors,the judge upped sevilla sentence to months on count one and reduced it to months on count two,to run consecutively for a total of months years.amended judgment entered on february.
in the same order,the judge scheduled a hearing a few days later to consider sevilla unresolved rule a motion from february.that hearing was subsequently postponed to february at defense counsel request.
on february,the day of the hearing,sevilla filed a second motion requesting recusal of the district judge due to bias and personal knowledge a santobello hearing to determine whether the government had breached the plea agreement and vacation of the february judgment because rule errors at the hearing could not be corrected in a rule a order.the motion also highlighted a litany of supposed rule violations in the plea colloquy beyond the judge admitted failure to advise sevilla of count two maximum penalty chief among them was that the judge had neglected to inform sevilla that parole had been abolished from the federal penal system.sevilla maintained that these additional alleged errors could only be corrected by an appeal and remand,or by allowing sevilla to withdraw his plea,and not by the district judge issuing an order under rule a 
at the hearing that day,the district judge considered both sevilla february and february motions afterwards,the judge issued another order under rule a this time purporting to set aside both the original guilty plea and the february amended sentence to remedy his failure at the colloquy to inform sevilla about the maximum penalty on count two and the impossibility of parole the judge noted,however,that the plea agreement still stood,and said he would schedule a new hearing after he issued a separate written ruling denying sevilla recusal and santobello requests.
later that day,sevilla filed a notice of appeal from both the amended judgment of february and the february order intended to set aside that judgment.
on february,while that appeal was pending,the district judge issued the promised written order denying sevilla recusal and santobello requests.the judge then scheduled a supplemental plea colloquy and resentencing hearing for march.he further announced he would not consider the pitufo murder at the resentencing hearing,as sevilla had requested in his february motion.to explain his decision,the judge cited such factors as the timing and seriousness of the accusation,the fact that sevilla had never been charged with that crime,and the judge own concerns for justice,fairness,and due process.
on march,sevilla moved to vacate the judge order scheduling the supplemental plea colloquy and resentencing hearing,arguing that the judge had no authority to conduct the colloquy or to further modify his sentence because rule a was not an appropriate vehicle for correcting rule errors.
thereafter,on march,we issued an order deferring our consideration of sevilla appeal until after the newly scheduled plea and resentencing proceedings,so that any subsequent appeal could be consolidated with the pending appeal.
on march,the district judge denied sevilla motion to vacate his order scheduling the supplemental plea and resentencing hearings then,on march,over sevilla objection that a full colloquy was required,the district judge conducted a truncated supplemental plea colloquy to ensure sevilla understood that the maximum possible penalty for count two,specifically,was life imprisonment,and that he was ineligible for parole,probation,or a suspended sentence.although defense counsel requested an entirely new colloquy,the judge did not conduct one because he thought there was no point in repeating what had already been said.instead,the judge advised sevilla of the information missing from the initial colloquy and asked if sevilla wanted to abide by the plea agreement.sevilla said yes 
four days later,on march,the judge held sevilla resentencing hearing.even without considering the pitufo murder,given sevilla extensive criminal history,the judge again applied the guideline and varied upward.the judge sentenced sevilla to months on count one and months on count two,to run consecutively for a total of months years and months.judgment entered on march.
on march,sevilla filed an amended notice of appeal,challenging all three judgments january,february,and march the february order purporting to vacate the february judgment and the february order denying his recusal and santobello requests.
discussion 
sevilla raises a panoply of issues on appeal.he claims that the district judge lacked authority to issue the february amended judgment,as well as authority to take all subsequent actions both the initial and supplemental plea proceedings were defective the final sentence was unreasonable and the judge erred in rejecting his recusal and santobello requests.the government counters that the appeal waiver in the plea agreement bars this challenge.but we bypass this issue because sevilla claims,if successful,could invalidate both the plea itself and the waiver of his right to appeal and so we forge ahead with the merits of sevilla appeal.
a.the district judge authority 
sevilla first argues that rule a did not empower the district judge to issue the february judgment,which modified the original january judgment by boosting sevilla sentence from months to months on count one and cutting his sentence from life imprisonment to months on count two.consequently,sevilla says,the february judgment and all of the judge subsequent actions was null and void.
on appeal,the government concedes that rule a did not authorize the district judge actions on february.no matter,the government says the judge derived his power to take subsequent action from,a habeas corpus provision but before we tackle the government fallback habeas position,we explain why we agree that rule a did not empower the judge to act on february.
we review issues of law,including the district judge interpretation of a federal rule of criminal procedure,de novo.united states leja,cir citing united states encarnacion,cir.
rule a empowers a district judge to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error within fourteen days after sentencing.a.the function of rule a is narrowly circumscribed it permit s correction of an illegal sentence.hill united states,d.for rule a purposes,a sentence is illegal if t he punishment meted out was in excess of that prescribed by relevant statutes,multiple terms were imposed for the same offense,or the terms of the sentence itself were legally or constitutionally invalid in any respect.id.rule a does not,on the other hand,enable a judge to fix errors committed at trial or during proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence.id.as such,rule a does not provide a means to revisit possible errors in the plea colloquy.see united states vinyard,cir finding rule a was not an appropriate vehicle for addressing possible rule b h violation in plea colloquy.
when vacating the january sentence and imposing an amended sentence on february,the district judge invoked rule a to correct two purported errors the judge selfprofessed mistaken entry of a sentence of months,rather than months,on count one and the judge failure to inform sevilla during the plea colloquy that count two carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.because neither of these alleged infirmities resulted in an illegal sentence,rule a by its terms does not provide a cure for either.
first,the month sentence that the judge says he entered mistakenly on count one was not illegal in the sights of rule a.it was not in excess of statutory limits.see b ii,setting the maximum penalty at eighty years,or months.it did not impose multiple terms for the same offense.see hill,at.and no one has argued it was otherwise legally or constitutionally invalid.see id.
second,the rule defect diagnosed by the judge in the plea colloquy namely,the judge failure to tell sevilla that count two was punishable by life imprisonment occurred before sentencing and,thus,is not a sentencing error.it is therefore decidedly outside the bounds of the type of glitch that rule a is designed to mend.see vinyard,at.
accordingly,like the parties,we conclude that the district judge could not rely on rule a for authority to issue the february judgment aiming to remedy mistakes he spotted in the january judgment.
the question,then,is whether gave the judge power to act on or after february 
before us,the government argues for the first time that sevilla february motion requesting recusal,a santobello hearing,and vacation of the february judgment for lack of authority,as well as alleging a string of rule errors in the plea colloquy authorized the judge actions on or after february because the motion functioned as a collateral attack on sevilla conviction and sentence under.sevilla did not caption the motion under any particular rule or statute,but simply dubbed it an omnibus motion regarding sentencing.and the district judge clearly viewed it as another rule a motion nonetheless,because a motion character depends upon its substance,not its appellation,united states ortiz,cir,the government says we can and should treat the february motion as a challenge based on its content,even though it does not wear a label.
we begin with a brief primer.section appears in the chapter devoted to habeas corpus and gives a federal prisoner a means to collaterally attack his sentence.a.specifically,it permits a prisoner to move the court that imposed his sentence to vacate,set aside,or correct the sentence because the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states,the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence,the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,or the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack.id.
notwithstanding this broad language,a motion alleging a violation of federal law is generally cognizable only if it involves a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.hill,at see also united states vonn,d quoting united states timmreck,d.by this standard,relief is not available to remedy a failure to comply with the formal requirements of a rule of criminal procedure,absent any evidence of prejudice or other injury to the defendant.see davis united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in particular,a defendant will rarely,if ever,be able to obtain relief for rule violations under,united states borrero acevedo,cir quoting united states dominguez benitez,d,because such errors seldom result in the type of complete miscarriage of justice or proceeding inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure that deserves redress under the statute,see timmreck,at finding the court failure to inform defendant of special parole term,in violation of rule,was not a fundamental defect.
moreover,a defendant usually gets only one complete round of collateral review under.melton united states,cir see munoz united states,cir per curiam.second or successive motions are severely limited and require certification by the appropriate court of appeals.h see castro united states,d munoz,at.accordingly,though we may choose to recharacterize a motion styled otherwise as falling under based on its content,trenkler united states,cir compiling cases,we must be mindful that doing so may deprive a defendant of his chance to bring a second,possibly stronger claim under that statute,see castro,at,id.at scalia,concurring 
against this backdrop,we choose not to recast sevilla february motion in a mold.no one below not sevilla,not the government,and certainly not the district judge considered the motion under.before us,only the government says we should view the motion under.this was sevilla motion,not the government,and the important concerns outlined above counsel against our recharacterizing the motion under that statute.
accordingly,we find that the february motion which we view as decided only pursuant to rule a did not provide the judge with authority for his post february actions by way of,and the january order remained the final order of the court we therefore need not reach sevilla arguments that the supplemental plea colloquy was defective the final sentence imposed was unreasonable and the district court erred in not granting sevilla february recusal and santobello requests.rather,we now turn to sevilla direct appeal of the january judgment.
b.the initial guilty plea 
most curiously,before us,sevilla seems to have forgotten what brought him here in the first place.at the february hearing,when the district judge asked sevilla what he wanted to do about alleged rule defects in the initial plea colloquy,sevilla insisted he wanted to address those defects on appeal rather than reopen the plea proceedings.however,he says little in his brief about the impact of rule errors in the initial colloquy on the first judgment,and instead focuses his attacks on purported errors at the supplemental plea level.
arguments raised in only a perfunctory and undeveloped manner are deemed waived on appeal.rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir united states zannino,cir.sevilla entire argument about the effect of rule errors in the first colloquy on the first judgment is as follows 
pursuant to this court opinion in united states ortiz garcia,cir,the district court failure to inform sevilla at the change of plea hearing that the maximum sentence for count two was life imprisonment instead of the years mentioned mandates setting aside the final judgment entered on january,where a life sentence was imposed on count two the change of plea transcript does not inform him of a maximum time of life imprisonment and it is by no means clear he would have pleaded guilty under those circumstances.the case should be remanded for resentencing before a different district court judge.emphasis added.
though sevilla has identified an error and a possible argument that he might not have pleaded guilty but for the error he has done so only in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.zannino,at.this we will not do.id.
as a result,sevilla rule claims are not merely forfeited and subject to plain error review as they would be because sevilla did not object on rule grounds during the initial colloquy or move to withdraw his plea in the district court see united states anderson,cir united states ortiz garcia,cir reviewing underlying rule claim for plain error because defendant failed to object to the error or move to withdraw his plea in the district court igartúa united states,cir a rguments that are not raised in a timely manner are forfeited,and p lain error review may be available for forfeited arguments.rather,because sevilla did not adequately challenge these errors on appeal,his rule claims are waived entirely.see anderson,at igartúa,at explaining that plain error review is seldom available for claims neither raised below nor on appeal.
though we may,on rare occasion,exercise our discretion to address waived arguments for instance,when they become available only as a result of intervening changes in law we see no reason to do so here.see anderson,at igartúa,at review is unavailable for waived arguments unless the court engages in the rare exercise of its power to excuse waiver.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,even if we did exercise our discretion to hear sevilla rule claims,they would not survive the high hurdle of plain error review.see anderson,at citing united states padilla,cir en banc thus,we turn to sevilla first sentence.
first sentence 
it also appears to have slipped sevilla mind to challenge his first sentence months on count one,followed by a consecutive term of life imprisonment on count two on appeal.in his brief,he mainly focuses on the alleged unreasonableness of the third sentence he received months on count one and months on count two,to run consecutively for a total of months years and months.but because sevilla does make some argument regarding one aspect of the first sentence namely,the district judge consideration of the pitufo murder at the first sentencing hearing we will not deem this particular argument waived anderson,at.
we review for abuse of discretion a district judge decision to consider particular information at sentencing.united states greig,cir.by statute,n o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a person which a judge may receive for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.moreover,a sentencing judge is affirmatively required to consider the history and characteristics of the defendant.a.and the sentencing judge has discretion to judicially find facts informing the sentence based upon a preponderance of the evidence,provided that any such fact does not trigger a mandatory minimum punishment or alter a statutory maximum,and that the ultimate sentence remains within the range of penalties set forth in the statute of conviction.united states doe,cir.
information about the pitufo murder as it was relevant to sevilla background,character,conduct,history,and characteristics is precisely the type of evidence that the sentencing judge is authorized by statute to consider.see u.a.furthermore,it was within the judge discretion to find facts about the pitufo murder by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing,as the judge consideration of that murder did not modify the mandatory minimums or statutory maximums applicable to sevilla,or result in a sentence beyond the range of penalties specified in the statutes of conviction.sevilla does not argue otherwise before us now.
accordingly,the judge did not abuse his discretion by considering the pitufo murder information at sevilla first sentencing hearing as a result,sevilla first sentence months on count one plus a consecutive term of life imprisonment on count two stands.
parting words 
we acknowledge that our result may seem harsh.where sevilla once faced months imprisonment,now he must grapple with a life sentence.but sevilla chose to proceed with this appeal knowing he risked a higher sentence.
at oral argument,we explicitly asked sevilla counsel if sevilla understood that this appeal could subject him to a sentence based on consideration of his alleged involvement in the pitufo murder and longer than the month term ultimately imposed by the district judge.we sought confirmation that sevilla wished to appeal anyway.on the spot,counsel asserted that sevilla understood these risks,but he agreed to call sevilla to confirm.
a few days later,counsel filed an unresponsive motion that did not address whether sevilla understood the risks he faced by seeking vacation of the third and most favorable month sentence.we then entered a written order again instructing counsel to inquire whether sevilla wished to pursue the appeal even though in this matter presented the risk to sevilla of receiving a sentence greater than his current sentence of months and up to life imprisonment,particularly if the district court were to consider either sevilla alleged involvement in the pitufo murder or calculate a base sentencing level and make appropriate upward departures.emphasis in original.counsel filed a second motion saying he had explained those risks to sevilla and sevilla still wished to proceed.
while our order focused on the risk of a life sentence upon before the district court,the propriety of a life sentence was clearly before us in this appeal.and because we expressly warned sevilla that a life sentence remained on the table,though the outcome we reach is not what sevilla hoped for,at least it should come as no surprise.
conclusion 
with our work finished,we affirm the initial guilty plea and the original january sentence of months on count one and a consecutive term of life imprisonment on count two.we vacate all subsequent judgments and orders of the district court.
carlos sevilla oyola sevilla was sentenced by the district court to months in prison.on appeal,he brings to our court attention numerous errors.the majority,finding several of these claims meritorious,has granted a most unusual form of relief life in prison.from that irrational result,i respectfully dissent.
i.the comedy of sentencing errors 
this tale of judicial woe begins at sevilla plea colloquy,which occurred on august.there,the sentencing judge informed sevilla,correctly,that he faced a statutory maximum of eighty years for count of his indictment,conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to distribute,pursuant to a.the judge,however,failed to inform sevilla of the statutory maximum for count of his indictment.although a conviction for aiding and abetting in the use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime,pursuant to c a,is punishable by a term of life in prison,the judge only informed sevilla that count carried a term of months mandatory.sevilla pleaded guilty to both counts.
sentencing proved a confusing process,replete with mistakes and misstatements on the part of the sentencing judge.it began on january,when the sentencing judge orally pronounced sevilla sentence.as recited,the sentence was as follows life imprisonment,and that will include of course the consecutive sentence that had to be imposed on the firearms,because it would be ridiculous to impose a life term plus five years.that does make any sense.
on january,the sentencing judge set this oral sentence down in writing.in apparent contrast to the prior day pronouncement,the written sentence imposed a term of months on count and life imprisonment on count.the judge explained that his oral pronunciation of the sentence had been a misstatement,requiring correction by way of apportionment 
on february,sevilla filed a motion,seeking a correction,reduction,or modification of his sentence.before that motion was considered,however,the sentencing judge independently undertook to correct additional errors in sevilla sentence.on february,the judge issued a written order.therein,he stated that although he had intended to enter an order apportioning the sentence to years on count months,he had mistakenly entered a sentence of months in the same order,the judge acknowledged that count of the written sentence,subjecting sevilla to life in prison,also suffer ed from a defect when the judge conducted sevilla plea colloquy he failed to mention that this count could carry a maximum term of life in prison.undertaking to correct both of these mistakes,the judge entered a new sentence.this time,sevilla was sentenced to months imprisonment on count and months imprisonment on count.the judge purported to act under federal rule of criminal procedure a.
on february,sevilla filed another motion,specifically noting the defective rule plea colloquy and seeking to withdraw his plea.a hearing on this motion was held the same day.at this hearing,sevilla stated that he could seek to appeal the sentence rather than undergo additional corrections at the level.the sentencing judge admitted that sevilla could utilize appellate review,but attempted to dissuade him from doing so 
counsel h e could proceed to file a notice of appeal today,and that would be his right to proceed.
the court he could,and you are going to get with that where we are now,a remand for a a remand to strike the plea and setting the matter again in the normal course of events.
counsel all right.in light 
the court for new plea negotiations or for whatever,trial,as the case may be.
eventually,the sentencing judge extended sevilla right to appeal by thirty days.sevilla agreed with this course of action,but stated that he intended to file a protective notice of appeal,so as to preserve his claims in case the court of appeals later determined the judge was,indeed,without power to resentence.with both sevilla and the government in agreement that the plea colloquy was defective,the judge then issued an order set ting aside the sentence imposed,as well as the plea colloquy that resulted in the defendant entry of a plea of guilty.
on february,the sentencing judge published an order that,among other things set forth a schedule for a supplemental plea colloquy.sevilla filed another motion,asserting that the sentencing judge had no power to conduct a supplemental plea colloquy or enter additional modifications to his sentence,as federal rule of criminal procedure a was not an appropriate vehicle through which to correct rule errors.
on march,the sentencing judge responded,stating that the opinion and order of february,should have made clear that rule a and rule were not the exclusive reasons for setting aside the sentence,as defendant contends.the judge claimed to have acted,as well,under a grant of authority established in a supreme court case from.see united states benz.
on march,the judge conducted a supplemental plea colloquy.sevilla objected,claiming that the initial deficiencies in his plea could only be corrected by conducting a completely new colloquy,not by simply undertaking to supplement the first.the district court disagreed,finding no point in repeating what had been said seven months before,in august.on march,the judge sentenced sevilla again.this time,he imposed a term of months on count and sixty months on count.sevilla filed another notice of appeal,bringing his claims before our court.
ii.the rule error and its impact 
sorting through this procedural mess,the majority concludes,and i agree,that the court had no power under rule a to impose either the second or the third sentence reasoning that sevilla did not properly challenge the rule plea colloquy error either before the district court or on appeal,however,the majority reinstates sevilla first sentence.in so doing,it strikes down a prison term of slightly under years and puts,in its place,a term of life plus months.i find that decision to be neither required by law nor supported by reason.
appellate waiver 
the majority states that sevilla says little in his brief about the impact of rule errors in the initial colloquy.i disagree.sevilla brief quite plainly makes this argument 
pursuant to this court opinion in united states ortiz garcía,cir,the district court failure to inform sevilla oyola at the change of plea hearing that the maximum sentence for count two was life imprisonment instead of the years mentioned mandates setting aside the final judgment entered on,where a life sentence was imposed in count two the change of plea transcript does not inform him of a maximum time of life imprisonment and it is by no means clear he would have plead ed guilty under those circumstances.the case should be remanded for resentencing.emphasis added 
this passage appearing in the argument section of sevilla brief is also foreshadowed in his presentation of the facts.therein,sevilla states that the sentencing judge failed to advise sevilla that he faced a potential life sentence as to count two,informing him only that you have a consecutive term of imprisonment of i think it five years on account of firearms.
it is true,of course,that arguments raised only in a perfunctory and undeveloped manner are deemed waived on appeal.united states zannino,cir.sevilla argument,however clearly falls outside the scope of our waiver doctrine.compare united states salimonu,cir deeming waived a claim made without argument or citation to case law,with united states dunbar,cir finding that,even where a claim was not stated artfully it was not waived where the appellate brief identified relevant facts and cited relevant case law,and holmes spencer,cir holding waiver inappropriate where an appellant brief reveals enough of the raw materials underlying a claim so as to allow the court to have no trouble reading his argument.
sevilla has identified a specific error.see.b t he court must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands any maximum possible penalty,including imprisonment,fine,and term of supervised release.he has provided case law.see ortizgarcía,at.he has assessed the identified error under the appropriate doctrinal test.see united states raineri,cir considering whether rule error influenced the defendant decision to plead guilty.in sum,his presentation succinct though it may be is in no way grounds for waiver.united states sepúlveda contreras,cir this is not a situation where we are forced to piece together the defendant argument for him,and we therefore find no waiver.internal citation omitted.
in fact,the majority admits that sevilla identified an error and a possible argument.nonetheless,omitting mention of the fact that this argument was also undergirded by specific reference to case law,it goes on to baldly assert that sevilla claim was pleaded in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work.see zannino,at.given that sevilla has identified a factual error,highlighted governing precedent,and applied that law to the facts at hand,however,i fail to see what work counsel has left undone.in light of the content of sevilla brief,the assertion that his claim has been waived is simply unsupported.united states watson,cir waiving an argument presented only as an oblique suggestion,absent any reference to applicable case law or a governing standard dimarco zappa cabanillas,cir simply noting an argument in passing without explanation is insufficient to avoid waiver.
if our standard for escaping waiver required that arguments be pled to the highest degree of artfulness,or that they be situated in the most persuasive and logical place within an appellant brief,i might well find myself in agreement with the majority.for good reason,however,that is not our rule.as it stands,we require only that an argument be raised,and raised squarely.see,sepúlveda contreras,at dunbar,at.this is a requirement that sevilla has more than met.
the illogical nature of the majority holding is made even more apparent when considered in context.after all,what reasonable defendant would expend any more than a succinct portion of his or her brief arguing against a sentence which had already been vacated by the sentencing judge,and for which the government was not advocating see united states ayala vázquez,wl,at cir.may,holding that a perfunctory statement was sufficient to avoid waiver where it served to put the court on notice of a clearly applicable argument.that sevilla had the foresight even to include this argument in his brief,perhaps to ward off just such an overly formalistic and strained reading as the majority now adopts,is in itself impressive.still,the majority now demands that he should have expended more of his appellate efforts tilting at windmills.i can not agree that this claim was waived on appeal.
plain error review 
the majority continues on to say that,even if sevilla rule claim were not waived,it would still fall under plainerror review,because sevilla did not object on rule grounds during the initial colloquy or move to withdraw his plea in the district court.
it is true that sevilla did not object at his plea colloquy however,sevilla february,motion explicitly put forth this error as grounds for withdrawing his plea.in fact,elsewhere in its opinion,when discussing sevilla motion,the majority acknowledges that fact.recognizing that a motion to withdraw was filed,the majority instead rests its forfeiture finding on the subsequent motion hearing,in which sevilla stated that he did not want to reopen the hearing.a thorough review of that hearing transcript,however,shows that sevilla preferred course was significantly less clear than the majority purports 
counsel he does not want to reopen the hearing and stands by all his arguments in the pleading filed today.
the court he does want to reopen the hearing 
counsel only because of all the arguments we presented,that we understand that the 
rule can not be cured by your honor rule a motion.
the court a rule 
counsel that would be a forfeiture 
read in context,sevilla statement was intended specifically to preserve on appeal the complaint that the sentencing judge was acting beyond his power a claim the majority has since deemed meritorious.at the same time,however,sevilla purported to stand by all of his arguments,including the request to withdraw his plea.
certainly,this portion of the record invites confusion.its apparently contradictory statements,however,do not requ
