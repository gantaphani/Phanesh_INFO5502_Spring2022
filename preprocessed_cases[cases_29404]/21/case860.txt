on august,rafael morales or defendant was charged in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico in a indictment.he was accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,in violation of count one mail fraud,in violation of counts two through ten embezzlement of labor union funds,in violation of c counts eleven and twelve structuring money transactions,in violation of b and and count thirteen and conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of h count fourteen.
on may,after a jury trial,morales was found guilty of all charges except for count two.on september,he filed a motion requesting a new trial,but this was denied.he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of months as to counts three through ten,and counts thirteen and fourteen.he was sentenced to a term of five years as to counts one,eleven,and twelve.all sentences were to be served concurrently.additionally,the district court imposed a supervised release condition requiring morales to submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release and thereafter to random drug testing not to exceed samples per year.on october,morales filed this appeal,challenging both his convictions and his sentence.after careful consideration,we affirm.
from to,morales was of frente unido de policías organizados fupo,and josé de de jesús was fupo president.fupo was a organization open to police officers and security guards,whose goal was to offer better working conditions and salaries for its members,as well as to provide legal representation in civil and criminal cases against its members.
through various outreach efforts including promotional materials sent by mail,fupo made constant efforts to recruit new members.new members filled out forms to authorize the payment of fupo membership fees through automatic deductions from their salaries.members either personally delivered these forms to fupo offices or sent them by mail.once fupo was in possession of a new member form,a letter signed by either morales or de jesús would be sent by mail to the relevant agencies and municipalities,authorizing the deduction of fupo membership fees from the new member salary.once deducted,membership fees were sent to fupo by mail.fupo received some fifty checks for membership fees each month by mail,and all checks were handled personally by morales or de jesús.membership cards that were not picked up at fupo offices were sent by mail.in the years and,fupo membership reached approximately.
around the year,members began to complain that promised services and benefits were not being delivered.one of the ostensible benefits of fupo membership was that the organization assumed responsibility for members attorneys fees.it seems that when members availed themselves of attorney services,it was customary for the attorneys to send the invoices directly to fupo.the checks were then prepared by madeline cabrera cabrera but were not actually sent until so authorized by morales or de jesús.typically,fupo prepared checks for attorneys fees totaling to per month.around the year,payments made for attorneys fees declined,even though the invoice amounts actually increased.although it appears that the checks were being prepared,they were not always sent.many members complained.
also in the year,members began to complain about fupo failure to provide other promised services.some members who were suspended from work complained that they were not being paid the money fupo had promised in the event of suspension.widows complained that they were not receiving the promised death benefit.payments of disability benefits were delayed.at least one fupo area director informed de jesús and morales about these problems,but the problems persisted.when cabrera became fupo executive secretary in,she discovered that,while de jesús was president and morales,fupo had fallen several years behind in its payments of disability benefits and in its payments to the irs,hacienda treasury of puerto rico,and bank credit lines.
fupo had a bank account at first bank in puerto rico.morales visited the bank each week.there,he deposited checks made out to fupo,and because they were issued by various government agencies police force,fire department,they cleared immediately.copies of checks and transaction records introduced at trial indicate that after depositing the checks,morales then would purchase a manager check,made out to fupo,for part of the deposit amount.as for the remainder,he would ask the bank to issue a check against fupo account,made out to cash for a specified amount never exceeding.after the bank prepared the check,morales would cash it and take the cash with him.
fupo also had a bank account at banco popular de puerto rico bppr,opened by morales and de jesús.morales went to bppr approximately once a month to deposit the first bank manager checks that were made out to fupo.then,morales would issue checks from fupo bppr bank account to himself,to his company bodyguard,and to de jesús.no single check was ever issued in an amount exceeding,despite the fact that morales often issued several checks to himself in the same day whose total amount exceeded.
typically,the total value of all checks issued to morales was between and per month totaling more than one million dollars during the course of three years while those issued to de jesús ranged from to per month totaling more than million during the same period morales and de jesús used these funds for personal expenses,including payment of personal credit card bills.
morales and de jesús concealed the scheme,which was repeated each month from january to december,from other fupo employees including administrative secretary joanna lind lind,who was in charge of fupo monthly expenses,and héctor navarro,who was responsible for filing various fupo financial reports with the departments of state and labor.also unaware of the fraud was angel troche troche,one of the founders and leaders of fupo.troche did not know fupo was issuing checks to cash.in fact,neither he nor any of the other directors ever gained access to fupo account books.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
morales challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for mail fraud,conspiracy to commit mail fraud,embezzlement,structuring monetary transactions,and conspiracy to commit money laundering.we consider them seriatim.to assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom,taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution,would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.united states sullivan,cir quoting united states,cir.
counts one and three through ten mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud 
morales claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.the mail fraud convictions counts three through ten were based on eight separate membership dues checks,mailed between and,the period during which morales regularly transferred funds from fupo first bank account to fupo bppr account and then issued checks from fupo bppr account to himself,de jesús,or one of their personal interests.
to demonstrate a violation of the mail fraud statute,the prosecution must prove the devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud the knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud and the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.united states mccann,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted,vacated on other grounds,mccann united states,d.the government must also show,in order to prove causation,that the defendant knew,or could have reasonably foreseen,that the use of the mails would follow in the ordinary course of business.united states pimental,cir quoting pereira united states.finally,i t is not necessary to prove that the defendant personally executed the mailings,but merely that the defendant caused the mailing by doing some act from which it is reasonably foreseeable that the mails will be used.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the first requirement,we have held that i n order to find a scheme to defraud,the jury simply had to determine that morales was attempting to wrong one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes.id.at quoting mcnally united states,d.the facts of this case indicate that fupo membership dues were misappropriated for the personal gain of morales and de jesús,rather than put to use for the intended purpose of improving the working conditions,professional growth,and legal resources of fupo members.there is little doubt that a rational jury could find that morales devised a scheme to defraud within the meaning of the statute.
as to the second requirement of,morales does not the record does not his participation was in any way unwilling or unknowing.under the third requirement,a conviction for mail fraud must be supported by evidence that the mail was used in furtherance of the scheme.we have held that t he mailing need not be an essential element of the scheme it can be merely incident to an essential part of the scheme.id.at quoting schmuck united states,d.here,promotional materials sent by mail were used to recruit new members,whose sent by misappropriated.new members authorized the deduction of fupo fees from their salaries via forms sent by mail,and morales and de jesús in turn sent letters to the relevant agencies,instructing that members fees be deducted from their salaries,as authorized.it seems quite clear that a rational jury could deduce from these facts that mailing was at least incident to an essential part of the fraudulent scheme.
finally,it is patently clear that a reasonable jury could have found that the use of the mail was foreseeable.in this circuit,it is simply the use of the mails in the course of the scheme rather than the particular mailing at issue that must be reasonably foreseeable for the causation element of a mail fraud offense to be satisfied.pimental,at.once new members had authorized automatic deductions of their fupo membership dues from their paychecks,fupo would send a by morales or de the relevant agencies and municipalities.fupo received some fifty checks per month in membership dues through the mail.morales and de jesús personally sorted through the mail received at fupo,kept the checks,and handed over the remainder of the mail to cabrera.we have no trouble concluding that a jury could have found the use of the mails to be reasonably foreseeable in the course of this scheme.
morales raises two arguments in support of his contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his mail fraud conviction.first,he claims that because fupo is a charitable organization engaged in a lawful enterprise,the mail fraud statute is inapplicable.second,he argues that because no witness testified at trial that he used the mail to defraud fupo,no rational jury could have convicted him of mail fraud.
in support of his contention that the mail fraud statute does not apply where funds were received through the mail by a legitimate organization and then misapplied by its officers,morales cites only one case from the northern district of california.united states beall.this is not the law of our circuit,and morales does not persuade us that it should be otherwise.
morales next contends that because no witness testified at trial as to his use of the mail to further his fraudulent scheme,there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction as to the mail fraud charges.however,direct evidence is not necessary to prove mail fraud.see pimental,at.we find that the evidence was sufficient to support morales mail fraud conviction as to counts three through ten.
to support a guilty verdict as to the conspiracy count under,the evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a conspiracy,the defendant knowledge of it,and his voluntary participation in it.united states yefsky,cir.to prove voluntary participation,the government must prove that the defendant had an intent to agree and an intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.united states royal,cir.further,when the commission of mail fraud is a goal of the conspiracy,the government must show either an intent to use the mails or the reasonable foreseeability of such use.yefsky,at emphasis added.
evidence introduced at trial revealed that morales and de jesús worked together to execute the fraud and that they kept it hidden from all other fupo members and employees.morales personally deposited membership checks in fupo first bank account each week and issued checks to himself and de jesús from fupo bppr account every month.a reasonable jury could have found that there was a conspiracy,of which morales was aware,and in which morales participated.
morales claims that a conviction for conspiracy to commit mail fraud must be supported by a showing of an intent to use the mail to effect the scheme.this position is simply incorrect,as it directly contravenes the law of this circuit.the government need only show the reasonable foreseeability of the use of the mail in the execution of the conspiracy.see also united states dray,cir united states delgado figueroa,cir.
counts eleven and twelve embezzlement of labor union funds 
morales claims there was no federal jurisdiction as to counts eleven and twelve because they were based on the premise that fupo is a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting interstate commerce,as defined by j of the labor management reporting and disclosure act lmrda.section c of the lmrda is violated by a ny person who embezzles,steals,or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use,or the use of another,any of the moneys,funds,securities,property,or other assets of a labor organization of which he is an officer,or by which he is employed,directly or indirectly.c emphasis added.the term labor organization is defined by the lmrda as an organization engaged in an industry affecting commerce and includes any organization in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose,in whole or part,of dealing with employers i emphasis added.
morales appeals his conviction as to counts eleven and twelve on the ground that fupo is not a labor organization under the lmrda because it is not engaged in an industry affecting commerce.for its part,the government does not respond to this argument at all 
the lmrda deems a labor organization to be engaged in an industry affecting commerce if it 
is the certified representative of employees under the provisions of the national labor relations act,as amended et,or the railway labor act,as amended et or 
although not certified,is a national or international labor organization or a local labor organization recognized or acting as the representative of employees of an employer or employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce or 
has chartered a local labor organization or subsidiary body which is representing or actively seeking to represent employees of employers within the meaning of paragraph or or 
has been chartered by a labor organization representing or actively seeking to represent employees within the meaning of paragraph or as the local or subordinate body through which such employees may enjoy membership or become affiliated with such labor organization or 
is a conference,general committee,joint or system board,or joint council,subordinate to a national or international labor organization,which includes a labor organization engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of any of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection,other than a state or local central body.
j.morales argues that fupo does not meet any of the above requirements because the vast majority of fupo members are police officers employed by the commonwealth of puerto rico and thus fupo is not the representative of employees of an employer or employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce.the lmrda defines the phrase industry affecting commerce as 
any activity,business,or industry in commerce or in which a labor dispute would hinder or obstruct commerce or the free flow of commerce and includes any activity or industry affecting commerce within the meaning of the labor management relations act,as amended et,or the railway labor act,as amended et.
c.at trial,the government presented evidence to the jury of fupo activities affecting commerce,consisting of the following the majority of fupo members are members of the police force in puerto rico,which uses smith and wesson firearms,crown victoria cars,and helicopters,none of which are manufactured in puerto rico and fupo has six or seven members who work for bodyguard,a private security company that uses armored trucks purchased in canada,cars manufactured by suzuki,arms manufactured by smith and wesson,and which services national companies like sam club and office max.morales cites nary a case to support his contention that these activities do not constitute engagement in an industry affecting commerce and are thus not sufficient to qualify fupo as a labor organization under the statute.our standard of review constrains us to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.a reasonable jury could conclude that fupo was sufficiently engaged in commerce to satisfy the statute,and we affirm morales conviction as to counts eleven and twelve.
count thirteen structuring monetary transactions 
morales argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for structuring monetary transactions.the bank secrecy act requires domestic banks to report any transactions involving more than in cash such reports are known as cash transaction reports,or ctr.see.further,n o person shall,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section a structure or assist in structuring,or attempt to structure or assist in structuring,any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.id.a.the supreme court has defined structuring as to break up a single transaction above the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions for the purpose of evading a financial institution reporting requirement.ratzlaf united states,d.
morales contends that the evidence was insufficient because none of the government witnesses testified as to any willful violation of the structuring statute,and that because the transactions in question involved checks,not cash,they do not fall within the ambit of.
evidence introduced at trial reveals that bppr never filed a ctr for any of morales transactions because he never issued a check in excess of,despite the fact that he often issued several checks to himself on the same day,whose total value exceeded that amount.similarly,of the numerous handwritten checks made out to cash signed by morales and drawn upon fupo first bank account,none exceeded,even when the total value of checks cashed in a single day exceeded.additionally,the checks that morales brothers cashed from fupo first bank account never exceeded.
morales maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because none of the government witnesses testified that morales ever willfully caused a financial institution to fail to file a ctr.although this argument is quite poorly developed,we assume that its intention is to suggest that his violation of was not willful.in ratzlaf,the supreme court held that a structuring conviction requires a showing that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.at.however,congress later amended the statute so that willfulness is no longer required for a violation of.see aversa united states,cir.
drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict,we have no doubt that the evidence presented in this case would permit a rational jury to find that morales violated the statute.during the period between january and december,morales prepared dozens of bppr checks,drawn against fupo account and made out to cash,for a total value of well over.not a single check exceeded in value.the consistent avoidance of the threshold over a period of almost three years would,in our view,permit a jury to conclude that morales divided all transactions above the reporting threshold for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements,in violation of.
morales next argues that the transactions that served as the basis for his conviction do not come within the ambit of sections and of title because they involved checks and not cash.this argument fails because many of the transactions in question involved cashing checks,such that someone sent on his routinely exit the bank with thousands of dollars in cash.we have observed that t he most common method of structuring is to divide sums of cash into amounts that are either under the reporting threshold or into amounts that are larger but still less likely to attract attention.united states hurley,cir.the evidence in this case suggests that morales acted exactly as hurley describes.morales develops no argument as to why this activity does not fall within the purview of the bank secrecy act,which requires domestic banks to report any transactions involving more than in cash.id.emphasis added.we find that his activity was exactly the sort that a proscribes.
count fourteen conspiracy to commit money laundering 
morales was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering under h.to find morales guilty,the jury had to find that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that morales conspired with de jesús to commit the offense of money laundering,which is comprised of four elements 
that morales knowingly conducted a financial transaction,that he knew the transaction involved funds that were the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,that the funds involved were in fact the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity,and that morales engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity.
united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
morales claims that no rational jury could have convicted him of money laundering because he did not conduct any financial transactions that affected interstate commerce he did not engage in any transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity and the government did not present any direct evidence to establish that he conducted financial transactions to conceal the nature of his mail fraud activities.
morales first maintains that he was not properly convicted under the money laundering statute because he did not conduct a financial transaction within the meaning of c.that section defines a financial transaction as 
a a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce i involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or ii involving one or more monetary instruments,or iii involving the transfer of title to any real property,vehicle,vessel,or aircraft,or b a transaction involving the use of a financial institution which is engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce in any way or degree 
c emphases added.morales only addresses part a,claiming that he was involved in no transaction that affected interstate or foreign commerce.he entirely ignores the remainder of this subsection.
even if we accept,arguendo,morales contention that he was involved in no financial transaction affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of subsection a,we find that a jury could have determined that he was involved in financial transactions as defined in subsection b.the government case included evidence that morales and de jesús retained exclusive control of the membership dues checks received by mail,that they deposited the majority of the checks so received in fupo first bank account each month,that they then transferred manager fupo first bank account to its bppr account,and that morales and de jesús regularly issued checks to themselves from the bppr account.each of these checks at a bank,transferring funds from one bank to another,and issuing one or more financial institutions engaged in interstate commerce.given these facts,we think a rational jury could easily have found that morales conducted a financial transaction within the plain meaning of c b.
morales next challenges the sufficiency of the government evidence as to the fourth element of the test,claiming that absolutely no evidence either direct or presented at trial to establish that he engaged in any financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity.morales points to united states dimeck,cir,to support his argument that,even if the checks that he issued to himself and de jesús were the proceeds of illegal activity,his activities did not constitute money laundering.in dimeck,the court found that the mere transportation of concealed drug money did not constitute money laundering because the money laundering statute was designed to punish those who thereafter take the additional step of attempting to legitimize their proceeds so that observers think their money is derived from legal enterprises.id.at.we find the facts of dimeck to be easily distinguishable from the present case.the facts,when considered in a light most favorable to the verdict,suggest that morales did far more than simply transport wealth.a rational jury could have found the evidence sufficient to indicate that morales monthly secretive transfer of fupo membership funds between three separate bank first bank account,fupo bppr account,and morales personal bppr an attempt to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,and control of proceeds.further,a jury could have found that morales practice of limiting the value of each check issued to himself or de jesús to so as to avoid bank reporting,indicates an effort to conceal the true nature,source,and ownership of the proceeds.specifically,we think it quite clear that a jury could have found that these complicated machinations were intended to create the appearance of legitimate income.
finally,morales suggests that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because no government witness directly testified as to his participation in any money laundering activity.however,we have held that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to support a money laundering conviction,at a conviction requires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction,whether from direct evidence,like the defendant own statements,or from circumstantial evidence,like the use of a third party to disguise the true owner,or unusual secrecy.in this instance,the lack of direct evidence is a direct result of the secret conspiracy between morales and de jesús.the fact that only morales and de jesús knew of the scheme only emphasizes its secretive nature and the deceit involved with its execution.everyone else at officers to administrative kept in the dark.for these reasons,we find that a rational jury could have found the evidence at trial sufficient to convict morales of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
brady violation 
morales argues that the government breached its duty under brady maryland,d,to provide him with exculpatory evidence in its possession.on august,morales filed a motion requesting any exculpatory information from the government,consistent with brady.on august,the district court granted the motion.by letter dated august,the government noted that a s of this date,no exculpatory evidence has been uncovered,but promised to provide any exculpatory evidences which may be uncovered in the future.
morales maintains that,at the time of the prosecution august letter,the government was already in possession of exculpatory evidence that it failed to disclose,in violation of brady.the evidence in question was the contents of two fbi reports detailing interviews with de jesús.in those reports,de jesús other he had won approximately million over the course of three years in a horse race,which had enabled him to regularly loan money to fupo.specifically,he said that during an approximately period,he had lent more than to fupo,and that morales had lent fupo.de jesús explained that the money he and morales took from fupo bank accounts constituted repayment of the loans.as evidence,de jesús presented copies of two cancelled checks,dated and,drawn on his personal account and made out to fupo for and respectively.morales claims that the government never informed him of the contents of these reports or of the two cancelled checks.he argues that this information was material and exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his appropriation of fupo funds.
an alleged brady violation must satisfy three elements the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene,d.we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged brady violations for manifest abuse of discretion.united states hansen,cir.
morales claims that all three prongs are satisfied because the information was exculpatory,the prosecution suppressed it,and there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed to the jury.we consider each element in turn.
morales claims that the evidence was exculpatory because it provided a legitimate explanation for his activities.we disagree.even assuming the credibility of de jesús statements regarding his loan to fupo of and morales loan of,there still remains million of fupo funds unaccounted for.further,the allegedly exculpatory reports include many statements by de jesús,ignored in morales brief,that are actually incriminating to morales.for example,the report reflects that de jesús admits that he kept writing checks to himself and morales after he felt that he had repaid himself for the loans that de jesús and morales continued writing checks to themselves because they started the organization and they looked on it as their own money that they always wrote the checks for or less so that they could avoid notification to hacienda and the federal reporting requirements that de jesús never reported the money he took from fupo to hacienda on his tax returns and does not believe morales did either that de jesús believes that he has taken between million and million from fupo in addition to what he claims to have lent the organization and that de jesús believes morales used the funds to open and support several security businesses.although we are not convinced that this evidence was exculpatory,we proceed to the second prong of brady.
under brady,the government is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence.at.assuming that the evidence in question is exculpatory,we find no brady violation because the government did not suppress it.the government allowed the defense to conduct discovery of all documents in its possession,which included the fbi reports of de jesús statements,which the government requested to be returned only after the defense had an opportunity to read them.at sentencing,the district judge found unpersuasive morales claim that the government requested the return of the documents before the defense had an opportunity to read all of them.we find no abuse of discretion.
finally,a valid brady claim requires a showing that the evidence in question was material.the supreme court has made quite clear that,for brady purposes,t he evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d.we find that the proffered evidence was not material.the evidence against morales was very strong,and de jesús statements contained within the allegedly exculpatory fbi reports only served to corroborate the prosecution theory of the case.further,even if credible,de jesús explanation of the scheme leaves almost million unaccounted for.we find no brady violation.
sentencing guidelines 
morales contends th
