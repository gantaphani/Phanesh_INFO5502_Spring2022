alberto lujan pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute large quantities of marijuana over an period.he now challenges the district court denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss a superseding indictment and to suppress certain evidence,as well as its refusal to depart downward pursuant to and its assessment of a fine.he also challenges his sentence on the ground that the government breached the plea agreement by opposing his request for a downward departure.finding his arguments unavailing,we affirm his conviction,sentence,and fine.
we refer to the facts set forth in the presentence investigation report psr,the plea and sentencing transcripts,and other materials before the district court.united states rizzo,cir.from to,lujan and other engaged in a marijuana distribution operation,which was responsible for distributing marijuana throughout arizona,michigan,new hampshire,and new york.according to the psr,lujan was the organizer of the conspiracy and was responsible for distributing approximately pounds of marijuana.thousand pounds of the pound total alone yielded approximately in revenue.
in,as indictments were handed down,houses searched,and arrested,the conspiracy began to unravel.presumably sensing the conspiracy impending downfall,on september,lujan negotiated an agreement not to prosecute,which included a limited immunity agreement,with the united states attorney for the eastern district of michigan in exchange for his cooperation 
the following month a grand jury in the district of new hampshire returned a indictment,charging lujan with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,in violation of,and conspiracy to distribute marijuana,in violation of a and.the government alleged that law enforcement officials in new hampshire had been investigating the conspiracy and lujan for a considerable time before lujan made his arrangement with the eastern district of michigan and that they were unaware of that deal when the indictment was returned.on august,a superseding indictment was returned,which added an additional count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.despite the success of federal authorities in bringing down his,lujan remained a fugitive until his arrest by the united states marshals service in michigan in june of.
lujan filed a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment,or,alternatively,to suppress any evidence derived from statements that he made to federal authorities in the eastern district of michigan pursuant to the immunity agreement.on february,the district court denied the motion,holding that the government met its heavy burden under kastigar united states,d,of proving that the evidence it would introduce at trial was not derived either directly or indirectly from immunized statements,and,alternatively,that lujan had affirmatively waived any and all kastigar claims by having entered into a written waiver agreement with the district of new hampshire in the summer of 
faced with this adverse ruling,on february,lujan pled guilty to a information,charging him with conspiracy to distribute in excess of kilograms of marijuana,in violation of a and.relevant for our purposes,the agreement contemplated that lujan would seek a downward departure,pursuant to a n extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.for its part,the government agreed not to oppose such a request,so long as lujan provide d the united states with the written opinion of a physician which unequivocally states that lujan medical condition will result in a significant reduction of his life expectancy.lujan reserved no issues for appeal.after the usual.proceedings,the district court accepted lujan plea and set sentencing for may.
at the sentencing hearing,lujan sought a section departure,which,despite the plea agreement,the government opposed.the district court denied the request,reasoning that although it understood its authority to depart,it did not think the facts of this case warranted a departure.in any event,the court accepted the government recommendation to sentence lujan at the low end of the applicable range and sentenced him to months imprisonment with five years supervised release.the court also assessed a fine.
lujan first challenge warrants little discussion.he attacks the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the superseding indictment,or,alternatively,to suppress any evidence derived from his immunized statements made pursuant to the limited immunity agreement.by entering an unconditional guilty plea lujan waived any and all nonjurisdictional challenges to his conviction,including constitutional ones.see tollett henderson,d when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged,he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.united states,cir.lujan certainly does not maintain,nor could he,that his kastigar claim calls into question the jurisdiction of the federal district court.united states,cir rejecting defendant claim that his challenge to a suppression motion was a jurisdictional one.this ends his challenge 
district court refusal to depart downward 
lujan next seeks review of the district court decision not to depart downward pursuant to.that section provides that although the defendant physical condition is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether to depart downward,an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range at sentencing,lujan presented evidence that he had only one remaining kidney as a result of an emergency nephrectomy performed in,suffered from cirrhosis and calcified arteries,and had a demonstrated family history of heart disease.lujan produced medical records and letters from doctors to support his request.notably missing from the record,however,was any evidence suggesting that the bureau of prisons would be unable to provide the appropriate degree of treatment for him or that incarceration itself would aggravate his conditions.see,united states leblanc,cir.in any event,he contends that these conditions,when taken together,constitute an extraordinary physical impairment and that the district court thus should have departed downward.
the government opposed the departure by producing a doctor,who,after reviewing lujan medical records,testified that he found no indication of heart disease and that,even if lujan had cirrhosis,lujan medical records indicated that his liver was well compensated and not compromised in any way.the doctor also testified that although a person can live a normal life on just one kidney,that person must take precautions to avoid damage to the remaining kidney.
our review of a district court refusal to depart downward is extremely limited.under a,an appellate court has jurisdiction to determine,inter alia,whether a sentence was imposed in violation of law or by an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.we have read this section narrowly to mean that an appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart where the district court plainly understood it had the legal authority to do so but found that the circumstances of the case were not sufficiently in the section context,extraordinary to warrant a departure united states saldana,cir leblanc,at.however,appellate jurisdiction will attach where the court refusal was premised on the mistaken belief that it lacked the legal authority to depart under the guidelines.united states ahlers,cir the district court understanding of its legal authority is subject to plenary review id.
lujan argues that the district court imposed the sentence in violation of law because it completely abrogated its responsibility to apply the guideline to his case.to support this claim,he points to the absence of express findings in the record indicating that the district court ma de a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome,or that it compared the facts of this case with other guideline cases.koon united states,d.it is well es
