background 
a.the facts 
the facts are largely undisputed and are summarized as follows 
sri lanka became an independent state in,following the end of british colonial rule.the sinhalese buddhist majority took control,and in the years since the sri lankan government has purportedly engaged in systematic oppression of the tamils,a minority group residing primarily in the north and east parts of the country.
formed in,the ltte is a militant separatist group in northern sri lanka that sought to establish an independent tamil state.it opposed the sri lankan government alleged persecution of the tamils.the ltte engaged in civil war with the sri lankan government,employing a significant military operation,including an army of some soldiers as well as air and naval forces.the ltte perpetrated acts of violence in sri lanka and india,including suicide bombings and assassinations.a military offensive by the sri lankan government in effectively eradicated the ltte presence in sri lanka.
as the district court found,the ltte and the sri lankan government thus were engaged in an ongoing civil war,with apparent serious human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.
in,pursuant to,the state department designated the ltte a foreign terrorist organization,after finding that the ltte was a foreign organization,engaged in terrorist activity,which threatens the security of united states nationals or the national security of the united states.a see also foreign terrorist organizations,dep t of state.htm last visited,listing ltte since.the ltte filed a petition to review this designation.the court of appeals for the circuit denied the petition.see people mojahedin org.of iran dep t of state,
the crimes 
was the principal procurement officer for the ltte from to.at the direction of the ltte leadership,he purchased at least million worth of weapons including guns,rocket launchers,and explosives and materials used to make suicide bombs.weapons with serial numbers matching those in pratheepan purchase orders were discovered among weapon caches confiscated from the ltte by the sri lankan government.
pratheepan also played a role in a scheme to bribe state department officials to remove the ltte from the foreign terrorist organization list.he relayed messages between the ltte leadership and operatives in the united states who were arranging the bribe with undercover government agents.
pratheepan personal history 
pratheepan was born on november,in a tamil neighborhood in sri lanka.he was raised during a time of civil war and was regularly subjected to violence,bombings,and intimidation as a result of the conflict between the sri lankan government and the ltte.he attended high school in his hometown until he was years old,when his school was destroyed.he and his family were frequently forced to flee their homes to refugee camps during military attacks.at one point he returned to his village to find that dozens of people including friends and acquaintances had been killed and that many buildings had been destroyed.
at years old,pratheepan moved to england,where he was granted political refugee status.he attended school and earned a bachelor degree in engineering,a certification in english proficiency,and a teacher certificate.he was employed as a college lecturer in mansfield,england from to.in,after seven years in england as a political refugee,pratheepan returned to his parents home in sri lanka.he was in jakarta,indonesia when he was arrested based on the charges in this case.
while incarcerated at the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn,pratheepan worked in the education department teaching math and other subjects to inmates.in advance of sentencing,inmates who were students of pratheepan wrote to the district court expressing their gratitude for his assistance.
pratheepan has no prior criminal convictions.as a citizen of sri lanka who was extradited to this country,he faces likely deportation upon the completion of his sentence.
proceedings below 
pratheepan was indicted in the eastern district of new york in september and detained by indonesian immigration authorities in jakarta in january.he was extradited to the united states his first time on soil and made his initial appearance in the eastern district of new york on january.he pled guilty to a superseding indictment in june.
pratheepan was sentenced on september.the district court found that the base offense level under the sentencing guidelines was,added points for providing support with intent to commit a violent act,and assessed a point terrorism enhancement.see united states sentencing guidelines manual a.after subtracting points for acceptance of responsibility,the district court found that the total offense level was.the terrorism enhancement automatically placed pratheepan in criminal history category vi,even though he did not have a criminal history.see b.while the guidelines range would have been months to life,the material support count carried a statutory maximum of months,and the statutory maximum sentence for the bribery conspiracy count was months.thus,the maximum sentence for both counts was months 
pratheepan addressed the district court,stating in part as follows 
this has been a long road for me and my family i admired the united states for the fundamental principles freedom,justice,equality,liberty,peace and democracy.i wanted these fundamental rights for my people to live as an equal citizen in our own country in sri lanka 
there is not a single day i have not thought about our people back at home.they are struggling for their freedom and their future.they still do have their freedom.i love my motherland very much.i never felt that i will ever be separated from my motherland the same way i will never be separated from my mother.now,the reality is that i do know i will ever be able to go back to my motherland to feel the freedom or to see my mother,to feel her love for me.this is a permanent punishment for me for the rest of my life at this point.
prior to imposing sentence,the district court noted i will not miss this case because it given me some of the most difficult and,in many ways,loneliest moments of my career trying to figure out a rational,reasonable sentence the district court explained that this was an unusual case because it carries a banner of terrorism and yet involves people who certainly pose no direct threat to the united states.nonetheless,the district court acknowledged,these folks face severe sanctions here in the united states because we do in any way underwrite or care to underwrite terrorist activities anywhere in the world.
the district court observed that pratheepan was motivated not by power or,but by a desire to help the tamil people it beyond me to make sense of the situation in sri lanka the district court noted that pratheepan had already been incarcerated for a lengthy period and separated from his immediate family and girlfriend.it further recognized that pratheepan had been a very model,positive inmate,and that it had received letters from inmates at the mdc thanking him for the help he had given them.finally,the district court noted that pratheepan faced an uncertain future because he was likely to be deported but would face possible retribution if returned to sri lanka.
at the same time,the district court acknowledged that pratheepan function in procuring arms for the ltte was critical and involved procurement of deadly merchandise,almost inevitably used to injure,murder,maim,not only military but civilians.
the district court imposed a term of imprisonment of months for the material support charge and months for the bribery conspiracy,to run concurrently.in its amended judgment filed october,the district court explained the variance 
t he court is called upon to make a difficult judgment in fashioning an appropriate and reasonable sentence.the defendant is a year old,educated tamil who has never been to the united states,but was extradited to this country following his january arrest in indonesia.he has no criminal record and has been in custody ever since.
the defendant admits to serving as a principal procurement officer for the ltte arranging for the purchase of weaponry and technical equipment by and through others,many of whom are codefendants.unlike most he remained in sri lanka where he lived with his parents and sister whom he has not seen since the day of his arrest.
despite his serious criminal conduct,all indications are that this defendant,like most of his,is a person of substance and decency who was motivated solely to assist the tamil minority in sri lanka who were engaged in an ongoing civil war that it now appears involved serious human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.
the defendant has been in custody for almost six years,separated from his family for the entire period.he has voluntarily served as a tutor of other detainees who have written to the court on the defendant behalf expressing their appreciation of his efforts and their thanks for the successes they have realized as a result.in the court view,supported by judges with whom i have consulted,a substantial variance is appropriate and reasonable given the full range of circumstances presented.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
applicable law 
we review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under a deferential standard.gall united states,d see united states broxmeyer,cir our standard is reasonableness,a particularly deferential form of review quoting united states cavera,cir en banc here,the government challenges only the substantive reasonableness of pratheepan sentence,arguing that the more than percent reduction from the applicable guidelines range was substantively unreasonable.
our review for substantive unreasonableness is particularly deferential.broxmeyer,at citing gall,at.the supreme court has made clear that responsibility for sentencing is placed largely in the precincts of the district courts.cavera,at.hence,our role in sentencing appeals is to patrol the boundaries of reasonableness,united states rigas,cir quoting cavera,at,with due respect for the sentencing court very wide latitude to decide the proper degree of punishment for an individual offender and a particular crime,cavera,at.
we will set aside sentences as substantively unreasonable only in exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.at quoting united states rigas,cir.we will identify as substantively unreasonable only those sentences that are so shockingly high,shockingly low,or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law that allowing them to stand would damage the administration of justice.broxmeyer,at quoting rigas,at.
district courts are to use the guidelines as a starting point,and then make an independent sentencing determination,taking into account the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,and all of the statutory factors.a cavera,at.sentencing courts are not to presume that the guidelines range is reasonable,and instead they must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.gall,at.where there is a variance from the guidelines range,on appellate review,we may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the guidelines a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.united states stewart,cir quoting gall,at.
application 
the sentence here of months was neither shockingly low nor unsupportable as a matter of law,nor would the administration of justice be damaged by our allowing the sentence to stand.applying the particularly deferential standard for substantive reasonableness review,we conclude that the district court decision fell within the range of permissible decisions.
as this case well demonstrates,sentencing is one of the most difficult and important responsibilities of a trial judge the experienced and respected district judge here characterized this sentencing as presenting some of the most difficult and,in many ways,loneliest moments of his career.we can understand why,for many competing considerations came into play.
on the one hand,as the government argued and the district court acknowledged,pratheepan crimes were certainly grave for more than six years he provided material support to a terrorist organization by purchasing on its behalf more than million in deadly merchandise used to injure,murder,maim,not only military but civilians.the ltte perpetrated many acts of violence,and the executive branch of our government has declared it a terrorist organization.
on the other hand,many mitigating circumstances were presented.the district court found that pratheepan was motivated not by power or selfaggrandizement,but by a desire to help the tamil people.his actions had to be evaluated in context pratheepan was caught in an ongoing civil war,one with serious human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.as pratheepan explained at his sentencing,there is not a single day i have not thought about our people back at home.they are struggling for their freedom and their future.while these motivations do not justify or excuse acts of terrorism,it was not inappropriate for the district court to take pratheepan motivations into account.in addition,pratheepan did not have a criminal record,and had accepted full responsibility for his crimes.moreover,for the nearly six years that he was incarcerated,pratheepan was a model inmate who earned the gratitude of other prisoners by his efforts to teach them math and other subjects.in the end,the district court determined that,despite the banner of terrorism,this year old,educated tamil was a person of substance and decency.he was not in this country voluntarily,but had been separated from his girlfriend and family after he was arrested in indonesia and extradited here,and he faced an uncertain future because of the likelihood he would be deported after completing his sentence and the fear of reprisal in his home country.there were other considerations as well.
the particular weight to be afforded aggravating and mitigating factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge.broxmeyer,at quoting united states fernandez,cir.in reviewing for substantive reasonableness,we do not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor,but instead we determine whether a factor relied on by a sentencing court can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in the case.cavera,at.it is apparent that the district court gave careful consideration to and struggled with all of the relevant factors.we conclude that it did not afford undue weight to any single factor.
we hold that the sentence of months fell within the range of permissible decisions.the district judge noted that he had consulted with his colleagues other judges and that they supported a substantial variance.pratheepan sentence is also reasonable when compared to sentences imposed upon similarly situated defendants.see,united states stewart,cir affirming sentence of months for former defense attorney convicted of conspiring to defraud united states,providing and concealing material support to a conspiracy to kill and kidnap persons in a foreign country,and making false statements,where guidelines range was months to life and initial sentence of months was vacated as being unreasonably low united states amawi,cir rejecting government appeal of sentences of months,months,and months for three defendants found guilty of conspiracy to kill and maim persons outside united states,conspiracy
