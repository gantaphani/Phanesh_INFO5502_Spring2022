jeremy barnes is here again,this time because the supreme court granted his certiorari petition,vacated our judgment,and remanded his case for reconsideration in light of alleyne united states.see barnes united states.we asked for and received supplemental briefing from the parties regarding alleyne and heard oral argument too.so the matter is teed up for decision.and after summarizing the case background and discussing the parties arguments,we vacate barnes sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
barnes pled guilty under a plea agreement to one count of conspiring to distribute at least kilograms of marijuana,in violation of and a,as well as one count of distributing or aiding and abetting the distribution of marijuana,in violation of a and.sentencing in a case like this largely depends on the amount of drugs involved.see,united states acosta colón,cir.for example,a a violation involving,say,kilograms of marijuana activates no prison sentence but a year maximum and carries a release term of years with a life maximum.see b b and b c see also united states nieves,cir discussing supervised release.but a violation involving kilograms or more of marijuana triggers a mandatory minimum of years in jail and years of supervised release with a mandatory maximum of life for both.see b a.the plea agreement here reserved barnes right to challenge any drug amount over kilograms and the government right to ask for a drug quantity between and kilograms.
with all this in mind,what follows is a explanation of how the judge calculated barnes sentence 
grouping the two counts together for sentencing purposes,see ussg d,the judge found barnes responsible for over kilograms of marijuana a finding made using the standard that triggered the sentence mentioned a second ago years in prison plus years of supervised release.noting that barnes had only copped to at least kilograms of marijuana,defense counsel had basically argued in a prehearing filing that a judge should not get to impose a mandatory minimum that depends on facts neither admitted by the defendant nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt.but the judge rejected that argument at sentencing because law held that a defendant can get a mandatory minimum based on a judicial finding under the preponderance test.see united states goodine,cir.
anyway,this finding helped yield a range of months in prison,the judge explained the other details of that calculation are irrelevant for current purposes.the range,the judge added,is years to life.both sides agreed with the judge take on the ranges.but a probation officer spoke up,saying to the extent the judge found that the drug weight was more than kilograms,the range would be years.okay,the judge said.defense counsel peeped no words of protests.
the prosecutor asked the judge to sentence barnes to months in prison.that would capture the applicable year mandatory minimum,she said.she also recommended that the judge impose a year term of supervised release.but she said that she recognized that a year before being cut off by the judge,who said n ow you recommending years.correct,the prosecutor replied.
when his turn to speak came,barnes counsel again said that judges should not be able to determine drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.the current state of law lets judges do just that,the judge noted.counsel agreed he raised the issue simply to preserve it for possible further review and then talked about barnes troubled history.the judge stopped him and asked if there is a year mandatory minimum based on what i found barnes lawyer answered yes and suggested that a year mandatory minimum prison stint was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing.and counsel quickly added that the judge,pursuant to the minimum mandatory,has to impose at least five years of supervised release.
ultimately,the judge sentenced barnes to months imprisonment and five years supervised release the judge thought about giving him a higher sentence.but i do usually exceed the government recommendation if there is a plea agreement,the judge said.and he also found that the selected sentence jibed with the sentencing factors in a,barnes personal history and characteristics,the seriousness of the crime,the need for adequate deterrence,and the need to protect the public.significantly,in his written statement of reasons for the sentence,the judge checked the box indicating that he had imposed a m andatory minimum sentence.
barnes appealed,arguing among other things that drug quantity must be treated as an element of the offense and thus proved beyond a reasonable doubt.we affirmed because caselaw let a judge use a preponderance standard in finding facts that increase a defendant sentence.see goodine,at.barnes sought certiorari.a little later the supreme court held in alleyne that most but not all facts that increase statutory minimum penalties must if the defendant does not admit them be proved beyond a reasonable doubt see.at.not surprisingly,the court gvr granted certiorari,vacated the judgment,and remanded the case for further consideration in view of alleyne.
so here we are.helpfully,the parties do not dispute that the judge calculation reflects alleyne error.rightly so,because the judge reached the plus kilogram figure the amount needed to trigger mandatory minimums using a preponderance standard see united states harakaly,cir discussing alleyne error.they also do not dispute that an alleyne error is of constitutional magnitude.about this,they are right again.see united states.pena,cir.and they do not dispute that barnes preserved his claim of alleyne error regarding the month jail term which they agree means that we must vacate his sentence unless the government proves the error harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.right they are.see united states pérezruiz,cir explaining that the government must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the assigned error did not contribute to the result of which the appellant complains see also united states melvin,cir calling the government burden here a heavy one.
two issues divide the parties,however.the first is whether the alleyne error involving the month prison term is harmless the government says it is barnes says it is not.the second is whether barnes preserved the alleyne error regarding the year term the government says he did not,and so argues review applies barnes says he did,and so argues review controls.we think barnes has the better of the arguments 
the prison term 
for those keeping track,the prison term imposed months is months above the year mandatory minimum.the government pounces on this fact,insisting it shows the judge based the jail sentence on guideline considerations,like the applicable range and the relevant section a factors.the applicable mandatory minimum,in other words,had no practical effect on the prison sentence that the judge chose,at least in the government mind.ergo,the government contends,the alleyne error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.we view matters quite differently,however.here why 
the key players at sentencing,recall,talked about mandatory minimums.true,the probation officer did not use the words mandatory minimum,but she did advise the judge that for kilograms or more of marijuana,the supervised release range would be years which is the mandatory minimum under section b a.and if,as probation suggested,that amount activated a mandatory minimum term,then everyone at sentencing could assume probation thought that amount activated a mandatory minimum jail term too.the prosecutor did use the words mandatory minimum hard on the heels of probation comment,telling the judge that the government recommended prison sentence of months would capture the applicable year mandatory minimum.the judge later used mandatory minimum lingo too,asking barnes lawyer whether a year mandatory minimum applied given the findings,to which counsel responded yes.all of this throws cold water on the government attempt to downplay the mandatory minimum role at sentencing.
but wait,protests the government.the judge also said there that he had actually considered giving barnes a higher
