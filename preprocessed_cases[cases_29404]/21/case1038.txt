jos√© picanso was convicted of four counts of distributing cocaine,one count of conspiracy to distribute,and two counts of aiding and abetting distribution.see.he now appeals his sentence,objecting to his designation as an organizer or leader.a.the government to contest the trial court attribution to picanso of a drug quantity less than that urged by the government.both claims of error are plausible but,by a close margin,we uphold the sentence against both attacks.
picanso was indicted with seven on trafficking charges in late.trial began on july,and in view of the decision in apprendi new jersey,d,the district court approved the government request to ask the jury to determine drug quantity.on july,picanso was convicted on the counts.by special verdict,the jury found picanso responsible for at least grams but less than kilograms of cocaine,making him liable under the statute to a minimum sentence of years and a maximum sentence of years.b b.
at the sentencing hearing,the government recommended that the court find picanso responsible for to kilograms of cocaine,equating under the guidelines to a base offense level bol of.c.it also sought a level increase under section a which provides,if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,increase the offense level by.both positions were supported by the probation officer report psr.the resulting total offense level tol of,coupled with picanso criminal history category ii,would have translated into a guideline sentencing range of months.ch,pt.a sentencing table.
picanso opposed both the quantity and adjustments sought by the government.as to the former,picanso said that he was responsible for less than kilos and he pointed to the jury special verdict as implying its rejection of the government position.the district court first said,you do have to argue the jury verdict with me,i bound by it.after further discussion,described more fully below,the district court retreated somewhat from this position but still found picanso responsible for between grams and kilos,resulting in a bol of.c.
however,the district court agreed with the government that the conspiracy involved five or more participants a point now undisputed and that picanso qualified as an organizer or leader,warranting an upward adjustment of levels.the result was a tol of and guideline range of months.ch,pt.a.the district court then sentenced picanso to months of imprisonment.picanso appealed to contest the factual basis for the role enhancement,and the government countered by from the district court ruling that picanso was liable for only grams to kilos of cocaine.
role enhancement.we begin with picanso appeal.to justify the role enhancement,the government carries the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defendant was the organizer or leader of a criminal activity.united states cruz,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.the guideline commentary states in pertinent part 
factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.
the underlying drug conspiracy involved picanso and a number of other drug dealers operating out of two social clubs in the back central area of lowell,massachusetts.picanso position is that he was one independent drug dealer among many he supplied many of the drug dealers that sold to end users,but he says they were all free agents and he exercised no control over them.the government seems to concede that picanso was not a leader of a unified group of drug dealers,but argues nonetheless that he pulled the organizational strings by virtue of his control of the supply of cocaine.it relies among other decisions on united states,cir 
one may be classified as an organizer,though perhaps not as a leader,if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity.the key to determining whether a defendant qualifies as an organizer is not direct control but relative responsibility t he four level enhancement applies whether or not the defendant retains supervisory control over the other participants.

in substance,picanso was a wholesaler.evidently he secured cocaine in bulk on trips to new york.according to the psr,picanso acquired kilograms of cocaine from his sources and broke down the kilograms into ounces and sold multiple ounces on a regular basis.after he distributed the drugs to retail dealers,they in turn would cut the cocaine and sell it to end users.consistent with this description,it is also undisputed that picanso was the primary cocaine supplier to these retail dealers.
the greater quantities in which a wholesaler deals and his larger profits can not alone trigger the role enhancement,united states fuller,cir,and the reason is plain.the base offense level already takes quantity and,implicitly,profit into account,id.at and if quantity alone were enough,every wholesaler in a significant conspiracy with retailers would be characterized as an organizer or leader.here,the retail dealers were free to purchase from others,and did so before,during,and after picanso arrival on the scene.nevertheless,under,a wholesaler even without control of his retailers could still coordinate others so as to facilitate the criminal activity.at.
the government points to several indicia to suggest a measure of control and coordination by picanso.several seem to us weak,at least in isolation.yes,when other drug dealers called picanso for a delivery,he would name a time and place for the transaction,but this de minimis planning is inherent in a criminal transaction involving more than one party.nor does it distinguish picanso from most sellers that as a formal matter he set the price and terms for his own sales.and,though some dealers regard picanso as the king,the guideline commentary provides that titles such as kingpin or boss are not controlling,although the commentary does not say that the perceptions of are automatically irrelevant.
more helpful to the government is the report by a confidential witness contained in the psr that picanso boasted that he would shut a down for good if the messed up again.the ability to regulate participation in the local drug trade is surely an indicium of power and control.this statement was not introduced at trial,and picanso questions whether the sentencing judge actually relied on it,but sentencing decisions can rest on facts contained in the psr and obvious evidence in the record supporting the district court ultimate finding is sufficient.cruz,at see also united states medina,cir no need for specific findings if evidence obvious.
there was also some evidence that picanso on at least one occasion arranged for a transfer of drugs that involved picanso as supplier,one of his retailers,and an acquaintance of the retailer.how far this showed picanso to be orchestrating downstream transactions is a matter of inference but inference drawing is part of confided to the district court.to the extent that picanso was effectively supervising the arrangements for a sale by the retailer for further distribution,it becomes easier to describe him as an organizer of something more than his own wholesaling.united states brown,cir,cert.denied,d.
while the pillars may be individually weak,taken together they provide somewhat stronger support for the district court ultimate finding.to summarize,picanso supplied a substantial network of retailers,set the terms for his own transactions with them,was regarded as the kingpin by other conspirators,inferences in favor of the ultimate some influence over the operations of the retailers themselves.probably this could be said of many wholesalers but not all.
there is no mathematical formula for drawing the line on one side of which one can be called an organizer.although th
