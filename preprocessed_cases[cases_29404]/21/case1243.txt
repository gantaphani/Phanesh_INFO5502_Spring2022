this case presents two issues whether b a constitutes a valid exercise of the united states sentencing commission authority,and thus binds district courts whenever they reduce a defendant sentence under c and whether,even if b a binds district courts,it nonetheless permits them to depart from a defendant amended guideline range under.defendants appellants adib brantley and clifton stith appeal from two orders entered on november,by the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue.in those orders,the district court reduced brantley and stith terms of imprisonment under c.nonetheless,the district court concluded that b a prohibited it from reducing brantley and stith sentences to a term of imprisonment that is less than the minimum of the ir amended guideline range s.based on this conclusion,the district court declined to grant brantley and stith request for a departure under,even though it had previously departed under that provision at the defendants appellants initial sentencings.
on appeal,brantley and stith argue that the district court erred in concluding that b a prohibited it from further reducing their sentences.first,they contend that b a does not bind district courts because the united states sentencing commission the commission exceeded its authority when it enacted that provision.second,they argue that,even if b a binds district courts,it does not prohibit them from departing under in order to account for the fact that a defendant criminal history category substantially the seriousness of his past crimes.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgments.
background 
on june,brantley pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering in violation of d.at his initial sentencing on december,brantley guideline range recommended a sentence of to months of imprisonment.because the district court found that brantley criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his past crimes,it granted a downward departure under b,reducing his range to to months.considering this range,the district court imposed a sentence of months.
stith case has a similar history.on may,he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering in violation of d.at his initial sentencing on december,stith guideline range was to months of imprisonment.the district court departed from stith guideline range under b,reducing that range to to months.considering this range,the district court imposed a sentence of months.
in,congress passed the fair sentencing act fsa,which sought to restore fairness to federal cocaine sentencing by increasing the amounts of crack cocaine a defendant needed to distribute in order to trigger statutory sentencing minimums.no,stat.the fsa also authorized the commission to make such conforming amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines as the commission determines necessary to achieve consistency with other guidelines provisions and applicable law.id,stat.at.acting under this authority,the commission amended the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines to conform them to the new statutory scheme and to increase the amounts of crack cocaine a defendant needed to distribute in order to incur harsher penalties.app.c,amends.effective november,the commission made the amendments retroactive,applying them to defendants,such as brantley and stith,who had been sentenced before the amendments enactment.app.c,amend.
when it made the amendments retroactive,the commission also amended the guideline provision that governs the extent to which a district court may reduce a defendant term of imprisonment in response to guideline amendments.id.under.b a,a district court may not reduce a defendant term of imprisonment to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.in,the sentencing guidelines recognized an exception to b a wherever the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing.b b in cases to which the exception applied,where the district court had previously departed from a defendant guideline range b b permitted the district court to grant a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range.id.the amendment narrowed the scope of b b exception,applying it only where a defendant had initially received a sentence because she had provided substantial assistance to authorities.b b see also app.c,amend.
in,brantley and stith asked the district court to reduce their terms of imprisonment based on the retroactive amendments to the guidelines.the district court found that,under those amendments,brantley had an amended guideline range of to months,and stith had an amended guideline range of to months.on november,the district court reduced brantley sentence to months,and stith sentence to months.responding to brantley and stith requests for a downward departure under,however,the district court stated that 
under the new amendment to,defendants do not benefit from any downward departures except those given for substantial assistance thus,this order modifying defendant sentence does not reflect the previous departure from defendant criminal history category under b.

ii.discussion 
we review the district court interpretation of statutes and the g uidelines de novo.united states savoy,cir per curiam.similarly,we review de novo any questions of constitutional interpretation raised by a district court application of the guidelines.see united states awadallah,cir.
brantley and stith advance two,alternative arguments.first,they argue that b a does not bind district courts for four different reasons the enactment of b a exceeded the authority that the commission exercises under u the enactment of b a required the commission to exercise legislative power in violation of the constitution b a usurps power that the constitution reserves for the judiciary and the commission failed,in enacting b a,to comply with the procedures required by.we have recently addressed each of these contentions.see united states.johnson,slip op.at cir.may.specifically,we held in johnson that i n amending,the commission has done precisely that which it was permitted,and congressionally encouraged,to do,id.at congress has sufficiently instructed the commission as to both the contours of its authority and the means by which it may exercise that authority,id.at the commission has not wrongfully limit ed judicial powers,id.at and the commission failure to follow procedures prescribed under,which were not required to amend a policy statement such as,can not render that subsection invalid,id.at.thus,for the reasons set forth in johnson,we agree with the district court that b a prohibited any reduction of stith and brantley sentences to a term of imprisonment that fell below their amended guideline ranges.
second,stith and brantley argue that,even if b a bound the district court,it nonetheless did not prohibit the district court from departing under.section b permits departures whenever a defendant criminal history category substantially the seriousness of his past crimes.stith and brantley contend that courts may incorporate departures into the amended guideline range that,under b a,limits the scope of a defendant reduction.section b a instructs courts to determine a defendant amended guideline range under b.section b,in turn,defines the amended guideline range as the range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment s to the guidelines had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.in making such determination,the court shall substitute only the amend ed guideline provisions for the corresponding provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.b.
section b use of the word applicable has technical significance.the commentary to defines the phrase applicable guideline range as the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history cate
