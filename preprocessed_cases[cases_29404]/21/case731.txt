following a conviction for various charges stemming from his operation of a heroin distribution organization,appellant roberto portes challenges the sentence imposed by the district court.specifically,he contends that the court committed error by sentencing him pursuant to a statute with an increased statutory maximum on the basis of a drug quantity that the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt,in violation of apprendi new jersey,d and treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory,in contravention of united states booker,d.we reject both former due to the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence of the requisite quantity of drugs,and the latter because portes has failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the district court would impose a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.consequently,we affirm portes sentence.
factual background 
in,the drug enforcement administration dea began an investigation of a heroin distribution organization that portes operated.at trial,four of portes former employees jorge luis,nelson,hector,and elso valverde,who had agreed to cooperate with the government,testified about the mechanics of the organization one participant would drive from worcester,massachusetts to new york once or twice a week to retrieve drugs from a contact there.the cash to purchase the drugs would be transported to new york in a secret compartment in the buick the drugs would be placed in that compartment on the return trip.back in worcester,the participants would weigh and package the heroin at various locations,including portes residence at florence street a room at the clarion suites hotel rented in the name of junior pena,one of portes aliases a space leased at one wayne terrace and the residence of rodolfo matos,another of portes employees.law enforcement agents surveilled all these locations at various times.they also rented a room across the hall from the room at the clarion suites hotel,from which they observed most of the participants in the conspiracy arriving at and leaving the room,sometimes putting items into their pockets.
the four cooperating witnesses testified that portes employed them in processing and distributing the heroin.they performed tasks such as sealing envelopes containing heroin,using a press to make one ounce tablets of heroin,and delivering packages of heroin to customers.testified that portes kept ledgers recording the amount of heroin delivered to various customers and the amount of money those customers owed.
a dea special agent,acting in an undercover capacity,arranged to purchase heroin from matos on five occasions.on january,the agent met matos at svea street in worcester and paid him for two ounces grams of heroin in a compressed,tablet form wrapped in red and white paper and tape.on february,the agent met matos at matos residence in worcester and paid him for three ounces grams of heroin.prior to this meeting,matos went to portes residence shortly thereafter,and valverde went to the clarion suites hotel for about five minutes,then returned to portes residence.matos then returned to his own residence.
on may,the agent purchased two ounces grams of heroin from matos for while they sat in a white buick lesabre.matos retrieved the heroin from a secret compartment in the glove compartment of the car.prior to this transaction,matos went to portes residence,where he met portes,and ruben perez.after exiting portes residence,matos and perez entered the buick,which was parked outside,and perez appeared to fiddle with the glove compartment area.perez then got out of the car and matos drove to meet the agent in the buick.
on june,the agent met matos at the auburn mall in worcester and paid him for two ounces grams of heroin.at that time the agent indicated that he wished to purchase a larger quantity of heroin for a discounted price.subsequently,the agent and matos negotiated over the phone for the sale of eight ounces of heroin for.testified that,on august,he saw portes wrapping and sealing nine tablets of heroin inside one wayne terrace.the planned transaction never occurred because most of the defendants were arrested that day.however,in executing search warrants,law enforcement agents seized nine ounces grams of heroin from the hidden compartment of the buick.they also seized a large quantity of drug paraphernalia from one wayne terrace,much of which contained trace amounts of heroin,and a bag containing grams of heroin in a powdered form.
procedural history 
the second superseding indictment,returned on june,brought various charges relating to the heroin distribution organization against portes and his three counts were relevant to portes.count one charged portes and various others with conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute,in violation of a and.count four charged portes with the possession of heroin with the intent to distribute it on august,in connection with the alleged heroin found at one wayne terrace,in violation of a.count five charged portes with possession,and aiding and abetting possession of,heroin on august,with the intent to distribute it,in connection with the heroin allegedly found in the white buick lesabre,in violation of a and.on these three counts,the indictment did not include any specific allegations with respect to the quantity of drugs involved.
at trial,the district court did not instruct the jury that it must find any specific quantity of drugs indeed,its instructions stated if you find that the material involved is heroin,beyond a reasonable doubt,you need not be concerned about the quantity.the jury returned a guilty verdict on the three drug counts related to portes.
the presentence report psr stated that portes was responsible for an amount of heroin between ten and thirty kilograms,resulting in a base offense level of.the psr added several enhancements two levels for the gun found at one wayne terrace,under b four levels because portes was a leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants,under a and two levels for obstructing justice due to portes threats to cooperating defendants,under.after totaling these enhancements,the psr concluded that portes was subject to the maximum offense level of.the psr also established the sentencing range for each offense a mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of life imprisonment on count one a maximum of twenty years imprisonment on count four and a mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of forty years on count five.
portes objected to the drug quantity stated in the psr,contending that,based upon the testimony at the trial,it is impossible to calculate the quantity of heroin attributed to him to be in the range of kilograms.he contended that the only heroin attributable to him should be the amount related to the specific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.
prior to sentencing portes,the district court conducted a evidentiary hearing.the government presented testimony from five cooperating witnesses who testified regarding the amount of heroin involved in portes offenses and from a dea special agent,who testified that,based on his review of the drug ledgers,the statements of the nine cooperating defendants,the heroin seized,and the heroin purchased,the conspiracy involved a total of grams of heroin.portes contested this drug quantity calculation,disputing the credibility of the government cooperating witnesses as to drug quantity and arguing that the amount in question was less than ten kilograms.
the court concluded that portes was responsible for more than three kilograms of heroin beyond a reasonable doubt and for seven to eight kilograms of heroin by a preponderance of the evidence.in making these determinations,the court relied on the heroin seized from one wayne terrace and the buick,the heroin that matos sold to the undercover agent,and the heroin listed in the drug ledgers which the court discounted somewhat because the ledgers included entries for cocaine as well as heroin transactions.the court stated that it did not rely on the cooperating witnesses testimony in making these determinations.based on this drug quantity,the cou
