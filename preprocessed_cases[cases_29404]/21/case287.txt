federal rule of criminal procedure a permits the filing of a motion to correct a sentence within days of its imposition.but what happens when a defendant timely notice of appeal follows such a motion but predates any action on the motion by the district court it is an open question in this circuit whether that notice of appeal,unamended,suffices to allow appellate review of an ensuing denial of the rule a motion.we hold that the original notice of appeal,unamended,does not create appellate jurisdiction to review the district court subsequent disposition of the rule a motion.in order to test the denial of rule a relief,the defendant must either amend his original notice of appeal or file a new notice of appeal.
it is trite but true that he who wins the battle does not always win the war.so it is here although we lack jurisdiction to review the allegedly incorrect denial of rule a relief,we nonetheless have jurisdiction to review the defendant separate claim of procedural error in the imposition of the sentence itself.exercising that jurisdiction,we conclude that the district court committed plain error in its imposition of the sentence.accordingly,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,the plea agreement,colloquy,unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and transcript of the disposition hearing define the factual contours of our analysis.see united states ocasio cancel,cir.
we scroll back to april,when christian ortiz failed to appear in a local puerto rican court for sentencing in a case.the court,undeterred by the defendant disappearing act,sentenced him in absentia to serve a term of immurement.the court did not stop there it also issued a warrant for the defendant arrest and found him guilty,on the spot,of the crime of contempt of court.
for nearly six months thereafter,the defendant eluded capture.the long arm of the law eventually ensnared him,and he was arrested with a stash of ammunition in his possession.the scene then shifted to a federal forum a grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment against the defendant that charged him with possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.see g,a.within a matter of months,the defendant executed a plea agreement and entered a guilty plea.
in due course,the probation department prepared the psi report,which recommended a guideline sentencing range gsr of to months.this recommendation contemplated a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iv.included in the underlying criminal history score were two points for the defendant in absentia contempt conviction.
the district court convened the disposition hearing on august.defense counsel argued that the contempt conviction had been imposed in violation of puerto rico laws requiring that,prior to conviction,a defendant be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.see laws ann.tit,app.ii,b.the district court refused to lower the gsr on this basis.it then concluded that the defendant actions warranted a small variance from the gsr and imposed a month incarcerative sentence.
thirteen days later,defense counsel filed a motion to reconsider judgment and sentence.having ascertained that the commonwealth court had vacated the contempt conviction prior to the federal court disposition hearing,counsel prayed for a lesser sentence based on a revised gsr.the motion papers explained that subtracting the two criminal history points attributable to the dismissed contempt conviction would result in a criminal history category of iii not iv and a gsr of to months.
the next day,defense counsel filed the instant notice of appeal.it described the matter appealed as the judgment and sentence entered against the defendant on august.
a month elapsed before the district court denied the defendant motion at that point,the defendant neither filed a further notice of appeal nor amended the original notice to include the district court more recent order.
during the briefing phase of this appeal,the parties proceeded as though both the sentence and the order were before us.at oral argument,we questioned our jurisdiction over the latter order and directed the submission of supplemental briefs.those briefs were duly filed.
against this backdrop,we first inquire into the extent of our jurisdiction.to conduct this inquiry,we must determine the character of the defendant motion.ascertaining a motion character depends upon its substance,not its appellation.see united states moran,cir united states morillo,cir.
viewed through the lens of substance,the raiment of federal rule of criminal procedure a perfectly suits the motion.that rule allows a district court to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error within days of the pronouncement of the sentence.a,c.here,the defendant filed the motion within the prescribed time frame.moreover,the motion sought to correct a clear error the inclusion of a dismissed conviction in computing the defendant criminal history score.this is a paradigmatic example of the type of bevue that rule a was designed to address.see,morillo,at.elevating substance over form,we conclude that the motion should be treated as a motion under rule a.
so characterized,the district court had authority to rule on the motion despite the earlier filing of the defendant notice of appeal.see fed.b see also supra note.nevertheless,the district court order denying the motion is not properly before us.we explain briefly.
it is common ground that our review of a district court order is circumscribed by the filed notice of appeal.this notice must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.rule designation requirement is mandatory,jurisdictional,and not susceptible to waiver.see constructora andrade gutiérrez,am.int l ins,cir.it follows that a party failure to designate a particular order for appeal ordinarily defeats a later attempt to dispute that order in the court of appeals.shelby superformance int l,cir.
to be sure,there is some play in the joints.see chamorro puerto rican cars,cir explaining that notices of appeal are to be construed liberally in the context of the record as a whole.in the last analysis,however,rule core dictates must still be satisfied,and is fatal to an appeal.in re spookyworld,cir quoting smith barry,d accord united states velez carrero,cir.when all is said and done,an inquiry into compliance with rule c b asks whether a particular notice of appeal,as informed by the case record in its entirety,sufficiently manifests an intent to appeal the order in question.see markel am.ins.díaz santiago,cir.
in the case at hand,nothing about the defendant notice of appeal manifests an intention to contest the outcome of the rule a motion an outcome that remained uncertain on the day the notice was filed.the notice designated for appeal only the district court judgment and sentence entered against the defendant on august,and omitted any mention of the rule a motion,let alone any mention of a disposition of that motion.nor did the defendant anticipatorily signal an intent to contest the outcome of the motion once the district court disposed of it.
this is not to say that the defendant was powerless to incorporate the denial of his rule a motion into his appeal.for one thing,he could have amended his pending notice of appeal to cover the subsequent ruling.see,constructora andrade gutiérrez,at.for another thing,he could have filed a second supplemental notice of appeal directed exclusively to that ruling.but the defendant pursued neither of these easily available alternatives.under such circumstances,we are without jurisdiction to review the district court denial of rule a relief see,united states cartwright,cir per curiam.
our determination that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court denial of the defendant rule a motion does not end the matter.we do have jurisdiction,under the filed notice of appeal,to review the sentence itself.see a.even so,there is a rub while the defendant argued at sentencing that his contempt conviction was invalid and unworthy of inclusi
