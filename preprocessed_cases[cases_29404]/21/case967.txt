the central question here concerns the interpretation of section of the sentencing guidelines,which provides for a enhancement of a defendant offense level if the defendant engaged in carjacking.sentencing guidelines manual b.we hold that the district court enhancement of the defendant sentence was not contrary to the guidelines and that there was no plain error in the district court failure to submit the fact issues concerning enhancement to a jury.
the guidelines provide if the robbery offense involved carjacking,increase by levels.id.b.the guidelines further define carjacking as the taking or attempted taking of a motor vehicle from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.id,cmt.this provision is similar to the statute making carjacking a criminal offense.see.that statute provides criminal punishments for w hoever,with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm,takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,shipped,or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation,or attempts to do so.id.emphasis added.despite the minor differences in language,we agree with the sixth circuit that the person or presence requirement of the guidelines provision should be interpreted to be the same as the person or presence requirement of the criminal statute.united states boucha,cir see also united states bates,cir reserving the question whether the guidelines,like the carjacking statute,include a specific intent requirement.the question thus becomes whether,on the facts of this case,the person or presence requirement of the carjacking statute has been satisfied.
at the sentencing hearing,the parties agreed that the carjacking enhancement was to be based entirely on the facts in the presentence report.accordingly,the following facts are taken from the presentence report.at approximately pm on april,the appellant,stephen savarese,and an accomplice traveled to the property of frank and beverly shippee in shapleigh,maine,on which the shippees home and the fort ridge trading post,a shop the shippees operated,were located.intending to steal firearms from the trading post,savarese and his accomplice pretended that their car had had mechanical trouble.they forced their way into the shippees home when shippee retrieved a cordless telephone for them,attacking shippee with a stick and threatening the shippees with a pistol and a shotgun.once the shippees had been subdued,the assailants demanded the combination to the lock on the door of the trading post.while they pointed guns at shippee,they also demanded and took the keys to the shippees suv,which was parked in the driveway.unable to gain entry to the trading post with the combination,savarese broke a window in the door and entered the shop.he returned to the shippees home with duct tape from the shop,with which the assailants bound the shippees hands and feet.savarese then guarded the shippees while his accomplice stole guns from the trading post and loaded them into the shippees suv,which they then drove to savarese car,parked nearby.
an eyewitness was able to identify savarese car as having been near the trading post on the night of april,and savarese was arrested on april.he subsequently pled guilty to charges of interference with commerce by robbery in violation of a and b using and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of c a ii and theft of firearms from a federally licensed firearms dealer in violation of u and aiding and abetting such a theft in violation of.
savarese was sentenced on december.with respect to the second count,a minimum sentence of seven years,consecutive to savarese other sentences,was required.see c a ii.the first and third counts were grouped together pursuant to section b of the guidelines.the base offense level for the first count was,pursuant to section of the guidelines.the district court applied four enhancements,each of two levels,under that section because a threat of death was made b f shippee sustained bodily injury b the shippees were physically restrained to facilitate the commission of the offense b and the offense involved carjacking b.in addition,the district court applied a enhancement pursuant to section b of the guidelines because firearms were taken,for an adjusted offense level of.
because the offense level for the first count was greater than that for the third count,it became the offense level for the grouped offenses.the district court reduced the offense level by three levels to because savarese accepted responsibility for the offense,pursuant to section of the guidelines.savarese was assigned to criminal history category i because he had no prior criminal history,resulting in a guideline range of months.the district court sentenced the defendant to months on each of the first and third counts,to be served concurrent with each other,and months on the second count,to be served consecutively to each of the first and third counts.the district court also imposed a supervised release term,a mandatory assessment of,and restitution of.
at the sentencing hearing,savarese objected to the district court carjacking enhancement,asserting that the enhancement provision did not apply to him because he took the keys from the shippees inside the house while the suv remained outside the house in the shippees driveway the district court relied on the sixth circuit interpretation in boucha of presence for purposes of the carjacking enhancement,stating 
i read the case law,scarce as it is on this issue.the case that seems to come the closest is boucha.i think the court in that case probably states the law correctly,but i not sure the interpretation is a reasonable one.
i do believe that the law in this circuit would be that the facts as set forth in this case where a person car is right outside their house,the keys are demanded and received by way of force,and the car is therefore taken from right outside the house comes within what congress intended in the carjacking statute and the enhancement as applied in the sentencing guidelines.
so i think the enhancement applies,and i severely troubled by the fact that it does apply.

we review the interpretation and application of the united states sentencing guidelines by the district court without deference,and we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states caldwell,cir.
the issue under the carjacking statute and hence under the guidelines is whether the victims suv was taken from the presence of the victims when the defendant forced them to turn over the keys.the government argues that,under the guidelines,merely f orcibly taking the keys to a vehicle at gunpoint is sufficient for the carjacking enhancement to apply.br.of appellee at.this interpretation ignores the fact that the vehicle itself must be taken from the presence of the victim and offers no limiting principle,encompassing the theft of keys to a vehicle located miles away in distant parts of the city,or even in a different city.we look to general purpose dictionaries from the time of the statute enactment to determine the meaning of statutory language.see,carey saffold,d see also textron,cir in contrast to the government interpretation,presence is defined as the part of space within one ken,call,or influence the vicinity of or the area immediately near one the place in front of or around a person.webster third new international dictionary see also webster third new international dictionary same.in interpreting the carjacking statute,this court has looked to the common law meaning of presence.united states,cir courts generally agree that taking from a victim person is understood to include the common law conception of taking from a victim presence.thus,at a minimum,proximity to the vehicle and the ability to influence the space encompassing the vehicle is required.
while this court has not previously addressed this issue,the authority from other circuits is basically consistent with this definition.in interpreting a robbery statute that also contained a person or p
