defendant pro se ulysses thomas ware appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a jury trial before william pauley iii,judge,convicting him of securities fraud,in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,rule promulgated thereunder by the securities exchange commission sec,and and conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud,in violation of.ware was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,a fine of,and forfeiture of.on appeal,ware contends,inter alia,that his right to be free from double jeopardy was violated,that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions,and that the court made errors in sentencing.we find no merit in any of ware contentions except his challenge to the sufficiency of the district court sentencing findings as to his role in the offenses.on that issue,we remand for additional proceedings in all other respects we affirm.
background 
the present prosecution focused on the conduct of ware with respect to a pump and dump scheme from december through april,involving the issuance of fraudulent press releases that artificially inflated the prices of the shares of two small companies service systems international,service systems,and investment technology,investment technology.the government evidence at trial included press releases issued at ware behest testimony from two participants in the drafting of the press releases,jeremy jones and carleton epps charts showing increases in price and trading volume of the companies shares corresponding to the dates on which such press releases were issued and testimony from several investors who invested in investment technology in reliance on ware press releases,only to see the stock become worthless when the artificially inflated prices plummeted.as discussed in part.below,the press releases contained materially false and misleading representations favorable to the companies,omitted material information that was unfavorable,causing their stock prices to rise.ware,who had acquired stock in the companies,sold most of his stock while causing the false press releases to be issued,reaping profits of more than in a period.
ware was tried on one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.after a first trial ended in a mistrial,necessitated by the illness of jones see part.below,ware was retried and convicted on both counts.he was sentenced principally as indicated above,calculated as discussed in part iii below.
ii.challenges to the conviction 
on appeal,ware makes numerous challenges to his conviction,including contending that his prosecution was the product of government misconduct,that the district judge should have recused himself,that his right to be free from double jeopardy was violated,and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on either count.we reject ware charges of government his contention that he should have been allowed to argue to the jury that there was such for the reasons stated by the district court in an order dated january,and in an in limine ruling on the record on may.we reject ware contention that the district judge should have recused himself,as we find in the record no basis for recusal.we reject ware double jeopardy and sufficiency challenges for the reasons that follow.
a.the double jeopardy contention 
ware first trial began on january.the government principal witness was jones,who described his participation in ware securities fraud scheme and authenticated numerous exhibits for admission into evidence.see,transcript of first trial at.when the trial was adjourned for the weekend on thursday,january,ware was in the process of jones.during the weekend,jones was hospitalized,suffering from elevated blood pressure and kidney failure.with ware consent,the trial resumed on monday,january,with testimony from other government witnesses.on tuesday morning,the government reported that it had been unable to obtain more information as to jones condition,and it proffered the name and telephone number of jones attending physician to ware and the court.ware moved for a mistrial,arguing that having a hiatus of a week or more during his of jones would be unduly prejudicial.see id.at.the government opposed the motion,and the district court denied it.see id.at.
on tuesday afternoon,the government relayed to ware and the court the physician evaluation of jones and inability to predict when jones might be discharged from the hospital.ware again moved for a mistrial the court postponed a ruling and continued the trial that afternoon.see id.at.later in the day,an affidavit was received from jones physician stating that jones was critically ill and would require hospitalization for an indefinite period of time.ware again moved for a mistrial,arguing that,as a practical matter,the jury would be unable to disregard jones testimony and the evidence admitted through his testimony.see id.at.although the government urged the district court to wait a few days to see whether jones condition improved,the court found it clear that jones would not be returning to testify soon and it granted ware motion.the court noted that 
t here is no constitutional issue presented here because the defendant has moved for a mistrial and it seems to me not to grant it would simply raise potential sixth amendment issues,because the defendant has not had an opportunity to complete his of jones.
ware thereafter moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he could not be retried because of his right to be free from double jeopardy.that motion was denied,and his new trial began in april.on this appeal,ware pursues his contention that the double jeopardy clause precluded any retrial.
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment generally protects a defendant from successive prosecutions for the same offense.see,oregon kennedy,d united states dinitz,d.however,where the original trial has not been completed because the defendant himself moved for a mistrial,he is deemed to have deliberately elected to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact.united states rivera,cir quoting united states scott,d.thus,when a mistrial has been granted on motion of the defendant,a retrial is normally not barred by the double jeopardy clause unless the government engaged in conduct that was intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.kennedy,at.see,dinitz,at.double jeopardy clause protect s a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests.
in the present case,the mistrial was sought by ware,and the district court granted it over the objection of the government.there is no indication whatever in the record that jones absence from the trial after january was procured by the government or that the government engaged in any conduct designed to cause a mistrial or goad ware into moving for a mistrial.accordingly,ware double jeopardy challenge is meritless.
b.the sufficiency challenges 
ware challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his securities fraud conviction,arguing principally a that the government failed to call as witnesses any auditors or forensic accountants to testify that any of the statements in the press releases were false or misleading,and b that there was no proof that those statements were material,that they had any impact on the trading volume in the shares of service systems or investment technology.in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud,ware contends principally that there was insufficient evidence of a conspiratorial agreement,pointing to testimony from epps and jones suggesting that they had not knowingly conspired to manipulate the service systems and investment technology stock.these contentions are meritless.
in reviewing a defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction,we must view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,see,united states josephberg,cir united states eppolito,cir,cert.denied,d united states leonard,cir.where there are conflicts in the testimony,we must defer to the jury resolution of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.see,united states jones,cir united states morrison,cir united states miller,cir,cert.denied,d.the assessment of witness credibility lies solely within the province of the jury,and the jury is free to believe part and disbelieve part of any witness testimony united states josephberg,at see,united states gleason,cir,cert.denied,d.these principles apply whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial.see,glasser united states.the conviction must be upheld if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.
the evidence at ware second trial,taken in the light most favorable to the government,included the following.in,ware was an attorney who operated a small firm called rosenfeld,goldman ware rgw,which held itself out as both a law firm and an investment bank.see,transcript of second trial tr.at.in late,ware hired jones and epps,young men who were previously employed by jackson,shanklin sonia or jss,a small securities firm that had leased office space from rgw until october.jones and epps testified that ware instructed them to search the internet for small publicly traded companies that had reasonable trading volume and whose share price was below.id.at see id.at.jones and epps were to contact companies that fit that profile and inquire whether they would like help from ware in promoting their stock in exchange,ware would require advance payments of cash or of stock that could be sold immediately upon receipt without restrictions.see id.at.
service systems and investment technology entered into such agreements with ware firm and brokerage accounts controlled by ware ultimately received a total of million shares of service systems stock see id.at and million shares of investment technology stock see id.at.after the initial shares were received,ware began editing,approving,and issuing press releases that he caused to be distributed nationwide through business wire and internet wire,companies engaged in the electronic distribution of press releases and other material on a large scale.the press releases promoting service systems and investment technology did not disclose the involvement or role of ware rather,ware had his clerical assistant myron williams,who owned a defunct credit consulting business called mw financial services,send the releases to business wire and internet wire,using the mw financial services name and website.see tr.
the press releases introduced at trial were false and misleading in three ways.first,they attributed statements and evaluations to sources that were said to be independent of each other and of the issuer of the stock being promoted.in fact,however,some of the information in the press releases for investment technology came from its president other information as to both investment technology and service systems was fabricated by jones and epps and the entities cited were not sources of factual information at all.one supposed source was mw financial services,williams credit consulting company,which was defunct.another was jss,which had never employed stock analysts,had never made stock recommendations,and never issued press releases during the period in question,jss principal worked from his home and was unaware that the jss name was being used by ware.see id.at.a third purported source,centennial advisors,was a company that had been created by epps and jones but was not operational.see id.at.a fourth,called small cap research group,was a company set up by ware.see id.at.ware instructed epps and jones,in drafting press releases,to make it appear that there were more entities analyzing these companies because it would be better for the price of the stock.id.at see also id.at ware also instructed epps to get on which epps described as an investment community bulletin board and on yahoo which has that same feature and post favorable comments about service systems and investment technology under an assortment of screen names emphasis added.in fact,ware was responsible for all of the favorable statements in the press releases,as the releases were written by epps or jones and edited or approved by ware.see,id.at.
second,the press releases did not disclose that service systems and investment technology had paid ware to prepare the promotional press releases.any receipt and amount of such compensation are material information,the disclosure of which is required by law,see b.
third,the press releases that ware caused to be issued contained false and baseless statements about the business and financial circumstances of service systems and investment technology.jones testified that he helped prepare and issue false press releases t o drive up the price of a stock.tr.he testified that he never saw or heard anything to support those releases.for example,a december,press release claimed that jss rated the service systems or svsy stock a speculative strong buy,with a target price of cents a share,which was more than five times the stock price at that time government exhibit gx a december press release,which was also attributed to jss,reiterate d speculative strong buy in short term gx and a december,press release attributed to centennial advisors a prediction that the svsy share price would triple in five business days see gx see also gx.in fact,svsy recent quarterly report to the sec,filed on november,stated that svsy has not recognized revenue to date and has accumulated operating losses of approximately since inception that although svsy was attempting to raise additional equity capital,there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations and that t hese conditions raise substantial doubt about the company ability to continue as a going concern.gx,at.
a press release for svsy on thursday,january,stated a that f inancing talks reportedly in excess of million dollars will provide the cash infusion that service systems needs,and b that carlton sic epps,analyst at jackson,shanklin sonia recommended svsy stock and believed that it could very well return up to from current levels.gx.in fact,however,jss never employed stock analysts see tr.epps never made stock price predictions see id.at and jones had no reason to believe there were any million financing negotiations see id.at.on january,ware sent service systems an stating that currently the bid has risen since our of thursday the market is positive on the prospects for the company our strategy will definitely work if everybody does their part on the team.gx.
ware earlier press releases for service systems had had similarly desirable effects on its share price in december.on december,the closing price of service systems stock was cents a share,on a trading volume of shares.see gx.after the press releases by ware on december,and,the december closing price was cents a share,with shares traded,reflecting increases of more than percent in price and more than percent in volume in six trading days.see id.
as to investment technology or it,ware caused press releases to be issued on,among other days,february,and.on january,investment technology stock had closed at cents a share,with shares traded.see gx.ware february,press release estimated that it profits would grow at the rate of percent a year and that its stock price would accelerat e to the mid with sic the next months on strong volume.gx.by february,the closing price of an it share was double the january closing price and the february trading volume was shares,whereas only shares had been traded on the previous trading day.see gx.ware february,press release attributed to small cap research group a description of it as a leader in the online gaming industry,referred to estimated eps earnings per share of,and stated that it share price was expected to increase to within the next months the release cited a report on the mw financial services website.gx.in fact,small cap research group was owned by ware mw financial services was merely a website that belonged to williams and was controlled by ware and the online gambling report on the website had been prepared by epps.when epps was asked about the supposedly expected price target of,he testified that the calculation of a price target starts with the financial statements of that company and that,as of the date of the press release,he had no financial statements for it tr.when asked about the basis for the press release estimate of cents per share as it earnings,epps testified that it was not an operating company.therefore,it did have any earnings.id.at.
ware also caused to be issued a february,press release that attributed to centennial advisors a recommendation of investment technology as a strong buy and stated that it had accepted more than bets totaling more than million in connection with the february,super bowl.gx.in fact,however,it had no operations and had not taken a single super bowl bet.see,tr.actually,they did do any money internal quotation marks omitted.jones testified that some of the information in this press release had come from it president see id.at,but that the million figure was his and epps hypothesis as to the amount that could have been bet with it on that type of day based on sports betting statistics they found on the internet id.at.and as to the press release statement that bets had been placed,jones testified,that is the information that carlton sic and i made up.id.at.
after the sec began an investigation in into the trading in investment technology stock,ware prepared an affidavit for williams that was designed to exculpate ware with respect to the february,press release.williams testified at trial that he signed the affidavit without carefully reading it,relying on ware because ware said it was merely a document that he had forgotten to have williams sign,ware was an attorney,and williams trusted him see id.at.the affidavit stated that the release was a draft that had been sent out inadvertently,that ware and williams had called business wire and explained the error,and that they had asked that the release be withdrawn.see gx.although ware submitted this affidavit to the sec,williams testified that each of these statements was false see tr.
a february,press release introduced as gx prepared by jones and attributed to centennial advisors,stated that it was aligning itself with takeover targets that had good business prospects in terms of content and established customer base and was allocating roughly an estimated percent of its operating budget to advertising.tr.internal quotation marks omitted.in fact,jones had no information to support his statements about it budget he testified,they had no budget.id.
during the period in which ware was having the falsely favorable press releases issued,he was selling most of the stock he had received as compensation for creating the press releases.in december and january,he sold of his service systems shares,making a profit of.see id.at.from the end of january to,ware sold some of his investment technology shares,making a profit of.see id.at gx.
we conclude that the evidence at trial was ample to permit the jury to find that ware,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities of service systems and investment technology,directly or indirectly used instrumentalities of interstate commerce t o make untrue statement s of material fact s or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,and hence was guilty of securities fraud.ware argument that there were certain types of evidence that the government did not present does not detract from the fact that the evidence the government did direct and sufficient to prove ware guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
the above evidence was also ample to permit the jury to find ware guilty of conspiracy in violation of,that ware a entered into an agreement with others,including at least epps and jones,to perpetrate the securities fraud scheme by means of wire communications,and b committed one or more overt acts in furtherance of that agreement.
iii.sentencing challenges 
in determining ware sentence,the district court first calculated the imprisonment range recommended by the advisory sentencing guidelines guidelines.it found that ware guidelines base offense level was,see guidelines a,and that that level should be increased by steps pursuant to b g either because the losses caused by ware offenses totaled more than or because his gains from the sale of the service systems and investment technology stock exceeded.see sentencing transcript,october,at.ware offense level was further increased by four steps because his offenses involved or more victims,see guidelines b four steps on the ground that ware was an organizer or leader of a scheme that involved five or more participants or that was otherwise extensive,see id.a two steps on the ground that ware,having been retained as an attorney for service systems and having made improper regulatory filings with respect to that company in order to benefit himself at its expense,abused a position of trust,see id.and two steps on the ground that his submission of the false williams affidavit to the sec constituted an attempt to obstruct justice,see id.see.ware total offense level was thus given his criminal history category of i,the range of imprisonment was months.after considering the factors set out in,the court concluded that a reasonable term of imprisonment for ware was months.
ware challenges most of the court guidelines calculations.we question only the adjustment for leadership role.
leadership role 
the advisory guidelines specify a upward adjustment in offense level if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants,guidelines a including the defendant,see,united states paccione,cir,cert.denied,d or was otherwise extensive,guidelines a.before imposing a role adjustment,the sentencing court must make specific findings as to why a particular subsection of adjustment applies.see,united states espinoza,cir.o ur precedents are uniform in requiring a district court to make specific factual findings to support a sentence enhancement under internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d united states carter,cir carter,cert.denied,d united states huerta,cir united states molina,cir united states patasnik,cir a court must make two specific factual findings before it can properly enhance a defendant offense level under a i that the defendant was an organizer or leader,and ii that the criminal activity either involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.
the findings of the sentencing court must be sufficiently specific to permit meaningful appellate review.it is not enough for the court merely to repeat or paraphrase the language of the guideline and say conclusorily that the defendant meets those criteria.in carter,for example,the district court applied the role enhancement,stating,
the thing that i wrestled with was the defendant role in the offense.a states that if a defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,then he can be liable.i think that this covers this defendant.
at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that this statement was far too general to support a role enhancement.id.
further,although a sentencing court may sometimes satisfy its obligation to make findings by adopting the factual statements in the defendant presentence report psr,see,united states molina,at,adoption of the psr does not suffice if the psr itself does not state enough facts to permit meaningful appellate review,see,carter,at.in carter,for example,the psr that was adopted by the district court simply made reference to a witness testimony that the defendant supplied drugs to at least dealers.id.we concluded that the psr findings were inadequate,and
