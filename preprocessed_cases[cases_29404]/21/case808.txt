background 
on june,vázquez and four other persons were indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.vázquez voluntarily surrendered to the police on july.all of vázquez pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and received sentences ranging from to months in prison.vázquez contested the charges against him.at trial,various prosecution witnesses testified as to the amounts of cocaine which they had sold or observed being sold to vázquez.witnesses also testified as to the presence of weapons at the drug point that vázquez administered.after a jury trial,vázquez was convicted on the sole count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.the court sentenced vázquez to months in prison based,in part,on the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines.
vázquez appealed his conviction and his sentence to this court.we affirmed vázquez conviction,but remanded his case to the district court for resentencing on the ground that his original sentence was pronounced in violation of booker.
prior to resentencing,vázquez submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court.in the memorandum,he argued that the evidence supported neither the drug quantity that the report attributed to him nor the finding in the report that he could have foreseen the involvement of a weapon in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.vázquez also argued that the court should deviate from the sentencing guidelines range to reduce sentencing disparities between him and his.lastly,vázquez suggested that the nature of his offense and his personal characteristics warranted a sentence below the guidelines range.
the court held a sentencing hearing for vázquez on september.during the hearing,the court stated 
we are not in agreement with the grounds put forth whereby we should depart from a guidelines sentence in this case.let me state for the record that this court,this judge,that it will generally heed to the guidelines in imposing criminal punishment.no doubt some criminal defendants will be disappointed by this result,yet in the long run such an approach may be the best way to develop a fair and consistent sentencing scheme around the country for the benefit of defendants,victims and the public.the congressional view of how to structure that sentencing will surely be informed by how judges conform to the new advisory guideline system.if that discretion is exercised responsibly congress may be inclined to give judges greater flexibility under a new sentencing system.on the other hand if that discretion is abused by sentences that thwart congressional objectives,congress has ample reason to deny us that flexibility.the course,in my opinion today,is to faithfully implement the congressional purposes underlying the sentences format by following the guidelines in all but unusual cases.i find that this is not an unusual case and that the application of the guidelines are reasonable in this case.
the court then sentenced vázquez to months in prison.vázquez now appeals from this sentence.
ii.discussion 
vázquez contests his sentence on two grounds.first,vázquez argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support various aspects of his sentence.second,vázquez contends that his sentence is procedurally defective because the sentencing court failed to adequately explain his sentence and is substantively unreasonable because the court gave improper weight to the sentencing guidelines.
sufficiency of the evidence 
vázquez first argument is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support either the individualized drug quantity or the involvement of weapons that were used to determine his sentence we review a sentencing court findings of fact for clear error and their conclusions of law de novo.united states antonakopoulos,cir.
drug quantity 
vázquez contends that the court erred in calculating the quantity of drugs personally attributable to him for sentencing purposes.in derman united states,cir,we held that 
o nce the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy,the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly.
the judge may determine the drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.united states santos,cir.
vázquez concedes that the sentencing court had the following testimony.first,edwin testified that on approximately occasions,he either sold or purchased one kilogram of cocaine to or from vázquez.second,alberto testified that he had sold some kilos to vázquez brother,which were,in fact,destined for vázquez himself.third,josé borrero feliciano testified that the ceiba drug point,which vázquez managed,sold an eighth of cocaine on a daily basis.vázquez argues that because some of these witnesses prefaced their calculations with the word around or approximately,their testimony is inherently unreliable.however,we have said previously that a sentencing court need not determine an exact amount of drugs,but may instead make a reasoned estimate of the drug quantity attributable to the defendant.united states huddleston,cir.given this testimony,we conclude that the court had ample evidence on which to base its conclusion that at least five kilograms of cocaine were attributable to vázquez.
weapons in the conspiracy 
vázquez also argues that the court had insufficient evidence to support the enhancement under b for possession of a dangerous weapon including a firearm.we have held that a defendant charged with conspiracy is accountable for all reasonably foreseeable conduct undertaken by others in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states bianco,cir.thus,to determine whether the sentencing enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon can be imposed,the sentencing court may consider not only whether vázquez personally possessed a dangerous weapon,but also whether it was reasonably foreseeable that a would possess a gun in furtherance of the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.united states casas,cir.
the sentencing court had the following evidence about the involvement of firearms in the conspiracy.first,alberto testified that he sold firearms to hiram,who was a runner for the drug point managed by vázquez.second,alexander figueroa testified that he gave a shotgun to the person in charge of storing firearms at the drug point.third,david sánchez ortiz,who sold drugs to vázquez through his brother,testified that he regularly carried a firearm for protection.lastly,edwin,who purchased cocaine from vázquez,testified that he also carried a firearm for protection.
we find that this is sufficient evidence to establish the use of firearms to further the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.further,we believe that the evidence presented is sufficient to allow an inference that vázquez,who was the manager of the drug point,was likely aware or could have foreseen that many of the people who worked for him carried or used firearms.as we have noted before,a defendant awareness of the inner workings of a conspiracy in which he is participating frequently will suffice to prove the defendant ability to foresee the acts of coconspirators.united states lacroix,cir.as vázquez has conceded,testimony at trial showed that vázquez allegedly exercised decision making authority to facilitate the delivery of narcotics,was in charge of buying,processing,and distributing the narcotics to the peddlers,and he would be responsible for retrieving the proceeds,verifying the status of the inventory and supervising the operation of the drug point.appellant br.given vázquez intimate involvement in the operations of the dr
