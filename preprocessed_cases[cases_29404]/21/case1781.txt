francis crowley appeals from his conviction,following a jury trial,of attempted aggravated sexual abuse,in violation of a,and his resulting sentence to imprisonment for nine years,three years of supervised release,in restitution payments,and the mandatory special assessment.though crowley raises a number of serious issues,none of his arguments warrants reversal of his conviction or sentence,which are affirmed.
the criminal charges against crowley and a,steven valjato,who was acquitted,arose from an incident at the kings point merchant marine academy in the early morning hours of september.it is undisputed that on that night,crowley and valjato,students at the academy,entered the room of a fellow midshipman,stephanie vincent,and tried to persuade her to engage in sexual acts with them.while the details of what occurred were sharply disputed at trial,vincent testimony,which the jury was fully entitled to credit,supplemented and corroborated in certain respects by the testimony of her roommate and of a friend of crowley who testified to certain arguable admissions by crowley,would have permitted the jury to find the following facts.
on saturday evening,september,vincent,a junior at the academy,and her roommate,jennifer bechtel,attended a keg party at the academy.crowley also attended the party,and he and bechtel at some point smoked some marijuana.vincent and bechtel returned to their dormitory room before midnight and went to sleep.
around sunday morning,vincent awoke to hear the room door open.crowley entered the room,climbed up on vincent desk,and approached her bed,which was raised five or six feet off the floor,supported by the desk and a chest of drawers.crowley began calling,jen,and vincent replied that bechtel was in the other bed.vincent left the room to use a bathroom,and crowley crossed the room to approach bechtel bedside.upon vincent return,she heard crowley unsuccessfully urging bechtel to go party with him and to smoke some crack.at crowley urging,vincent went out into the hallway to talk to crowley and valjato,who were sitting in the hallway.they urged her to party with them,displaying what appeared to be marijuana,but vincent rejected the offer and returned to bed.
shortly thereafter,crowley reentered the room and again climbed up to vincent bedside.after telling her that valjato was angry about vincent rejection of their overtures,and that valjato wanted to perform oral sex on her,crowley tried to climb into vincent bed.a physical struggle ensued,in which crowley pinned vincent to the bed with his upper torso while fondling her breasts.vincent resisted physically and repeatedly demanded that crowley stop and leave,but crowley persisted,telling her that he and valjato wanted to engage in oral sex with her,urging her to agree,and touching her breasts.during this struggle,crowley moved one of his hands inside the waistband of vincent shorts,pushed her up against the wall by the side of her bed while continuing to press her down with his body,gripped her genitals,and attempted to penetrate her vagina with his finger.
at about this point,valjato also entered the room,climbed onto the desk,and added his entreaties,encouraging vincent to come on let us do this.tr.at.although valjato could not get into the bed,his large body blocked any effort by vincent to get away from crowley,who continued to pin her to the bed while trying to pull down her shorts.when vincent continued to resist,valjato eventually punched the bedframe,saying,s he not going to do it,let go.id.at.valjato then threatened vincent never to tell anyone what had happened,or it would be all over for her.id.at.crowley asked vincent if she would charge him with sexual harassment,and she said that if he left the room everything would be fine.
valjato and crowley climbed down from the bed and left,but crowley immediately reentered the room,and once again urged vincent to agree to have oral sex,again saying that valjato was angry at her refusal.when vincent again refused,crowley finally left.about an hour and twenty minutes had elapsed since crowley first entry.vincent reported the incident later that day.
procedural history 
the prosecution of crowley and valjato took some unusual turns.crowley was originally charged in nassau county court with two counts of sexual abuse,a felony punishable by a maximum of seven years imprisonment.see penal law,mckinney.on the eve of trial,the state court dismissed the charges on crowley motion,concluding that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over the academy grounds.
crowley and valjato were then indicted by a federal grand jury in the eastern district of new york and charged in four counts one count each of attempted aggravated sexual abuse in violation of a and attempted sexual abuse in violation of,and two counts of abusive sexual contact in violation of a.these and potentially overlapping offenses have distinct elements.section a,the most relevant for purposes of this opinion,prohibits causing or attempting to cause another person to commit a sexual act specifically defined in as including,as to adults,essentially only genital,oral,anal or digital intercourse by using force against that other person.section prohibits causing or attempting to cause another person to commit one of the defined sexual acts by the use of threats short of threats of death,serious injury,or kidnaping,which are included in a different subsection of the more serious a.finally,prohibits as relevant here the use of force or threats to accomplish sexual contact,defined by more broadly than the limited sexual acts that are the subject of and.
at a jury trial in before the honorable joanna seybert,both crowley and valjato were convicted of the two more serious aggravated sexual abuse charges,and acquitted on the two sexual contact counts.after the trial,however,judge seybert granted defense motions for a new trial,on the ground that the court had erred by refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of voluntary intoxication,and for dismissal of the indictment,on the ground that the indictment was defective in failing to specify the particular sexual act the defendants were accused of attempting.united states crowley,d.
on the government appeal,this court reversed the dismissal of the indictment,holding that the defendants had waived any objection to the indictment lack of specificity by failing to raise the issue before trial,but affirmed the grant of a new trial,holding that the jury indeed should have been instructed on voluntary intoxication.united states crowley,cir.
on remand,the case was first assigned to the honorable thomas platt,who ruled on various motions,and then to the honorable jacob mishler,who presided over the trial.following a jury trial,the jury acquitted valjato of both remaining charges,and acquitted crowley of the lesser charge of attempted sexual abuse,but convicted crowley again of the most serious charge of attempted aggravated sexual abuse under a.after the trial,due to judge mishler illness,the case was again,and on june,the honorable leonard wexler sentenced crowley,primarily to imprisonment for nine years.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
crowley raises five objections to his conviction and sentence.he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the definition of attempt that the court erroneously refused to permit him to vincent on certain matters,principally concerning alleged prior instances of false accusations of various sorts against other midshipmen that the indictment should have been dismissed for lack of specificity and that the district court erred by not departing downward from the sentencing range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines.none of these arguments justifies reversal of the judgment below.
sufficiency of the evidence 
crowley argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he intended to accomplish a sexual act by force.appellant br.at.in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,the defendant faces an uphill battle,united states jones,cir,and bears a very heavy burden,united states rivera,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted,because the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government,with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the verdict,united states amato,cir.the question for this court is not whether it believes that the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,united states brown,cir,but whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,jackson virginia,d emphasis in original.
in support of this claim,crowley points out that the evidence is uncontradicted that he was much stronger than the victim,that he repeatedly asked vincent to allow him and valjato to engage in sexual acts with her,and that he eventually voluntarily abandoned his endeavor and left the room.in effect,he claims that the evidence conclusively demonstrates that he never intended to complete a sexual act by force,because if he had really wanted to,he would have been able to accomplish his goal.the argument is misconceived.
under a,it is a crime to attempt to cause another person to engage in a sexual act by using force against that other person.a.a sexual act,within the meaning of this statute,includes the penetration,however slight,of the genital opening of another by a finger,with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.id.c.to establish an intent to commit an offense,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the intent to commit the crime,and engaged in conduct amounting to a substantial step towards the commission of the crime.united states rosa,cir quoting united states martinez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.putting these various legal rules together in the context of this case,it would suffice for conviction of the offense charged in this case for the government to prove that crowley intended to accomplish digital penetration of vincent genitals by force,with the purpose of sexually arousing either himself or vincent,and actually did take a substantial step toward accomplishing that goal.
substantial step 
taking the issues in reverse order,assuming it was proved that crowley intended to forcibly penetrate vincent,there is no question whatsoever that he engaged in a substantial step toward completing that crime.the substantial step standard,which has been adopted by this court as the test for the wrongful act element of federal attempt crimes,united states stallworth,cir,derives from the american law institute model penal code,where it represented the code drafters proposed solution of the problem of framing criteria to determine when the actor has progressed sufficiently toward his criminal objective to have committed an attempt.model penal code cmt,at.the problem faced by the drafters was that to punish as an attempt every act done to further a criminal purpose,no matter how remote from accomplishing harm,risks punishing individuals for their thoughts alone,before they have committed any act that is dangerous or harmful yet,if the law punished only the very last act necessary to accomplish the criminal result,legal intervention would be delayed to a point at which it may well be too late to prevent harm.the model penal code test was designed to widen the ambit of attempt liability beyond the confusing and conflicting tests developed by common law courts,which generally set the dividing line between criminal attempts and mere preparatory conduct at the point where an actor came dangerously close to the completion of the crime.united states ivic,cir friendly,overruled on other grounds,national org.for women,scheidler,d.as this court has defined it,a substantial step must be something more than mere preparation,yet may be less than the last act necessary before the actual commission of the substantive crime.united states manley,cir.
determining whether particular conduct constitutes a substantial step is so dependent on the particular factual context of each case that,of necessity,there can be no litmus test to guide the reviewing courts.id.at.in this case,however,there can be no doubt that crowley acts,as described by vincent,went far beyond any preparatory step,and sufficed to satisfy virtually any definition of the actus reus wrongful act of attempt.the jury was entitled to find that crowley physically pinned vincent to the bed against the wall,pushed his hand inside her shorts,and put his hand on her vagina with a groping,gripping type of action.tr.at.indeed,vincent expressly testified that crowley tried but was not able to insert his finger,because she was resisting.id.it is difficult to understand what further act crowley could have performed toward the goal of forced penetration,short of actual completion of the crime.the evidence was thus sufficient to establish that crowley actions met and exceeded what is necessary to constitute a substantial step toward the completion of a forcible sexual act as defined in the statute.
with respect to the mens rea wrongful state of mind element,crowley presents a closer question for the finder of fact,but no more difficult an issue for us.to satisfy the mental element of attempt,the government must prove that the defendant intended to engage in conduct constituting a this case,that crowley intended to commit a sexual act by force.crowley argues that his words as reported by vincent sought even begged or pleaded for her permission to engage in sexual acts,and that,had he truly intended to compel her submission,he would have persisted with physical force which,he contends,would ultimately have succeeded.these are arguments that a jury could reasonably consider in assessing whether crowley really intended to go through with a sexual act as defined in the statute against vincent will,or whether he planned to desist short of such acts if she continued to deny him permission to go further.
but the question of crowley intention is primarily one of inference from his actions,and thus one especially suited for resolution by a trial jury.see cheek united states,d united states brandt,cir.the state of a person mind is rarely susceptible to proof by direct evidence,and usually must be inferred from evidence of his or her acts,but it is no less a question of fact for that.see united states chestnut,cir.here,vincent testified that crowley placed his hand on her vagina and tried to insert his finger,but was prevented by her physical resistance.all of the sexual contact that crowley did vincent breasts,pushing his hand inside her pants,and grabbing her committed,according to the victim testimony,over her express verbal objection and against her physical resistance,by means of physical force.the jury could legitimately reject crowley claim that he would inevitably have succeeded if he really intended to use force,given that the awkward space in which the struggle was going elevated bunk to which crowley only had access by climbing on a helped to neutralize any advantage in physical strength he might have had,and thus facilitated vincent determined resistance.crowley intention was a genuine issue of fact for the jury to resolve,and it resolved the question against him.the evidence was sufficient to justify its conclusion.
our assessment of this issue is bolstered by precedent.in united states hourihan,cir,this court affirmed a conviction for aggravated sexual abuse in violation of a based on attempted forced fellatio,where the defendant,over his victim objections,forcibly kissed her and rubbed her breasts,then attempted to physically force her to a kneeling position in proximity to his exposed penis,but desisted from his efforts in order to answer a telephone call.contrary to crowley arguments,we see no meaningful distinction between this case and hourihan.crowley,like hourihan,used physical force not only to make sexual contact with his victim over her objections,but also to force himself into position to accomplish a sexual act.hourihan came no closer to accomplishing his goal of intercourse than crowley did to accomplishing his of digital penetration.and hourihan,like crowley,argued that he obviously did not attempt to force his victim into a sexual act because,if he had wanted to force her,he could have,given his size and strength as compared to hers.id.at yet this court gave short shrift to his claim of insufficiency,holding that the jury could easily have found,on these facts,both that hourihan had the necessary intent to compel a sexual act by force,and that he had taken a sufficiently substantial step toward accomplishing that goal.id.the same result follows here 
one further word is appropriate.crowley argument that a jury could reasonably find that he voluntarily left the room without persisting further in the use of force suggests a claim not that he never intended to compel a sexual act,but rather that he at some point renounced the crime and abandoned that intent.american courts have historically divided over whether renunciation or abandonment of an attempt,after the defendant actions have progressed far enough to establish liability,can ever constitute a defense.see model penal code cmt,at nn.collecting cases.the model penal code definition of attempt includes an affirmative defense of voluntary renunciation,which applies only when the actor abandon s his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission,under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose,with the further stipulation that renunciation is not complete and voluntary if it is motivated by the unanticipated difficulty of accomplishing the objective,or by a desire to avoid detection or to defer the attempt to a different crime or another victim.id.most recently revised codes and proposals adopt a renunciation defense substantially similar to the model code.id.cmt,at collecting statutes 
this court has never directly addressed whether such a defense is included within the concept of attempt incorporated by congress without definition into many criminal statutes,though it has frequently cited the model penal code analysis as persuasive in other respects,including in adopting the substantial step test itself.see,ivic,at united states jackson,cir stallworth,at.the only other circuits that have formally addressed the question have rejected the defense as a matter of federal law.see united states shelton,cir united states bussey,cir.
but it is unnecessary to decide the question here.crowley neither sought a jury instruction on this subject in the district court nor raised the argument here,and at oral argument he expressly disavowed reliance on any renunciation defense.moreover,the facts here are hardly compelling ones on which to advance such a legal argument.crowley came very near to completing his goal,and as the american law institute notes,much of the argument supporting a renunciation defense may prove unsatisfactory when the actor has proceeded far toward the commission of the contemplated crime.model penal code cmt,at.even if the model penal code renunciation provision applied,the jury might well have concluded that crowley attempt was defeated not by a change of heart,but by vincent successful resistance and by crowley fears that further efforts as the day began to break would lead to detection.under these circumstances,crowley failure even to raise the issue suggests a reasonable strategic choice that the defense was better off arguing that crowley never had a criminal intent,rather than making the in federal law,and perhaps lacking in jury he began with a criminal purpose but abandoned it.
in short,the evidence in this case was more than sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find both the physical and mental elements of aggravated sexual assault by means of attempted forcible digital penetration 
ii.jury instructions 
crowley also argues that the jury was improperly instructed concerning the definition of attempt.appellant br.at.judge mishler instructions correctly stated,at least twice,that in order to find crowley guilty of an attempt,the jury would have to find that he had an intent to engage in criminal conduct,and that he took a substantial step toward the commission of the substantive offense.the essence of crowley claim is that judge mishler committed error by failing further to define the meaning of substantial step by advising the jury that an action is a substantial step only if it strongly corroborate s his criminal intent.id.at.
the government attempts to block this argument at the outset by arguing that crowley failed to preserve it by proper objection to the district court proposed charge.crowley argues that he made the same argument in the district court that he makes here,both submitting his proposed instruction in writing and renewing his request at the charge conference.
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure permits parties to file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests and also provides that n o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.as the government correctly points out,the supreme court has held that a request for an instruction before the jury retires does not preserve an objection to the instruction actually given by the court.jones united states,d.similarly,this court has repeatedly held that a party who has requested an instruction that has not been given is not relieved of the requirement that he state distinctly his objection to the instruction that is given,united states friedman,cir internal quotation marks omitted,noting that t he separate references in rule to charge requests and to objections clearly indicate that a charge request does not relieve a party of the obligation to make a specific objection,and that a requested charge is not a distinct objection to a charge adopted by the district court,id.at.see united states wong,cir united states locascio,cir united states tannenbaum,cir.
this rule may appear harsh or counterintuitive to lawyers who believe that a requested charge should adequately alert a trial judge to a party substantive legal position.the distinction between requests to charge and specific objections at a charging conference is significant,however.requests to charge,often submitted in advance of trial or in its very early stages,assist the court in preparing a draft of jury instructions,and in understanding the legal issues that might come up during a trial.but events and positions often change during a trial,and language that may have appeared desirable or not to the judge early in the trial,when the judge may have limited understanding of the evidence to be presented or the parties contentions,or that may have seemed important or desirable to the parties before the evidence has crystallized and the arguments are ripe for presentation to the jury,may come to appear in a very different light by the end of the trial.thus,when reviewing requests to charge,a judge may conclude that particular language is not very important,but she might be persuaded to change her opinion if the proponent of the language reiterates the request by means of a focused objection to the judge proposed charge when the instructions are being finalized.similarly,even if a party took a particular position in requests to charge submitted,so many events at trial could lead the party to change its position that a judge may reasonably treat such requests as abandoned if the party does not press the point by means of a focused objection to the judge proposed charge at the proper time.
accordingly,the mere fact that a defendant submitted his proposed language as part of a requested charge does not in itself preserve the point for appeal.to determine whether crowley waived or preserved his argument,we must turn to the charging conference,of which the parties present rather different accounts.the government argues that crowley did not merely forfeit his claim by failing to register a specific objection which would leave open the possibility of review for plain error,but waived it entirely,while crowley contends that he raised a sufficiently specific objection to preserve the point.
the discussion at the charging conference was brief.judge mishler opened the proceedings by reading the defendants proposed charge on attempt.that charge began by stating,in exactly the language that would ultimately be read to the jury,that the elements of attempt are one,an intent to engage in criminal conduct,and two,the performance of acts constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the substantive offense.tr.at.the request went on,however,to modify the words substantial step by adding the description,which strongly corroborates the actor criminal intent.id.the proposed instruction then added two more paragraphs further defining or describing the meaning of substantial step.
the government then objected to the proposed instruction to the extent that it went beyond simply stating the requirement of a substantial step,and judge mishler agreed,noting that this court in manley had adopted the model penal code standard,that the requisite elements of attempt are an intent to engage in criminal conduct and the performance of acts which constitute a substantial step toward the commission of the substantive offense.id.at quoting manley,at.valjato lawyer then stated,that where i quoted,judge that what my letter quoted,those exact words from the second circuit opinion.id.this comment appeared to refer to the language just quoted by the judge,which the judge had in effect agreed to read to the jury,though portions of the remainder of the proposed charge,which the judge declined to give,also closely paraphrase language from manley 
judge mishler proceeded to distinguish between language in appellate opinions that discusses the law and language that ought to be included in jury instructions but there a difference between the second circuit in a discussion of the elements and instructing the district court to charge in the words of the second circuit.id.the judge stated his view that in the manley case this court was not intending to instruct the district court,and he refuse d to charge as proposed.id.at.instead,he reiterated his intention to state the two elements of attempt,intent and substantial step,in essentially the words stated by this court in manley and proposed by the defendants.judge mishler then specifically asked,any objections to that valjato lawyer said,we take that,judge,and crowley counsel was silent.id.at.
this dialogue illustrates why rule requires more than a request to charge.judge mishler apparently discarded the defendants proposed explanatory language not because he felt it misstated the law,but because he thought the language was unnecessary and not required by this court decisions.he gave the defendants every opportunity to object,but rather than explaining why the additional verbiage was important to them,or even baldly stating that they objected to the failure to give it,the only defendant to respond simply accepted the judge proposal.on this record,no district judge could be expected to understand that crowley believed,as he now professes to do,that the charge the court intended to give was egregiously incorrect.appellant br.at.
the government,like crowley,misreads the significance of the exchange discussed above.while crowley clearly failed to object to the omission of his proposed further elaboration on the meaning of substantial step,thus forfeiting that issue on appeal,it can not fairly be said that he invited the charge or affirmatively waived his position.the defense did seek the language crowley now claims was essential crowley neither approved nor objected to the judge proposal and even valjato comment can best be read as acquiescence in the judge ruling rather than approval or invitation of it.there is thus no basis to find that crowley intentional ly relinquish ed a known right,foreclosing limited review of the charge for plain error affecting substantial rights.see united states olano,d.
accordingly,since crowley failed to comply with rule by objecting to the omission of his proposed language,stating distinctly the matter to which he object ed and the grounds of the objection,the court may review the charge only for plain error.
plain error 
despite crowley somewhat overheated argument,the instructions given by the district court can not be characterized as plain error.for an error to be a plain error or a defect affecting substantial rights.b,it must be a clear or obvious deviation from current law that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.olano,at.even when an error is plain and affects substantial rights,a reviewing court should only exercise its remedial discretion under rule b if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in the first place,nothing actually stated in the charge was erroneous at all.the court succinctly and correctly defined the elements of aggravated sexual abuse,correctly noting that the offense includes both knowingly causing a person to engage in a sexual act which the court later correctly defined for the jury by force,and attempting to do so.the court then further defined attempt,as set forth above,correctly describing its elements.
nor is it by any means obvious that the failure to gloss the meaning of substantial step,let alone the failure to use the particular words now demanded by crowley,constitutes error.as crowley correctly points out,this court has frequently cited the language of the model penal code,which suggests that a substantial step is one that is strongly corroborative of the actor criminal purpose.model penal code.see sui ins,cir ivic,at jackson,at stallworth,at.a district court certainly could not be faulted for using this language to define substantial step for a jury.
but this court has never remotely suggested that it is mandatory for a trial court to use this language in instructing a jury,or indeed that a trial court is required to go beyond the perfectly understandable english word substantial itself.the model penal code itself does not use the strongly corroborative language as a definition of substantial,or suggest that this language should be quoted to juries,but rather uses the phrase in instructing courts as to what kinds of acts may be held to be sufficient to constitute substantial steps.model penal code.that language is part of a section of the code that enumerates specific acts which,if they meet the strongly corroborative test,shall not be held insufficient as a matter of law to constitute an attempt.id.as judge friendly expressly noted,this entire section was intended for use by the judge not in charging the jury but in deciding whether to send a case to it.ivic,at.
judge friendly also recognized that the strongly corroborative language is not the easiest language for juries to grasp while finding it difficult to improve upon that formulation as a conceptual matter,he pointed out that this is not language easy of application by a jury or even by an appellate court.id.at.judge sand recommended instruction,the acts of a person who intends to commit a crime will constitute an attempt where the acts themselves clearly indicate an intent to willfully commit a crime,seems to state the same concept in easier language.see leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions,inst,at see also pattern criminal jury instruction,sixth circuit stating that defendant conduct must strongly confirm intent to commit the crime.moreover,while the substantial step formula is now the prevailing standard in american law,the penal laws of many states that have adopted it have omitted the following section,which contains the strongly corroborative language.model penal code cmt,at.those jurisdictions appear to have believed that the phrase substantial step required no further elaboration.
it is thus difficult to conclude that the language now demanded by crowley is essential to conveying the meaning of substantial step to a jury.at any rate,there is no basis for concluding that the omission of any particular definition of substantial was so obviously erroneous that the district court should have recognized it as error even in the absence of proper objection by the defense.
finally,crowley can make no showing that he was prejudiced by the omission of the definition from the charge,still less that the alleged error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.quoting united states atkinson.the purpose of the substantial step requirement is to distinguish between merely preparatory acts and those that progress so far as to be justly punished as wicked and dangerous attempts to complete the crime.on this record,there was little ambiguity about whether crowley acts constituted a substantial step toward accomplishing forcible digital penetration.as discussed above,his acts progressed to within a literal inch of completion.whatever doubt a jury might have been prepared to entertain about crowley true purpose,there can be no doubt that the acts he committed strongly corroborate the government charge that he intended to accomplish a sexual act by force.there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have been more likely to find crowley not guilty if the judge had glossed the substantial step requirement with the definition proposed by the defense.
there was thus no error,much less plain error requiring reversal,in the jury instructions.
crowley next argues that the district court erred by unduly restricting his efforts to vincent.he asserts that he should have been permitted to explore two areas in before the jury allegations that vincent had made false accusations of various kinds against other students,and questions about a battery of psychological tests to which she was subjected by the academy.appellant br.at.the district court rulings on both subjects were within its broad discretion to control.
alleged false accusations 
vincent credibility was obviously a critical issue at trial,and the defense duly attacked it,not only by but also by offering testimony from shannon pender,who had attended the academy at the same time as vincent.pender testified that she knew and disliked vincent,that before the incident at issue in this case she had discussed vincent reputation with a number of male and female fellow students,as well as with officers who were commanders and administrators of the academy,and that vincent had a reputation for untruthfulness.she also testified that vincent had made various other accusations against that had been proven false.tr.at.
the defense had attempted to vincent with respect to the claim that she had made such false accusations,but the trial court did not permit questioning before the jury on this subject.rather,the court permitted defense counsel to conduct a voir dire examination of vincent outside the jury presence.during that examination,defense counsel were allowed to direct vincent attention to certain named students or certain particular incidents,and to ask vincent whether she had ever lie d about what happened in those instances or falsely accuse d the students involved.tr.at.in each case,vincent denied lying or making false accusations.counsel were generally not permitted,however,to ask questions that explored in any detail what vincent had told the authorities in these cases or what the results of any official inquiry had been.after hearing this testimony,judge mishler declined to permit on this subject before the jury.crowley attacks this decision as clearly wrong,appellant br.at,and argues that the restriction on denied him his right to confront his accuser,guaranteed by the sixth amendment.
b prohibits a party from presenting extrinsic evidence of s pecific instances of the conduct of a witness,for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness credibility,unless that conduct was the subject of a criminal conviction.the rule,however,permits the witness to be examined about such specific conduct,in the discretion of the court,if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.b.similarly.b allows the admission of testimony regarding prior bad acts of a witness,so long as such evidence is not offered in order to show action in conformity therewith.
as this court has repeatedly emphasized,however,t rial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.delaware van arsdall,d.only when this broad discretion is abused will we reverse a trial court decision to restrict.united states,cir.united states rahman,cir see also united states flaharty,cir united states griffith,cir.further,under rule,the district court may exclude even relevant evidence if it finds that the probative value of the testimony is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.flaharty,at.
unlike the questions about prior violent crimes,which this court held were properly precluded in flaharty,the questions defendants proposed to ask,which related to alleged instances of false accusation,were certainly relevant to the witness credibility.and defense counsel represented,and later demonstrated via pender testimony,that they had a good faith basis for their proposed questioning.nevertheless,although we might have taken a different course in the position of the trial judge,we can not hold that judge mishler abused his discretion in proceeding as he did.the voir dire examination established that vincent would deny making false accusations or lying in connection with academy investigations of other students.since the defense would be precluded by rule b from attempting to refute vincent testimony by offering extrinsic evidence concerning the incidents in question,the only evidence before the jury on the subject would have been vincent denial of falsehood.see united states perrone,cir see also jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,at to ed.
allowing before the jury would thus have produced little of probative value.certainly,the trial court was well within its discretion in not allowing any broader inquiry into the nature of what vincent had told the authorities and what the results of their investigations to the extent vincent even knew of them had been.such inquiry would at best have produced confusing and distracting sideshows regarding the facts of controversies completely unrelated to the charges against crowley at trial,and was properly precluded.it was thus also within the trial judge broad discretion in regulating to conclude that since the most that would be permitted was questioning about whether vincent had lied,to which the defendants would get negative answers,the prejudicial impact of engendering speculation about the subject outweighed the minimal probative value of permitting the jury to evaluate vincent demeanor during the question and answer.
we are further bolstered in this view by the fact that judge mishler,like judge seybert and the state court judge before him,had conducted an in camera review of vincent academy file,and found no evidence of any conclusion by academy officials that vincent had made false accusations.govt.br.at.judge seybert,after her review,found that the reports made by vincent in the matters in question were never determined to be fallacious or wholly unsubstantiated.at most the conclusions reached by academy officials were equivocal,thus the records would not support pursuant to rule b.tr.of june,hr g,at.the records thus support the independent conclusions of both judge seybert and judge mishler that permitting the defense to suggest that vincent had lied to academy officials would be more prejudicial than probative 
psychological tests 
crowley second claim of improper limitation on may be disposed of more quickly.crowley claims that the trial court erred in preventing of linda bulone,the academy medical administrative assistant,who testified that vincent called her on september to report crowley assault.the defense sought to examine bulone conc
