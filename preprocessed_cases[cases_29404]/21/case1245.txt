defendant appellant swahili johnson appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge granting his motion for a sentence reduction under c,pursuant to amendment of the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines.johnson challenges the district court order reducing his sentence based on the court determination that it was unable to vary below the revised applicable guidelines range based on guidelines.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court did not err in declining to apply a downward variance to sentence johnson below the reduced guidelines range.under of the guidelines,the district court did not have discretion to apply the variance to which johnson asserts he was entitled.in spite of johnson arguments to the contrary,bound the district court,was a valid exercise of the sentencing commission commission authority,and did not violate the administrative procedure act apa requirements for the promulgation of formal rules.
accordingly,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
on november,defendant swahili johnson was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.he pled guilty to distributing fifty grams or more of crack cocaine on june.the district court formally accepted johnson guilty plea on june,and sentenced him on november.at sentencing,the court determined that johnson total guidelines offense level was,that his prior offenses placed him in criminal history category vi,and accordingly that his guidelines range was to months.the district court then granted a downward variance from the bottom of the guidelines range based on johnson personal history,imposing a custodial sentence of months imprisonment.
on october,the district court reduced johnson sentence pursuant to the retroactive application of amendment to the guidelines.we have detailed the history and validity of amendment in united states savoy,cir per curiam.in essence,amendment addressed the disparities in prior sentenci ngs of defendants convicted of certain crimes involving crack cocaine,as compared to defendants convicted of similar crimes involving powder cocaine.the amendment,effective november,reduced by two levels the base offense level associated with each enumerated quantity of crack cocaine.savoy,at see also.c,amd.
thus,as a result of this first reduction,johnson offense level fell from to,resulting in an applicable guidelines range of to months.applying the same ten percent downward variance it had at johnson original sentencing,the district court determined that johnson sentence should be reduced to months.
johnson appealed this sentence reduction,arguing,inter alia,that the district court failed to recognize its discretion to vary even further downward from the applicable sentencing range.see united states erskine,app x,cir.we affirmed the district court calculation of this first reduction.id.at.
in november,johnson moved pro se for a further sentence reduction pursuant to c,based on the retroactive application of amendment to the guidelines.the district court then appointed counsel to represent johnson in connection with this motion.
on february,johnson counsel filed a new motion to reduce johnson sentence under c pursuant to amendment,which was effective as of november.see.c,amd.amendment,much like amendment before it,was designed to address the disparity between the guidelines treatment of crack cocaine and powder cocaine.to accomplish this goal,amendment further reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses under of the guidel ines 
amendment was made retroactive when it was added to the list of guidelines amendments under which a defendant could move for a reduced sentence.see,app,amd.the list of amendments allowing for such retroactive reductions appears in subsection c of the policy statement at of the guidelines,which generally governs sentence reductions resulting from guidelines amendments.see united states berberena,cir.prior to november,permitted defendants who had originally received a departure or variance to receive a comparable departure or variance in the context of sentence reductions under c.see b.as amended,however,generally prohibits courts from reducing a defendant term of imprisonment under c to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range b a.the sole exception to this rule applies to defendants who originally received a downward departure as a result of providing substantial assistance to the government.see.b b 
based on amendment,johnson argued that his offense level under should be reduced from to,making his guidelines range to months.johnson further asserted that the district court should continue to apply the downward variance based on his personal history that it had applied both when sentencing him initially and when reducing his sentence in,thus making his second reduced sentence months imprisonment.
on february,the government filed a submission with the district court indicating that it did not oppose a reduction in johnson sentence to months,but noting that the amended version of,effective november,did not authorize the district court to reduce johnson sentence based on a downward variance to anything less than months imprisonment.
on february,the district court granted johnson motion insofar as it granted him a reduction.it reduced johnson sentence to months but denied his request to apply the ten percent downward variance it had twice previously applied.the court determined that b a only permitted it to further reduce johnson sentence where a downward departure had been granted in the original sentence based on the defendant substantial assistance to the government,pursuant to guidelines.because johnson had not originally been granted such a departure,the district court reasoned that the limitation in b a now applie d to him.ja.the district court noted also that the second circuit had determined that was binding on district courts.see dillon united states.united states savoy,cir.the district court thus concluded it was not authorized to sentence johnson below the amended guideline range of to months.ja.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,johnson makes three arguments as to why the district court erred in determining that it could not apply a downward variance so as to reduce his sentence under amendment based on his personal history and characteristics,each of which attacks the validity of.first,he argues that the commission amendment to both exceeds the commission authority and goes beyond the directives of the sentencing reform act sra,et,et,and thus can not bind the district court.he bases this argument on the assertion that because permits certain retroactive sentence reductions while also limiting the court ability to apply most departures or variances,it interferes with the structure of the sentence.appellant br.at.second,johnson argues that the commission amendment of guidelines violates principles,and therefore is invalid.finally,johnson asserts that the commission failed to follow the procedural requirements for promulgating formal rules set forth by the apa when it amended of the guidelines,rendering that policy statement invalid.
several of our sister circuits have already addressed many or all of the issues that johnson now raises see,berberena,united states anderson,cir see also united states horn,cir addressing similar arguments as to guidelines amendment united states fox,cir addressing similar arguments as to the prior version of.for reasons substantively akin to those set forth by these circuits,we hold today that of the guidelines is valid and binding on district courts.
we address each of johnson arguments in turn.
standard of review 
we generally review a district court c onclusions of law,including those involving constitutional questions,de novo.in re terrorist bombings of embassies in africa,cir quoting united states.fell,cir.sentencing issues not raised before the district court due to oversight are normally reviewed for plain error.see united states keppler,cir.
the parties disagree as to which standard of review applies in this case.johnson asserts that because he raised the general issue of the application of b during the second sentence reduction proceedings,a harmless error standard should apply.see united states villafuerte,cir finding plain error standard applicable only where a defendant failed entirely to raise an issue below.the government argues that plain error review is the applicable standard,since johnson argument that is invalid or was not presented to the district court,and thus has been raised for the first time on appeal.
we decline to decide which standard of review applies in this case,as we ultimately conclude that,even under de novo review,johnson arguments do not undermine the validity or binding nature of,and thus the district court properly determined that prevented it from further reducing johnson sentence.
ii.commission authority 
johnson first argues that the amendment to of the guidelines exceeds the authority of the commission and contradicts the purpose of the sra,and thus is not binding on the district court.he asserts that the district court therefore erred in holding that it did not have the authority to apply a downward variance so as to impose a sentence below the amended guidelines range.
while a district court generally may not reduce a term of imprisonment once it is imposed,see cortorreal united states,cir,congress has authorized retroactive reductions in limited circumstances,as set forth in c.the sra,in turn,allows the commission to determine the extent to which guidelines amendments addressing disparities in sentences,such as amendment,may apply retroactively.see u.
the supreme court has held that a sentence reduction under.c does not implicate the sixth amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,and thus provisions in the guidelines pursuant to which a defendant may seek a reduction under c may bind a district court.dillon.at.thus,the types of sentence reductions provided for in amendments such as amendment are not considered resentencings,such that the sixth amendment concerns identified in booker do not apply.see id.in united states savoy,we specifically held that,if a defendant was originally sentenced within the applicable guidelines range,booker and its progeny do not permit district courts to disregard b a by reducing the defendant sentence below the amended guidelines range at.such amendments therefore are considered valid and binding on district courts.see id.
section was enacted and amended pursuant to the power granted to the commission in a and u.see notice of final action regarding amendment to policy statement.at.thus,congress has delegated to the commission the power it exercised both in creating and amending.see berberena,at.amendment establishes that certain defendants convicted of offenses involving crack cocaine are entitled to retroactive reductions in their offense levels as set forth in,and thus a reduction in their applicable sentence ranges.however,these reductions are not without parameters.the version of provides that under amendment,a sentence generally may not be reduced to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision of this subsection.b a.
johnson argues that exceeds the commission authority under the sra by generally prohibiting district courts from departures or variances imposed at a defendant original sentencing hearing this argument is without merit.
the commission is authorized to permit a retroactive reduction in a defendant sentence under c,which provides that in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the commission pursuant to o,upon motion of the defendant the court may reduce the term of imprisonment when the commission chooses to retroactively reduce the applicable guideline range for a sentence,congress has directed that it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.u.in issuing such retroactive reductions,the commission is directed to do so via binding policy statement,as it has done in.see a 
accordingly,the commission has followed the directives of.u,and thus acted permissibly congress has given it the authority to retroactively reduce applicable guidelines ranges for sentences such as johnson sentence here.o see also dillon.at.it must do so by establishing in what circumstances and by what amount a retroactive guideline range reduction would be appropriate,and then issue such retroactive reductions via binding policy statements.a,u.in amending to allow for retroactive sentence reductions pursuant to amendment,while prohibiting further reductions based on certain variances or departures,the commission has done precisely that which it was permitted,and congressionally encouraged,to do.johnson arguments to the contrary are unavailing.
iii.separation of powers 
johnson next argues that the commission amendment to of the guidelines is invalid because it violates constitutional principles.johnson advances two arguments in this regard the commission ability to issue binding policy statements constitutes the exercise of legislative authority without the requisite accountability to congress and the binding nature of infringes upon the exercise of judicial authority of courts conducting sentencings.
legislative authority 
johnson argues that congress failed to set forth an intelligible principle to guide the commission issuance of binding policy statements regarding retroactive sentence reductions,and thus such policy statements violate principles.the constitution provides that a ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states,art.i.to preserve the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution,the doctrine establishes that congress generally can not delegate its legislative power to another branch.mistretta united states,quoting field clark.however,congress may delegate its legislative power so long as it provides by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.id.at quoting hampton,united states,u.emphasis added,alteration in original.the supreme court has recognized that such intelligible principles may be broad in scope,as in our increasingly complex society,replete with ever changing and more technical problems,congress simply can not do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.id.
johnson asserts that concerns are implicated by the commission amendment of because nothing restrain s the commission if it chooses to issue binding policy statements as part of the decision to make an amendment retroactive.appellant br at.the argument that promulgation of the amendment to indicates the commission has engaged in unbridled and constitutionally invalid legislative authority by enacting that policy statement is ultimately unavailing.
the supreme court has held that the sra sets forth more than merely an intelligible principle or minimal standards.mistretta,at.because only an intelligible principle is required,t he threshold for a constitutionally valid delegation is much lower than was the delegation in mistretta.berberena,at citing united states garcia,cir.every circuit to have considered this question has concluded that the sra satisfies the threshold of setting forth an intelligible principle because it limit s and inform s the commission on how it must exercise its delegated authority.berberena,at internal quotation marks omitted accord anderson,at horn,at garcia,at.we join these circuits in holding that both a and u sufficiently limit and inform the commission on how it must exercise its delegated authority.
in u,congress articulated the scope of the commission power to retroactively reduce sentences by empowering it to specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for an offense may be reduced.u.in a congress prescribed the specific tool po
