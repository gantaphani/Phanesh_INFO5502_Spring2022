efrain santiago burgos appeals the month prison sentence imposed by the district court after he pled guilty to a drug conspiracy charge.santiago argues that the district court made a prejudicial sentencing guideline calculation error and improperly imposed his sentence consecutive to one he received as a result of a conviction tangentially related to the relevant drug conspiracy.the government concedes the guideline miscalculation point but disputes the consecutive sentence error.it also argues that any error is nevertheless for naught because santiago plea agreement included a waiver of appeal.santiago disputes the applicability of the waiver.we hold as follows the waiver does not bar santiago appeal the consecutive sentence was not improper the guideline error requires remand for resentencing.
in august,santiago and dozens of other people were indicted on multiple drug conspiracy counts.the indictment alleged,inter alia,that santiago served as a runner,whose duties included providing drugs to sellers and collecting drug proceeds from them.previously,in july a time during which the drug conspiracy was alleged to be active santiago was sentenced to a short prison term and three years of supervised release for assaulting a drug enforcement agency informant.the supervised release eventually was revoked as a result of the current charges.
in april,santiago pled guilty to one count of the present indictment,which charged him with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine,fifty grams of cocaine base,one kilogram of heroin,kilograms of marijuana,oxycodone and xanax,all within feet of a school or public housing complex the government and santiago executed a plea agreement which stipulated that santiago would be accountable for at least two but less than kilograms of cocaine.the parties further agreed that santiago sentencing guideline calculation would begin with a base offense level bol of to be increased by two levels because of the protected location and by two more levels for his role in the offense finally,if santiago accepted responsibility for his crimes,he would receive a deduction these stipulations yielded an total offense level tol of,a result which is not part of this appeal.
the plea agreement contained no stipulation with respect to santiago criminal history category chc,but the parties agreed to certain limits on the parties permissible arguments about the appropriate sentence.they agreed that,if santiago chc was determined to be i,he could ask for a sentence as low as months or the low end of the applicable guideline range,whichever was higher.the government,meanwhile was permitted to recommend a sentence of months if santiago chc was i or ii.a chc of iii or higher would result in a recommendation at the low end of the applicable guideline range neither side was permitted to recommend a sentence shorter than months.
especially relevant to this appeal,the plea agreement contained the following waiver provision the defendant hereby agrees that if this honorable court accepts this plea agreement and sentences him according to its terms,conditions and recommendations,defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgement sic and sentence in this case.
after santiago plea and before sentencing,a presentence investigation report psr was provided to the district court.santiago chc is the fulcrum of the parties dispute.the psr first saddled santiago with two criminal history points for his informant assault conviction.see b.two additional points were added because the instant offense was committed,in part,while santiago was under a term of supervised release for the informant assault conviction.id.d.the four criminal history points yielded a chc of iii.
the district court sustained santiago objection to the two criminal history points for the prior conviction,id.b,on the basis that the assault on the informant was an overt act within the conspiracy.see id.cmt.excluding from consideration of criminal history sentences that are for conduct that is part of the instant offense.siding with the government,the district court denied santiago objection to the two additional points related to his commission of the instant offense while on supervised release.see id.d.halving the total of points from four to two dropped santiago into chc ii,resulting in a sentencing range of months.the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom end of that range and ordered it to run consecutively to the sentence he received on the informant assault case after his supervised release was revoked.
on appeal,santiago challenges the two criminal history points assessed under d and the district court imposition of a consecutive,rather than a concurrent,sentence.for its part,the government concedes the criminal history error,observing that the same rationale that the district court employed to deduct two criminal history points under section b that the assault was an overt act within the conspiracy to which santiago was pleading guilty should apply to the two points assessed under section d.we accept this concession and say no more about the issue.the government additionally maintains that there was no error in the consecutive sentence.but the government further argues that,regardless of any error below,the appellate waiver provision of the plea agreement altogether precludes santiago appeal.we turn first to the waiver.
the government argues that even though the court erred in its guideline calculation by sentencing santiago according to chc ii two points rather than chc i zero points,the sentence nevertheless met the waiver requirement that it fall within the agreement terms,conditions and recommendations because the agreement allowed a month sentence for either chc i or chc ii.we disagree.
a waiver of appeal is valid if it was knowingly and voluntarily executed,and if enforcement would not result in a miscarriage of justice if enforced.sotirion united states,cir united states teeter,cir.but e ven a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.united states mccoy,cir see also united states okoye,cir,cert.denied,d united states acosta roman,cir.
here,santiago does not claim that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary.but we still must determine whether this appeal falls within the waiver scope.to do so,we rely on basic contract interpretation principles,construing the agreement where possible to give effect to every term and phrase,okoye,at,and construing any ambiguities in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed,id.citing united states fern√°ndez cabrera,cir.
the government argues that santiago month sentence was expressly contemplated by the plea agreement,and thus his claim falls well within the waiver.we see it differently,however.while the agreement certainly did not entitle santiago to any particular sentence,and a month sentence was possible under either chc i where it would be in the middle of the sentencing range or ii where it would be at the low end of the sentencing range,the district court chc error deprived santiago of an express right that he otherwise did possess under the agreement to argue for an month sentence.because the agreement limited santiago request to the greater of months or the lower end of the applicable guideline range,once the district court erroneously settled on chc ii with a sentence of months,santiago was deprived of one of the benefits of the plea bargain the possibility of a sentence at the low end of the correct guideline range.see united states saxena,cir observing that a defendant who fulfills his part of a plea agreement is entitled to the benefit of his bargain.
here,santiago sentence recommendation was highly dependent on the chc.specifically,he could argue for an month sentence if his criminal history category is in fact,his chc was i or at least should have been,and he was not permitted to so argue.we therefore find that he was not sentence d according to the agreement terms,conditions,and recommendations and the waiver is therefore inapplicable to this appeal.mccoy,at finding waiver inapplicable where district court misappli
