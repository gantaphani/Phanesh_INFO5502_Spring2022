boston police officers tom joyce and ed fleming stopped wilkerson after he made an illegal.during the stop,the officers learned he was driving with a suspended license.officer joyce asked wilkerson to step out of the vehicle,but wilkerson refused.joyce and wilkerson struggled for the door while officer fleming called for.wilkerson then drove off and a chase ensued.
the car chase ended when wilkerson abandoned his vehicle and took off on foot.from about thirty to forty feet away,the officers saw wilkerson holding his right side around his waist area.joyce informed his partner,eddie,be careful,i think he has a gun.joyce then broadcast over the radio,he reaching for his budge,meaning that wilkerson was reaching for the waistband area where he thought wilkerson had a gun.the officers reported that wilkerson continued to hold his right waist area while they followed him,but they did not actually see a gun.
the officers pursued wilkerson onto hartwell street.officer joyce testified at trial that he was about sixty feet away when he saw wilkerson turn into an alley between houses at and hartwell on the north side of the street.officer fleming testified that he had just turned onto hartwell when he saw the same thing.as wilkerson turned into the alley,joyce slowed down and peered down the driveway on the south side of hartwell,between and hartwell,to see if wilkerson would come back the opposite way.he did not.when joyce reached the alley,he saw wilkerson climbing over a six or fence,no longer clutching his waist area.joyce did not see anything in wilkerson hands or belt as he lowered himself over the fence.joyce did not attempt to scale the fence,but instead turned around and ran up the driveway.there joyce saw wilkerson running west through the backyards toward cheney street.officers from another police unit arrested wilkerson when they caught him running at a slow jog on maple street near cheney.
after wilkerson arrest,officers were ordered to retrace the route of the foot chase looking for anything he might have discarded.another officer accompanied by joyce found a gun and grams of crack cocaine in the alley between and hartwell.the items were described as clean and dry and lying on top of damp,dirty refuse.the gun was cocked,loaded,and ready to be fired.the key factual dispute at trial was whether wilkerson ran up the alley where the gun and drugs were found,between and hartwell,or whether he ran up the driveway between and hartwell,which he would have had to pass before reaching the alley.
both of the evidentiary issues wilkerson raises on appeal involve testimony about his flight path on hartwell street.we first address federal rule of evidence and the common law to determine when prior consistent statements may be used to rehabilitate a witness credibility.
officer fleming testified that he saw wilkerson turn into the alley between and hartwell.defense counsel attempted to impeach fleming credibility on this subject by eliciting testimony that he did not describe the alley in the radio broadcasts he made while chasing wilkerson,he referred to the alley as a driveway in his police report,and in state grand jury testimony he stated that wilkerson ran between the second and third houses on hartwell,which would be between and if counting from the direction in which they ran.fleming was impeached on other subjects with his federal grand jury testimony,but none concerned wilkerson flight path.
to rehabilitate his credibility,the government asked officer fleming on redirect examination,a t any time prior to writing the report or in testifying in this case,did you ever indicate that wilkerson ran up anyplace other than that area between and hartwell he answered no.he was then asked,a t any prior time,writing a report or in your prior testimony,did you indicate that the defendant ran up any location other than this location between and hartwell again he answered no.finally he was asked,referring to his federal grand jury testimony,d o you recall what you said in that testimony fleming answered 
i testified to the fact that i saw the defendant run on to hartwell street and run up an alleyway between two homes on hartwell street.
and were you shown two photographs in the grand jury 
and what did you identify those photographs as being 
a.as the alleyway the defendant ran.
defense counsel objected to this line of questioning.she argued that the testimony was hearsay and should not be allowed as prior consistent statements under federal rule of evidence d b because it was not offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication.the district court agreed and ruled that fleming testimony could not be admitted under rule.instead,the court allowed the testimony under rule,the rule of completeness.defense counsel maintained her objection.the district court,sua sponte,gave a limiting instruction directing the jury to consider the testimony only for the officer credibility and not for the truth of the statements.
we review the district court ruling for abuse of discretion.see united states millan,cir.we conclude that the district court erred in admitting the testimony,but the error is harmless.
in united states simonelli,cir,this court addressed the same issues presented here.on,a witness prior inconsistent statements were used to impeach his credibility.on redirect the government asked the witness about statements he made to the grand jury which were consistent with his trial testimony.some of the questions went beyond the specific points covered on,but all were within its general scope.many of the statements were used only to rehabilitate the witness,rather than as substantive evidence.see id.at.
in simonelli we stated that when prior consistent statements are admitted to rehabilitate a witness,admissibility is determined by the interplay between the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine about prior consistent statements.id.at.we noted that both the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine allow prior consistent statements when they tend to show that a statement used to impeach a witness is not really inconsistent when understood in its proper context.see id.at.
the government argues that officer fleming testimony was properly admitted because it was offered to rebut the impression created by defense counsel that officer fleming had given conflicting or uncertain accounts of wilkerson flight path.however,simonelli makes clear that prior consistent statements must at least have some rebutting force beyond the mere fact that the witness has repeated on a prior occasion a statement consistent with his trial testimony.see id.at quoting united states pierre,cir.the redirect testimony at issue does not meet the required standard.defense counsel officer fleming about inconsistencies in the way he described wilkerson flight path and his failure to broadcast information about the alley over the police radio.confirming on redirect that the officer had never described a different flight path did not clarify or otherwise provide context for the statements used to impeach fleming.rather,the testimony only bolstered officer flemin
