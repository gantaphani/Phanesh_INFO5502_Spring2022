after olin dudley stevens was convicted on a charge of failing to register under the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,tit.i,stat,the district court sentenced him to serve months in prison.he challenges his conviction,alleging both evidentiary insufficiency and constitutional infirmity.concluding that his arguments lack merit,we affirm.
we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states rodríguez vélez,cir.in,the defendant was convicted of a sex crime in rhode island and incarcerated.upon his release from immurement,the state notified him of his duty to register annually as a sex offender.see laws a repealed he initially complied and renewed his registration periodically.he eventually became less assiduous,and his failure to keep his registration current led,in,to a no contest plea to a charge of failing to register as a sex offender.he did not learn his lesson and,four years later,he was again convicted on a charge of failure to keep his state sex offender registration current and given a suspended sentence.
we to january of,when the defendant moved from rhode island to maine.he failed to notify the authorities in rhode island of his change in residence and likewise failed to register as a sex offender in maine as required by that state law.see.ann.tit.a.by the same token,he neglected to comply with sorna which congress had enacted in.
these delinquencies came to the attention of the authorities and,in february of,a federal grand jury indicted the defendant for with sorna registration requirements.see u.after a bench trial,the district court found him guilty.the court concluded that,although the defendant lacked actual knowledge of his duty to register as a sex offender he was on constructive notice of this duty because he had registered several times in rhode island and also had been convicted for failing to register.united states stevens,d.following the imposition of sentence,the defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.
we begin our discussion of the merits with the defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.we review such challenges de novo,appraising the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.rodríguez vélez,at.the verdict must stand unless the evidence is so scant that a rational factfinder could not conclude that the government proved all the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
the defendant challenge has twin foci.first,he claims that the government did not present sufficient evidence that sorna required him to register as a sex offender after he had traveled in interstate commerce.at bottom,this claim rests on a legal interpretation,and the defendant argues that the evidence is inadequate under that interpretation.thus,the statute of conviction frames this aspect of the argument.
sorna provides in pertinent part 
a in general.whoever 
is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act 
a is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of sorna or 
b travels in interstate or foreign commerce and 
knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by sorna shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the defendant posits that this requirement did not become applicable until the attorney general promulgated an implementing regulation in february of.see.because this regulation his trip from rhode island to maine,his thesis runs,that travel can not be said to have triggered the federal registration requirement.
this contention is old hat.we previously have held that sorna was fully effective as of the date of its enactment july.united states ditomasso,cir.it therefore stands decided,under settled circuit precedent,that the defendant interstate travel in brought sorna registration requirement into play.consequently,the district court correctly applied the requirement in this instance.
the second focus of the defendant claim of evidentiary insufficiency is that the government did not present proof adequate to show that he knowingly violated sorna.in mounting this argument,the defendant does not challenge the supportability of the district court finding that he had constructive notice of a registration requirement.rather,he claims that sorna requires a showing of a specific intent to violate its registration provision and,therefore,requires a showing of actual knowledge of that provision.to the extent that this claim poses a question of statutory construction,our standard of review remains de novo.united states leahy,cir.
sorna makes it a crime to knowingly fail to register or update a registration as required by sorna.a.the defendant suggests that knowingly modifies all the language that follows it,with the result that a person can not violate the statutory proscription unless he knows specifically of his obligation to register under sorna and nevertheless flouts that obligation.this suggestion lacks force.
the supreme court has given us the appropriate starting point for our analysis.the court has said that unless the text of the statute dictates a different result,the term knowingly merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.bryan united states,d.our own precedent is to the same effect.see united states meade,cir.nothing in the text of sorna dictates a different result.indeed,giving words their ordinary meaning,the adverb knowingly modifies only the phrase fails to register,not the next phrase,as required by sorna.united states currier,cir construing knowingly in m,a firearms statute,as not requiring the government to prove specific intent.
in an effort to remove his case from the sweep of the bryan rule,the defendant urges us to find that the meaning of knowingly in section a is at least unclear,thus making applicable the rule of lenity.the notion that lack of clarity may ground an exception to the bryan rule is plausible.see,united states godin,cir applying rule of lenity after concluding that the knowledge requirement in an unrelated statute,a,was ambiguous.but ambiguity is a condition precedent to the invocation of the rule of lenity,see,united states santos,d united states dwinells,cir,and sorna contains no ambiguity with respect to its knowledge requirement.
the short of it is that,in the case at hand,no textual clue counsels against giving knowingly the usual meaning that bryan ascribes to that term.accordingly,we hold that section a requires only that the government prove general intent that is,a defendant awareness of his failure to register simpliciter.we add that this holding is well within the mainstream.it comports with the holdings of every other court of appeals that has decided this point.see,united states fuller,cir united states voice,cir united states vasquez,cir.
that ends this aspect of the matter.inasmuch as the statute of conviction contains only a general intent requirement,the government had to prove no more than that the defendant was aware that he had not registered.see bryan,at fuller,at.on this point,even the district court finding of constructive notice was superfluous.
the district court determination that the government carried this burden can not seriously be questioned.it follows that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant conviction.
in a different but equally unavailing vein,the defendant advances a pair of constitutional claims.we review these claims de novo.united states volungus,cir.neither of them is substantial.
to begin,the defendant asserts that convicting him despite his lack of actual knowledge of sorna requirement deprives him of due process of law.this assertion flies in the teeth of the venerable principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.see,united states int l minerals chem,d united states robinson,cir.
of course,there is an acknowledged exception to this principle for conduct that is wholly passive,see lambert california,d,and the defendant seeks refuge within the narrow confines of this exception.but the circumstances of this case do not lend themselves to an application of the exception.
there is no need to tarry.in an earlier sorna case,united
