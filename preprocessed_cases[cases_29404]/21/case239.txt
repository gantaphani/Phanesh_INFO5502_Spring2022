after a jury trial,defendant appellant charles fermin was convicted of possession with intent to distribute both marijuana and cocaine,and acquitted of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a offense.on appeal,fermin contests the denial of his motion to suppress and the sufficiency of the trial evidence,and alleges error in the jury instructions and sentence enhancements imposed.finding no reversible error,we affirm fermin convictions and sentence.
facts background 
because fermin challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal,we set forth the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states clemens,cir.
on january,members of the high intensity drug trafficking area task force hidta task force,a unit of the rhode island state police,were conducting surveillance near the providence college campus.fermin was observed walking down residential liege street,wearing a garbage bag underneath a red sweatshirt,before disappearing out of sight between two houses,and liege street.he emerged three to four minutes later rolling a large black suitcase.
looking around as if to check if anyone was walking behind him,fermin wheeled the suitcase the same way he had just come and entered a nearby parking lot.he made his way to the far end of the lot,where he placed the suitcase between a jeep and a cement wall.he then stepped away from the suitcase and began to talk on a cell phone.between conversations,he slid the suitcase under the jeep and removed the sweatshirt he was wearing.several minutes later,fermin retrieved the suitcase,tied his sweatshirt around the handle,and exited the parking lot with the suitcase in tow.
police stopped fermin on the street shortly thereafter and asked to speak with him about the suitcase.fermin immediately dropped his cargo and said that it was not his.he told police that he had been running at the providence college track when someone threw the suitcase over the fence standing next to the suitcase,one detective discerned a strong odor of marijuana he unzipped the suitcase and saw that it did in fact contain a large quantity of marijuana.fermin was arrested and transported to the police barracks.
while being interviewed at the barracks,fermin reiterated that he happened upon the suitcase while running at the providence college track,after someone threw it over the fence.fermin also volunteered to the detective processing him that he and his friend saw someone dump the suitcase near the providence college track his friend had encouraged him to take the bag,believing there might be money in it.he declined to identify his friend,stating that the friend was a college white boy and you know how they are.the detective later presented fermin with surveillance photographs taken earlier that day,both before and after he had retrieved the suitcase,which depicted him walking down the street alone.fermin became visibly upset and said that he did not want to argue.
police recovered pounds of marijuana from the suitcase,stored in clear plastic bags grams of cocaine a bottle of powdered caffeine three digital scales and a box of plastic bags like the ones filled with marijuana.in addition,the suitcase contained a revolver loaded with six rounds of ammunition inside a pair of sweatpants.
a indictment issued against fermin,charging him with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of those crimes.fermin unsuccessfully moved to suppress all evidence seized by law enforcement personnel on january,as well as all statements he made to police that day.
after a trial,fermin was convicted of the two drug charges but acquitted of the firearm charge applying sentence enhancements for obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm during the commission of the crimes,the district court sentenced fermin to months in prison.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
motion to.evidence at the motion hearing and district court ruling 
the district court held a hearing on the motion to suppress,at which fermin and two detectives,allen and demers,testified.the detectives testimony at the hearing concerning their january surveillance of fermin tracked their eventual trial testimony.however,detective allen also gave details,not placed before the jury,of a tip received from a reliable confidential informant two days prior to fermin stop.the informant told police that liege street was being used as a stash house for large amounts of marijuana,approximately or pounds,and that the stash was to be relocated soon.acting on the tip,task force members conducted surveillance of the area on january and.they observed vehicles pulling up in front of liege street and one or more people entering the house at a time,leaving a short time later.such activity,detective allen believed,was consistent with narcotics trafficking.
fermin account of the ensuing stop on january contradicted that of the detectives.fermin testified that he was jogging in the area when he found the suitcase next to a recycling bin in someone backyard.picking it up and noting its substantial weight,fermin became curious as to its contents,but did not want to open it while on the potential owner property.he decided to take the suitcase to the chad brown housing project,where people mind their business,resolving to throw it out there if it contained nothing of value.
according to fermin,he was wheeling the suitcase down the street when a car sped by and abruptly came to a stop ahead of him.an officer emerged,pointing a gun at him,and commanded him to stop.fermin immediately let go of the suitcase.another officer exited a different car,also with her gun drawn the two converged on fermin as a third officer approached him with handcuffs.in response to their questioning about the suitcase,fermin told police that he had just found it in someone yard and that it did not belong to him 
detective demers testified that he parked on the street next to fermin and displayed his badge but not his gun as he exited the vehicle,stating,state police.state police task force.we want to talk to you regarding the suitcase you carrying.in response,fermin put his hands up and dropped the suitcase,declaring that it was not his and that he had found it while running at the providence college track.immediately thereafter,detective allen arrived on the scene and parked his car,with the front of his car facing both detective demers and fermin.two other officers also arrived and stood behind fermin.
detective allen asked questions of fermin in what he described as a conversational tone of voice he denied giving any commands or drawing his gun.allen placed fermin in handcuffs once marijuana was discovered in the suitcase and transported him to the police barracks.
crediting the detectives version of events over fermin,the district court ruled that the encounter was a consensual one that did not implicate the fourth amendment.further,the warrantless search of the suitcase was proper,as fermin had disclaimed ownership of it and thus forfeited a claim of privacy.see united states de los santos ferrer,cir.the court held in the alternative that,even if the encounter constituted a seizure for fourth amendment purposes,police had reasonable suspicion,supported by articulable facts,that criminal activity might have been afoot.the court therefore denied fermin motion to suppress.
discussion 
when reviewing a challenge to the district court denial of a motion to suppress,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the district court ruling on the motion,and we review the district court findings of fact and credibility determinations for clear error.united states camacho,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.however,we review conclusions of law de novo,giving plenary review to the district court application of law to facts,determinations,and ultimate decision to deny the motion.id.at.
the question whether the encounter at issue was consensual,or instead a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment,is not free from doubt.the district court found that it was undisputed that there were at least four,if not five officers present in some formation around fermin in a very short period of time after he was confronted,and that police told fermin that they wanted to speak with him about the contents of the suitcase.it is not clear that a reasonable person,surrounded by five police officers,would believe that he was free to leave.see california hodari.indeed,fermin did not leave but rather submitted to police authority by answering questions about the suitcase.see united states holloway,cir citizen submission to show of police authority is a prerequisite for a finding of seizure.
we need not decide the question,however,because fermin stop was supported by reasonable suspicion in any event.see united states espinoza,cir brief investigatory stops can be grounded on reasonable suspicion,as opposed to probable cause.police had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting fermin of criminal activity.ornelas united states,alteration,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
acting on a tip from a confidential informant that the house at liege street was a repository for a large amount of marijuana,police observed comings and goings from the house consistent with drug trafficking.see united states jones,cir information provided to police by third parties may create reasonable suspicion if the information contains sufficient indicia of reliability.quoting alabama white.this is not a case where the detectives suspicion was based on fermin mere presence in a area known for drug activity,camacho,at.the tip and surveillance,combined with fermin deliberate path toward liege street,his disappearance between houses and reemergence with the suitcase shortly thereafter,and subsequent attempt to keep the suitcase out of sight by hiding it under a jeep,together constituted specific and articulable facts justifying the belief that fermin was engaged in criminal activity.united states rabbia,cir quoting united states brake,cir united states velez saldana,cir police had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant after seeing him emerging from area where large shipment of drugs recently had been seized united states moore,cir officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct stop after defendant ran out of apartment in building where they had just observed significant foot traffic suggesting ongoing drug sales,and defendant attempted to hide something from officers.the stop was thus permissible,as was the search of the suitcase following fermin disclaimer of ownership.see de los santos ferrer,at.the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.
sufficiency of the evidence 
at trial,the government proceeded on alternative theories in support of fermin guilt,arguing that he either had actual knowledge of what was in the suitcase,or else purposely avoided learning of the contents.see united states appolon,cir noting that theories of actual knowledge and willful blindness can coexist quoting united states griffin,cir.over defense counsel objection,the district court instructed the jury that they could infer that fermin acted knowingly if it found that he deliberately closed his eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him.
fermin argues on appeal that the instruction was unwarranted where there were no facts suggest ing a conscious course of deliberate ignorance.united states azubike,cir.he further contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient,under either theory,to establish that he knew that the suitcase contained drugs.
we review preserved challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.id.at.in assessing sufficiency,we examine the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom.united states cruz rodríguez,cir.if,in this light,any reasonable jury could find all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,we must uphold the conviction.united states lizardo,cir.
we consider first whether there was sufficient evidence that fermin actually knew of the drugs in the suitcase.it is worth noting at the outset that key evidence tending to establish fermin mens rea was not before the jury,namely,the tip that liege street was a drug stash house and the detectives subsequent surveillance of the area.without this evidence,the case against fermin is a closer one.however,after a full review of the transcript,we conclude that there was nonetheless sufficient evidence to support fermin convictions on a theory of actual knowledge.
there was evidence before the jury of fermin purposeful behavior in retrieving the suitcase from the liege street area.fermin walked,towards the rear of and liege street.witnesses testified that he emerged with a bulging suitcase three to four minutes later and walked back the way he had come,looking over his shoulder as if to check if anyone was walking behind him.fermin then tried to hide the suitcase next to and under a jeep while he talked on his cell phone.united states ortiz,cir defendant entry into a condominium complex,emergence with a black bag,and placing of the bag into car trunk supported a rational inference that defendant knew that the bag contained cocaine.this evidence is probative of fermin deliberate conduct and distinguishes the case from others involving defendants who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.see,united states valerio,cir evidence insufficient to support conviction of knowing possession of cocaine with intent to distribute where drugs were found in lining of chair in apartment of which defendant was occupant.
further,the jury could infer fermin knowledge of his cargo from his nervous behavior and attempts to conceal the suitcase,as well as from the odor of marijuana emanating from the suitcase.see united states de jesús viera,cir testimony regarding the defendant nervous behavior was also supporting evidence of guilt.azubike,at attempts at secrecy demonstrative of defendant knowledge that briefcase with which he was entrusted contained heroin united states de leon davis,cir strong odor of glue emanating from suitcase,used to avoid detection of drugs,supported inference of knowing participation in drug trafficking.
the jury also could have found that fermin gave more than one demonstrably false account of how he found the suitcase,explaining first that someone threw it over the fence while he was running at the providence college track,and later that he and his friend had found it together and that the friend had encouraged him to take it.unfortunately for fermin,a lieutenant at the school office of safety and security testified at trial that there is no outdoor track on campus surveillance photographs also depicted fermin alone on a residential street,not on the college campus both immediately before and after retrieving the suitcase.thus,fermin knowingly false statement s were probative of his consciousness of guilt.united states littlefield,cir.
finally,there was testimony at trial that the wholesale value of the drugs in the heavily packed suitcase was up to,with the retail value being double that amount.the quantity of drugs possessed provides a basis from which to infer knowledge.see de jesús viera,at azubike,at united states ayala tapia,cir.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,a reasonable jury could find that fermin had actual knowledge of the contents of the suitcase 
given this conclusion,we need not reach the question whether the record evidence reveals flags of suspicion that,uninvestigated,suggest willful blindness,such that the instruction was warranted.united states epstein,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the warning signs of criminal activity were perhaps less conspicuous than in other cases where such an instruction properly was given,lizardo,at,any error in the decision to give the instruction was harmless in light of the ample evidence of fermin actual knowledge.united states garcía pastrana,cir error in giving instruction harmless where evidence is sufficient to support defendant direct knowledge of criminal activity.
moreover,because the court instruction,taken as a whole,could not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge,azubike,at,there was no danger that the jury convicted based on an impermissibly low standard,see united states brandon,cir.the district court cautioned the jury,
it is entirely up to you to determine whether fermin deliberately closed his eyes to a fact and,if so,what inference if any should be drawn from that fact.however,it is important to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake or ignorance in failing to learn a fact is not sufficient.there must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant of the fact.if after considering all of the evidence you have a reasonable doubt that fermin acted with the requisite culpable state of mind,then you must find fermin not guilty.
littlefield,at court instruction did not mandate inference of knowledge where it explained to jury that defendant mere negligence would be insufficient to establish guilt.thus,there was little risk that the jury was confused into convicting a defendant who merely should have known about the criminal venture.brandon,at.
jury instructions 
fermin next argues that the district court jury instruction regarding the consideration of expert testimony was erroneous.in particular,he takes issue with the court admonition that,due to expert witnesses specialized knowledge,their opinions should be carefully consider ed and should not be disregarded lightly.fermin asserts that this instruction effectively directed the jury to defer to detective allen,who opined that the quantities of marijuana and cocaine found in the suitcase were consistent with distributive intent,rather than personal use 
because fermin did not object to this instruction,our review is for plain error.see.d united states medina martinez,cir.when applying the plain error standard in the context of jury instructions,we look at the instructions as a whole to ascertain the extent to which they adequately explain the law without confusing or misleading the jury.united states brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
it is the province of the jury to determine the proper weight to assign to expert testimony.united states shelton,cir.testimony is not entitled to deference simply because it derives from an expert.see united states pires,cir.indeed,jurors often are reminded to consider the factors that generally bear upon the credibility of a witness when weighing expert testimony.pattern criminal jury instructions for the district courts of the first circuit 
although the district court errantly advised the jury that expert testimony should not be disregarded lightly,the instruction in its entirety apprised the jury of its proper role expert witnesses.the court told the jury that it was not required to accept an opinion just because a witness has specialized knowledge,that it should measure the credibility of expert witnesses by the same standard applicable to other witnesses,and that expert opinions are not necessarily determinative or conclusive.separately,the court also cautioned against giving special weight to testimony.these multiple warnings were sufficient to offset any potential confusion,and the instruction as a whole was not plainly erroneous.brown,at although certain language in instruction was ambiguous in the abstract,the rest of the jury instruction lent content to it,such that jury was not led astray united states nishnianidze,cir finding no plain error in jury instruction where district court initially misstated element of crime but later clarified nature of government burden.
sentencing 
fermin argues that resentencing is required because the district court imposed two unsupported sentence enhancements and also improperly penalized him for exercising his right against.we consider each objection in turn,reviewing the court legal conclusions de novo and factual conclusions for clear error.united states gonzalez,cir.
enhancement 
a sentencing court is authorized to enhance a defendant offense level by two levels if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice.sentencing guidelines manual.such an enhancement may be premised on a finding that the defendant committed perjury during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing.id.cmt.united states maguire,cir.the court must make an independent finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the elements of perjury have been satisfied before imposing the enhancement.gonzalez,at.perjury consists of false testimony under oath concerning a matter material to the proceeding,as long as the testimony is given with the willful intent to provide false testimony,rather than as a result of confusion,mistake,or faulty memory.united states shinderman,cir quoting united states dunnigan.
here,the district court imposed a enhancement for obstruction of justice after concluding that fermin had perjured himself during the suppression hearing.the court found that fermin testimony was a tale spun to attempt to get the court to suppress the evidence,and that it was clearly false,both in its specifics and in a general overall sense.in particular,the court found untruthful fermin account of discovering the suitcase,his denial that he ever told police that he found it while running on the track at providence college,and his assertion that police stopped him with weapons drawn.
the district court finding that fermin willfully lied in an attempt to have evidence against him suppressed is a factual one that we review for clear error.gonzalez,at.we can not say that the finding was clearly erroneous.fermin testimony about the circumstances of finding the suitcase and subsequent stop by police directly conflicted with that of the other two witnesses,who the court determined to be more credible.united states meada,cir finding of perjury not clearly erroneous where defendant testimony conflicted with several other witnesses.this was no testimonial conflict about a peripheral matter but,rather,a clash about a central issue at the heart of the motion to suppress.shinderman,at.as the district court noted,fermin disavowal of having told police that he was running at the track also was belied by police reports that recorded such statement after the fact.
fermin contends that the district court failed to make the requisite finding that his false testimony concerned a matter material to the suppression hearing.but insofar as his testimony was relevant to whether police had reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop and whether that stop constituted a seizure,it was obviously material.united states campbell,cir affirming application of enhancement where district court applied the correct legal test for perjury but did not make explicit materiality finding,noting that court of appeals can make materiality determination absent express district court finding.the enhancement was proper and not clearly erroneous.
gun enhancement 
fermin also disputes the enhancement imposed under b.that guideline applies if a dangerous weapon was possessed during the course of a offense,provided that the presence of the weapon was known to,or reasonably foreseeable to,the defendant.united states quiñones medina,cir the commentary to the guideline notes that t he enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present,unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.cmt.a see also united states thongsophaporn,cir.fermin argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knew or could have reasonably foreseen the presence of the gun in the suitcase,particularly where the jury acquitted him of the firearm charge.
although we are mindful that the jury acquitted fermin of the firearm charge,it remains the law in this circuit that acquitted conduct can form the basis of a sentence enhancement.united states gobbi,cir.while the jury must,of course,find facts beyond a reasonable doubt,a standard applies to the sentencing court factual findings.id.further,there is no necessary inconsistency between acquittal on charges of knowing possession of a firearm and the court finding that the presence of the gun was reasonably foreseeable to fermin.
here,the district court determined th
