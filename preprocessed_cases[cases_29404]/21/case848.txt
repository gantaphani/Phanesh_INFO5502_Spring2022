on november,israel navedo,along with seven other named,was indicted by a federal grand jury in puerto rico for participating in a conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than one kilogram of heroin with the intent to distribute,a.all of the other named members of the alleged conspiracy eventually pled guilty navedo did not.
at trial,the prosecution offered evidence that from to,navedo was part of a drug conspiracy in the la perla section of old san juan and that he regularly distributed cocaine and heroin to both ordinary buyers and dealers who would sell the drugs on his behalf.one of navedo dealers testified that he sold cocaine and heroin for navedo daily for three years and that his sales for navedo included four to six kilograms of heroin per week.less comprehensive testimony came from a supplier to navedo and one of his customers.
after a trial,a jury convicted navedo of the offense.the jury was charged that,to find navedo guilty,it had to find that he was personally responsible for the amounts specified in the indictment,namely,more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than one kilogram of heroin.at sentencing in march,the district judge said that he agreed that at minimum,navedo was responsible for this amount,which equated to a guideline sentencing range of to months.
the judge sentenced navedo to months of imprisonment.however,the judge gave no reason in open court for choosing this sentence.the sentencing statute requires that at sentencing the court shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,including its reasons for selecting a particular point within the guideline range if the range exceeds months.c 
navedo appealed to this court,attacking both his conviction and sentence.in an unpublished opinion,we rejected all claims of error,including attacks on the drug amount,save that we agreed that,under section c,the district judge had to give reasons for his choice of sentence.we remanded for resentencing to allow him to do so.
on remand,the district court held a sentencing hearing in august and listened to arguments from counsel as to the proper sentence.it then noted that the guidelines were now advisory,referred to the factors set forth in section a,and reaffirmed the sentence,offering the following explanation 
the court has determined in prior cases and reaffirms it in this one that it will generally heel to the guidelines imposing criminal punishment.no doubt some criminal defendants will be disappointed by this result yet in the long run such an approach may be the best way to develop a fair and consistent sentencing scheme around the country for the benefit of defendants,victims and the public.
we believe that the guidelines advisory ranges best effectuate the sentencing reform act statutory factors.therefore,the court finds that throughout the span of this conspiracy as charged in the indictment the defendant,israel navedo concepcion was involved in the distribution of the quantity of drugs involved in the indictment.this was found by the jury and i presided over the trial and agree with that finding.the facts and circumstances of the defendant s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual possession of controlled substances and a serious threat to society.his participation in the conspiracy and the evidence presented during the trial justify a sentence at the upper end of the advisory guidelines.
the new sentencing occurred in august,and so was subject to united states booker,d,decided in january.in his present appeal,navedo first argues that the district court misconstrued the legal standard governing sentences by treating the guideline range as presumptively correct and giving the guidelines undue weight.admittedly,the resentencing occurred before this court decision in united states,cir en banc,which gave our own view of the proper approach to sentencing.
the district judge statement at,quoted above,could suggest that he viewed the guidelines as presumptively determining the proper sentence although the term presumption was not used.the presumption language has been adopted by a number of circuits but in,we declined to adopt it.at.nevertheless,our decision did treat the guidelines as more than just one factor among many,deemed them the proper starting point for sentencing,and said that the proponent of a variance had to support it.id.at.
in the resentencing,the district court explicitly recognized that the guidelines were now advisory and allowed both sides to make whatever arguments they wanted.it is debatable and a matter of nuance how far the district court emphasis on the guidelines differs from our own in.yet if we thought that there was any serious possibility that a new sentencing,enlightened by,would produce a better result for navedo,we would order a second remand.
this is not a realistic possibility.the most important indicator is that the district judge,while stressing the importance of the guidelines,has once again sentenced navedo at the top of the range,referring generally to the evidence presented at trial.the evidence provides a basis for the district court assessment,as we will see in the discussion that follows,and there is little and nothing new that might sway the district court in the opposite direction.
if the district court erred in expressing the algorithm,the variance was modest,consisting of a few ambiguous phrases will generally heel guidelines best effectuate not literally in conflict with.in the present case,we regard the phrasings,if error at all,as harmless to anyone advocating a lower sentence for navedo.asking the district court to take note of and then resentence would,by itself,accomplish nothing.
navedo second claim of error is that the district judge failed adequately to explain his reasons for choosing a sentence at the top of the guideline range or to explain in navedo words why no lower sentence would be sufficient to accomplish the statutory purposes of sentencing.the argument has two different parts.the first one is,in essence,that the district court explanation is too opaque to permit understanding of the reasons for the sentence or effective review of it.
as we explained in,we are prepared to read what the district court did say in light of the record.see at.the more obvious the reasons for a choice,the less that needs to be explained.in this case,the district court explicit concerns were the scope of the crime and the potential for dangerousness.beyond that,the district court referred generally to the evidence presented during the trial as justifying a sentence at the upper end of the advisory guidelines.
turning to that evidence,navedo was not convicted for a couple of drug transactions,but for a enterprise.he was not just a dealer although not the senior figure among the conspirators,he employed at least one subordinate dealer and if that dealer testimony is fully credited others as well.although navedo had no prior convictions,he the evidence of the duration of the conspiracy,the seeming volume of drugs,and his own viewed by the judge as a significant danger.
thus,it is not difficult to see here what led the district court to impose the maximum guideline sentence on navedo volume,duration,and use of subordinates.still,even where fairly obvious,in the future the main factors ought to be identified by the district court itself,eliminating the need for guesswork.this is not a requirement for a lengthy or detailed recitation or one addressing every claim and rather,the reviewing court needs,and both parties deserve,a specific explanation and not just a reference to the evidence.
the other aspect of navedo second the district court failed to explain why it did not give a lesser a different and recurring matter in such appeals.navedo points to the sentencing statute,which says,among other things,that a sentence should be not greater than necessary to carry out the purposes specified in the statute.a.this pronouncement says nothing about what explanation is required from the district judge,but it is often cited by defendants as if it were an admonition to be lenient and
