this case is an offshoot of the prosecution of members of the notorious boston winter hill gang for various crimes including extortion and murder.one of the defendants in that prosecution,james whitey bulger,was later elevated to the top ten most wanted list he remains,after nearly ten years,a fugitive.in this case,richard schneiderhan,a retired massachusetts state police lieutenant,was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice,in violation of and.he was prosecuted for communicating to a criminal associate of james bulger the decision of federal law enforcement authorities to conduct electronic surveillance of bulger two brothers,john and william,via pen registers placed on their telephones.
the primary issue at trial and in this appeal is whether defendant had the requisite intent to obstruct justice when he provided the information.he asserts three claims of error.his major challenge is to the district court denial of a motion for new trial based on the failure of the prosecution to disclose in timely fashion an allegedly exculpatory letter that related to a trial witness testimony,in violation of brady maryland,d,and the jencks act.he also argues that the court erred in allowing two witnesses to give testimony that he alleges constituted impermissible opinion evidence as to defendant mental state,in violation of.b.a final issue raised in the wake of blakely washington,d,and united states booker,d,is whether defendant is entitled to as a result of the court plain error in adjusting his sentence upward under the mandatory sentencing guidelines.
our review persuades us that,in the final analysis,these arguments lack merit.
i.the brady and jencks act issues 
factual background.we first review the facts relevant to the government alleged failure to disclose a significant letter in timely fashion.we draw the facts from the evidence presented at trial.
defendant had a longstanding friendship with one stephen flemmi,a member of the winter hill gang.after flemmi was incarcerated as the result of the prosecution of gang members,defendant kept in touch with him and another gang member who was not then in prison,kevin weeks.weeks had learned from james bulger and flemmi that defendant had done many favors for the gang in providing information.weeks and defendant met perhaps a dozen times,defendant hoping that weeks would be of some help to flemmi and consequently wanting to be of help to weeks.
in late september,defendant was able to do something.whether that something was really intended to be helpful or was just a pretense is the issue underlying defendant claim regarding the withheld letter.at that time,james bulger was still at large more than three years after the winter hill gang indictments,and he was newly placed on the top ten list.the government adopted a broad investigative strategy that included orders from a ted baker at fbi to place pen registers on three telephones of william and john bulger.those work orders were channeled through the computer of linda reardon,a telephone company employee who also was the daughter of defendant,edward duff.
winter hill gang member weeks,testifying under a cooperation agreement,said that on a thursday in late september he received an envelope that defendant had left for him at the rotary variety store,a locale frequented by gang members and their associates.the envelope contained a typewritten note,which said that a tom baker had put wiretaps on two phones the day before,and listed the telephone numbers.at the bottom was typed,max,a number and name previously used by defendant to identify himself in his dealings with weeks.weeks called john bulger,who confirmed the accuracy of the telephone numbers.
over six months later,acting on information from weeks and others,massachusetts state police officers thomas duffy and thomas foley interviewed defendant,who acknowledged writing to flemmi and meeting with weeks.when told that weeks had indicated that he was the source of wiretap information,defendant initially protested that he would have had no way of knowing such information.later in the conversation,he revealed that john and william bulger were the targets of the surveillance,although this fact had deliberately not been communicated by the officers.defendant,when asked how he knew about the targets,first asserted that he learned this from the two officers but quickly withdrew this answer and said he had assumed the fact.in a second interview,held two days later,defendant admitted leaving the typed note with its identifying signatures and said he had received the information from his duff.
defendant testimony as to motive.what we have recounted thus far described what happened.what follows is a summary of defendant testimony at trial about the motives for his actions and his knowledge of the source of his information.it is a remarkable tale of shifting,if not contradictory,emphases.he first explained he had remained in contact with weeks in the hope that he might learn something about james bulger whereabouts and reap a substantial reward.later,he dismissed this as sarcasm.then he described how william bulger had helped defendant and others by supporting the listing of their church as a national monument.he felt,he said,a great obligation to william.this testimony was followed by statements that he had not helped weeks recently,that weeks was getting a little bit hinky about talking to him,and that he,defendant,wanted to throw him a bone.later,however,he described this explanation as a little facetious.following up on his bone motive,defendant said that william would not talk on the telephone to his brother james and that everybody knew that james did not talk on the telephone,so i knew it was going to cause any damage.moreover,oddly,he said he did not really believe that there were taps a thing on william and john phones.
his testimony about the source of his information was equally vacillating.first,in reporting his call from florida with the tip about electronic surveillance,he said he did not know where the information had come from but merely assumed where it had,without saying what his assumption was.shortly thereafter,he said that the information he passed to weeks was just golf course or barroom gossip just stories.
on the following day of trial,the government inquired about defendant niece,linda reardon.defendant had earlier disavowed knowing that she was employed by the telephone company,saying,i knew a group of the family were employed there,but i did know specifically who was what.under,he testified as follows 
q.the information from duff defendant he got it from his niece sic linda reardon,and you gave it then to kevin weeks,right 
i do know that he got it from his daughter linda.i was told that he got it from her,but of my own knowledge,i do know.
defendant admitted giving the information to weeks and expecting that he would in turn give it to john and william bulger.
the undisclosed letter.against this factual background we must assess the relevance of a letter that was not disclosed prior to trial,whether the letter was exculpatory,and,finally,whether its was prejudicial.see brady,at.under the jencks act,our inquiry focuses on whether the letter was a statement of a witness relating to the witness trial testimony.see b.
the letter at issue was written by then assistant united states attorney david apfel,who had been associated with the prosecution of gang members and the search for james bulger from through.the letter was dated october,a year earlier than the events detailed in this case.it was written to the attorney then representing william bulger in connection with bulger possible proffer of information or appearance before the grand jury.it assured counsel that william would not face questions based on a title iii wiretap but would be asked questions based on information obtained from telephone pen registers and trap and trace devices,as well as from terminating number searches.defendant asserts that the letter reveals that any information he may have communicated in about electronic surveillance was harmless because the bulgers already knew about it.
in a grand jury appearance in,william said he knew there had been a wiretap on his telephone and thought his counsel had given him that information.he did not know whether it was a wiretap or a pen register,but assumed both.the district court held that that testimony,which was available to defendant,gave him specific information about the same subject matter covered in apfel letter,thus precluding any material prejudice.the court also held that,by asserting that his actions had no impact,defendant was raising the impermissible defense of factual impossibility,and the court further ruled that defendant had failed to exploit available witnesses on the weeks and william bulger.finally,it held that the jencks act was not violated because no showing was made that apfel letter was a statement about matters material to the testimony apfel had given in defendant trial.
argument and analysis.we generally will reverse the denial of a motion for new trial only if there is a manifest abuse of discretion,united states glenn,cir,and a district court determination that information is neither exculpatory under brady nor discoverable under the jencks act is similarly subject to review,united states,cir.the criteria for finding a brady violation are a wilful or inadvertent suppression of evidence by the government,the evidence being favorable to the defendant,resulting in prejudice to the defendant so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.strickler greene,d see united states josleyn,cir.this does not mean that a verdict would have been more likely than not different,but that,without the evidence,defendant did not receive a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.strickler,at.quoting kyles whitley,d.
the jencks act requires the government to provide,upon request,certain prior statements made by trial witnesses,and our review turns on the statutory requirement that the statement relate to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified,b.again,a demonstration of prejudice is necessary.united states,cir.
on appeal,defense counsel seeks to characterize the apfel letter as an admission by the government that pen registers were a well known component of the winter hill gang investigation,supporting defendant contention that his communication to weeks in was not intended to be of consequence.defendant refers in his brief to the government myth that no law enforcement officer under any imaginable circumstance would ever breathe a word about electronic surveillance in order to avoid flushing it sic usefulness down the toilet,and asserts that the jury should have learned that by october,even the federal prosecutors had abandoned the secrecy shill.in oral argument,appellate counsel passionately elaborated on that theme i was given a chance to put david apfel letter down his throat i could have tortured him for a couple of hours about that letter.he further noted that for the government to put pen registers on the brothers phones in is almost laughable as a realistic attempt to track down james.
there are several problems with this argument.perhaps the most important is that the argument blithely ignores the gulf separating the kind of information he was convicted of passing on to weeks and that described in the apfel letter.the latter was a statement,made a year before appellant action,that the government has obtained information from unidentified pen registers,trap and trace devices,and terminating number searches.in other words,not only is the reference to past activity,but it is a general reference to several investigative techniques employed by the government without identifying the targeted telephones.
in contrast,defendant was charged with and convicted for passing on information that electronic surveillance devices had just been installed on the telephones of two named individuals.it was the harm done to law enforcement investigations by this kind of almost contemporaneous release of specific information concerning targets of electronic surveillance that was the subject of the testimony of all the government witnesses at no point does defendant in either his brief or oral argument acknowledge the difference between the information contained in the apfel letter and the specific target information referred to by the government witnesses.we fail to see how nondisclosure of the apfel letter suppressed evidence that could be considered exculpatory.
beyond this,we note that defendant claim that he was merely passing on gossip would have been seriously flawed even had the letter been available.first,this particular argument was the last of a number of asserted motives,most of which contradicted it.for example,were worthless gossip all that was communicated,there would be little prospect of a substantial reward resulting from such information,or even the prospect of building up credit with weeks for some future bonanza tip about james whereabouts.if,as appellate counsel argued,no reasonable person with any experience could believe that release of electronic surveillance information would be of value,such a bone would hardly be deemed worth gnawing by such a seasoned criminal associate as weeks.similarly,mere gossip would be no way of responding to the heavy obligation he assertedly felt toward william because of past favors.
moreover,on the record we have set forth,see supra at,the guilty verdict is consistent with the jury belief that defendant acted on his assumption and understanding that the source of the information was his niece,linda,reporting the order for pen registers that came through her computer.see united states nishnianidze,cir t he jury duty is to assess credibility,and it may accept or reject,in whole or in part,any testimony.such a permissible inference shatters the golf course gossip theory.
our conclusion with respect to the brady claim is thus threefold.first,we can not consider the belatedly produced apfel letter to be exculpatory for defendant because of its irrelevance to a communication of specific,current,highly confidential police surveillance.second,we deem defendant effort to substitute a worthless gossip motive for that of obstruction of justice to be unhelpful to therefore not it is internally inconsistent with his own testimony as to the basis of his action.finally,we hold that in any event defendant has made no showing that admission of the apfel letter could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict,josleyn,at quoting kyles,at.the ruling of the district court,therefore,falls far short of any abuse of discretion.
our decision on the jencks act issue is determined by what we have said about the basic difference between the generalized notice in the apfel letter and an unauthorized release of information about electronic surveillance currently in place.apfel testimony at trial was confined to a description of the electronic surveillance procedure,the particular pen registers at issue,and the purpose of sealed orders to keep such surveillance secret.the letter was not relevant to that testimony.finally,as in our analysis of the brady issue,the evidence in its totality renders any jencks error harmless.see united states neal,cir.indeed,defendant makes no attempt to demonstrate prejudice.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of the motion for new trial.
ii.admission of testimony as to mental state 
background.defendant second asserted error is that the district court improperly allowed two law enforcement witnesses to opine that someone experienced in dealing with organized crime would know that revealing the existence of electronic surveillance to a target would compromise the investigation.other testimony established that defendant had such experience.see infra at.
defendant invokes rule b of the federal rules of evidence,which prohibits an expert witness from testifying that a defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged.he cites our opinion in united states valle,cir,where we held that rule b prohibited
