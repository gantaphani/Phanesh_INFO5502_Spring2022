defendant gilberto caraballo appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york raymond dearie,chief judge at which he was found guilty on five counts relating to the murder of jose fernandez,see a substantive and conspiratorial id.a solicitation to commit a crime of violence id.c use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence e a murder while engaging in a narcotics offense one count relating to the murder of edward cortes,see id.murder while engaging in a narcotics offense conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride and fifty grams or more of cocaine base crack,see id.b a,and two counts of firearm possession,see g felon in possession of a firearm id.c possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.caraballo was sentenced principally to five concurrent terms of life imprisonment and is currently serving that sentence.
on appeal,caraballo challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his e a conviction for the murder of jose fernandez as well as the district court failure a to dismiss a juror for cause after the start of trial,and b to give a charge.we discuss and reject caraballo claims of error by the district court in a summary order issued today.see united states caraballo.cir.in this opinion,we address his sufficiency challenge.we conclude that the substantive connection requirement implied in the engaging in element of e a can be satisfied not only by proof that at least one of the purposes of the killing was related to an ongoing drug conspiracy,as we held in united states desinor,cir,but also by proof that the defendant used his position in or control over such a conspiracy to facilitate the murder.the trial evidence in this case demonstrated that caraballo used his position as a supplier in the charged drug conspiracy to induce confederates to participate in fernandez murder,promising to forgive past drug debts and to supply drugs in the future.this was sufficient to sustain the challenged e a conviction.
thus,for the reasons stated in this opinion and the contemporaneous summary order,we affirm caraballo judgment of conviction.
background 
caraballo conviction was secured following a lengthy trial at which the government sought,but did not ultimately obtain,death sentences for the murders of jose fernandez and edward cortes.we here describe only those facts relevant to caraballo sufficiency challenge to his e a conviction for the fernandez murder.in doing so,we view the evidence,as we must,in the light most favorable to the government.see united states williams,cir.
a.the narcotics conspiracy 
caraballo was charged with killing jose fernandez while engaged in an offense punishable under section b a of title of the united states code,specifically,a conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and fifty grams or more of crack.united states caraballo,cr,superseding indictment at,citing e a.caraballo does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on the underlying narcotics conspiracy,nor could he.the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that between january and december,caraballo and various confederates,including quincy martinez,martin aguilar,armando molina,and eric rosario,conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute large quantities of cocaine and crack in violation of b a.see id.any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense,the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.
the evidence further demonstrated that caraballo was the conspiracy wholesale supplier,providing drugs either through direct sales or on consignment to confederates who sold or arranged for the sale of those drugs on the street,principally in sunset park,brooklyn.among the persons to whom caraballo supplied drugs was molina who,at various times,employed martinez,rosario,and fernandez as dealers.after a with molina,caraballo began supplying drugs to fernandez on consignment.caraballo likewise supplied drugs on consignment to aguilar and aguilar associate,jeffrey taylor.caraballo ceased providing drugs to aguilar in september after aguilar failed to pay his debts and,along with taylor,robbed one of caraballo drug associates.
b.the murder of jose fernandez 
quincy martinez had been dating fernandez,also known as tris,for more than ten years when,in september,she began a romantic relationship with caraballo.apparently,fernandez often physically abused martinez,and,on several occasions in the fall of,caraballo advised martinez that he could get rid of fernandez.see trial tr.at.on december,following a big fight between martinez and fernandez,martinez told caraballo that he should do it,murder tris,id.at.caraballo responded,say no more.id.at.
caraballo had,in fact,been planning fernandez murder for some time.in october,caraballo solicited his drug confederate aguilar to kill fernandez,promising in return to forgive aguilar drug debts and to resume supplying drugs to him on consignment.aguilar partner taylor concluded that he would double his own drug sales if aguilar line of credit with caraballo was reopened,and so he too agreed to participate in the fernandez murder in exchange for in cash or drugs.id.at.taylor participation was central to caraballo plan taylor worked as a maintenance man in cemetery in sunset park,which caraballo identified as a convenient place to hide fernandez dead body.
aguilar and taylor knew that caraballo wanted fernandez killed because of his relationship with martinez.taylor told aguilar that this was a stupid reason to kill tris,but aguilar explained who cares it not our business.i get this done and everything squashed,all of aguilar problems with caraballo would be resolved and they could resume their profitable drug distribution arrangement with caraballo.id.at.
on the morning of december,shortly after martinez gave her consent to fernandez murder,caraballo,aguilar,and taylor drove caraballo van to fernandez home.fernandez had been told that the group was going to cemetery to steal marble.once fernandez was in the van,caraballo began driving,whereupon aguilar put his arm around fernandez and shot him under the chin.fernandez began screaming,prompting aguilar to shoot fernandez again,in the temple.although fernandez fell to the floor,he was not yet dead.indeed,he attempted to escape the van,but aguilar pulled him back inside.caraballo then handed aguilar an automatic pistol,and aguilar fired several more shots into fernandez head and back,finally killing him.
fernandez dead body remained in caraballo van,parked overnight in his driveway.the next day,taylor and aguilar drove the vehicle to cemetery and there dropped fernandez body down a remote storm drain,as previously agreed with caraballo.as promised,caraballo thereafter gave taylor approximately worth of cocaine and one hundred ecstasy pills for his role in the murder.caraballo also forgave aguilar drug debt and arranged for him and taylor to receive drugs on consignment from one of caraballo associates.
c.the jury charge 
with compelling evidence adduced that caraballo was a participant in both the charged narcotics distribution conspiracy and the murder of jose fernandez,defendant sufficiency challenge reduces to a single issue did caraballo commit the murder while engaging in the charged drug conspiracy e a.on this element of e a,the government requested that the jury be charged as follows 
t he government must establish that the defendant intentionally killed jose fernandez while engaging in the drug conspiracy charged in count seven.the term while engaging in means more than coincidence in time with a drug conspiracy.it requires not only that the crime occur during the time period covered by the drug conspiracy,but also that the killing be related in some meaningful way to the drug conspiracy.moreover,the defendant participation in the killing must be related to the drug conspiracy.
you may find that the killing was related to the drug conspiracy if you find that there was a connection between the defendant role in the killing and his participation in the drug conspiracy.for example,if you find,as the government has alleged,that the defendant knowingly and intentionally killed or counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or caused the intentional killing of jose fernandez by using his access to the conspiracy drugs or a drug debt that arose during the conspiracy to recruit others in furtherance of the murder scheme,this element would be satisfied.
request to charge at.with exceptions not relevant here,caraballo counsel generally join ed in the government proposed instructions.letter from david stern to raymond dearie at.nevertheless,the court used only the first proposed paragraph in its charge to the jury,omitting the second without objection from either side.
judgment and appeal 
the jury found caraballo guilty of the nine crimes detailed above,see supra at,including the e a charge for killing jose fernandez.the jury declined to impose the death penalty,and the district court sentenced caraballo principally to five concurrent terms of life imprisonment.a judgment of conviction reflecting that sentence was entered on september.caraballo timely filed notice of this appeal.
ii.discussion 
caraballo sufficiency challenge and standard of review 
caraballo contends that his e a conviction for the murder of jose fernandez can not stand because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that he committed this murder while engaging in an offense punishable under b a.relying on united states desinor,in which this court observed that the engaging in element of e a did not require the government to prove that a motive was the sole,primary,or most important reason for a killing as long as it was one purpose,at,caraballo submits that the trial evidence in this case was insufficient to satisfy even this modest requirement because his sole motivation for the fernandez murder was his romantic relationship with quincy martinez,a circumstance unrelated to the charged drug distribution conspiracy,appellant br.at.
the rule of constitutional sufficiency derived from the due process clause instructs that a conviction can not be obtained except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.in re winship,d.a defendant raising a sufficiency challenge nevertheless bears a heavy burden because a reviewing court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and uphold the conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original accord united states jones,cir.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that caraballo sufficiency challenge fails because proof that the purpose of a killing was related to a defendant drug activities is not the only means of satisfying the engaging in element of e a.here,a rational jury could find that element established by evidence that caraballo used his position in the charged drug conspiracy to effect the fernandez murder,specifically,by inducing drug confederates to participate in the killing through promises to forgive drug debts and to supply drugs in the future.
statutory text and the substantive connection requirement 
before considering caraballo argument that a killing must further some purpose to support a e a conviction,we review the statutory text,considering the ordinary or natural meaning of the words chosen by congress,as well as the placement and purpose of those words in the statutory scheme.bailey united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.we then discuss the judicial gloss on that text,including our recent decisions regarding the engaging in element of e a.
the statutory text 
section e provides,in relevant part,as follows 
in addition to the other penalties set forth in this section 
a any person engaging in or working in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise,or any person engaging in an offense punishable under section b a of this title or section b of this title who intentionally kills or counsels,commands,induces,procures,or causes the intentional killing of an individual and such killing results,shall be sentenced to any term of imprisonment,which shall not be less than years,and which may be up to life imprisonment,or may be sentenced to death 
upon a literal reading of the statute,then,a e a offense can be committed in one of three ways.first,such an offense is committed when a person kills while engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise.id.section c specifically defines how one engage s in a continuing criminal enterprise,namely,by committing a continuing series of felony drug crimes in concert with five or more other persons with respect to whom the defendant occupies a position of management and from which the defendant obtains substantial income or resources.id.c see garrett united states,d.those fitting this definition are commonly referred to as drug kingpins.see,chapman united states,d united states roman,cir.
second,a e a offense is committed when a person kills while working in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise.this phrase is not statutorily defined,but,in accordance with settled principles of interpretation,courts have given the phrase its commonly understood meaning,working to promote or advance the interests of a continuing criminal enterprise.united states cooper,cir accord united states mccullah,cir united states jones,cir.this language signals congress intent to broaden the scope of liability under e,beyond liability only for homicidal drug relatively limited class of drug traffickers to all who kill while working in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise,united states walker,aff cir,including hired henchmen who commit murder to further a drug enterprise in which they may not otherwise be intimately involved,united states mccullah,at accord united states ray,cir.
third and finally,a e a offense is committed when a person kills while engaging in an offense punishable under section b a or section b of title,while manufacturing,distributing,or importing large quantities of drugs,see id.b a,b,or conspiring to do so.as noted,caraballo was convicted of violating this prong of e a,and he does not argue that the government failed to prove that the predicate drug conspiracy was ongoing at the time he and his confederates killed fernandez.
the substantive connection requirement 
section e was enacted as part of the abuse act of,stat.as prosecutions commenced under this provision,a question promptly arose not expressly answered by the plain text whether the killing in question must be related in some way to the continuing criminal enterprise or drug offense that the defendant is charged with engaging in or working in furtherance of,or whether it is sufficient that the killing occur contemporaneously with the conduct specified in the statute.courts universally concluded that a substantive,and not merely temporal,connection is required in order to sustain a conviction under e a.see,united states jones,at requiring a substantive connection between the killing and the continuing criminal enterprise united states tipton,cir a substantive connection between the murder and the drug offense must be implied as an essential element of e.united states chandler,cir same united states tidwell,no.civ,wl,at,same united states pitera,same united states whiting,same.
courts required a substantive connection between the defendant drug activities and the charged killing in part to address the concern that,absent such a requirement,e a would be subject to constitutional challenge on commerce clause grounds.see united states jin fuey moy.holmes,a statute must be construed,if fairly possible,so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional,but also grave doubts upon that score.united states,cr,wl,at,noting that requiring relationship between drug conspiracy and killing avoids potential constitutional infirmities under united states lopez,d united states tidwell,wl,at analyzing defendant lopez challenge to
