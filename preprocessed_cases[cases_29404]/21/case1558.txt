background 
in may a police officer saw a vehicle run a red light.david lynch was a passenger in the back seat of the vehicle.when the police officer stopped the vehicle,he saw lynch moving his hands around in the back seat.lynch refused to show his hands,and after an ensuing struggle with the police officers,lynch was handcuffed and subdued.a pat down of lynch revealed a loaded firearm.lynch was already a convicted felon and thus was indicted as a felon in possession of a firearm under g.the government asserted that lynch was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence under the acca because he previously had been convicted of three violent felonies and was currently charged with violating g lynch prior new york felony convictions were for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in attempted robbery in the second degree in and attempted burglary in the third degree in.
in march,lynch appeared before judge berman to plead guilty to the indictment.he did not concede,however,that he was subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence under the acca he noted that he intended to press the issue before the district court.later,lynch argued that his convictions for attempted burglary and criminal possession of a weapon were not for violent felonies as defined by the acca 
the attempted burglary conviction 
in,lynch pled guilty to attempted burglary in the third degree in violation of new york penal law in nassau county superior court.section provides that a person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.a related section of the penal law defines building as any structure,vehicle or watercraft used for overnight lodging of persons,or used by persons for carrying on business therein,or used as an elementary or secondary school,or an inclosed motor truck,or an inclosed motor truck trailer.penal law.the criminal information charged lynch with burglary in the third degree,namely,that lynch had knowingly entered and remained unlawfully in a building known as a clothing store located at main street,hempstead,new york,with intent to commit a crime therein.nassau county super.information.lynch pled to the lesser offense of attempted burglary in the third degree,for which there was no separate charging document.the federal presentence investigation report federal psr prepared in connection with the sentencing in this case incorporated facts from the nassau county presentence report state psr authored at the time of lynch guilty plea to the attempted burglary.the federal psr stated that a ccording to a copy of a presentence report prepared by the nassau county probation department on august,lynch and three other individuals burglarized a hempstead store and stole a quantity of clothing.federal psr.although lynch and the government tried to obtain copies of the transcripts of the plea proceedings related to the attempted burglary conviction,they were both told that those transcripts no longer existed.
the criminal possession of a weapon conviction 
in,lynch pled guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in violation of new york penal law in nassau county court.section,as it read in,provided that a person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree when he possesses a or loaded firearm with intent to use the same unlawfully against another.according to both the indictment and the plea allocution,lynch possessed a loaded firearm,specifically a caliber pistol,which he used to shoot neil williams.apparently lynch and his girlfriend were in a cab together,and when lynch exited the cab,he shot williams.lynch explained at his plea allocution 
i was coming from my house,and me and neil williams,he had drawn a pistol at me and shot me in my face,and i had shot him back only to protect my own life.i was scared at the time.i did want to shoot him or anything like that.it was out of a thing of fear.i was trying to protect my own self.
plea hr g tr,at.the nassau county court accepted lynch guilty plea.
district court sentencing 
following the plea proceedings for the current offense,lynch submitted a letter to the district court in which he argued that his prior crimes of attempted burglary and criminal possession of a weapon were not violent felonies.as to the attempted burglary,lynch argued that congress did not intend to include attempted burglary in the definition of violent felony and,further,that there were insufficient facts for the court to conclude that he had attempted to commit a generic burglary the government,in its letter,responded by pointing out that lynch had pled guilty to an information that charged him with a generic burglary because it was the burglary of a store.the government further argued that attempted burglary under this particular new york statute had been held to constitute a violent felony in united states andrello,cir per curiam.
as to his conviction for criminal possession of a weapon,lynch argued that he never admitted to having the unlawful intent to use the element he asserted was a prerequisite to the crime being classified as a violent felony based on this court decision in united states danielson,cir per curiam.the government countered that having pled guilty to the particular weapons charge,lynch necessarily admitted the elements of the offense,which included both possession of the weapon and intent to use it unlawfully.
at sentencing,the district court agreed with the government arguments and found that all three of lynch prior crimes were violent felonies.with respect to lynch attempted burglary in the third degree,the district court found that it was a violent felony based upon andrello,and because a copy of the state court information made it clear that lynch pled guilty to an attempted generic burglary of a clothing store.with respect to lynch criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,the district court agreed with the government that the indictment and plea allocution showed that lynch admitted to possessing the weapon with unlawful intent to use it,specifically rejecting the argument that,at his plea proceedings in state court,lynch admitted only to possession and not to having the requisite criminal intent.citing danielson,the district court concluded that lynch criminal possession of a weapon was a violent felony the district court sentenced lynch to fifteen years imprisonment,the mandatory minimum under the acca,followed by five years supervised release and the necessary special assessment.
lynch appeals his sentence.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court determination of whether a prior offense is a violent felony under the acca.united states king,cir.
ii.applicable law 
a defendant convicted of violating g who has three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.c.in pertinent part,the term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b ii emphasis added.for lynch two prior offenses,the attempted burglary and the criminal possession of a weapon,to constitute violent felonies under the acca,they would have to fall under the residual,or otherwise,clause in e b ii,because neither would qualify as one of the four enumerated offenses.
to determine whether a prior offense is a violent felony for purposes of the acca,we use a categorical approach.united states rosa,cir citing taylor united states,d.taylor instructs that the sentencing court must look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.taylor,at.in a narrow range of cases,the sentencing court may go beyond the mere fact of conviction where the statute of conviction covers both conduct that would and conduct that would not constitute a violent felony.id.in such cases,the sentencing court may also consult the charging documents and jury instructions to determine whether the conviction was for conduct that falls under the definition of violent felony.id.
iii.attempted burglary is a violent felony 
lynch argues,as he did below,that his conviction for attempted burglary in the third degree is not for a violent felony.his argument fails because this court decision in united states andrello,cir per curiam,and the supreme court recent decision in james united states,d,compel the conclusion that the attempted burglary of which lynch was convicted is a violent felony under the acca.
in andrello,this court held that the crime of attempted burglary in the third degree under new york law,the same crime at issue here,constitutes a violent felony because it falls under the acca residual provision.at.there,we looked to new york law and found that in order for a defendant to be convicted of attempted burglary,the defendant must have carried the project forward within dangerous proximity to the criminal end to be attained,and that mere preparation was not enough.id.at quoting people bracey,internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,this court explained that 
since burglary itself is a crime that inherently involves a risk of personal injury,the crime of attempted burglary under new york law,which requires proof of conduct that would present a serious potential risk of attainment,must be considered a crime that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
id.at united states brown,cir applying andrello to hold that third degree burglary under new york law is a crime of violence under a.we added the fact that the underlying substantive offense may not be accomplished is not pertinent.id.at.
the supreme court recent decision in james,holding that attempted burglary under florida law is a violent felony under the acca.at,confirms the soundness of our reasoning in andrello the court concluded that attempted burglary fell under the residual provision of the acca,id.at,as a crime that otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,e b ii.it explained that attempted burglary,as defined by florida law is an offense that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,because florida law requires an overt act for attempted burglary and because such an attempt poses the same kind of risks as a completed burglary.id.quoting e b ii the court commented that while the statutory language defining attempt is broad,the florida supreme court has considerably narrowed its application in the context of attempted burglary,requiring an overt act directed toward entering or remaining in a structure or conveyance.id.at quoting jones state,so d.such an overt act toward committing a burglary,said the court,would pose the same kind of risk as,or an even greater risk than,that posed by a completed burglary because the main risk arises from the possibility of a confrontation between the burglar and a third an occupant,a police officer,or a comes to investigate.id.at.the court explained that while many completed burglaries do not involve such confrontations,attempted burglaries often do because it is often just such outside intervention that prevents the attempt from ripening into completion.id.at.
the reasoning of both andrello and james applies equally in this case and compels the conclusion that lynch attempted burglary is a violent felony for purposes of the acca.under new york law,a person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein,penal law,and is guilty of attempt when he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime,id.presaging the supreme court analysis of comparable florida law in james,we said in andrello that the new york courts have narrowed the definition of attempt to require proof of conduct that carr ies the project to within dangerous proximity of its accomplishment.andrello,at.we went on to conclude that because burglary inherently involves a risk of personal injury and because attempted burglary requires proof that the defendant could potentially attain the fruition of such inherently risky behavior,attempted burglary is indeed a crime that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.id.at quoting e b ii.where a defendant like lynch has come within dangerous proximity to having completed the burglary,such conduct certainly presents the possibility of a confrontation between the burglar and a third party who comes to investigate.james.at.following james,therefore,we reaffirm our holding in andrello that attempted burglary in the third degree under new york law constitutes a violent felony cognizable under the acca.
lynch asserts two other arguments,both of which lack merit.he first argues,relying on shepard united states,d,that because new york burglary statute is and because he never admitted to any facts in his plea that would support a finding that he attempted to commit a generic burglary,the acca can not apply this argument misses the mark.while a conviction must qualify as a generic burglary to fit within the specific statutory reference to burglary in e b ii identifying as a violent felony any crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,a burglary may nevertheless qualify as a violent felony under the statute residual provision.this conclusion derives from the supreme court decision in james,which rejected james argument that the florida attempted burglary offense could not be a violent felony because the burglary statute is.james.at.it explained that while florida burglary statute is not limited to generic burglary,
that conclusion is not dispositive,because the government does not argue that james conviction for attempted burglary constitutes burglary under e b ii.rather,it relies on the residual provision of that clause,the court has cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of,but nevertheless similar to,generic burglary.
id.at citing taylor,at.just as we need not address whether lynch conviction was for an attempt to commit a generic burglary,we need not consider lynch argument that the district court considered impermissible evidence in making that determination 
lynch second argument,that congress did not intend to include attempted burglary as a violent felony under the acca,is also unavailing.the supreme court in james specifically rejected james argument that the residual provision should be read to extend to completed offenses only,reasoning that nothing in the plain language of the residual clause prohibits attempt offenses from qualifying as acca predicates when they involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.id.at.the court also rejected james argument that the legislative history of the acca indicated that congress did not intend to include attempt offenses in the residual provision.id.at.instead it concluded that neither the statutory text nor the legislative history discloses any congressional intent to categorically exclude attempt offenses from the scope of e b ii residual provision.id.we need go no further.
