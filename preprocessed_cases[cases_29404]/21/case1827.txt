defendant herbie noel appeals from a judgment of conviction entered by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york frederic block,judge on two counts of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,for each of which defendant was principally sentenced to months imprisonment,and one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana,for which he was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,all sentences to run concurrently.the indictment did not charge,nor did the jury find,either the quantity of marijuana involved in any of the counts or whether the defendant received any remuneration in connection therewith.defendant appeal presents two important questions arising from the supreme court landmark decision in apprendi new jersey,d,and this circuit application of that decision to the principal federal narcotics statute.first,defendant lodges a facial challenge to the constitutionality of on the ground that the statute impermissibly in light of apprendi removes findings of drug quantity from juries and that there is no permissible saving construction of the statute.second,defendant argues that,even if constitutional,the default provision for marijuana,the statutory provision which sets the maximum term of imprisonment to which a defendant may be sentenced absent an indictment and jury finding as to the maximum term found in b,not the term prescribed in b d.we reject defendant challenge to constitutionality and find that the default provision for marijuana is the term of b d.we further agree with the government that any resulting error in the month sentence for the conspiracy count did not affect defendant substantial rights because it did not affect his overall term of imprisonment.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
defendant noel was an employee of the port authority of new york and new jersey the port authority,which has primary responsibility for the operation of the three major airports serving new york city,including john kennedy airport jfk.defendant worked for the port authority at jfk,and by virtue of his position with the port authority he had access to certain restricted areas of the airport,including areas from which luggage arriving on international flights could be retrieved without subjecting it to scrutiny by the united states customs service.the government alleged that defendant used this position to smuggle shipments of narcotics into the united states.
defendant was prosecuted pursuant to a superseding indictment,dated september,which charged him with six counts,to all of which he pled not guilty one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine two counts of attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine one count of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana and two counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.defendant was acquitted after a jury trial on the three counts this appeal concerns,and reference will be made,only to the remaining three counts.none of the counts alleged any quantity of marijuana involved in the offenses nor any fact related to remuneration.however,the parenthetical statutory references following each count referenced specific penalty provisions on the conspiracy count,b b vii the provision for offenses involving kilograms or more of marijuana,and on the two counts,b d the maximum provision for less than kilograms of marijuana.
trial commenced on november.the government case was based largely on the testimony of two cooperating defendants,rodney smith and donald gordon,both of whom were baggage handlers employed by triangle aviation services.both men testified to several occasions between and their arrest in when allegedly they retrieved suitcases full of marijuana at jfk,bypassed customs,and delivered the suitcases to noel in exchange for payment.the government introduced corroborating evidence in the form of phone and pager records detailing various phone calls and pages among the defendants.smith and gordon were arrested after an undercover agent arranged with them to recover shipments of cocaine at jfk in a like manner,and they implicated noel in both the cocaine and marijuana shipments.
the jury returned verdicts of guilty on the marijuana counts on november.the defendant did not request,and the jury was not charged,to determine the amount of marijuana involved in any of the offenses.
prior to sentencing,defendant expressed his dissatisfaction with his trial attorney and acquired new counsel.at sentencing on january,defendant contested not only the evidence of the quantity of marijuana involved in the conspiracy but also the standard to be applied,arguing that at least as to uncharged conduct the court should apply a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence,given the significant effect it could have on the overall sentence.sent.tr.although the district court and,indeed,defense counsel recognized that this argument had largely been rejected by this circuit the district court erred on the side of caution and found beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved at least kilograms of marijuana,resulting in a base offense level of under.sent.tr.the district court found the two substantive counts involved and kilograms,respectively.applying a enhancement for the defendant supervisory role under a,the district court sentenced the defendant principally to months above the midpoint of the applicable guideline range the district court also imposed a fine.judgment was entered on february,and defendant filed a notice of appeal that same day.
on april,defense counsel filed a motion in this court requesting a extension of time in which to file defendant initial brief which was due on april.the moving papers stated the reason for seeking the extension as the difficulty appellate counsel had in obtaining the case file from trial counsel,but also stated as follows 
additionally,the appellant anticipates filing a motion in the district court pursuant to within the next few weeks.granting the requested enlargement of time would enable us to determine whether this case can be resolved through such a motion in the district court.in the event the motion is denied,a consolidated appeal would be the most expeditious manner in which to resolve all issues in this case.that would be possible by granting the requested day enlargement of time.
the supporting affidavit of appellate counsel stated further that 
i t is our view that,in the event we are not successful in the trial court on the petition,the most efficient and expeditious course of action in this case would be a consolidation of the direct appeal with the appeal from a denial of the petition,thereby enabling all issues to be resolved one way or the other in one forum at one time.obviously,if we are successful with the motion,we would move to dismiss the appeal and we would not need to burden this court.
we plan to file noel petition within the next four weeks.the issues involved are not complex and we should be able to arrive at a resolution of the issues within a short time frame.indeed,it is our hope that we can resolve those issues within a time frame that would enable us to meet the briefing schedule as extended pursuant to this motion.in the event we are not successful with the petition,we would immediately move to consolidate the appeal.
this court granted defendant a extension on april.the order granting the extension contained a handwritten notation by a staff attorney of the court that p arties could stipulate to withdraw appeal pending resolution of motion.
on may,the court received from defendant a stipulation which stated that the appeal would be removed from the docket.on may,defendant counsel wrote to the court to confirm a telephone conversation he had apparently had with a representative of the clerk of the court.according to defense counsel letter,the clerk office had informed him that the stipulation needed to state that the appeal was being withdrawn,and that the stipulation required the defendant signature authorizing the withdrawal.in the letter,counsel authorized the court to alter the stipulation to read withdrawn,assured the court that a statement of authorization from defendant would be forthcoming shortly,and also stated that 
as we discussed,and as the stipulation provides,the point is that we have agreed to stay the appeal pending a resolution before the trial court of a motion under,with the idea that a consolidated appeal would better serve the interests in judicial economy.so,while we are withdrawing the appeal now,it is with the right to reinstate it,if necessary,following a decision by the trial court on noel petition.
no letter of approval from defendant was forthcoming,however,and on june,this court ordered the defective stipulation stricken from the docket for failure to comply with the signature requirement of fed.b and then dismissed the appeal for failure of defendant to file his appellant brief within the extended time allotted.the letter was accompanied by directions from the clerk stating that,if it had been the defendant intention to withdraw the appeal,a signed stipulation along with a request to reinstate the appeal and a motion to file out of time were required to be submitted within twenty days.on june,defense counsel wrote to a staff attorney of this court detailing his efforts to obtain defendant signature and explaining that difficulty with the prison mail system had caused the delay.the letter also asked the staff attorney to please advise as to the procedure for removing the default and reinstating the appeal so that we can have it withdrawn instead pursuant to our stipulation,with leave to prosecute the appeal,if necessary,after we litigate the motion in the district court.on july,defendant filed a motion to reinstate his appeal and for permission to file a withdrawal stipulation out of time on july,this court granted the motion only to the extent that the appeal is reinstated.
this court received from defendant a revised stipulation to withdraw his appeal,executed by all parties,on july.the stipulation stated,in its entirety,as follows 
it is hereby stipulated by and between the parties,subject to the approval of the court,that the appeal of herbie noel be withdrawn upon the following conditions 
that within days of notice of the decision of the district court on appellant motion,appellant shall move to restore this appeal to the calendar and 
that within fourteen days of said restoring of the appeal to the calendar,appellant brief and appendix shall be served on appellee and filed with the court.
the stipulation was signed for the court by a staff attorney and filed on july.
despite defense counsel representations that a motion would be filed within a few weeks and his professed hope that the resolution of that motion might even precede completion of briefing of the appeal,defendant did not file his motion until some two and years later,on december.the district court denied both the motion and,sua sponte,a certificate of appealability coa,on august,the order denying the motion was entered on the district court docket sheet on august along with a notation that copies were mailed to counsel by judge block chambers.subsequently,on august,the clerk of this court received a letter from defendant counsel,dated august,which stated as follows 
on july,as to appellant herbie wayne noel,the appeal was suspended and held in abeyance pending the prosecution of a motion in the district court under in the case.i have just received notice by mail that on august,the district judge entered an order denying noel motion under.accordingly,the appeal is now due to be reinstated and a briefing schedule can now be set for the direct appeal.
it is not clear to me exactly how to proceed most efficiently.the purpose of the suspension of the appeal was to allow all of the issues to be consolidated in one vehicle to avoid excess litigation.however,it would appear that noel will need to file a separate notice of appeal within days of august,and pursue the certificate of appealability process as to the motion the district court denied a certificate of appealability as part of the order,thereby making the matter ripe for noel to seek the certificate from this court while this direct appeal is ready to proceed.i would appreciate any thoughts on the matter.if they can still be consolidated that would seem to be helpful all around,although i can not,of course,speak for government counsel.
a reinstatement order was issued by the clerk of this court on september,which stated that a n order withdrawing the appeal of,herbie noel,having been entered on and the counsel for the having filed the necessary papers,upon consideration thereof it is ordered that the appeal be,and it hereby is reinstated.the remainder of the procedural history before this court is of no significance to this appeal.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we first address two issues of this court jurisdiction.the first we raise sua sponte in furtherance of our obligation to assess our own jurisdiction at the outset of every appeal,see goldberg cablevision,cir is whether we have jurisdiction over defendant direct appeal from his judgment of conviction.the second,urged by the government,is whether we have jurisdiction to review the denial of his motion attacking that conviction.
a.the direct appeal 
our concern over our jurisdiction on the direct appeal arises from the fact that,on its face,we have a voluntary withdrawal of an appeal by defendant followed by a request to reinstate the appeal some three and years after entry of the judgment appealed beyond the ten days for appeal allowed by fed.b.were this any other issue besides the timeliness of the appeal,we might ignore this apparent procedural irregularity and proceed directly to the merits,on the ground that any procedural indeed there was implicitly both invited and approved by this court.however,not only are the time limits of fed.mandatory and jurisdictional,united states ex rel.mcallan city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d,these time limits are the one procedural area which courts of appeal are expressly forbidden from altering or suspending in an individual case,see fed.we therefore must address the issue of our jurisdiction 
we begin by noting that we approved the procedure followed of a direct appeal of a conviction followed by reinstatement of the appeal upon the district court decision on a motion directed to that united states hernandez,cir.the defendant in hernandez simultaneously filed both a notice of appeal from his conviction and a motion.on motion to this court,we granted the defendant request to withdraw the appeal without prejudice to reinstatement by written notice to the clerk of the court within days of the district court decision on the motion.id.at.after the district court denied the motion,we concluded that we had jurisdiction to review,as a direct appeal,the district court denial of defendant motion to suppress certain evidence in the criminal case 
we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider hernandez claim that the district court improperly denied his suppression motion.hernandez timely filed his notice of appeal for his direct appeal.we granted his motion for withdrawal of his direct appeal without prejudice,and he complied with our instructions for reinstatement of his appeal.therefore,the suppression issue is properly before us.
id.footnote omitted.we did not,however,further explain the basis for our jurisdiction,nor,apparently,was any question of the consistency of this practice with fed.brought to our attention.the power of this court to reinstate a voluntarily withdrawn appeal at any power perhaps conditioned on compliance with certain prerequisites,a time period within which to request reinstatement seems to have been assumed.
we need not test that assumption here because,despite its label,the stipulation withdrawing the appeal was not,in fact,a withdrawal.in determining the proper procedural treatment of a paper filed with the court,we have consistently eschewed reliance on the denomination given it by a party in favor of examining its purpose or function.see mcallan,at treating motion for reconsideration under district court local rule as a motion under.e for purposes of tolling the time to file notice of appeal smith barry,d courts must look to see whether paper filed is the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal in order to assess compliance with fed.
a withdrawal of an appeal is an expression of the intent of the parties principally,of course,the appellant not to pursue the appeal any further and brings the appeal to an end defendant here,however,clearly never intended to abandon his direct appeal.indeed,he initially requested an extension of time to file holding the appeal in the motion,and he submitted the stipulation that the appeal be withdrawn apparently only because of the suggestion of a staff attorney that he do so and,more importantly,the refusal of the clerk office to accept anything else.defendant correspondence with this court continually referred to the direct appeal as being in suspension or abeyance.moreover,there is no indication that the government or this court understood this to be the end of the appeal.we,therefore,will consider the stipulation of withdrawal filed with and signed by this court as a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance and a grant of that power we unquestionably have under the federal rules of appellate procedure thus,the jurisdiction over the direct appeal which vested in this court upon defendant filing of the notice of appeal in february has remained with this court throughout 
finally,this construction of our own jurisdiction does not call into question the district court adjudication of the motion,because there is no jurisdictional bar to a district court adjudication of a motion during the pendency of a direct appeal.see derango united states,cir united states taylor,cir womack united states.any concern over such a practice is one of judicial economy and the concern that the results on direct appeal may make the district court efforts on the motion a nullity.united states rodgers,cir the divestiture of jurisdiction rule is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy,designed to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two courts at the same time.quoting united states salerno,cir.the district court therefore had jurisdiction to decide defendant motion.
b.the motion 
the government nonetheless contends that we have no jurisdiction to review the district court denial of defendant motion because defendant filed no notice of appeal from the denial order and no coa was granted,as required by.we disagree with the government on the first point but concur on the second.
we start by noting that we specifically held in hernandez that a notice of appeal is required to bring the denial of a defendant motion before this court defendant can not rely on our jurisdiction over the direct appeal.see hernandez,at see also united states means,cir.in an attempt to evade the clear mandate of hernandez,defendant raises several arguments as to why communications with this court staff led counsel to believe that,hernandez notwithstanding,no notice of appeal from the district court denial was necessary.for example,defense counsel claims that,having asked in the august reinstatement letter to the court how best to proceed with the appeal,and having received no answer,he assumed that the september order reinstating the direct appeal was the,that its reference to having filed the necessary papers indicated no further paperwork was necessary for the appeal of the motion despite its patently clear reference to the direct appeal.our overriding response to this argument is that not only did this court staff say nothing which could be remotely construed as indicating that no notice of appeal was necessary,even if they had our staff have no more power to overrule our precedent than this panel does.our staff attorneys and clerk office are extraordinarily helpful,but they are not charged with performing counsel legal research for them.nor,as urged by defendant,do we have the equitable power to excuse compliance with fed.requirement of the filing of a notice of appeal,even if the equities were in his favor.see smith,at.rule dictates are jurisdictional in nature,and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review.
it is undisputed that defendant filed no formal notice of appeal with the district court from the denial of his motion.the inquiry does not,however,end there we must determine whether he filed any paper which can be reasonably construed as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal.haugen nassau county dep t of social,cir means,at.in order to suffice as a notice of appeal,a paper must specify the party or parties taking the appeal,designate the judgment,order,or part thereof appealed from,name the court to which the appeal is taken,and specifically indicate the litigant intent to seek appellate review.haugen,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we find that the august letter from defense counsel requesting reinstatement of the direct appeal suffices as a notice of appeal from the denial of defendant motion as well.the letter was,first of all,timely,having been received by this court within sixty days of the date on which the order appealed from was entered on the district court docket sheet the reinstatement letter discussion of how best to consolidate an appeal of the motion with the direct appeal specifies the party,order,and court involved in the appeal the only question is whether it sufficiently evinces a definite intent to appeal.there would be little reason for defendant counsel question as to how to consolidate the appeals if there were to be nothing to,no appeal on the motion.we have previously held that intent to appeal may be inferred from a letter questioning how to proceed with an appeal.see grune coughlin,cir.true,grune involved a pro se appellant,but we find the inference no less valid here.under the circumstances,we believe that there could be no genuine doubt as to defendant intent to appeal the denial of his motion and that the letter sufficed to put the other parties and this court on notice of that intent see haugen,at requiring indication of intent to appeal ensure s that the filing provides sufficient notice to other parties and the courts quoting smith,at.becker montgomery,d excusing lack of signature on notice of appeal on ground that imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing,from what judgment,to which appellate court.we therefore deem the reinstatement letter as a notice of appeal from the district court order denying defendant motion.
our jurisdictional inquiry has one more step,however,and that is defendant failure to secure a coa,as required by c.the district court denied a coa and defendant presented no request for a coa to this court as permitted by fed.b.having construed the august letter as a notice of appeal,however,we will also construe it as a request for a coa.see fed.b if no express request for a certificate is filed,the notice of appeal constitutes a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.hooper united states,cir lozada united states,cir.defendant having briefed the denial of his motion on the merits,he has been afford ed the opportunity to make the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right required by c.lozada,at see hooper,at denying coa on the basis of the appellate briefing.on the basis of that briefing,and for substantially the reasons stated by the district court we deny the request for the coa and dismiss the appeal from the denial of defendant motion.
ii.the constitutionality of after apprendi 
we now turn to the merits of defendant direct appeal.defendant attacks his convictions and sentence based on the intervening supreme court decision in apprendi,benefit of which defendant receives because his conviction is still under direct review.see griffith kentucky,d.because defendant did not raise any objections below,however,we review his claims only for plain error.see united states thomas,cir en banc.our first task under the plain error test is to determine whether there is any cognizable error at all.see id.
defendant first claim of error is that apprendi renders and therefore as well unconstitutional on its face,and therefore his convictions,not merely his sentence,must be vacated.we join every other circuit to have addressed this argument in rejecting it.see united states,cir united states buckland,cir en banc united states kelly,cir united states mcallister,cir united states cernobyl,cir united states martinez,cir united states brough,cir,cert.denied,d united states slaughter,cir,cert.denied,d see also united states candelario,cir,cert.denied,d.
the defendant in apprendi was convicted of possession of a firearm with an unlawful purpose,a offense punishable under new jersey law by a maximum of ten years imprisonment.at sentencing,the trial judge applied a sentencing enhancement statute under new jersey law which provided that,if the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that a crime was motivated by racial bias,the maximum penalty for a offense was twenty years.apprendi,at.the supreme court vacated the sentence,holding what it had only suggested before in jones united states,d that under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment,o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.
we applied the teachings of apprendi to in thomas.with respect to controlled substances,contains two subparts a,entitled unlawful acts,which outlaws certain actions manufacture,possession with intent to distribute,distribution,involving those substances and b,entitled penalties,which lays out the terms of imprisonment which may be imposed for the unlawful acts of subsection a.the ranges of possible prison terms increase in tiers from years through,depending on the quantity of controlled substance involved in the threshold quantity for each tier varying with the type of controlled substance involved the variation from this scheme for marijuana will be discussed in more detail below.in thomas,we concluded that if the type and quantity of drugs involved in a charged crime may be used to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum for an indeterminate quantity of drugs,then the type and quantity of drugs is an element of the offense that must be charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury.id.at.because thomas sentence of months exceeded the statutory maximum for an indeterminate amount of,months under b c and was based on a quantity of cocaine neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,we found constitutional error under apprendi and vacated for resentencing to months.id.at.
defendant facial challenge to the constitutionality of is as follows first,in light of apprendi,it is no longer permissible to construe the threshold drug quantities of b as sentencing factors to be determined by a judge rather than jury.clearly,in light of thomas,we agree with the opening premise.second,defendant urges,if drug quantities are elements of offenses,then a is a disjointed criminal statute,which prescribes no penalty and which,therefore can not constitutionally serve as the basis for a criminal conviction,in that it does not create a crime as a matter of law.we part company with defendant on this proposition.
first,as we made clear in thomas,drug quantity becomes an element of the offense under only where the type and quantity of drugs involved may be used to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum for an indeterminate quantity of drugs.at.thus,an indictment today which charged a violation of a and included no allegation of drug quantity would state a crime and be a perfectly valid indictment.moreover,contrary to defendant suggestion,there is a prescribed penalty for such a crime the provisions of b which prescribe a penalty for an indeterminate quantity of drugs,for most controlled substances,b c.the determination of the provision for an indeterminate amount of marijuana is addressed below.
second,we see no constitutional problem presented by the government charging drug quantities that support penalties greater than those of the provisions relating to indeterminate,those instances where drug quantities become elements of the offense.true,in such a situation a no longer presents the entire offense one element of the crime drug quantity is to be found in b instead.defendant offers,however,no persuasive reason why subsection a must stand alone,and we see none.we agree with the seventh circuit in brough that i t makes no constitutional difference whether a single subsection covers both elements and penalties,whether these are divided across multiple subsections as does,or even whether they are scattered across multiple statutes.brough,at.see also apprendi,at.m erely because the state legislature placed its hate crime sentence enhancer within the sentencing provisions of the criminal code does not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element of the offense.quoting state apprendi.
to the extent that defendant is arguing that we can not reconcile a construction of which requires drug quantity to be an offense element with congress intent to make drug quantity a sentencing factor,we reject the argument.simply put,congress has expressed no such intent.it is true that we had previously held drug quantity to be a sentencing factor to be found by the judge,see,united states campuzano,cir,overruled by thomas,at.but there is nothing in is there usually in federal criminal specifies a division of responsibility between judge and jury as to drug quantity.see buckland,at.in respect to this statute at least,that division is,and in this circuit always has been,a judicially crafted overlay based on constitutional principles apprendi significantly altered our understanding of those principles and so too our interpretation of the statute.see id.at brough,at.we therefore reject defendant constitutional challenge to.
iii.the marijuana sentencing provisions of 
defendant second claim of error below is that the district court sentenced him on each count to greater than the statutory maximum for offenses involving an indeterminate amount of marijuana.because no quantity of marijuana was charged in the indictment,nor was drug quantity submitted to the jury,such a sentence would be error under apprendi and thomas as alluded to above,while b c provides the default provision,as it were,for most controlled substances,the question of just what the statutory maximum for an indeterminate amount of marijuana is somewhat more difficult.
there are five provisions in b relating to marijuana 
b a vii provides for a term of imprisonment of years to life imprisonment for a violation of a involving kilograms or more of marijuana 
b b vii provides for a term of imprisonment of to years for a violation involving kilograms or more 
b c provides,except as provided in subparagraphs a,b,and d,for a term of imprisonment of up to years for a violation involving any schedule i or ii controlled substance 
b d provides for a penalty of up to years for a violation involving less than kilograms of marijuana,except as provided in paragraphs and of this subsection and 
b provides that n otwithstanding paragraph d of this subsection,any person who violates subsection a of this section by distributing a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration shall be treated as provided in section of this title and section of title.
section of title covers offenses involving simple possession and provides for a maximum imprisonment of year.
defendant argues that,absent an indictment and jury finding with respect to quantity,the maximum allowable sentence is one year under b.the government argues,on the other hand,that the appropriate default provision is five years under b d we agree with the government.
we believe that congress intended that b be a mitigating exception to the provision of b d.first,as indicated by the introductory phrase of b notwithstanding paragraph d of this subsection,distribution of a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration is an activity prohibited by a and covered by the penalty provisions of b d,and therefore represents an exception to an otherwise applicable penalty.second,there is reason to consider the activity mostly contemplated by b namely,the sharing of small amounts of marijuana in social be not just one of lesser degree than those covered by b d but of a different type more akin to simple possession than to provisions intended to cover traffickers the legislative history of this amendment suggests that congress took exactly this view.see,cong.rec,statement of hughes t rafficking provisions should apply to the large distributor,rather than to the person who is only using the drug with his friends.
apprendi,however,specifically noted and reaffirmed the distinction between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation.apprendi,at.the court there noted that where a judge finds a fact which allows a defendant to escape the statutory maximum attached to a jury verdict,that finding by the judge neither expos es the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute,nor is the judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone.id.the court thereby expressly stated that the concerns animating its decision were absent in such a mitigating scheme.defendant interpretation of apprendi,in contrast,would largely prohibit congress from establishing facts in mitigation of punishment,because any attempt to do so would necessarily result in having to submit to the jury the question of the negating of these mitigating facts in order to support a punishment greater than that prescribed in the mitigating provision.for example,as defendant argues here,defendants would have to be sentenced under the provision of b unless the jury found the absence of the facts in that mitigating,that the distribution was for remuneration.this would effectively rewrite an otherwise valid criminal neither done nor authorized in apprendi.we do not believe apprendi in any way calls into question the power of congress to establish mitigating exceptions to otherwise complete offenses.
fundamentally,we believe defendant mistake is to misread apprendi not for what it actually says but for the way it has been applied.that is,defendant argues,paraphrasing united states lowe,d,that the ladder for the distribution of marijuana begins with the lowest statutory maximum provision found at b.see id.at b is the first rung of the penalty ladder for the offense of distribution of marijuana.it,therefore,according to defendant,must represent the default provision for apprendi purposes,and any facts differentiating b from provisions with higher statutory maximums must be considered offense elements of those provisions.
this methodology,despite its surface appeal,is nowhere to be found in apprendi.apprendi stated that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the converse proposition,however,is equally true any fact that decreases the penalty for a crime need not be so treated.see id.at.in applying apprendi to two or more statutory provisions,therefore,we believe the proper baseline or default provision is not the provision with the lowest penalty,but rather the one which states a complete crime upon the fewest facts.the competing provisions must then be analyzed to determine what effect their additional facts have on the maximum punishment prescribed in the baseline if a fact increases that punishment,it must be treated as an offense element otherwise,it need not be 
applying this test to the competing positions in this case,it is clear that b d,not b,is the baseline provision,because the latter requires at least one,absence of required by the former.because this additional fact does not increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,it need not be treated as an offense element.the statutory maximum for an indeterminate amount of marijuana,therefore,is the provision of b d.
iv.substantial rights 
because we have determined that the statutory maximum penalty for an indeterminate amount of marijuana under b is five years,there is no error with respect to defendant sixty month sentences on the two possession counts.defendant sentence on the conspiracy count of months is unconstitutional,however,in light of apprendi.moreover,this error is plain.see thomas,at error is plain if it is clear or obvious at time of appellate review.we must therefore decide whether this error affect ed defendant substantial rights.id.at.we hold that it did not.
under our modified rule,applied where,as here,the source of plain error is a supervening decision,the government,not the defendant,bears the burden to demonstrate that the error did not affect substantial,that the error was harmless.see united states monteleone,cir the government claims that this error is harmless because,under the stacking provisions of the sentencing guidelines,see d,even if defendant sentence on the conspiracy count is changed to sixty months,his total term of imprisonment months will not change the conspiracy count will merely be run consecutively to the possession counts to the extent necessary to achieve that term we agree with the government.we recently held,in united states rivera,cir,that if the district court had meant to impose a sentence on an conviction that exceeded the default maximum of twenty years it was unclear that the district court had done so,any apprendi error resulting from that sentence was nevertheless harmless because the defendant had also been sentenced to a concurrent term of life imprisonment on a continuing criminal enterprise cce count under.see rivera,at because cook could properly be sentenced to life imprisonment on the cce count,a concurrent sentence on other counts is irrelevant to the time he will serve in prison,and we can think of no collateral consequences from such erroneous concurrent sentences that would justify vacating them.although rivera did not involve application of stacking,the an erroneous sentence on one count of a conviction does not affect substantial rights where the total term of imprisonment remains equally applicable here.we see no basis to distinguish this case from rivera.like the panel in united states mclean,cir,before whom this issue was simultaneously under consideration,we agree that we should join with our sister circuits in holding that where a defendant is convicted on multiple counts,any error in exceeding the statutory maximum on a single count is harmless if the application of would require the sentence on one or more of the remaining counts to be run consecutively so that defendant total term of imprisonment remains unchanged.see buckland,at united states angle,cir en banc united states price,cir united states smith,cir united states sturgis,cir,cert.denied,d united states page,cir,cert.denied,d.
we reject defendant contention that,because at this point he has already served more than sixty months in prison,our holding that the maximum allowable sentence on the conspiracy count is sixty months should lead to his immediate other words,that the district court should not be allowed to alter the concurrent running of the sentences.we rejected a similar argument in united states triestman,cir.there,defendant triestman had been convicted of a drug trafficking offense under,for which he received a sentence of months,and using or carrying a firearm in connection with that offense under c,for which he received a consecutive sentence of months.following the supreme court ruling in bailey united states,d,triestman successfully filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under to vacate his c conviction.however,the district court also resentenced triestman on his drug trafficking count,applying a level sentence enhancement under b which had previously been unavailable because of the c conviction,thus resulting in a sentence of though at the time of the resentencing he had a
