jan carlo oquendo garcia appeals his sentence for aiding and abetting the possession of a rifle in furtherance of a crime,c a.he argues that the court imposed an month incarcerative sentence in violation of.h and that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.finding no errors,we affirm.
following a routine vehicle stop which escalated into a police pursuit,law enforcement officers arrested oquendo garcia and joshua molina velazquez.searches of their persons,the vehicle,and the surrounding area yielded drugs,guns,ammunition,and cash.as a result,the government charged both individuals with possessing marijuana with intent to distribute,a,and possessing a rifle in furtherance of that crime,c a.oquendo garcia pled guilty to the gun offense,and the government dismissed the drug count.molina velazquez pled guilty to both.
as a result of his plea,oquendo garcia faced a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of months in prison.c a i.section b of the sentencing guidelines adopts that mandatory minimum as the recommended guidelines sentence,and the probation department applied it in oquendo garcia report.nonetheless,the district court determined that an month sentence was more appropriate,given oquendo garcia extensive criminal history.oquendo garcia immediately moved for reconsideration,which the district court denied.he then timely filed this appeal.
when appropriate,we apply a test to evaluate the reasonableness of a criminal sentence.united states politano,cir.first,we consider whether the district court committed any procedural missteps when imposing the sentence.id.then,we ask whether the sentence was substantively reasonable.id.oquendo garcia presents arguments at both steps.
initially,oquendo garcia asserts that the district court departed from the sentencing guidelines,without first providing him with the required notice.see.h noting that b efore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party prehearing submission,the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.he acknowledges that plain error applies to this claim and that he must therefore show an error that was clear or obvious,and that it both affected his substantial rights and seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states ramos gonzález,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
to establish an error,he points to application note of b which says,a sentence above the minimum term required by c is an upward departure from the guideline sentence which may be warranted,for example,to reflect the seriousness of the defendant criminal history.accordingly,he believes that the court increase here was,by definition,a departure.
oquendo garcia claim turns on whether the court departed or varied from the guidelines,as rule h notice is only required for the former.irizarry united states,d.as we have noted,departure has a technical meaning in the sentencing context it refers to specific deviations imposed in accordance with a statute or a specific guidelines provision.united states vega santiago,cir en banc.variances,meanwhile,exist as a result of the advisory nature of the guidelines.they permit the district court,after calculating the guideline sentence including any departure,to impose a different sentence based on the broader criteria identified in the statute.id.we will treat a sentence above a statutory mandatory minimum under section c as an upward variance,united states rivera gonzález,cir,absent some indication in the sentencing record which persuades us that the district court intended to or in fact applied an upward departure,see united states aponte vellón,cir.
here,the sentencing record makes plain that the court applied a variance,rather than a departure.first,nothing in the record ranging from the psr to the sentencing hearing suggests that the district court ever considered a departure under application note.further,the district court followed the steps typical of a variance when imposing the sentence it calculated the guidelines range,examined the factors,and imposed an prison term.see,aponte vellon,at.if there were any question,the court explicit invocation of a at the time that it augmented the sentence sheds light on the court intent.for the simple reason that the court varied,rather than departed,there was no rule h error 
oquendo garcia also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.he argues that he was less culpable than his since he was convicted on only one of the two charges,having only constructively possessed the rifle.in contrast,molina velazquez had actual possession of the rifle and was convicted of both crimes.yet,the court only sentenced molina velazquez to months in prison.
we review this substantive challenge under the deferential standard.united states battle,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.t here is not a single appropriate sentence but,rather,a universe of reasonable sentences,rivera gonzález,at,and our goal is to determine whether the district court provided a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result,united states martin,cir.when considering a argument in particular,our concern is primarily with national disparities,though we have also examined arguments that a sentence was substantively unreasonable because of the disparity with the sentence given to a.united states reverol rivera,cir.
even if we agreed that oquendo garcia was less culpable than molina velazquez,his argument nonetheless fails since the district court imposed a reasonable sentence based on oquendo garcia individualized criminal history.the sentencing judge emphasized that this was oquendo garcia third firearm conviction,on top of nine other weapon charges.the court stated,oquendo garcia is not unfamiliar with weapons a pparently he been very much attracted to firearms.this was,moreover,only a sampling of the defendant criminal past.thus,relying on this criminal history,the court reasonably determined that an sentence was necessary to promote respect for the law and to protect the public from further crimes by oquendo.these are defensible concerns.see a see also united states del valle rodríguez,cir noting that concerns over recidivism are valid reasons to impose an upward variance united states flores machicote,cir stating that the need for deterrence must be assessed in terms and can justify an upward variance 
oquendo garcia argues that he and molina velazquez were sufficiently alike and thus the court justification can not account for the sentencing disparity.but he does little more than broadly profess that the two cohorts had similar criminal histories.while he provides a single record citation in the facts section of his brief to his psr,he does not actually tell us what information in the psr would support his claim,nor does he provide us with the actual document.he has quite simply failed to sufficiently develop this argument.
despite the lack of argument,we have reviewed molina velazquez psr anyway to assess the validity of oquendo garcia claim,given the disparity in the sentences.a comparison of the two,however,shows that the defendants were not similarly situated,united states vargas,cir,such that giving oquendo garcia a longer sentence than molina velazquez was unreasonable.the psrs showed that oquendo garcia had more and overall convictions and arrests than did molina velazquez.united states mateo espejo,cir a claim of disparity,however,assumes that apples are being compared to apples.and,the district court specifically noted when sentencing oquendo garcia that it was concerned with his prior criminal offenses,including convictions and arrests,and his apparent attraction to firearms.
accordingly,since the district court explanation,though brief,contained a clear,cogent,and coherent rationale for its decision,united states madera ortiz,cir,and since there were no other errors,we affirm.
in any event,oquendo garcia would be unable to establish that the error affected his substantial rights on plain error review.the psr an
