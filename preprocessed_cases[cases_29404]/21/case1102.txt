this appeal is from a sentence entered after a remand for resentencing following this court vacating of one count of conviction.united states,cir.there are two issues of note.the first is whether we will entertain the government argument,made for the first time on appeal,that the law of the case doctrine bound the district court not to reconsider its earlier resolution of a sentencing issue,and therefore that the defendant was not free to raise this argument the second time around.the second is the defendant argument that he is ineligible for the sentencing enhancement in kidnapping cases where the victim is not released within seven days.see b b.not surprisingly,we reject both arguments.
on may,jorge was found guilty following a jury trial of conspiring to commit a hostage taking for ransom count one,a,aiding and abetting a hostage taking count two,and using and carrying a firearm in relation to the hostage taking in violation of c count five.he was sentenced to months in prison for counts one and two respectively,to be served concurrently,and months in prison for count five,to be served consecutively to counts one and two.appealed the convictions on all three counts,contesting the sufficiency of the evidence.
on september,this court affirmed convictions on the counts,set aside the conviction on the firearm count,count five,for insufficiency of evidence,and remanded to the district court for resentencing on counts one and two,at.on remand,the district court heard argument and again sentenced to months in prison for each of counts one and two,to be served concurrently.now appeals this sentence.he argues that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence based on b b,which provides for a enhancement for a kidnapping in which the victim was not released before seven days had elapsed.he says that because the evidence shows that he only joined the hostage taking five days before the victim was rescued,the enhancement should not apply to him.we affirm the district court sentence.
on august,lorenzo,and a person named charlie abducted richardson leo at gunpoint.was years old,and was the manager of the cache liquor store,one of the businesses owned by his brother.the victim,restrained in handcuffs and with a hood over his head,was taken to a private residence and held for a ransom.he was held in captivity for ten days before he was rescued by the fbi.in addition to and charlie,there were several other conspirators involved.the coconspirators were tom√°s the father of the defendant,luis manuel,santiago,clecencio,amable,and raimary lavandier the wife of.throughout the abduction,was handcuffed,blindfolded,and gagged at times he was kept in a bathtub.periodically throughout the abduction,the kidnappers made telephone calls to brother and uncle demanding ransom and threatening to kill.
was first held in one place for three days by,the father,and charlie.the kidnappers,fearing that the victim might be located by authorities,recruited.was then transferred to home,a place the kidnappers thought would be harder for the authorities to discover.
on august,was again moved,this time to a home in barrio obrero where lived with his wife raimary lavandier.as of august,had been a hostage for five days.was chained to a bed in a bedroom at the rear of the house,handcuffed,and blindfolded with duct tape.on august,the victim brother received seven telephone calls from the kidnappers in which they threatened him that this would be the last day on which he could pay the ransom before they resorted to killing.
on august,under questioning from the fbi,admitted to his role,and led the fbi to the residence.on the same day,a fbi swat team surrounded the residence,announced its presence,and ordered the occupants of the house to leave.at this point,came to the room in which was held,unchained him from the bed,removed the blindfold and the handcuffs,escorted him into another room,and told him to act like he was part of the group.apparently,hoped to bluff his way out with his victim.a short while later,those in the house came out and were arrested by the fbi agents.was rescued.he had been held hostage for ten days.
law of the case 
the government argues that appeal of his sentence at this stage of the case is barred by the law of the case doctrine.see united states ticchiarelli,cir.however,the government did not present this argument to the district court and we therefore do not consider it here.united states slade,cir it is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court,she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.if the government wishes to assert at resentencing before the district court after remand that certain issues resolved earlier should not be revisited,it should say so then.
sentencing guidelines 
the district court judge sentenced by applying the sentencing guideline for kidnapping.he applied a enhancement in accordance with b,because ransom was demanded.he also applied a enhancement pursuant to b b,because the victim was not released before seven days had elapsed.it is this enhancement that challenges in this appeal 
argues that the evidence at trial established that he did not join the hostage taking until august,when the victim was relocated to his residence.he concedes that the sentencing guidelines section on assessing relevant conduct in a jointly undertaken criminal activity,a b,instructs the court to consider all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.id.however,he argues that because application note to a b states that a defendant relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy,even if the defendant knows of that conduct,his sentence can not be enhanced based on the fact that the victim was not released within seven days,because the victim was released five days from the start of involvement in the hostage taking.in short,argues that the district court erred when it considered five days in captivity before the victim was transferred to residence in sentencing.
in response,the government argues that there was sufficient evidence to show that was involved in the hostage taking before the victim was relocated to his home.the government contends that must have known about the hostage taking before was moved to his house because it was a family affair father was shown to be actively involved from the outset,and wife was later involved.the government also argues that must have participated in the hostage taking before was transferred to his home,because he had to arrange for the transfer.
in addition,the government argues that even if application note to a b prohibits the sentencing court consideration of the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy in most circumstances,the note contains an exception for an unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant culpability.in such circumstances an upward departure may be warranted.a b,cmt.the government contends that this case is one of unusual circumstances,and a sentence enhancement is allowed.
we review challenges to the evidentiary support of a sentencing guidelines enhancement for clear error,united states patrick,cir,cert.denied,d.we review questions of the legal meaning of the guidelines de novo.united states mitchell,cir.both are involved here.
there are alternate readings of the basis for the trial judge sentencing decision,the grounds for which are not explicit.the first is that the judge appears to have made a subsidiary factual determination that was a member of the conspiracy from the outset and not just for the five days in which he actively participated.the district court enhancement rests on the district court finding that this was a continuing criminal situation in which this defendant actively participated.further,the district court judge explicitly stated that he agreed with the government 
the facts here support such a conclusion.joined the conspiracy before the victim was relocated to his home.father was actively
