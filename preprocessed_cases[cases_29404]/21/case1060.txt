elvy pleaded guilty both to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and to a related attempt count.see a.he now appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court should have credited him for a mitigating role in the offense of conviction and that his sentence was tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel.concluding,as we do,that the first claim is unavailing and the second unripe,we affirm the appellant sentence.
we draw the relevant facts from the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psi report,the disposition hearing,and the documents of record.see united states dietz,cir.
the events giving rise to the appellant arrest had their genesis in a call placed by a cooperating witness,functioning under the auspices of the federal bureau of investigation,to the appellant brother,jos√© correa the caller offered to bring five kilograms of cocaine from new york to rhode island.correa agreed to purchase the contraband,and the parties arranged to consummate the transaction on july.
at the appointed time and place,an undercover officer posed as a drug courier.correa and the appellant approached the officer vehicle to take delivery of the drugs,and the trap snapped shut.a search of their minivan turned up in cash.a subsequent search of correa residence netted an additional in cash.
on august,a federal grand jury indicted correa and the appellant.both men initially proclaimed their innocence.on november,correa changed his plea.as he is not a party to this appeal,we make no further reference to the proceedings against him.
the district court had scheduled the case for trial on november.rather than stand trial,the appellant decided to plead guilty.the court accepted his changed plea,continued the matter for sentencing,and commissioned the preparation of the psi report.the court specifically advised the appellant that,when the psi report was ready,he would have a right to review it with counsel and to object to it.the court emphasized that any objections not lodged within days after the psi report was made available would not be considered.
the probation department completed the psi report on december.it suggested that the court employ a base offense level of,see ussg c,and deduct two levels for acceptance of responsibility under ussg a.because the appellant apparently qualified for an additional decrease under the safety valve provision,see f see also united states marquez,cir united states,cir the psi report recommended an adjusted offense level of.that offense level,together with a criminal history category of appellant had no prior criminal a guideline sentencing range of to months.
in response to the psi report,the appellant proffered only a single objection.this objection focused on the drug quantity calculation used to determine his base offense level.he did not object either to the use of a adjustment,rather than a adjustment,for acceptance of responsibility or the absence of a adjustment for minor participation.
the district court convened the disposition hearing on january.the court resolved the question of drug quantity against the appellant,and that question is not pursued on appeal.defense counsel then raised,for the first time,the possibility of a adjustment under ussg b which provides that i f the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity,the sentencing court should decrease his offense level by levels.in belatedly broaching this subject,the lawyer conceded that he had not objected within the stipulated time frame and ascribed his failure to writer block.the court responded if it was raised under the rule it is waived.the court made that very clear at the time the plea was accepted.the court then added 
i t does appear to me that there is a great deal of basis for a reduction here.according to the presentence report,martinez was with the and both went to meet the agent and went back to the apartment and discussed purchasing kilograms.martinez was present at the time.
i recognize what he said in his statement of acceptance of responsibility that he was just along for the ride,so to speak but i am not sure if he is prepared to testify to that or not.in any event,it is too late to raise that objection.
following the imposition of a incarcerative sentence,filed a notice of appeal.in it,he makes two points.first,he asseverates that the sentencing court erred in denying him a adjustment under ussg b.second,he maintains that ineffective assistance of counsel elongated his sentence because it deprived him not only of the aforementioned adjustment but also of a plenary reduction for acceptance of responsibility under ussg.we deal with these contentions sequentially,using throughout the november edition of the sentencing guidelines.
we need not tarry.although the appellant criticizes the district court for failing to grant a downward adjustment for his ostensibly minor role in the offense,he did not interpose a timely objection to the psi report on this basis 
in the circumstances of this case,the absence of a timely objection might well constitute a waiver.after all,the criminal rules provide that the probation department shall prepare the psi report and furnish it to the defendant,the defendant counsel,and the prosecutor.see.b a.then,within days after receiving the presentence report,the parties are to communicate in writing to the probation officer,and to each other,all the objections that they may have to the sentencing classifications and other matters contained in or omitted from the presentence report.b b.not later than seven days before the disposition hearing,the probation officer must give the district court and the parties a revised psi report,including an addendum setting forth any unresolved sentencing objections.b c.apart from any preserved objections,the sentencing court may accept the presentence report as its findings of fact without further inquiry or elaboration.b d 
in the district of rhode island,these provisions are reinforced by a local rule,which provides that 
not less than days prior to the date set for sentencing,the probation officer shall disclose the presentence investigation report to the defendant and to counsel for the defendant and the government.within days thereafter,counsel shall communicate to the probation officer any objections they may have as to any material information,sentencing classifications,sentencing guideline ranges,and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report.such communication may be oral or written,but the probation officer may require that any oral objection be promptly confirmed in writing.
a.further provisions in the local rules mirror the framework of the federal rules of criminal procedure.see,b d.
the time limits embedded in these rules serve a threefold purpose they promote focused and informed resolution of disputed sentencing issues,fairness for both the government and the defendant,and efficiency in judicial administration.united states,cir explaining that time limits are no mere technicalities they are integral to the fair and orderly process of imposing sentence.thus,a party who decides to forgo a timely objection is in a poor position to complain when the sentencing court holds him to the easily foreseeable consequences of that decision.
moreover,the district court was especially forthcoming in this instance.it called the applicable time parameters to the appellant attention at the hearing,warned him no fewer than four times of the deadline,and spelled out the consequences attendant to noncompliance.the appellant was,therefore,on both actual and constructive notice that he must set forth his specific objections to the psi report within the allotted time or else forever hold his peace.
in the final analysis,however,we need not go so far as to declare what happened here a waiver.even were we to assume,favorably to the appellant,that this lapse constituted a forfeiture,rather than a waiver,that characterization would not lead to a different result.on appeal,forfeited issues are reviewed for plain error.united states olano,d united states rodriguez,cir.under the plain error standard,an appellant mu
