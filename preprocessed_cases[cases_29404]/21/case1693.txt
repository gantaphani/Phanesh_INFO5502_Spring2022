troy vaval appeals from his conviction and sentence after pleading guilty before judge amon.appellant participated in a scheme to rob and carjack a purported illegal gun buyer,actually a confidential informant carrying federal funds.on appeal,appellant principally argues that i he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court violated.b k by failing to inform him of mandatory restitution and ii he should be resentenced before a different judge or permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because the government arguments at sentencing violated the plea agreement we conclude that the failure to inform him of mandatory restitution in the amount of was not plain error because it would not have affected his decision to plead guilty.however,we also conclude that the government breached the plea agreement by engaging in sentence advocacy,and we therefore vacate appellant sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
a the indictment 
appellant was charged with carjacking,count i,robbery of federal money using a dangerous weapon,a count ii,and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,k,a b,et count vi,by a felon,g,a,et count v.the indictment also charged two.
the government alleged that on january,appellant met with a confidential informant ci in queens,new york after having promised to sell the ci firearms.appellant told the ci to follow him into an alley,where the ci was ambushed by appellant and three other individuals using two guns,one of them a.appellant took of buy money and a gold chain from the ci another attacker took his wallet and rings.appellant then told his to put the ci in the ci car and take the keys.appellant got into his own car two of the other three attackers drove the ci car further into the alley and were in the process of taking off the ci pants when the police arrived.before his arrest,appellant attempted to flee,driving at high speeds down a service road,on sidewalks,and in the middle of roads toward oncoming traffic.
b the plea agreement 
appellant pleaded guilty to count ii of the of federal property with a dangerous weapon,a pursuant to a plea agreement.the agreement stated that the maximum term of imprisonment was years,the maximum fine was,and restitution was under.the remaining counts were to be dismissed.the agreement further stated that the government will advise the court and the probation department of information relevant to sentencing,including criminal activity engaged in by the defendant,and such information will be used by the court in determining the defendant sentence.however,the government also agreed that based upon information now known to the attorney office,it would take no position concerning where within the guidelines range determined by the court the sentence should fall,and make no motion for an upward departure.the government would not be bound by these two provisions if information relevant to sentencing became known to it after the date of the plea agreement,or if it determined that appellant violated the agreement.
c the guilty plea 
appellant signed the plea agreement and pleaded guilty on september.at the plea colloquy,the court did not mention restitution but did tell appellant that he was subject to a mandatory special assessment and a maximum fine of.appellant,through counsel,asked to be assured that the attorney agreed not to move for an upward departure,and not to argue where in the guideline range he should be sentenced.the government agreed to this characterization of the plea agreement.appellant then stated that he planned the scheme to steal federal money,that two other individuals were involved,and that a pointed a during the robbery.the court accepted the plea.
d the presentence report 
the presentence report psr recommended an offense level of,a criminal history category chc of ii,and,therefore,a guidelines range of to months.it also stated,correctly,that restitution of was mandatory.the psr offense level was higher than that specified in the plea agreement,because it included a two level enhancement for fleeing from the police in a dangerous manner.the psr recommended chc was lower than that of the plea rather than the plea agreement chc had been calculated incorrectly to include outdated crimes.finally,the psr emphasized appellant supervisory role and seemed to show that five participants were involved in the crime,justifying a three level role adjustment nevertheless,the psr recommended only the two level role adjustment that had been recommended in the plea agreement.appellant did not object to any aspects of the psr.
e the sentencing 
at sentencing,the government noted that both the plea agreement and the psr had erroneously given appellant a rather than a role adjustment.noting that its mistake was caused by a misunderstanding of the law,the government stated 
judge,i did agree to the two level enhancement in the plea agreement for a role adjustment.i was speaking to the probation officer before court today.i wanted to point out to the court that although the probation officer also only gave two points for the adjustment of role offense,as the court will recall the testimony at the trial did bring out that actually including the defendant there were five participants in this crime.so,technically,i think that it would be three levels added instead of two for the role adjustment.
appellant objected,claiming that this statement violated the plea agreement.
the district court decided to use the guidelines calculations specified in the psr,because the role adjustment issue was not raised in a timely fashion and because it believed that the added level would not affect appellant sentence.having set the guidelines range at to months,the court then gave the parties a chance to speak.appellant counsel asked for a sentence at the bottom of the range,while appellant apologized for his conduct and asked for leniency.the government,after noting that it had waived the government right in the plea agreement to ask for an upward departure or to ask the court to sentence the defendant in a particular place in the range of the guidelines,stated 
i would like to point out a couple of things to the court.again,in the plea agreement we believed that the defendant was in chc three.it turns out that he is in chc two.i find this defendant criminal history appalling.and the fact that he can sit here today and say that he made a mistake,i find completely disingenuous.because it is a mistake that he has made over and over and over again in terms of robbing people at gun point and using violence to commit robberies.i understand that the guidelines preclude us from looking at or calculating certain offenses.but certainly this is not this defendant first or second offense.
also,the instant conduct shows that this defendant was the ring leader of this crime.he punched the victim in the face.he orchestrated three people who were armed with guns.one was an intratek semi automatic assault weapon.to be lying in wait for a victim,to rob him,to abduct him.there was testimony at the trial brought out that he was going to be killed.i just ask the court to consider all of that when making the court decision about where to sentence this defendant.
appellant objected that the government was violating its agreement not to take any position about where within the guidelines range appellant should be sentenced and asked that the government remarks be stricken.the government responded that we do make a promise that we will be silent at sentencing but only not to move for an upward departure or to ask for a particular sentence within a range.the government noted that based on the information that i had at the time of the plea agreement i believed that the defendant was going to be in a chc category three.he is in a category two.i think,technically,i could make an upward departure which i am not.
the court said that it understood appellant concern about the arguments made by the government,but that 
i sat through the trial of appellant.the government remarks do not change any view that the court had of this case coming out here.
so whether the government is correct or not,whether their interpretation of your agreement is correct,i do think there is any prejudice as a result of it.
i think that i have given vaval the serious benefit here by not litigating an issue about the extra role adjustment point.
the court noted that it had always believed that this was an extremely serious matter and a sentence at the top of the guidelines range is required for punishment and deterrence the court sentenced appellant to the top of his guidelines ordered in restitution,but no fine.
discussion 
we turn now to appellant arguments regarding the withdrawal of his plea because of a rule violation or resentencing because of a plea agreement breach by the government.
a the rule violation 
rule b k required the district court to inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands the court authority to order restitution.it is undisputed that the court failure to do so violated rule.nevertheless,we conclude that appellant may not withdraw his plea.
appellant did not object to the rule violation,and we therefore review it for plain error under.b.appellant bears the burden of establishing such an error.united states vonn,d in the rule context,a silent defendant has the burden to satisfy the rule.plain error is i error,that is ii plain,and iii affects substantial rights.united states olano,d.where these conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in the context of a rule violation,to show plain error,a defendant must establish that the violation affected substantial rights and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states dominguez benitez,d 
appellant has not met this burden.significantly,the psr informed appellant before sentencing that restitution of was mandatory.at sentencing,appellant stated that he had read the psr and was aware of its contents.nevertheless,appellant never objected to the ordering of restitution or attempted to withdraw his plea prior to imposition of sentence.he also failed to object when the restitution order was actually imposed.
where a defendant,before sentencing,learns of information erroneously omitted in violation of rule but fails to attempt to withdraw his plea based on that violation,there can be no reasonable probability that,but for the rule violation,he would not have entered the plea,and the plain error standard is not met.see united states,cir rule violation not plain error because,inter alia,appellant made no attempt to withdraw his plea once he learned the information left out of the rule colloquy.
in the instant matter,this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that at the rule proceeding,the court informed appellant that by pleading guilty,he would subject himself to a maximum fine of.united states molzen,cir no plain error where appellant was not advised in plea colloquy that he might have to pay in restitution,but was advised that he might be fined up to united states powell,cir failure to inform defendant of mandatory restitution during plea colloquy harmless where defendant aware of maximum potential fine,which exceeded restitution amount,as she received adequate notice of her financial liability united states morris,cir collecting cases holding that although rule c requires the district court to explain a defendant liability for both fines and restitution,failure to do so does not impact a defendant substantial rights where he was warned of a potential fine larger than the actual amount of restitution ordered.
we therefore conclude without difficulty that there is no reasonable probability that being told at the plea hearing of mandatory restitution of would have affected appellant decision to plead guilty.
b the breach of the plea agreement 
appellant argues that the government breached the plea agreement by its argumentative relating of the facts of appellant crime and the seriousness of his criminal history.we agree.
we review interpretations of plea agreements de novo and in accordance with principles of contract law.united states riera,cir.further,we construe plea agreements strictly against the government and do not hesitate to scrutinize the government conduct to ensure that it comports with the highest standard of fairness.united states lawlor,cir.to determine whether a plea agreement has been breached,a court must look to what the parties reasonably understood to be the terms of the agreement.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,because plea bargains require defendants to waive fundamental constitutional rights,prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of performance.id.
to be sure,the government acknowledged at sentencing that the plea agreement prohibited it from seeking an upward departure or taking a position on the appropriate sentence within the applicable guidelines range.it also stated that it did not intend to violate those provisions of the agreement.such statements do not,however,insulate the government against a finding of breach if in fact what was said constituted an argument about where within the range to sentence appellant whether to upwardly depart.see id.at.
the government was permitted by the plea agreement to advise the court of information relevant to sentencing,including criminal activity engaged in by the defendant,but some of its statements did not fall within this category of permissible behavior for example,the government volunteered highly negative characterizations of appellant criminal history as appalling and his purported contrition as disingenuous.such characterizations are not information protected by the agreement.the government also noted that the guidelines preclude us from looking at or calculating certain offenses.it then went on to do just that by stating,b ut certainly this is not this defendant first or second offense.
the facts of appellant present crimes had already been fully canvassed during sentencing,in the psr,and at the trial of appellant before the same judge.nevertheless,just before sentencing,the government felt the need to provide the vivid detail quoted earlier.the government also suggested that i think,technically,i could make an upward departure argument and reiterated that it had thought appellant chc was iii rather than ii at the time of the agreement.it is difficult to draw a principled distinction between the government actually moving for an upward departure and stating that it technically could move for such a departure and then adding arguments that would support such a departure.
moreover,the offending statements by the government occurred after the court had determined appellant guidelines range.at that point,the only remaining issues were whether to depart or where within the range to sentence appellant,and the government statements had no relevance other than to address those issues.indeed,at the conclusion of the statements in question,the government stated,i just ask the court to consider all of that when making the court decision about where to sentence this defendant.
our holding that the government breached its plea agreement obligations is fully consistent with our decision in riera,at.in riera,the government responded by letter to the district court sua sponte inquiry about whether an upward departure was legal,stating that a departure was well within the court discretion.id.at alteration in original.the plea agreement prohibited the government from advocating an upward departure but allowed it to respond to inquiries from the court by stating relevant facts and law and opining whether the court had discretion to depart.id.at.we held that the government letter came very close to breaching the agreement because it contained a few descriptive words that might have suggested that the government thought that the court should upwardly depart.id.at emphasis in original.however,there was no breach because the letter did not explicitly advocate a departure and,to repudi
