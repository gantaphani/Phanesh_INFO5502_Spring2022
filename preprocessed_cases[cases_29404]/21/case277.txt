richard souza appeals from his conviction and sentence for structuring financial transactions to evade reporting requirements.we affirm.
background 
in,souza was hired to repair the roof of lawrence burtchaell,an elderly widower.the two developed a close relationship and soon souza was spending several days a week at burtchaell home.
during this time period,burtchaell acquaintances began noticing symptoms of mental decline.usually well dressed,burtchaell began looking disheveled.he also had difficulty remembering neighbors names,he would get lost walking around the neighborhood,and one time he flooded his house because he forgot to turn off the bath.burtchaell diminishing mental capacity was also detected by his investment advisor,mark friese,who registered concern with his manager.
in,souza persuaded burtchaell to put up money to purchase real estate in maine.souza told burtchaell and friese that burtchaell was a partner in the investment,but revealed neither that the other partners were souza sons,nor that burtchaell was providing all of the purchase money.though souza promised that in a few weeks burtchaell would recoup his money with interest,burtchaell never saw any return on the investment.
after closing the deal,burtchaell took out an loan on the property and wired almost all of the proceeds to souza account with sovereign bank.in the following months,souza withdrew all of these funds,always in increments of less than.for instance,on june,within a period of an hour and a half,souza withdrew in six separate installments of at five different sovereign branches.
banks are required to file a report when an individual withdraws or more.a.for purposes of reporting,banks aggregate an individual daily transactions across all branches.b.thus,sovereign treated souza six june withdrawals as one withdrawal and filed a report.
souza was charged with structuring his june transactions for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements,in violation of a.souza claimed that he had been forced to make multiple withdrawals of because each sovereign branch ran out of money.to rebut this claim and to show souza intent to evade the reporting requirements,the government presented evidence of the maine transaction,arguing that souza wished to avoid drawing attention to his withdrawals because they were composed of funds.souza was convicted and sentenced.he appeals.
ii.discussion 
souza claims violations of his rights to a speedy trial,to effective assistance of counsel,and to due process.he also argues that the district court made erroneous evidentiary rulings and sentencing errors.none of these arguments is persuasive.
speedy trial 
souza contends that he was denied his speedy trial right.that right derives from two sources the speedy trial act sta,and the sixth amendment.
the sta places time limits on two periods in criminal proceedings the period between arrest and indictment,and the period between indictment and trial.id.b c.in computing the amount of time that has elapsed during these periods,the sta permits courts to exclude certain intervals.id.h.
souza alleges sta violations in both periods.we review sta challenges de novo as to legal rulings and for clear error as to factual findings.united states valdivia,cir,cert.denied.overall,however,we review for abuse of discretion decisions to exclude intervals of time from the sta count.united states gates,cir,cert.denied.
between arrest and indictment 
the sta calls for indictment no later than thirty days after arrest.b.souza was arrested on august,and was indicted on september.he argues that only fourteen of these days are excludable,leaving days five more than the sta permits.although delay resulting from any pretrial motion is excludable,id.h d,including up to thirty days during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court,id.h h,souza claims that no excludable time resulted from a joint motion filed by the parties on august.he makes three points,none of which is availing.
first,souza argues that the joint motion,which sought enlargement of time to obtain an indictment,requested relief that the court was incapable of granting.souza did not make this argument to the district court.even if he had,while it is true that courts can not enlarge the time limits established by the sta,courts can exclude certain periods in the interest of justice,see id.h a,and the joint motion,was functionally equivalent to an anticipatory motion to exclude time.souza does not and could not contend that the purely semantic difference prejudiced the proceedings in any way.
second,souza contends that the exclusion of time sought by the joint motion was not in the interest of justice.but it is irrelevant whether the motion reasons for seeking exclusion had merit time was excludable not because the court granted the joint motion,but because the court had the motion under advisement.
third,souza asserts that the toll that stops the clock while a court considers a pretrial motion should not apply when the motion seeks a continuance.otherwise,says souza,a party intent on excluding time could obtain that result simply by filing a motion.but in united states richardson,we rejected this argument and held that a motion to continue can toll the speedy trial clock,cir.
of course,as we cautioned in richardson,neither counsel nor district courts may employ measures for excluding time from the speedy trial clock that impermissibly frustrate the sta purpose of protecting the shared interest of criminal defendants and the public in bringing criminal charges to the bar of justice as promptly as practicable.id.at quoting united states hastings,cir.as was true of the motion to continue in richardson,the joint motion here was not filed as a pretext to avoid the consequences of an sta violation,but was filed for the legitimate purpose of seeking a continuance in the interest of justice.id.counsel for both souza and the government sought the continuance to carry on preexisting plea negotiations and because each had a vacation planned.since we have expressly left open the issue whether periods of plea negotiation can properly be excluded,united states scantleberry frank,cir,a motion to continue made on that basis,while not guaranteed to succeed,will not be deemed pretextual on that ground alone.similarly,because we have held that a reasonable vacation constitutes a plausible basis for excluding a relatively brief period of time,gates,at,a motion to continue made on that basis is also not necessarily pretextual.
nor does the fact that souza objected to the joint motion render it pretextual.after all,defense counsel has the power to seek an sta continuance without first informing his client or obtaining his client personal consent.id.at.souza objection is merely a datum for the district court to consider in its analysis of the ends of justice,and must be measured in light of both attorneys legitimate reasons for requesting a continuance.id.
because the sta permits a court to exclude up to thirty days while a motion is under advisement,h d,h,the joint motion tolled the speedy trial clock beginning on august and continuing through september.this exclusion reduces the counted number of days between the august arrest and the september indictment below thirty,and therefore within the limits of the sta.
between indictment and trial 
the sta calls for trial no later than seventy days after indictment.c.souza was indicted on september,and his trial began on february.he argues that only of these days were excludable,leaving days more than the sta permits.
e xclusions of time not specifically challenged in a motion to dismiss are deemed waived.gates,at emphasis added.souza did not file a motion to dismiss challenging specific intervals in the pretrial period.instead,through pro se filings,he protested generally about delay.on appeal,he avers that these general protestations were meant to convey that there were no excludable intervals anywhere in the pretrial period.this mischaracterizes his filings,which comprised vague complaints of delay and accusations against the court,the government,and his attorneys for colluding to impair his speedy trial right.even when viewed as charitably to souza as possible,his assertions did not in any event challenge exclusions of time during the pretrial period,thus waiving such challenges on appeal 
sixth amendment 
souza also contends that the delay between his arrest and trial violated the sixth amendment guarantee of a speedy trial.we review the district court sixth amendment decision for abuse of discretion.united states santiago becerril,cir.to determine whether a sixth amendment violation has occurred,a court balances four factors the length of the delay,the reasons for the delay,the defendant assertion of his right,and prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.united states dowdell,cir citing barker wingo.
length of delay 
length of delay,in addition to factoring into the balance,serves as a triggering mechanism for review,since a court will conduct a sixth amendment analysis only after a defendant has shown that the period of time has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from presumptively prejudicial delay.doggett united states,internal quotation marks omitted.generally,delay becomes prejudicial around the mark.see id.at dowdell,at.
here,roughly eighteen months passed between souza arrest in october and his trial in february.for purposes of analysis,we will assume,without deciding,that the delay establishes a presumption of prejudice,triggering further sixth amendment review.see,santiago becerril,at assuming that delay was presumptively prejudicial.
as for its place in the balancing test,a lengthier delay raises the likelihood that the defendant suffered prejudice.doggett,at.while the delay in souza case was not at the extreme end of the spectrum,see barker,at it is clear that the length of delay between arrest and trial well over five years was extraordinary.but see united states munoz franco,cir the five years that elapsed between indictment and trial is a troublesome length of time.nonetheless,our inquiry has revealed no constitutional violation,we have held that a delay is a rguably long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor of the defendant speedy trial claim,santiago becerril,at.we will assume for the sake of argument that the delay in souza case weighs in his favor,but,as we explain below,not heavily enough to overcome the countervailing weights of the second and fourth factors.
reasons for delay 
of the four factors in the analysis,examination of the reasons for delay is the focal inquiry.munoz franco,at internal quotation marks omitted.we must first determine if the delays were attributable to souza or to the government.d elays sought by defense counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.vermont brillon.for those delays caused by the government,we must evaluate the underlying reasons 
a deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government.a more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant.finally,a valid reason,such as a missing witness,should serve to justify appropriate delay.
barker,at footnote omitted.
this factor weighs against souza.much of the delay resulted from his actions or those of his counsel.between his arrest and the appointment of his ultimate trial counsel,souza twice violated the terms of his release,necessitating further proceedings,and thrice obtained new counsel,who sought continuances on several occasions.additionally,souza filed two pretrial motions,which further delayed the proceedings.
the delays attributable to the government were not motivated by a deliberate attempt to defer the trial.some were traceable to the fact that replacement counsel for the government needed time to gain familiarity with the case after the initial counsel left the attorney office.others resulted from the medical leave of an irs agent who was needed to produce certain documents.these fall into the category of valid reasons that justify an appropriate delay.further appropriate delay occurred when the case was transferred to a new district court judge after the initial judge retired.
once the trial date was set,it was continued twice.first,the government moved for a continuance because counsel had another trial and an appellate argument scheduled during the same month as souza trial.thereafter,souza counsel moved to continue because he had a conflict with the new trial date.all in all,the government,as compared to souza and his counsel,played a minimal role in delaying the trial.
defendant assertion of the right 
from the outset,souza made it clear that he wished to proceed to trial as quickly as possible.this factor weighs in his favor,but not enough to overcome the weight that the second and fourth factors carry against him.
prejudice resulting from the delay 
prejudice is assessed in light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect i to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration ii to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused and iii to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.barker,at.
the last of these interests is the most serious,as it implicates the fairness of the entire system,and we begin with it here.id.souza argues that evidence and testimony of witnesses was lost or hampered as a result of the delay between his criminal conduct,which occurred in,and his trial,which occurred in.but most of this period is irrelevant for speedy trial purposes.the speedy trial right attaches upon arrest or indictment,whichever occurs first,santiago becerril,at,and souza was not arrested until august.the delay in obtaining the arrest following his criminal conduct implicates separate rights,see munoz franco,at,not invoked by souza on appeal.though souza speculates about prejudice,he points to nothing in the period between his arrest and trial that impaired his ability to mount a defense.
as to pretrial incarceration,we can not say that the delay between souza arrest and trial caused him prejudice.souza was incarcerated while awaiting trial only because he failed to abide by the conditions of his release.and,as to anxiety and concern,since considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges,only undue pressures are considered.united states henson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the record does not suggest that souza was subject to such undue pressures.
weighing all four factors,in light of the facts that souza and his counsel were largely responsible for the delay and that souza did not experience prejudice as a result,we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court determination that souza sixth amendment right was respected.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
souza argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by filing the joint motion for enlargement of time.souza claims that his attorney agreed to this motion without consulting souza and that the motion ran counter to his interests.
this is neither the time nor the place to first raise the ineffective assistance claim.such claims should ordinarily be litigated in the first instance in district court.it is true that we make an exception for cases in which trial counsel ineffectiveness is manifestly apparent from the record,but this is not such a case.united states wyatt,cir citations omitted.souza ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires further factual development,so he must wait to raise it on collateral review.
due process 
souza claims that his conviction under a violates due process because the statute fails to provide fair notice that his conduct was criminal.because his actions withdrawing in increments from multiple branches in one day in fact triggered the bank reporting requirements,he wonders how he can be punished for evading those requirements.we review such a challenge de novo.united states hussein,cir.
souza argument misses the point.section a makes it a crime to structure transactions for the purpose of evading the reporting r
