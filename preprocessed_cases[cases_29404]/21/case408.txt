samuel ortiz garcía ortiz executed a plea agreement and entered a guilty plea without ever having been informed that the maximum penalty for the crime to which he was pleading guilty was life imprisonment.ortiz ultimately received a sentence of months,though his plea agreement recommended months.ortiz argues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement is unenforceable,that the district court violated rule by failing to inform him of the maximum penalty at his hearing,and that the court violated rule by failing to inquire at the sentencing hearing whether ortiz had reviewed the investigation report with his attorney.because we find that the waiver is unenforceable and that the rule violation constituted plain error,we vacate and remand for a new hearing.
facts background 
we recite the facts only as they are relevant to this appeal,drawing from the plea colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the investigation report psr,and the sentencing hearing transcript.united states mercedes mercedes,cir.on may,ortiz and two other individuals attempted to steal the car of gilberto santiago quiñones santiago.santiago and his passenger confronted the men,and an altercation ensued,in which ortiz does not appear to have been involved.after the fight was over,santiago and his passenger got back into the car to try to leave,but ortiz,agustín rodríguez adorno rodríguez,blocked their way.an unidentified individual then said,he tough.shoot him.ortiz approached the driver side of the car and fired multiple shots into the car,killing santiago.
a grand jury returned a indictment,charging ortiz,rodríguez,and another individual with conspiring to commit a carjacking with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm,in violation of,count one aiding and abetting in a carjacking that resulted in a death,in violation of count two aiding and abetting in the use,carriage,and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of,during,and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence,in violation of c a iii count three and aiding and abetting one another in causing the death of another person through the use of a firearm,in violation of j count four 
on june,ortiz entered into a plea agreement with the government,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c a and b.under the terms of that agreement,ortiz agreed to plead guilty to count three of the indictment discharging a deadly weapon during a crime of violence,in violation of c a iii.in exchange,the government recommended a sentence of months.as part of the plea agreement,ortiz accepted the district court jurisdiction and authority to impose any sentence within the statutory maximum set forth for the offense.if the district court chose to impose a sentence up to the maximum established by statute,ortiz could not for that reason alone,withdraw a guilty plea,and would remain bound to fulfill all of the obligations of the plea agreement.nowhere in the agreement,however,did the government include the maximum penalty under c a iii,which is life imprisonment the statutory penalties section of the agreement simply stated that the crime was punishable by imprisonment of not less than ten years,a fine not to exceed,or both,and a term of supervised release of no more than three years.
the agreement also contained a waiver of appeal section,which read as follows the defendant hereby agrees that if this honorable court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.
at ortiz hearing on june,the district court informed ortiz that the minimum statutory penalty for the offense charged in count three was imprisonment of not less than ten years if the firearm is discharged,but the court did not mention the maximum penalty.ortiz did not object to this omission at the hearing.the district court did confirm ortiz understanding that the court could impose a sentence more or less severe than the one recommended in the agreement and that the court sentencing calculation would depend in part on its review of the psr.the court also informed ortiz that,if the court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced ortiz according to its terms,ortiz would waive and surrender his right to appeal.a sentencing hearing was scheduled for september.
the government first referenced the maximum penalty of life imprisonment under c a iii in an initial psr filed on september,and an amended psr filed on september.it is unclear,however,whether the government belated attempt to notify ortiz that he might receive a life sentence was successful.because ortiz did not receive the psr at least days before his sentencing hearing,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure e,ortiz counsel filed a motion to continue the hearing.in that motion,ortiz counsel stated that he came to discuss the psr and amended psr with his client yesterday,september,barely three days from the sentencing date.ortiz counsel further stated that he would normally advise his client to waive the day notice period required by rule e,but due to the nature of the case and the need to thoroughly study the reports and further discuss with his client the contents of these,he was requesting a continuance of the sentencing date.the district court rescheduled the hearing for october.
four things happened at the sentencing hearing that are important here.first,the district court failed to confirm whether ortiz had in fact reviewed the psr with his attorney.second,the court informed ortiz that the maximum sentence under c a iii was life imprisonment.third,the court imposed a sentence of months,finding that the sentence to which the parties had agreed,months,did not reflect the seriousness and aggravated nature of the offense.fourth,after informing ortiz that he had waived his right to appeal substantive issues regarding the conviction and sentence,the district court went on to say,i must tell you,ortiz,that because the court has not sentenced you according to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement,you do have the right to appeal.ortiz did not object to the court failure to inquire about the psr,nor did he ask that his plea be vacated once the court informed him of the maximum penalty.
ortiz,rodríguez,elected to go to trial.rodríguez argued that santiago death had been the result of a street fight,not an attempted carjacking.on june,a jury convicted rodríguez of counts one and two but acquitted him as to counts three and four.rodríguez received a sentence of months imprisonment.
ii.discussion 
a.the waiver of appeal 
we begin by addressing the waiver of appeal that ortiz executed as part of his plea agreement,which,if enforceable,would preclude our consideration of the alleged rule and rule violations.
a waiver of appeal is enforceable if it is valid and the defendant claim lies within its scope.united states padilla colón,cir.for a waiver to be valid,the defendant must have entered into it knowingly and voluntarily.united states teeter,cir.to determine whether a defendant claim falls within the scope of an otherwise valid waiver,we examine what the parties agreed to,interpreting the agreement under basic contract principles.united states acosta roman,cir.we construe any ambiguities in the waiver of appeal provision in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.united states fernández cabrera,cir 
in this case,ortiz agreed to waive his right to appeal the district court judgment and sentence if the court accepted the agreement and sentenced ortiz according to the agreement terms and conditions.those terms and conditions included a recommended sentence of months and a provision confirming that the district court had sound discretion to impose any sentence within the statutory maximum set for the offense to which the defendant pleads guilty.nowhere in the agreement,however,did the government specify the maximum penalty,which was life imprisonment.the agreement merely listed the statutory minimum of imprisonment of not less than ten years.
the government argues that ortiz waiver of appeal is enforceable because the district court,at the hearing,ensured that ortiz had knowingly and voluntarily entered into the waiver and then accepted ortiz plea of guilty,which the government equates with having accepted the plea agreement itself.the government further contends that ortiz month sentence falls within the scope of what ortiz consented to in the plea agreement,which only promised that the government would recommend a sentence of months 
to determine whether a defendant entered into a waiver of appellate rights knowingly and voluntarily,we examine the text of the plea agreement and the content of the colloquy.teeter,at.we first confirm that the written agreement contains a clear statement elucidating the scope of the waiver.id.we have previously upheld waivers of this exact nature,though we emphasize again today that it would be better practice,given the frequency of appeals involving waivers,for the government to draft waiver provisions that make specific reference to any terms and conditions of the plea agreement that are not intended by the parties to be covered by the waiver.acosta roman,at emphasis in original.
given that the text of the waiver provision was clear enough on its face,we next examine the transcript of the hearing to ascertain whether the court interrogation sufficed to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive his right to appeal.teeter,at.this includes an inquiry into whether the district court informed the defendant of the ramifications of the waiver.see,acosta roman,f d at.while the district court did question ortiz specifically about his understanding of the waiver provision,the court failed to comply with rule b h mandate that the court inform the defendant of,and ascertain that the defendant understands,any maximum possible penalty.the court did neither.perhaps this error could have been mitigated if the plea agreement had included the maximum penalty,or there was other evidence that the defendant had been informed of and understood the maximum penalty.but there is no such evidence.furthermore,any opportunity the court might have had at the sentencing hearing to cure the omission and provide ortiz with time to consider withdrawing his plea was marred by other mistakes,which we describe later.
under the circumstances,we are not convinced that ortiz plea was knowing,and we therefore choose not to enforce the waiver.we can thus reach the merits of ortiz claim.
b.the rule violation 
we review ortiz underlying rule claim for plain error,because ortiz failed to object to the error or move to withdraw his plea in the district court.see united states vonn,united states rivera maldonado,cir.in order to establish plain error,a defendant must show that an error occurred the error was plain the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.rivera maldonado,at quoting vonn,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
rule requires that the district court inform the defendant during the plea colloquy of any maximum possible penalty,including imprisonment,fine,and term of supervised release.b h.the parties agree that the district court failed,at the hearing,to inform ortiz of the maximum penalty for discharging a dangerous weapon in relation to a crime of violence under c a iii.the parties also agree that the plea agreement itself failed to specify the maximum.
we begin with a note about the maximum penalty under c a.the statute does not include an express maximum.rather,the statute provides escalating minimums,based on whether the firearm was carried five years,brandished seven years,or discharged ten years.see id.the maximum penalty thus derives from caselaw,much of it interpreting the supreme court suggestion in harris united states,that s ince c a subsections alter only the minimum,the judge may impose a sentence well in excess of seven years,whether or not the defendant brandished the firearm.id.at see also id.at thomas,dissenting explicitly referring to the maximum as life imprisonment.today,to avoid any uncertainty in this circuit,we join all of our sister circuits in finding that the maximum penalty under c a is life imprisonment 
the fact that we had not explicitly spoken regarding the maximum penalty at the time of ortiz hearing did not,however,excuse the district court of its obligation to inform ortiz of the maximum at that hearing.there is no evidence before us,nor does either party contend,that the district court was unsure of the maximum penalty.the court informed ortiz at the sentencing hearing that the maximum penalty under c a iii was life imprisonment,and the psr contained that same information.the district court seems to have simply forgotten to inform ortiz of the maximum at the hearing,as required by rule b h.that error was both obvious and plain,and the first two prongs of the plain error test are thus met.united states borrero acevedo,cir.
the third prong of the plain error test,whether the error affected ortiz substantial rights,is a closer question.ortiz has the burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states dominguez benitez.that requires a showing,informed by the entire record,that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.id.at quoting strickland washington.
ortiz essentially makes two claims as to how the rule error affected his substantial rights.first,his brief argues that 
the record reflects that by pleading guilty ortiz was surrendering an important defense to the carjacking charges since there was evidence that what occurred was a street brawl that had nothing to do with an attempted carjacking which if believed by the jury or established during the course of trial could have led to an acquittal.
the government counters that ortiz,rodríguez,used this very same defense at trial and was found guilty of conspiracy to commit carjacking and of carjacking though rodríguez only received a sentence of months.it is not for us,however,to assess whether a defendant would likely have succeeded at trial,had he elected not to plead guilty in the absence of a rule error.if the defendant can show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea,we must accept that showing without judging its merits.see dominguez benitez,at the point of the question is not to a defendant actual decision if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error,it is no matter that the choice may have been foolish.ortiz second claim,in the alternative,is that,if he had been properly informed of the maximum penalty,he might have tried to insist on a rule c c agreement,which would have allowed him to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial if the district court had rejected the agreement.
the government urges us to find that the error did not affect ortiz substantial rights,because ortiz was notified of the maximum penalty both in the psr and during the sentencing hearing and did not object or move to withdraw his plea.the government suggests that ortiz inaction belies his claim that,but for the rule error,there is a reasonable probability that he would not have elected to plead guilty.if the record clearly established that ortiz had reviewed the psr with his attorney prior to the sentencing hearing,that might indeed negate ortiz claim that the rule error affected his substantial rights,given ortiz failure to object to the psr.the record before us,however,reveals no such thing,because the district court failed to confirm at ortiz sentencing hearing that ortiz had read and discussed the psr with his attorney.we are thus met with another complicating factor,which forces us to take one more detour.
federal rule of criminal procedure i a requires a district court,at sentencing,to verify that the defendant and the defendant attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report.the government concedes that the district court failed to make the proper inquiry under rule i a but nonetheless argues that there is sufficient evidence that ortiz read and discussed the psr with his attorney to satisfy the rule.the government relies on ortiz motion to continue the original sentencing hearing,in which ortiz counsel stated that he came to discuss the psr and amended psr with his client on september,and need ed to thoroughly study the reports and further discuss with his client the content of these.these statements alone do not establish that ortiz actually read or discussed the reports with his attorney.though we have held in the past that it is enough that the court determine that the defendant and counsel have had an opportunity to read and discuss the report,united states cruz,cir,we were interpreting a prior iteration of the rule,which only required the court to determine that the defendant and defendant counsel have had the opportunity to read and discuss the presentence investigation report,id.at emphasis added.the rule,which was amended in,now requires the district court to confirm that the defendant and the defendant attorney have read and discussed the report.fed.pro.i a emphasis added.without going any further,we find that rule i a mandate was not satisfied here 
given the record before us,we must therefore assume that ortiz was notified for the first time at his sentencing hearing that he might receive a life sentence.the fact that ortiz said nothing when the district court informed him of the maximum penalty at the sentencing hearing does not convince us that ortiz would have elected to plead guilty regardless of the rule error.dominguez benitez requires ortiz to demonstrate a reasonable probability,not an absolute certainty,that he would not have entered the plea in the absence of the error.at.
as we did in rivera maldonado,we find here that the error went to the very purpose of rule,which is to advise a defendant of the actual consequences of his plea so that he can realistically decide whether to plead guilty.at quoting united states santo,cir.in rivera maldonado,the magistrate judge failed,during the rule colloquy,to inform the defendant that he could be sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release.id.at.relying on erroneous information in the plea agreement,the court instead told the defendant that the maximum supervised release term was three years.id.the defendant stated that the information he received from the plea agreement and the magistrate judge played a crucial role in his decision to plead guilty.id.at.given that,as well as the dramatic difference between a three year period of supervised release and a lifetime of supervised release,we found that the defendant had shown a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.id 
of course,in rivera maldonado,the defendant actually received the maximum sentence,a lifetime of supervised release,whereas ortiz was sentenced below the maximum.nonetheless,the sentence ortiz received was well above the minimum that had been mentioned in his plea agreement and during his plea colloquy.the omitted information here,like the erroneous information in rivera maldonado,dramatically altered the sentencing stakes for the defendant,and ortiz has established a reasonable probability that he would not have entered into the plea agreement if he had been properly informed of those stakes.under these particular circumstances,the rule error affected ortiz substantial rights.
finally,as in rivera maldonado,the rule error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings such that we must vacate ortiz plea and remand for a new hearing.id.at.one of the core concerns of rule is that the defendant have knowledge of the consequences of his plea.united states hernandez wilson,cir.the failure to insist on the requirements of rule may well deter future defendants from entering into guilty pleas and waivers of appeal,which conserve judicial resources and promote efficiency and finality in the adjudication of criminal cases.teeter,f d at.
because we find that the rule violation constituted plain error,we need not address whether the rule violation,which ortiz also raises for the first time on appeal,meets the same fate.
iii.conclusion 
while plain error is a high hurdle,united states henderson,cir,some defendants do clear it,and ortiz has.on remand,ortiz may of course receive a sentence far longer than months.indeed,that risk is very real,given the underlying conduct at issue here.but ortiz made the decision to proceed with this appeal with full knowledge of its potential consequences the same can not be said of his original decision to plead guilty.
vacated and remanded.
the indictment charges,and the government brief lists,violations of and,c a iii and,and j and.because it is unclear what statutory provision and refers to in each instance,we have omitted that language here.
as we explain in more detail below,a complicating factor in this case is that the relevant statutory text does not include a maximum penalty the statute only specifies a mandatory minimum of not less than years.c a iii.the maximum penalty of life imprisonment is thus derived from case law.
though we need not reach the issue here,even if a defendant entered into an appellate waiver knowingly and voluntarily and his claim lies within the scope of that waiver,we may refuse to enforce the waiver if doing so would result in a miscarriage of justice.sotirion united states,cir.
the government urges us to disregard the district court statement at the sentencing hearing that ortiz had a right to appeal because the court had not sentenced him according to the plea agreement terms and conditions.because we find that ortiz waiver of appellate rights was not knowing and voluntary,we need not address whether the district court in fact sentenced ortiz according to the plea agreement terms and conditions,such that ortiz claim would fall within the scope of the waiver.see united states mccoy,cir even a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.
rule b h refers to the maximum possible penalty and not to the statutory penalty or statutory maximum.it therefore does not provide an exception for situations like this one,in which the statute itself does not specify a maximum.

the government relies in part on united states espinola,app x cir,vacated on other grounds,an unpublished opinion in which we held that,where it is clear from the record that defense counsel was thoroughly familiar with the psr,we will not assume that defense counsel did not discuss so critically important a document with his client,id.at quoting cruz,at.here,it is not clear from the record that ortiz attorney was thoroughly familiar with the psr.id.
similarly,in santo,we found that a rule error reasonably could have affected the defendant decision to change his plea to guilty where the mandatory minimum was ten years but the defendant was informed in the plea agreement and during the plea colloquy that it was five years.at.we decided santo before the supreme court held in vonn and dominguez benitez that a defendant who fails to preserve a rule claim must meet the plain error standard,which requires the defendant to establish a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have pled guilty.see vonn,dominguez benitez.nonetheless,we recognized in santo that the defendant faced a high hurdle because he had failed to seek withdrawal of his guilty plea in the lower court.we found the defendant had cleared that high hurdle and had shown a substantial defect in the rule proceeding itself.rivera maldonado,at quoting santo,at internal citation omitted.
at our request,ortiz attorney has filed a certified statement confirming that he discussed with his client the possibility that,if we were to grant his appeal and remand for a new hearing,he could receive up to a life sentence on remand.notwithstanding that risk,ortiz attorney has represented
