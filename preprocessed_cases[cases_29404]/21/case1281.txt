this case presents the question of whether the discharge of a cartridge from a millimeter semiautomatic pistol constitutes the use of an explosive for purposes of h.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it does not.
defendant appellant larone graham,abgod graham graham,appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seybert,sentencing him principally to a total of years imprisonment and five years supervised release,following his conviction,upon a jury trial,of conspiracy to affect commerce by robbery,in violation of a affecting commerce by robbery,in violation of a and conspiracy to affect commerce by extortion,in violation of a affecting commerce by extortion,in violation of a and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence,in violation of c a iii and using an explosive to commit a felony,in violation of h.graham year sentence included two consecutive,mandatory year terms of imprisonment for the violations of c a iii and h,both based on graham firing of a gun at the ground next to the victim of his extortion.
on appeal,graham argues principally that his conviction on count eleven of the superseding indictment for use of an explosive to commit a felony,in violation of h,should be reversed because the cartridge in the millimeter semiautomatic pistol he discharged during the course of his extortion does not constitute an explosive for purposes of the statute in the alternative,graham argues that convicting him for one act of discharging a gun in furtherance of extortion under both h,the explosives statute,and c a iii,the statute punishing the discharge of a firearm used or carried during and in relation to a crime of violence,constitutes multiple punishments for the same offense and therefore violates the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment,const.amend.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the term explosive in h does not include within its ambit the cartridge in the millimeter semiautomatic pistol used by graham.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court on count eleven of the superseding indictment in an accompanying summary order filed today,we reject graham remaining challenges to his conviction.accordingly,we reverse his conviction on count eleven,affirm his conviction on counts one,two,three,five,six,seven,and ten,and remand for de novo resentencing on these affirmed counts,see united states rigas,cir citing united states quintieri,cir.
background 
offense conduct 
the following background relates to the conduct charged in count eleven of the superseding indictment and is taken from the testimony at trial.
graham was the leader of a group of violent robbers associated with the louis pink houses the pink houses,a public housing project in brooklyn,new york.the group,which was sometimes known as the pink houses group,carried out robberies of jewelry and specialty stores,collecting,among other things,jewelry,cash,and fur coats.after graham henchmen completed the robberies,they would often gather in the parking lot of the pink houses and distribute the loot amongst themselves and to graham,their leader.
on december,members of the pink houses group robbed the diamond oro jewelry store at broadway and street in manhattan.the group was led by graham lieutenant,kareem davis davis and included pink houses group member tyrone redrick redrick and jamel thompson thompson,a member of another gang known as nfl.following this successful armed robbery,the robbers drove back to brooklyn,stopping briefly to drop thompson off at his girlfriend home.there,thompson examined the jewelry he had taken,electing to keep a few items for himself.these items included a gold,ornament depicting the head of jesus christ and referred to at trial as the jesus head.thompson put the remaining jewelry into a bag.
later that same day,thompson called nfl leader,michael harriston harriston,and explained that he had just executed a robbery with members of the pink houses group and would give harriston some of the jewelry he had stolen.the two men drove to thompson house,where thompson retrieved the jesus head and gave it to harriston in exchange for a diamond ring.
that night,a group that included graham,davis,and other pink houses group members met in the pink houses parking lot with thompson.thompson handed the bag of jewelry less the items he had removed over to the group.after reviewing the contents of the bag,graham indicated that he was disappointed in the loot and that thompson had botched up the job.after this meeting,graham and davis became suspicious that thompson had taken jewelry for himself without the group knowledge when thompson stopped at his house on the way back from the robbery.davis called thompson,who admitted that he had taken jewelry from the robbery,pawned it,and purchased a white acura with the proceeds.
graham discussed thompson theft from the group with davis and indicated that he wanted to go find thompson and make him give back the jewelry he had taken for himself.graham accompanied by other members of the group located thompson at a barber shop.after doing so,graham forced thompson to get into graham vehicle by,inter alia,firing a single shot into the ground with a millimeter pistol when thompson appeared ready to flee the scene.
the group drove to a pier in far rockaway,queens during the drive,thompson told graham and the others that he had given the jesus head to harriston in exchange for a ring.at the pier,graham and his lieutenants threatened thompson,who promised at gunpoint that he would pay back his debt to the pink houses group if he was allowed to live.the group then drove back to the pink houses and,later that night,released thompson on the condition that he commit more robberies to make it up to them.
the group convened at a gas station on atlantic avenue in brooklyn the next day to plan a robbery that thompson would commit to repay his debt.graham provided thompson with a mac to commit the robbery and directed him to rob a jewelry store on canal street in manhattan.though thompson ultimately did not commit the robbery due to the presence of a traffic policeman and a crowd of people around the store,later that same day or the next day redrick saw graham wearing the jesus head that had been stolen from the diamond oro.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
as relevant here,graham was indicted on the following charges count five,conspiracy to extort thompson,in violation of a and et count six,extortion of thompson,in violation of a,and et count ten,discharging a firearm during a crime of violence,in violation of c a iii,and et and count eleven,using an explosive to commit a felony,in violation of h,and et count ten charged that graham was subject to a mandatory consecutive year prison term for discharging the millimeter semiautomatic into the ground during and in relation to the extortion of thompson,while count eleven charged that the cartridge in the gun constituted an explosive used by thompson to commit the extortion,for which he was also liable for a mandatory consecutive year term.
trial began on january.agent john mckenna mckenna of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms atf testified for the government regarding how firearms and ammunition work.mckenna explained the mechanics of a semiautomatic pistol of the type fired by graham during the extortion of thompson 
when you pull the trigger,the mechanics will cause a hammer to fall,which will cause a firing pin to move forward,strike the rear of the ammunition,and in striking the rear of the ammunition,it will strike an area called the primer,which contains very volatile explosive material in it.so just the mere friction of it will cause a reaction and a fire.
from there,that primer will then light a propellant powder that is in the casing area.that propellant powder will burn very,very rapidly and create a lot of gas and heat.the gas is now looking for an area to escape,and it will cause the projectile at the top of the ammunition,the bullet,to then exit the firearm down the barrel and then out the firearm.
mckenna characterized this process as a within the bullet.
on february,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on counts five,six,ten,and eleven of the indictment,regarding the thompson extortion.the jury also found graham guilty of counts one,two,three,and seven,acquitting him as to counts four,eight,nine,and twelve.
with regard to counts five,six,and eleven,graham moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure rule motion,at.graham argued,inter alia,that h was never intended to prosecute the commonplace act of discharging a firearm,id.at,and that if applicable in this context,h was unconstitutionally vague as applied because the term explosive is being applied to the common and legal item,a bullet,and legally permissible conduct,discharging a firearm,id.at.
the government responded that the plain language of the statute includes ammunition because the definition of explosive in j refers to gunpowders and the various ignition methods which comport with the way ammunition functions.gov t opp to rule motion,at july.the government further argued that ammunition is explicitly excluded from g,a nearby subsection of that prohibits the possession of an explosive in an airport,thereby indicating that ammunition is not excluded from the definition of explosive applicable to h.id.finally,the government pointed out that,a section of the explosives act listing exceptions to the act applicability,provides that small arms ammunition and components thereof are excepted from some applications of the act,but not from the ambit of h.id.at.
the district court heard oral argument on graham rule motion at a july,hearing.it began by inquiring of the government as to whether it had charged a violation of h based on the discharge of a firearm during the commission of a felony in any other case.rule,at.the government replied that the only instance of which it was aware in the eastern district in which the government had prosecuted the discharge of a firearm under h had ended in dismissal of the charge,and that there is no appellate law on the issue of whether h covers the gunpowder in a cartridge.id.at.graham counsel argued that the inclusion of a cartridge under h is beyond congress intent and that a single shot from graham firearm was not an explosive because it was not in such proportions,quantities,or packaging as to fit within the definition of explosive.id.at.after hearing argument,the district court rejected graham rule arguments and denied the motion in its entirety.id.at.
by a judgment of june,the district court sentenced graham to months in prison,to be followed by five years supervised release,and ordered graham to make restitution in the amount of.graham month sentence included a consecutive,year mandatory term on each of his convictions under h and c a iii.this appeal followed.
discussion 
this case presents the question of whether the discharge of a cartridge from a millimeter semiautomatic pistol during the commission of an extortion implicates not only the year mandatory sentence in c a iii of the gun control act of,stat,codified as amended at c ed.and supp.v,prohibiting the discharge of a firearm used or carried during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,but also the mandatory year term provided for in h of the explosives control act,enacted as title xi of the organized crime control act of,stat,codified at et,which prohibits the use of an explosive to commit any felony which may be federally prosecuted.we review this question de novo.see united states mazza alaluf,cir.graham argues that the cartridge he discharged during thompson extortion does not fall within the meaning of explosive as used in h.we agree.
the explosives control act both regulates explosives by controlling their distribution,transportation and storage and criminalizes conduct related to explosives by providing criminal penalties for their intentional misuse.united states lorence,cir.we begin,as we must,with the act text.in conducting statutory analysis,we review the statutory text,considering the ordinary or natural meaning of the words chosen by congress,as well as the placement and purpose of those words in the statutory scheme.united states aguilar,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also county of nassau leavitt,cir noting that statutory language is read in light of the surrounding language and framework of the statute.a text plain meaning can best be understood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.saks franklin covey,cir.statutory construction,as the supreme court has said,is a holistic endeavor in which the meaning of a superficially ambiguous provision is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.ass of texas timbers of inwood forest,d.
section h provides in relevant part that 
w hoever uses fire or an explosive to commit any felony including a felony which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such felony,be sentenced to imprisonment for years notwithstanding any other provision of law the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall not run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment including that imposed for the felony in which the explosive was used or carried.
h.the term explosive is defined for purposes of h as 
gunpowders,powders used for blasting,all forms of high explosives,blasting materials,fuzes other than electric circuit breakers,detonators,and other detonating agents,smokeless powders,other explosive or incendiary devices within the meaning of paragraph of section of this title,and any chemical compounds,mechanical mixture,or device that contains any oxidizing and combustible units,or other ingredients,in such proportions,quantities,or packing that ignition by fire,by friction,by concussion,by percussion,or by detonation of the compound,mixture,or device or any part thereof may cause an explosion.
j explosives are therefore defined as falling into three categories articles like gun powder and blasting material that are commonly used as explosives explosive or incendiary devices within the meaning of c and chemical compounds or mixtures that may cause an explosion when ignited.lorence,at footnote omitted see also united states hepp,cir same united states hewitt,cir same.the government invokes two of these three categories in urging that the discharge of a firearm constitutes the use of an explosive the first category,on the theory that the fired cartridge contained gunpowder and the third category,on the theory that a cartridge is a device containing ingredients that,when ignited,cause an explosion.with regard to both contentions,we disagree.
as to the first theory,the government is correct that firearms like graham millimeter semiautomatic expel bullets by the combustion of gunpowder or other explosive material contained within the cartridge.see black law dictionary ed defining firearms.section j,however,does not specifically list either single cartridges or ammunition generally as a form of explosive falling within its ambit.instead,it defines explosive to mean,in relevant part,gunpowders,powders used for blasting,all forms of high explosives,blasting materials,fuzes other than electric circuit breakers,detonators,and other detonating agents and smokeless powders.j.
as the supreme court has advised,words and people are known by their companions.gutierrez ada,d id.at invoking the canon noscitur a sociis to narrow the relevant phrase in any election where the phrase was closely surrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elections accord gustafson alloyd,d.here,we deem it significant that the word gunpowders in j appears in a list of materials that also includes high explosives,detonators,and detonating agents all used in detonation,a particularly fierce and explosive chemical reaction producing vigorous evolution of heat and sparks or flame and moving through the material detonated as a high explosive such as dynamite or tnt at a speed greater than that of sound.webster third new int l dictionary.the list also includes blasting materials,commonly used for the breaking up of heavy masses as of rock by means of explosives.id.at.
to be sure,gunpowder is also a powerful explosive that can be used in blasting.and absent some indication in the text we hesitate to conclude that j requires some minimum quantity of gunpowder to be present before it will apply.in ordinary usage,however,a person carrying a single unspent pistol cartridge in his pocket a cartridge containing a small amount of gunpowder is hardly deemed by virtue of this to be armed with gunpowder or an explosive.we do not think congress intended this result,nor do we think the government interpretation of j that a single millimeter cartridge falls within its definition of explosive,simply because the cartridge contains a small quantity of gunpowder is reasonable.
this conclusion is not altered by the government second argument that the cartridge in graham millimeter weapon was,in effect,a device containing ingredients such that ignition could cause an explosion.section j defines explosive,in relevant part,as any chemical compound,mechanical mixture,or device that contains any oxidizing and combustible units,or other ingredients,in such proportions,quantities,or packing that ignition by fire,by friction,by concussion,by percussion,or by detonation of the compound,mixture,or device or any part thereof may cause an explosion.j.the government argues that this definition is applicable here because,as agent mckenna testified,a bullet fires via a.accepting this argument,however,would mean that the getaway driver in every bank robbery would also be subject to h not for robbing the bank,but for using an explosive to do so.after all,the internal combustion engine relies on a to produce the hot gaseous products of combustion acting on moving surfaces of the engine,such as the face of a piston,a turbine blade,or a nozzle,that cause the engine to run.see encyclopaedia britannica,internal combustion engine,http last visited.indeed,the chamber of the engine in which the combustion process occurs is sometimes known as the explosion chamber.oxford english dictionary ed.
we do not deem the government construction of j to be reasonable.in united states gelb,cir,we rejected the notion that spilled gasoline,used to set a commercial building afire,constituted an explosive for the purpose of j,simply because chemical compounds such as gasoline may cause an explosion under certain atmospheric conditions.id.at.the government,curiously,fails to cite gelb,much less discuss its implications here.at any rate,we need not speculate as to the line between mini explosions and larger ones,nor address j potential application to incendiary bullets,intended to ignite flammable materials such as gasoline,see encyclopaedia britannica,ammunition.last visited,or to ammunition generally,in order to conclude that a single millimeter cartridge does not constitute an explosive for the purpose of j,simply because it may be fired from a gun.
this conclusion is confirmed by consideration of the explosive control act penalty provisions in light of those contained in the gun control act.united,at interpreting d of the bankruptcy code so as to produce a substantive effect compatible with the rest of the law.in the version of c of the gun control act in effect when h was enacted,congress mandated a term of no less than one year and no more than years for anyone who carrie d a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the united states.c,supp.iv.section h was modeled on this provision except for the word explosive in h,instead of the word firearm in c,the two provisions as originally enacted were identical.united states ressam,d.thus,it is clear that congress meant to establish a sentencing enhancement for use of explosives as a counterpart to the existing firearms enhancement,in order to address an emerging social concern with the tragedy of lost lives and damage to property caused by bombings,gelb,at.despite the close relationship between the two provisions,however,there is no hint in the text or structure of the explosives control act that congress also intended to heighten substantially the existing firearms enhancement,so long as the firearm at issue happened to contain at least one cartridge.
as the supreme court pointed out in ressam,moreover,congress thereafter redrafted what was then c the firearms enhancement to,inter alia,increase its penalties,delete the word unlawfully and insert the words and in relation to immediately after the word during.ressam,at.the provision was amended to apply to those who carr y a firearm during and in relation to the commission of qualifying felonies in order to allay concerns that a person could be prosecuted under this provision for committing an entirely unrelated crime while in possession of a firearm,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.section h the explosives enhancement was thereafter also amended to delete the word unlawfully but,significantly,not to insert the words in relation to,as was done with regard to c.see id.at.
the supreme court in ressam concluded from this enactment history that congress in amending h did not intend to introduce a relational requirement into the explosives provision.id.at.accordingly,unlike c,h applies whenever explosives are carried during the commission of a felony under united states law the careful distinction between explosives and firearms that the ressam court perceived congress to have enacted in amending h,however,comes substantially undone if j,when enacted,brought a millimeter cartridge within the terms of h.for if the government construction is correct,an individual will always be subject to the explosives enhancement for committing a felony under united states law while carrying a firearm,so long as the gun is loaded.
nor do the difficulties with the government construction end there.congress in confined the heightened penalties applicable pursuant to c to those who use or carry firearms during and in relation to crimes of violence,thereafter also making them applicable in the context of drug trafficking crimes.section h,however,applies to those who use explosives to commit any felony under united states law,or who carry explosives during the commission of such a crime.indeed,pursuant to the government construction,if an individual merely happened to have a pistol cartridge in his pocket during the commission of any felony under united states law including,one may suppose,telemarketing fraud,software piracy,and illicitly cutting and removing timber on public land,he thereby triggers the explosives act year mandatory consecutive term in addition to whatever penalty he might receive for the underlying crime.again,however,carefully limiting the reach of the gun control act enhanced penalties makes little sense if the possession of a loaded firearm automatically triggers the sentencing enhancement in the explosives act.and the government construction that a person like graham triggers application of both c a iii and h produces the very odd result that a bank robber armed only with a pistol,who shoots it once into the air to intimidate the bank customers,could be punished more severely years more severely,to be exact than a robber who uses a flask of nitroglycerin to accomplish the same result.
the government suggests that the fourth circuit decision in united states davis,cir,supports its reading of the statute.suffice it to say that the davis court,which concluded that the sentencing enhancement for property damage by use of explosives,see ussg,includes the damage caused by projectiles discharged from a firearm,davis,at,was merely interpreting a sentencing guideline,and so had no occasion in its quite brief discussion of explosive,id.at,to grapple with the relationship between the respective sentencing enhancements in h explosives and c firearms.
the government also relied in its opposition to graha
