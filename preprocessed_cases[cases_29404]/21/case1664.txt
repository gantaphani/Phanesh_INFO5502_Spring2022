raul ramirez appeals from a judgment entered on may,in the united states district court for the western district of new york richard arcara,chief judge,sentencing him to months imprisonment.on appeal,ramirez argues that the district court erred in finding that each of the two prior conditional discharge sentences he received under penal law was a term of probation for purposes of c a of the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines,and thus subject to inclusion in ramirez score.we find that the sentences were properly counted under c a,and accordingly affirm this part of the district court decision.
ramirez also challenges the district court determination,based on information in the presentence report psr and an unidentified document,that ramirez had previously been convicted of two offenses in puerto rico that should be counted in calculating his sentence under the guidelines.because,as is explained below,we are remanding this case to allow the district court to consider whether to resentence ramirez in accordance with united states crosby,cir,we decline to address the validity of the district court finding with regard to the puerto rican convictions.to facilitate the resolution of this issue in any future appeal taken by ramirez,however,we direct the district court,upon remand,to clarify the nature and contents of the document on which it relied,and to include that document in the record.
background 
in june,ramirez pleaded guilty in the district court,pursuant to an agreement with the government,to one count of conspiracy to possess heroin with the intent to distribute.in the plea agreement,ramirez conceded that he had been paid to claim two packages at the post office that he knew contained heroin.the agreement contemplated a base offense level of and the application of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under a and b,yielding a total offense level of.the agreement added two points to ramirez score for a misdemeanor conviction in new york state court for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle,bringing ramirez category to level ii.the applicable guideline range under these calculations was to months imprisonment.
prior to sentencing,the probation office issued a psr that suggested ramirez had been involved in past criminal conduct unaccounted for in the plea agreement.the psr disclosed two convictions in new york state court for which ramirez received conditional discharge sentences under penal law a plea to one count of disorderly conduct,and a plea to one count of driving without a license.the psr recommended adding one point for each of these convictions under c.the psr also cited two convictions in the superior court of puerto rico,one for conjugal abuse,threats,and violation of the puerto rican weapons law in october,and the other in february for possession of a controlled substance.the psr indicated that ramirez had been sentenced to one term of eighteen months imprisonment and two terms of six months imprisonment on the various counts of the october conviction,and one term of two years imprisonment for the february conviction.the psr recommended adding three points for each of the puerto rican convictions,under a.
the eight additional points recommended in the psr together with the two points contemplated in the plea agreement brought ramirez score to,and placed him in category v.an offense level of and a category of v produced a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.prior to sentencing,ramirez objected to the inclusion of all eight additional points.he argued that because the two new york state convictions for disorderly conduct and driving without a license were on the list of excludable minor offenses in c,they should not be counted in calculating his criminal history.while ramirez recognized that,under c a,such offenses,even if on the list of excludable offenses,must be counted if the sentence received for the offense was a term of probation of at least one year,he contended that the sentence of conditional discharge he had received under new york law did not amount to probation,as the term is used in c a.thus,ramirez argued that the psr erroneously added two points for his convictions for disorderly conduct and driving without a license.
ramirez also argued that the district court should not include the puerto rican convictions in his calculation.he claimed that the information contained in the psr lacked sufficient indica of reliability because it had been obtained through some kind of database,and had not been verified by documentary evidence or through contact with the court in puerto rico.ramirez also pointed out that the probation office had been unable to obtain a date of arrest for the february conviction.thus,according to ramirez,it was possible that the offense resulting in the february conviction occurred on the same day as that resulting in the october conviction.if that were so,he argued,the two offenses would be related under a,and,pursuant to that provision,only one of them could be counted in his score.
the district court imposed sentence in may.it found that a sentence under new york law is the equivalent of a term of probation for purposes of c a because the statute describing conditional discharge,penal law,provides that such a sentence can be modified or revoked if the terms of the discharge are violated.the district court thus followed the psr recommendation to add one point for each of ramirez two offenses carrying a sentence the district court also agreed with the psr that six points should be added for ramirez convictions in puerto rico.the court stated that it had recently received documentation from puerto rico,and that although the document is in spanish,the court has been able to discern that it does in fact support the inclusion of the puerto rican convictions described in the psr.the court did not describe the document or otherwise address its contents.
after it was clear that the district court would sentence ramirez based on a category of v,ramirez moved for a downward departure,arguing that the category the seriousness of his criminal record.the court declined to depart.finding the applicable guidelines range to be to months,the district court sentenced ramirez to months imprisonment.ramirez appealed.
discussion 
probation under c a 
the district court ruled that a sentence under penal law is the equivalent of a term of probation of at least one year under c a this determination called for the interpretation of a guidelines provision and thus raises a question of law that is subject to de novo review in our court.see united states rubenstein,cir united states vasquez,cir.
in general,no points are assessed for prior sentences imposed for the fifteen offenses listed under c.that list of offenses includes driving without a license and disorderly conduct.see c.this rule,however,is subject to exceptions in c a and b.the first of these exceptions provides that sentences imposed for the listed offenses are counted in the calculation if the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days c a.
ramirez argues that the term probation does not include a sentence like the one authorized by penal law because such a sentence does not contemplate active supervision by a probation officer.section allows a sentencing court to release a convicted defendant into the community on condition that he abide by a set of terms,but does not require that these terms include reporting to a probation officer or other supervisory official.indeed,there is a separate new york statute defining probation,which does contain such a requirement.see penal law.although many,if not most,of the conditions that may be imposed for probation and conditional discharge under new york law are the same,see penal law,probation is the more onerous sentence.see,id.a conditional discharge may only be imposed where the sentencing court finds that probation supervision is not appropriate.
the fact that new york nominally distinguishes between probation and conditional discharge is of limited relevance to defining the meaning of the term probation as used in c a
