appellant raymar lucena rivera is currently serving a term of imprisonment of months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit money laundering as set forth in a indictment that also included charges.in this sentencing appeal,lucena rivera argues that the district court erred in calculating the amount of laundered funds relevant to his base offense level,applying an enhancement for having a leadership role,applying an enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds,and failing to adequately consider the factors set forth in a.essentially,lucena rivera contends that the district court unduly relied on evidence concerning the underlying drug crimes rather than the moneylaundering itself when determining his sentence.
although we disagree with that assessment,we nonetheless conclude that more specific factual findings are necessary to allow us to adequately review the application of the enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds.we find lucena rivera other claims of error meritless.hence,we will remand the matter to the district court with directions to revisit only the application of the enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds while upholding the district court other sentencing determinations.
because there was no trial,the underlying facts of the case are taken from the plea agreement and investigation report psi 
lucena rivera had been engaged in and activities for two years before the moneylaundering activities at issue in this case began in.on multiple occasions prior to,he moved between and kilograms of cocaine into puerto rico,keeping some to kilograms for himself.
the transactions and activities relevant to lucenarivera conviction included the following interactions with a dea confidential source,who contacted lucenarivera in and introduced himself as someone in the drugtrafficking business 
in cash delivered in plastic containers to the confidential source on may,to be divided between a check for made out to lucmar solutions,in cash delivered to colombia as payment for drugs,and the source commission 
a september meeting in panama between lucena rivera,edgardo torres vázquez two of lucena rivera associates,and the confidential source wherein the details of a transaction including the denominations of the bills,the fee,and the timing were discussed 
in cash delivered to the confidential source on september,in exchange for various checks for real estate expenditures,including one made out to joyuda beach resort for 
in cash delivered to the confidential source on september,
in cash delivered by the confidential source to lucena rivera associates in panama 
delivered to the confidential source on november,of which was to be delivered in cash to panama as payment for drugs 
to be delivered by edgardo torres vázquez to the confidential source in march and 
left for the confidential source to pick up and transport to new york as payment for drugs in august.
the total of the transactions was over million.lucena rivera argued that of the total amount laundered,used to purchase properties,was not tied to drug trafficking therefore,it was not relevant to the charge of promotional money laundering.though expressing doubt as to the factual and legal merit of this objection,the district court nonetheless excluded that amount from its calculation.accordingly,the district court determined that the total amount laundered for sentencing purposes was between million and million,triggering an increase to the base offense under a.
the government also pressed for three sentencing enhancements a enhancement for knowledge that any of the laundered money was proceeds of,or intended to promote the distribution of,a controlled substance a enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds and a enhancement for having a leadership role in the offense.lucena rivera did not object to the enhancement based on his knowledge that the funds were involved in,but did object to the other two.
the district court rejected appellant objections to the two enhancements.it found that the operation involved more than five participants and was under the leadership of lucena rivera,thus warranting the application of a enhancement under a.the court also found that the enhancement under b c for being in the business of laundering funds applied to lucena rivera because of the intertwined nature of his money laundering and drug trafficking activities.these enhancements produced a total offense level of,which yielded a guideline range of months with the upper limit being the statutory maximum.
the district court explained the sentence of months as follows 
w hat i will do is i will sentence him to months,not to reach the statutory maximum.it means nothing.but that what it is.it like some sort of courtesy adjustment,if you will 
do doubt for a minute that i do think this is this was a very closely intertwined drug business and money laundering case.extremely closely intertwined.very difficult.very difficult.principles of relevant conduct,when you look at the whole thing,justify easily the level on the amount.easily.
the court provided no further explanation of the sentence imposed,nor did lucena rivera request any.
on appeal,lucena rivera challenges the total offense level calculation and the proffered reasons for the sentence.specifically,he contests the calculation of the quantity of laundered funds the applicability of the enhancement for having a leadership role and the applicability of the enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds.as to the basis for the sentence,lucena rivera further argues that the district court did not adequately address the factors under a and did not adequately explain the reasons for the sentence imposed.
his appeal blends legal and factual arguments.to the extent that his challenge is based on questions of law,we review de novo.see united states walker,cir.to the extent that his challenge to an enhancement is based on the factual findings of the district court,we review only to determine whether those findings were clearly erroneous.id.
amount of laundered funds 
lucena rivera first argues that the district court erred in lumping together all of the cash amounts involved in the transactions with the confidential source.specifically,he asserts that concealment money laundering and promotional money laundering are two distinct offenses and therefore any funds laundered for concealing,rather than promoting,unlawful activity should not have been included in the quantity calculation for the purposes of sentencing and the government had the burden of proving that each transaction involved funds that were proceeds of completed drug transactions and failed to meet that burden.
promotional and concealment money laundering 
the statute,a a i applies when an individual knowingly uses the proceeds of an unlawful activity in a financial transaction with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.a a i.another provision of a applies when an individual knowingly uses the proceeds of an unlawful activity in a financial transaction to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.a b i.
lucena rivera contends that those two subparts of the statute are separate crimes promotional money laundering and concealment money laundering,respectively.following from that argument,he claims that,as a matter of law,the quantity of funds used to calculate his total offense level should have included only those funds that were laundered for promoting illegal activity,rather than for concealing the source of the funds.the government responds that there is only one crime money laundering and that,whatever the purposes of the laundering,all of the funds should be considered in sentencing determinations.
we have previously described promotional and concealment money laundering as two different modalities of the same offense.united states cedeño pérez,cir citing united states iacaboni,cir see also united states garcía torres,cir.in cedeño pérez there was only one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,but the indictment charged the defendant with conspiring to commit both modalities.at.that treatment of the offense as a single crime with different modalities comports with the government position here,as well as with our sister circuits views.see,united states bolden,cir united states booth,cir united states holmes,cir accord united states meshack,cir,amended by cir per curiam united states navarro,cir.
consistent with precedent,we reaffirm that promotional and concealment money laundering are not distinct crimes,but rather alternative means of committing the general offense of money laundering.accordingly,in calculating the total amount of funds laundered for the purposes of sentencing,the district court did not have to distinguish between those funds that may have been laundered for concealment rather than for promotion.
proof as to source of funds 
lucena rivera argues that the government bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the funds involved in each separate transaction included in the total amount calculation were the proceeds of a specific type of unlawful act namely,lucena rivera acknowledges that the government need not point to the specific drug deals that generated the ultimately laundered funds.he nonetheless argues that,for each transaction,the general source of the funds must be identified and the funds must have already been exchanged for drugs in a completed transaction before they can be considered proceeds of unlawful activity.
drawing on these indisputable propositions,lucena rivera then emphasizes the distinction between collecting money as proceeds of prior drug deals and later using that money to promote unlawful activity by purchasing more drugs in the future.he claims that the government and the district court wrongly conflated the two activities in evaluating the evidence on whether the laundered funds were proceeds of prior drug deals.
other circuits have specifically addressed the potential conflation of the proceeds and promotion elements.courts have recognized that simply because money is used to promote future unlawful activity it does not necessarily follow that the money was earned through prior unlawful activity.in recognizing this distinction,the fifth circuit has indeed held that funds do not become the proceeds of drug trafficking until a sale of drugs is completed,and found that the government failed to prove this element by simply showing that the money was eventually exchanged for drugs.united states gaytan,cir citing united states puig infante,cir see also united states harris,cir reaffirming the rule that m oney does not become proceeds of illegal activity until the unlawful activity is complete and the principle that t he crime of money laundering is targeted at the activities that generally follow the unlawful activity in time.
although the district court unquestionably considered evidence that the laundered funds were involved in future drug deals,there is no indication that the district court unduly relied on such evidence in making its determination that those funds were proceeds of prior drug deals.in the context of a criminal conspiracy,we think it appropriate to consider the use of laundered funds for the perpetuation of an unlawful activity as circumstantial,but not conclusive,evidence that those funds were derived from that same unlawful activity.
the record also included evidence that went beyond simply demonstrating that the funds were used to purchase drugs in the future.according to the psi,lucena rivera had been transporting drugs for a organization for two years prior to,moving between and kilograms of cocaine at a time into puerto rico.the psi further set forth numerous conversations between lucena rivera and the dea confidential source about activities involving lucena rivera and his associates.
finally,the psi also set forth lucena rivera reported income for the tax years.that income was insufficient to supply the quantity of funds involved in the transactions at issue as well as to support lucena rivera purchases of real estate,cars,and other assets.under the circumstances,it was reasonable for the district court to conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that more than million of the laundered funds were the proceeds of lucena rivera earlier activities.
role in the offense enhancement 
to impose the leadership enhancement under a,the district court is required to make two findings a status determination,that the defendant acted as an organizer or leader of the criminal activity,and a scope determination,that the criminal activity met either the numerosity or the extensiveness benchmarks established by the guideline.united states carrero hernández,cir quoting united states tejada beltrán,cir.lucena rivera contends that the government failed to prove either of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence,and,therefore,the district court erred in finding that the enhancement applied.
as to status,lucena rivera is indeed correct that we draw an important distinction between organizing criminal activities and organizing criminal actors.carrero hernández,at emphasis omitted.to apply an enhancement under a,the district court must find that a defendant exercised control over criminal actors,rather than just planned criminal activity.id.at quoting united states jones,cir i t is not enough that the defendant merely controlled,organized,or managed criminal activities he must instead control,organize,or manage criminal actors.this status determination is distinct from the numerosity determination and simply asks whether the defendant exercised control over any other criminal actors.hence,to satisfy the status element,r egardless of whether the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,a defendant needs only to have led or organized one criminal participant,besides himself of course.united states arbour,cir.
the psi summarizes lucena rivera own description of his operation to the dea confidential source upon their first meeting,which included the assurance that he paid his employees well to prevent them from talking if arrested.the psi also describes several transactions that involved participants in addition to lucena rivera who appeared to be under his direction.the most prominent example is the march transaction in which torres vázquez delivered money from lucena rivera to the dea confidential source lastly,the psi makes repeated references to lucena rivera partners and employees.accordingly,the district court finding that lucena rivera led or organized other participants was not clearly erroneous.
as to scope,lucena rivera does not dispute that more than five individuals were involved in his operation,but contends that there was no basis to conclude that those individuals were also involved in the offense of conviction.the introductory commentary to chapter,part b provides that t he determination of a defendant role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of relevant conduct and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.ch,pt.b,introductory cmt.section a a includes in the definition of relevant conduct all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,in preparation for that offense,or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense emphasis added.
here,the activity was a necessary precursor to the offense of conviction.accordingly,the court conclusion that the criminal activity involved five or more participants was not clearly erroneous 
in the business of laundering funds 
the guidelines set forth in begin by laying out two different methods for calculating the base offense level under a the base offense level for the charge is the same as the base offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived if a the defendant committed the underlying offense or would be accountable for the underlying offense under principles of relevant conduct and b the offense level for that offense can be determined.under this method,a defendant who launders the proceeds of his crimes,and is only convicted of money laundering,is susceptible to punishment equivalent to the punishment applicable to the underlying criminal activity.see united states descent,cir per curiam explaining that the change in the guidelines to make reference to the underlying offense was an effort to have the sentence better reflect the culpability of the defendant.however,if either of the elements of subsection a is not satisfied,the base offense level for the charge is calculated pursuant to a,which incorporates the tables that provide base offense levels for other crimes involving illegally obtained funds.here,both parties agreed that subsection a applied.hence,we focus on the district court application of the enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds set forth in b c.
that application requires the district court to examine the totality of the circumstances to decide whether a defendant was in the business of laundering funds.see cmt.n.the application note to the guideline directs the court to consider the following list of factors 
i the defendant regularly engaged in laundering funds.
ii the defendant engaged in laundering funds during an extended period of time.
iii the defendant engaged in laundering funds from multiple sources.
iv the defendant generated a substantial amount of revenue in return for laundering funds.
v at the time the defendant committed the instant offense,the defendant had one or more prior convictions related to money laundering or international financial transactions 
vi during the course of an undercover government investigation,the defendant made statements that the defendant engaged in any of the conduct described in subdivisions i through iv.
neither party suggests an alternative definition of what it means to be in the business of laundering funds.we have also declined to adopt a firm definition of the term,instead pointing the district courts to the sentencing commission commentary to the revision to as to who is subject to the business enhancement,t he commission determined that,similar to a professional fence,see.b b,defendants who routinely engage in laundering funds on behalf of others,and who gain financially from engaging in such transactions,warrant substantial additional punishment because they encourage the commission of additional criminal conduct.united states aguasvivas castillo,cir quoting app.c,vol.ii,at.
the district court specifically acknowledged the factors set forth in the application note but made no factual findings as to their existence.instead,the district court focused on the intertwined nature of the and businesses and little else.though the underlying activity may have constituted relevant conduct for the purpose of applying the other enhancements to the conviction,it is not encompassed by the list of factors set forth in the application note for evaluating the business enhancement.
the lack of adequate findings on the factors set forth in the application note prevents us from reviewing appropriately the application of the enhancement.accordingly,we will follow the practice,reaffirmed in united states quinones,cir,of remanding the matter to the district court with directions to revisit,on the basis of the existing record,the application of the enhancement for being in the business of laundering funds.on remand the district court can elect to either a vacate the sentence and conduct a new sentencing hearing to resentence lucena rivera without the application of the enhancement or b reaffirm the sentence previously imposed,filing with the clerk of the district court written findings,based upon the existing record and consistent with this opinion,as to the application of the enhancement.before making its decision between these courses of action,the district court has discretion to hold a hearing and invite attorney argument on the question of whether the existing record would support the findings necessary to apply the enhancement.see id.at.as we noted in quinones,this approach is appropriate when the basis in the sentencing record for the application of an enhancement requires clarification.see id.at citing united states levy,cir,and united states parra ibanez,cir.
we therefore withhold judgment and remand the matter to the district court.the district court shall notify the clerk of this court as to which option it chooses within twenty days of the date of this order.should the court elect to proffer written findings rather than resentence lucena rivera,those findings must be filed with the clerk of the district court within sixty days of the court notification,and thereafter promptly transmitted to the clerk of this court.we will retain appellate jurisdiction over the matter to assess the adequacy of those findings in due course.however,should the district court indicate that it elects to vacate lucena rivera sentence and resentence him without applying the business enhancement,this court will issue judgment remanding the case to the district court so that it can vacate the sentence and proceed to resentencing.
section a factors and the explanation for the sentence 
when,as here,a defendant does not raise an objection to the sentencing judge explanation and alleged failure to address the a factors in the district court,we review a subsequent challenge to the adequacy of the sentencing analysis for plain error.see united states murphy cordero,cir.
section a factors 
in interpreting the procedural requirement to undertake a a analysis,we have held that a sentencing court is not obligated to conduct an express weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors or individually mention each a factor.id.at quoting united states lozada aponte,cir.the inquiry on appeal thus becomes whether we are satisfied from the district court limited explanation that it considered all of the applicable factors and viewed the sentence as sufficient to account for the defendant individual circumstances.united states zapata,cir.
here,the district court offered only a cursory explanation for the sentence,saying that it reflected a courtesy adjustment.if that were the only explanation in the record,a remand might well be warranted for further consideration and explanation,even under the plain error standard.however,the district court made references during the course of the sentencing hearing indicating that other a factors were considered in particular the need for adequate deterrence under a b and the seriousness of the offense under a a.
specifically,in response to defense counsel argument that lucena rivera was simply an intermediary the money man as he put it and even a slight punishment for him would thus be sufficient to send a message to about the culpability of everyone in their organization,the district court took the view that a guideline sentence was warranted because money laundering is an integral part of drug trafficking.the court also emphasized the seriousness of the offense,concluding the explanation for the sentence with the statement,p rinciples of relevant conduct,when you look at the whole thing,justify easily the level enhancement.easily.as for lucena rivera principal argument for a sentence on the basis of his personal history and characteristics pursuant to a the court reference to a courtesy adjustment,though imprecisely worded,was apparently a reference to his stature in his family and the community.
accordingly,the district court did not plainly err in its consideration of the a factors or its limited explanation thereof.
sentencing factor manipulation 
lucena rivera contends that the district court did not adequately address or credit his allegations of sentencing factor manipulation sentencing factor manipulation occurs where government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of a crime.united states fontes,cir alteration in original quoting united states montoya,cir.we have recognized that because b y definition,there is an element of manipulation in any sting operation,relief for sentencing factor manipulation is reserved for only the extreme and unusual case.fontes,at first alteration in original quoting united states connell,cir and montoya,at.the defendant bears the burden of establishing sentencing factor manipulation by a preponderance of the evidence,united states gibbens,cir,and a district judge determination as to whether improper manipulation exists is ordinarily a factbound determination subject to review.id.at.
here,lucena rivera argues that the government possessed enough information and evidence to prosecute him as of september,yet continued to launder money and import drugs with him until august.lucena rivera maintains that the government motivation for continuing this criminal activity was to inflate his eventual sentence.see united states egemonye,cir noting that a government sting operation could not be endlessly prolonged and enlarged,but finding no extraordinary misconduct there.
although the investigation was prolonged beyond the initial transaction,lucena rivera has not sustained his burden of demonstrating an improper motive for this prolongation.on the contrary,the limited record on this issue suggests proper motives.as noted at the outset,one of lucena rivera associates torres vázquez was indicted and convicted on the basis of,in part,information and evidence obtained during the later transactions between himself,lucena rivera,and the confidential informant.see united states torres vázquez,cir see also united states barbour,cir noting that a proper motive for prolonging an investigation would be to identify more of the conspirators and gather evidence against them.furthermore,the government was investigating lucena rivera for drug crimes at the time,not simply,and law enforcement authorities may not have completed their investigation of those crimes.
although more explanation from the district court would have aided our review,it invoked generally first circuit case law in stating its conclusion that lucena rivera failed to demonstrate that the government was motivated by an improper goal rather than a legitimate one.on this record,that determination was not clearly erroneous.see barbour,at a district court choice between two or more reasonable interpretations of the evidence can not be called clearly erroneous.
for the reasons set forth in part above,we remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.we retain jurisdiction for the time being pending the district court election as to whether to file additional written findings as described in this opinion or,alternatively,to vacate the sentence.so ordered.
lucena rivera objected to only three paragraphs of the psi,and,thereby accepting the factual findings in the remainder of the report.
torres vázquez also pleaded guilty to.he appealed his conviction on grounds of factual insufficiency and sentencing error.we affirmed his conviction on the basis of factual findings not relevant to lucena rivera appeal.see united states torres vázquez,cir.
the indictment included one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.that count cited overt acts that were also charged as separate counts of money laundering.each of those counts charged lucena rivera with a violation of a a i and alleged that he did knowingly conduct and attempt to conduct a financial transaction affecting interstate and foreign commerce that involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity,that is drug trafficking with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity emphasis added.lucena rivera plea agreement required him to plead only to the overarching conspiracy charge rather than to each count of money laundering separately.
as discussed in part i,supra,lucena rivera conceded the applicability of the enhancement pursuant to b,which amounted to an admission that he knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of,or were intended to promote.id.emphasis added.in contesting the total amount calculation on appeal,he argues that the government failed to show that all of the laundered funds involved in the transactions at issue were proceeds of.
contrary to lucena rivera contention,the undisputed facts contained in the psi support the conclusion that he organized or led torres vázquez.
lucena rivera attempts to blunt the force of this conclusion by arguing that relevant conduct can not be considered in these circumstances.he points to,application note c,which states that in cases in which subsection a applies,application of any chapter three adjustment shall be determined based on the offense conduct covered by this guideline,the laundering of criminally derived funds and not on the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived,cmt.c.lucena rivera acknowledges that by its own terms this application note applies only to cases in which subsection a applies and that he was appropriately sentenced under subsection a.however,because the district court found that he was involved in the underlying drug trafficking conduct,and because subsection a applies to defendants who committed or could be held accountable for the underlying offense,he urges us nonetheless to apply this argument fails because lucena rivera can not have it both ways his concession that the district court appropriately sentenced him under subsection a is dispositive.given this concession,there is simply no basis for using the application note relevant to subsection a.
reads as follows a base offense level the offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived,if a the defendant committed the underlying offense or would be accountable for the underlying offense under subsection a a of relevant conduct and b the offense level for that offense can be determined or plus the number of offense levels from the table in theft,property destruction,and fraud corresponding to the value of the laundered funds,otherwise.b specific offense characteristics if a subsection a applies and b the defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of,or were intended to promote i an offense involving the manufacture,importation,or distribution of a controlled substance or a listed chemical ii a crime of violence or iii an offense involving firearms,explosives,national security,or the sexual exploitation of a minor,increase by levels.apply the greatest a if the defendant was convicted under,increase by level.b if the defendant was convicted under,increase by levels.c if i subsection a applies and ii the defendant was in the business of laundering funds,increase by levels.if a subsection b b applies and b the offense involved sophisticated laundering,increase by levels.
among other things,the revision consolidated the money laundering guidelines,previously laundering of monetary instruments and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.it reflected an attempt to make the penalty structure address more adequately the culpability of the defendant or the seriousness of the money laundering conduct.app.c,vol.ii,at.
we emphasize that any new sentencing hearing would be limited to simply resentencing lucena rivera on the basis of an offense level and guideline range calculation that did not include the business enhancement.we note that lucena rivera concedes that if the business enhancement were not applied to him,the enhancement for convict ion under,the statute of conviction here,would apply in the alternative.b directing the court to apply the greatest of a menu of specific offense characteristics enhancements.the resultant offense level would thus be as opposed to the calculated with the business enhancement,and the new guideline range would be months as opposed to months.
although we quoted it earlier,the text of the district court explanation is reproduced here for convenience w hat i will do is i will sentence him to months,not to reach the statutory maximum.it means nothing.but that what it is.it like some sort of courtesy adjustment,if you will do doubt for a minute that i do think this was a very closely intertwined drug business and money laundering
