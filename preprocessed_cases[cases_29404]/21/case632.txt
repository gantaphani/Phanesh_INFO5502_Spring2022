nelson and elias were tried together and convicted of drug and weapons crimes charged in two consolidated cases.rodriguez appeals his convictions and sentence.he contends that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress and to sever,that the jury did not represent a fair cross section of the community,and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions.he also challenges his sentence.rivera raises three issues,all pertaining to his sentence.rodriguez convictions and sentences on the gun charges are vacated his convictions and sentences are otherwise affirmed.rivera sentence is affirmed.
members of the family,including nelson,were involved in a drug trafficking organization,known as callejón de los conejos,that operated in ponce,puerto rico.a federal grand jury returned an indictment,dated september,charging rivera and nine others,including his three brothers and his mother,with a drug conspiracy that operated from until the date of the indictment criminal case.an arrest warrant was issued for rivera.
the united states marshals service learned that rivera was living at an apartment in cataño,puerto rico.on september,deputy united states marshals and puerto rico special response team officers went to that apartment to arrest rivera.the officers knocked on the apartment door and announced their presence.one of the officers saw a man,whom he recognized,look out of a window near the door when no one responded to their knocking,the officers knocked down the door and entered the apartment behind an officer carrying a shield.
as the officers entered,they saw rodriguez,wearing a leg brace but not using a crutch,walking toward them.they also saw rivera looking out of the bedroom door,holding a gun.the officers secured rodriguez.rivera closed and locked the bedroom door,but after an officer kicked the door twice,rivera opened the door and came out without the gun.the officers secured rivera.
the officers and federal marshals entered the bedroom.a crutch was on the bed.they found heroin,cocaine,packaging for the drugs,and money.clothing and cell phones were also found in the room.they discovered a loaded taurus mm pistol under a pillow on the bed and a loaded glock caliber pistol in a box under the bed.they found additional equipment for processing and packaging drugs in the kitchen.rivera and rodriguez were arrested.
a grand jury indicted rivera and rodriguez on october,for crimes arising from the circumstances of their arrest in cataño criminal case.they were charged with possessing heroin,cocaine,cocaine base,and marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of a with possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of c and and with aiding and abetting each other in those crimes.rivera and rodriguez were each charged,separately,with being a felon in possession of firearms in violation of g.in december of,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment in criminal case,charging rivera and rodriguez with conspiring with ten other,including rivera brothers and mother,to possess with the intent to distribute heroin,cocaine,cocaine base,and marijuana in violation of a.the court granted the government motion to consolidate the two cases.
rivera and rodriguez moved to suppress the evidence found in the cataño apartment,and a hearing was held on the motions on august.at the hearing,the court realized that an issue existed as to whether the defendants had standing to challenge the evidence.the court denied rodriguez motion,due to his lack of standing,and gave rivera an opportunity to brief the issue.a further hearing on rivera motion to suppress was held on november,and.the court denied rivera motion on december.
jury selection was held on april.on may,counsel gave their opening statements,and the government called its first witness.evidence continued each day through thursday,may.on may,rodriguez filed a motion to sever his trial from rivera trial,arguing that if they were tried separately,rivera would provide exculpatory testimony for rodriguez,based on rivera testimony at the suppression hearing.the court held a hearing on rodriguez motion on monday,may.the government objected to severance.
despite noting that the motion to sever was untimely,the court decided to sever the trial of criminal case.from criminal case.under the new schedule,both defendants would be tried on the charges in criminal case first,and a separate trial for criminal case would be held at a later time.following the lunch break the same day,however,the court reconsidered the severance issue and denied the motion as untimely.trial proceeded,as originally planned,on the charges against both defendants in both cases.
after the conclusion of the government case,both defendants moved for judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.the motions were denied.on may,the jury returned its verdict finding rivera and rodriguez guilty on all charges 
presentence reports were prepared and submitted.rivera objected to the drug quantities and other parts of his presentence report.rodriguez requested that new counsel be appointed to represent him for sentencing,and the court appointed new counsel on november.
rodriguez sentencing hearing was held on may.the court found a total offense level of and a criminal history category of ii resulting in an advisory guideline range of to months.after reciting the factors set forth in a and discussing the extent of rodriguez drug transactions,the nature of his offenses and his role in them,his injuries,and his possession of weapons,as noted in the presentence report,the court concluded that a sentence at the high end of the range was appropriate.rodriguez was sentenced to months on count one in criminal case months on counts one,two,and three in criminal case months on count four and months on count seven of criminal case,all such terms to run concurrently.in addition,he was sentenced to months on count five in criminal case,said sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences imposed resulting in a total sentence of months.terms of supervised release were also imposed.
rivera sentencing hearing began on march,and was continued to august.the court found a base offense level of and applied a increase based on rivera leadership role,which yielded an adjusted offense level of.the court found a criminal history category of vi based on his status as a career criminal.a criminal history category of vi,combined with a total offense level of,resulted in an advisory guideline range of months to life.
rivera was sentenced to life in prison on count one of criminal case.in criminal case,rivera was sentenced to life in prison on counts one and three and to terms of years on count two,months on count four,and months on count six,all such terms to run concurrently.in addition,he was sentenced to a term of months for his conviction on count five in criminal case,which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in criminal case.terms of supervised release were also imposed.
rivera and rodriguez filed timely notices of appeal.
on appeal,rodriguez challenges the district court denial of his motions,the of the jury,the sufficiency of the evidence,and his sentence.rivera raises issues pertaining to his sentence.we consider the issues raised by the parties in turn.
rodriguez appeal 
rodriguez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from rivera trial and in denying him a hearing on his motion to suppress evidence found at the apartment in cataño,where he was arrested with rivera.he also argues that the jury did not represent a fair of the community,that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction,and that his sentence was unreasonable.the government responds that some of the issues rodriguez raises were waived and that the issues lack merit.
motion to suppress 
both rodriguez and rivera moved to suppress the evidence found at the cataño apartment.at the beginning of the suppression hearing,rodriguez counsel sought additional evidence,including the address of a witness who had some involvement in the circumstances of the arrest,for the purpose of obtaining a subpoena.after a sidebar conference,the district court stated on the record 
i was under the misapprehension that the subpoena that was requested by rodriguez concerned the person who had the possession or the custody or the use of the place where the defendants were arrested.it turns out that she is not the owner nor did she have that apartment under any type of rent or under her control.also during this conference,it appeared that rodriguez was there visiting and in those circumstances then he would have no standing to challenge any search that was done at that time and there fore his motion to suppress is hereby denied on the basis of standing to file the motion to suppress.
supp.hr,at.the court then ordered rivera to brief the issue of whether he had standing to move to suppress the evidence.another hearing on rivera suppression motion was held in november,and the motion was denied on december.
on appeal,rodriguez argues that he had standing to move to suppress the evidence found in the cataño apartment,despite his status as a guest in the apartment,and that the district court should have heard his motion.the government contends that rodriguez waived the standing issue by not raising it in the district court alternatively,the government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying rodriguez a hearing on his motion.
before a court may reach the merits of a motion to suppress,the defendant carries the burden of establishing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area searched or,as in this case,the items seized.united states lipscomb,cir,cert.denied,d.although the threshold requirement is referred to as standing,it is more properly considered under a fourth amendment analysis.id.at.f ailure to present evidence with respect to such an expectation prevents a defendant from making a claim for suppression under the fourth amendment.united states samboy,cir.
in the district court,rodriguez failed to address the question of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the cataño apartment or the items seized there.on appeal,rodriguez asserts,based on his status as a casual visitor for a brief period at rivera apartment,that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched.he is mistaken.see united states torres,cir.the district court properly denied his motion,due to his lack of standing,without further consideration.
motion to sever 
on may,rodriguez filed a motion to sever trial of the charges against him from rivera trial.he argued that rivera testimony at the suppression hearing in november of,about the drugs,guns,and money found in the apartment in cataño,was exculpatory evidence which he wanted to present in his defense.he further argued that rivera would testify on his behalf if the charges against them were tried separately.
the district court addressed the motion on the morning of may.rodriguez counsel explained the exculpatory nature of the testimony he expected from rivera.the court asked whether rivera would testify on rodriguez behalf,and rivera counsel said that he would testify only if the charges against him were severed from rodriguez trial and if rivera were tried first.the government objected to the motion on the ground that it was untimely,because the trial had already progressed into the second week,and argued that the totality of rivera testimony was not exculpatory.after initially deciding to sever the two indictments,the district court denied rodriguez motion as untimely.
a district court decision to deny a motion to sever is reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion.united states decologero,cir,cert.denied,d,d.a motion to sever charges or defendants must be made before trial.b d.failure to move for severance before the deadline for filing pretrial motions constitutes waiver,which may be excused only on a showing of good cause.e united states,cir united states palmer,cir.
on appeal,rodriguez argues the merits of his severance motion.the government points out that the motion was denied as untimely and that rodriguez failed to show good cause for the untimely filing.at oral argument before this court,rodriguez counsel represented that the motion to sever was timely,having been filed on the first day of trial following jury selection.in support of his position,counsel filed a letter,pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j,in which counsel stated said motion was filed on may,after jury selection but before the start of jury trial,day one,on may.
counsel representation is contrary to the record and to the statement of the case presented in rodriguez own brief jury selection was held on april.the first day of evidence was may and trial continued through may.therefore,the motion to sever,filed on may,was untimely.
in the district court,rodriguez counsel explained that the motion was filed on may because he had only received the full transcript of the suppression hearing earlier that week.counsel further stated that after reading the transcript,he realized that rivera testimony was exculpatory.the district court found,however,that because counsel attended the suppression hearing in november of and heard the testimony at that time,he did not need the transcript before filing the motion.
based on the circumstances presented here,the motion for severance was untimely,and rodriguez failed to show good cause for an untimely filing.the district court correctly denied the motion.no abuse of discretion occurred.
jury selection 
rodriguez argues,for the first time on appeal,that the requirement that jurors serving in the district of puerto rico be proficient in english violated his sixth amendment right to a jury made up of a fair cross section of the community.issues not raised before the district court are forfeited and subject to review only for plain error.see united states,cir,cert.denied,d walker,at.the plain error standard requires this court to find that there is error that is plain and that affects substantial rights.united states rodriguez,cir quoting united states epstein,cir.
we have previously considered the english proficiency requirement and held that it was justified by the overwhelming national interest served by the use of english in a united states court.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted united states,cir.rodriguez provides no basis to reconsider our previous holding in the circumstances of this case.no error occurred.
sufficiency of the evidence 
rodriguez contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of the conspiracy charged in criminal case and the weapons charges in criminal case.we review the district court denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal under the de novo standard.united states giambro,cir.in doing so,however,we view the evidence in the light most flattering to the jury guilty verdict and assess whether a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.lipscomb,at.
with respect to the conspiracy conviction,rodriguez argues that relatively little evidence was presented at trial that linked him to the conejos drug operations in ponce and that the evidence presented showed that he played only a minor role to prove that rodriguez was part of a drug conspiracy,the government was required to prove that a conspiracy existed,that rodriguez had knowledge of it,and that rodriguez participated voluntarily in it.united states,cir.a conspiratorial agreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence,at quoting united states gomez,cir.the underlying criminal activity of the conspiracy charged was a violation of a,which involves manufacturing,distributing,or dispensing drugs,or possession with the intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense drugs.
rodriguez,sigilfredo,who became a government witness,testified that he first met rodriguez during a drug transaction in or when he bought marijuana from rodriguez.testified that initially,in and,rodriguez sold him marijuana in the amount of thirty pounds every two weeks.described the conejos drug organization and identified its members,which included himself,rivera,and others.he further testified that beginning in,he had a business relationship with rodriguez,selling drugs,and a social relationship with him.at that time,rodriguez supplied cocaine,marijuana,and heroin to,although also had other suppliers.in addition,testified that rodriguez sold drugs to other members of the conejos organization.rodriguez wife testified about rodriguez contacts with rivera and that rodriguez called rivera boss.
it is not the role of the reviewing court to weigh the evidence our role is merely to ensure that some evidence exists to support sufficiently the jury determination.united states liranzo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury to find that rodriguez was part of the conejos drug trafficking conspiracy.rodriguez long relationships with and rivera,along with supplying drugs to other members of the conejos organization,support a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conejos drug organization.therefore,the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction in criminal case.
rodriguez also argues that evidence is lacking to support his conviction on count five in criminal case,that he possessed a weapon in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of c,and aided and abetted rivera in doing so,and on count seven,that he was a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g he argues that he was only a visitor at rivera apartment in cataño where the guns were found.the government contends that the evidence proved that rodriguez aided and abetted rivera in possessing guns and also that rodriguez was in constructive possession of the guns found in the apartment.
section g,charged in count five,requires that rodriguez have had knowing possession of the guns knowing possession under g can be established by proving that rodriguez had constructive possession of the guns that is,that he knowingly had the power and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a firearm,directly or through others.decologero,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in count seven,rodriguez was charged with violation of c by possessing,in furtherance of drug trafficking,and aiding and abetting rivera in possessing the two guns found at the cataño apartment when they were arrested.to convict under c,the government must prove possession of the guns and a significant nexus between the guns and the drug crime,meaning that the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense.united states roberson,cir,cert.denied,d.provides that one who aids or abets another in commission of a crime is punishable as a principal.
constructive possession is shown if rodriguez knowingly had the power and intention to exercise dominion and control over a firearm directly or through others.united states,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted.constructive possession can be joint,does not require actual ownership of the firearm,and can be established through circumstantial evidence decologero,at.
on the other hand,mere presence with or proximity to weapons or association with another who possesses a weapon are not enough to prove constructive possession.united states duval,cir,cert.denied,d,d united states mclean,cir.instead,the government must show some action,some word,or some conduct that links the individual to the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it,some power over it.mclean,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as the officers entered the cantaño apartment,they saw rodriguez walking from the area of the bedroom and saw rivera standing in the bedroom doorway,holding a gun.rivera closed and locked the bedroom door before the officers could enter.the officer in charge arranged his personnel around the closed and locked bedroom door and then kicked the door.rivera did not respond immediately,but after several kicks,rivera opened the door and was no longer holding the gun.the officers arrested rivera and then entered the bedroom where they saw rodriguez crutch on the bed and found drugs,drug paraphernalia,money,and two loaded under a pillow and the other in a box under the bed.they also found clothes and cell phones.
based on that evidence,which is taken in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict,the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that rodriguez had been in the bedroom with rivera and that rivera was holding one of the loaded guns when the officers entered the apartment.rodriguez,however,was only a temporary visitor at the apartment,where rivera was living.he did not own the apartment or its contents,including the guns.the government does not contend that any of the clothes,cell phones,or other property found in the bedroom,other than the crutch,belonged to rodriguez.the record includes no evidence that rodriguez owned or actually possessed either gun.
it is not necessary,however,for rodriguez to have owned or physically possessed the guns to satisfy the possession requirements of g and c because possession may be constructive.while the evidence shows that rodriguez was present in the bedroom with the guns and was near rivera,who was seen holding a gun,evidence is lacking to link rodriguez to the guns.in the absence of evidence that rodriguez knowingly possessed the guns found in rivera bedroom,either actually or constructively,a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm as charged in count seven of criminal case.therefore,rodriguez conviction and sentence on count seven are vacated.
with respect to count five,rodriguez was also charged with aiding and abetting rivera to violate c,possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime.a defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting in a crime if the principal committed a crime,and the defendant consciously shared the principal knowledge of the underlying criminal act,and intended to help the principal.united states,cir.again,mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient,even with knowledge that the crime is to be committed.id.instead,to be guilty as an aider and abettor in violation of c,the accomplice must both know,to a practical certainty,that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and must also facilitate that possession.united states,cir.
because rivera was convicted of violating c,which was not appealed,it is established that the principal committed the crime of possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime.the evidence at trial supports an inference that rodriguez knew rivera was engaged in criminal activity related to drug trafficking indeed,they had a relationship in the drug trafficking business.
evidence was introduced that rodriguez knew that rivera had guns at the cataño apartment,which were involved in the drug business.rodriguez was seen walking from the area of the bedroom,where rivera was looking out of the door and holding a gun.rodriguez crutch was found on the bed in the bedroom.officers found the guns hidden in the bedroom,along with drugs,money,and drug paraphernalia.the proximity of the guns and the drugs indicates a link between them.witnesses also testified that rivera was always armed.that evidence,taken in the proper light,could support a jury conclusion that rodriguez knew,to a practical certainty,that rivera had a gun or guns and would use a gun to protect and defend his drug business.united states spinney,cir finding insufficient evidence of knowledge to sustain aiding and abetting conviction under c.
the record offers no evidence,however,that rodriguez facilitated rivera in possessing or using the guns.for example,the record lacks evidence that rodriguez bought or supplied the guns,arranged for their delivery,or assisted in any other respect in making the guns available for rivera.see united states,cir discussing evidence of knowledge and facilitation sufficient to sustain conviction of aiding and abetting violation of c.
to sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting a violation of c,the evidence must be sufficient to show both that the defendant knew,to a practical certainty,that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and that the defendant facilitated that possession,at.because evidence of facilitation is lacking in this case,rodriguez conviction and sentence for violating c,count five,are also vacated due to insufficient evidence.
sentencing 
rodriguez challenges the drug quantities the district court used in determining his sentence and argues that his sentences were unreasonable.we review a sentencing court factual findings,including drug quantity calculations,for clear error.united states jones,cir,cert.denied,d.we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
at the sentencing hearing,rodriguez counsel argued that evidence was lacking to calculate an amount of drugs attributable to rodriguez and that,based on testimony at the suppression hearing,the drugs found at the cataño apartment belonged to rivera and not rodriguez.the district court ruled that for purposes of rodriguez sentencing,rivera suppression hearing testimony was irrelevant and would not be considered the court relied on the presentence report drug quantity calculations.
the court explained that based on trial testimony,rodriguez supplied him with approximately thirty pounds of marijuana on a basis,between and,for a total of kilograms.after,rodriguez supplied with heroin on many occasions,although also had other heroin suppliers.the court calculated that rodriguez supplied one kilogram per year of heroin from until january of.when converted to the marijuana equivalent,that amount totaled kilograms of marijuana.the court found that the total amount of drugs found at the cataño apartment equaled kilograms of marijuana.adding all of the amounts together,the court found that rodriguez drug activities involved kilograms of marijuana.
rodriguez contends that the drugs found at the cataño apartment are not attributable to him and argues that those drugs should not have been considered in determining his sentence.because he was convicted of drug trafficking crimes based on the drugs found at the cataño apartment,however,his argument is without merit.rodriguez does not otherwise contest the court calculations of the drug quantities,and the record supports the court quantity findings.
under the guidelines,a crime involving at least kilograms but less than kilograms of marijuana yields a base offense level of.because there were no other adjustments,the total offense level was also.based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of ii,the advisory guideline sentencing range was to months.after considering the factors set forth in a,which were addressed in the presentence report,the court decided that a sentence at the top of the range was appropriate for rodriguez.the district court noted that rodriguez had physical impairments due to his injuries from a serious accident,but found that despite his impairments,rodriguez continued to be involved in criminal activity.
the district court followed the sentencing protocol that we have prescribed.see united states smith,cir.if the court has calculated the gsr correctly and has supplied a plausible explanation for the sentence imposed,we generally defer to the district court judgment.id.that is the case here.
rivera appeal 
based on the presentence report calculations and evidence heard at the sentencing hearing,the district court found that rivera drug offenses involved more than kilograms of heroin,which converted to kilograms of marijuana.as a result,the applicable base offense level was determined to be.a enhancement was added because of rivera leadership role in the offenses,resulting in a total offense level of.the court also found a criminal history category of vi.
rivera was sentenced to life in prison on count one of criminal case.in criminal case,rivera was sentenced to life in prison on counts one and three and to terms of years on count two,months on count four,and months on count six,all such terms to run concurrently.in addition,he was sentenced to a term of months for his conviction on count five in criminal case,which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in criminal case.rivera argues that his sentences were not reasonable,that the drug quantity determination was erroneous,and that the court erred in imposing a adjustment based on his role in the drug operations.we begin by considering rivera claims of procedural irregularity before addressing the reasonableness of his sentence.
drug quantity 
at the sentencing hearing,the district court explained that a government witness,testified at trial that he supplied rivera,for his drug point in ponce,with two or three eighths of a kilogram of heroin weekly for the time after rivera left prison in september of until went to jail in january of.the district court determined that period included months or weeks.taking the lesser amount,two eighths of a kilogram of heroin per week,the district court calculated that rivera drug transactions as part of the conejos conspiracy involved kilograms of heroin.the court added the kilograms of heroin found in the cataño apartment,which brought the total over kilograms of heroin.based on sentencing guideline a,which refers to the drug quantity table at subsection c,kilograms or more of heroin results in a base offense level of.
rivera argued at the sentencing hearing and argues on appeal that did not supply heroin to him as regularly as the court found because rivera had other suppliers.as the district court stated at the sentencing hearing,testimony established that rivera was buying two to three eighths of a kilogram of heroin every week during the period between the end of september of to january of,although his suppliers were not always the same.therefore,rivera argument that,himself,did not always supply heroin to rivera does not change the drug quantity calculation.
the district court factual findings as to drug quantity are reviewed for clear error,at.the district court did not add drug quantities pertaining to the time rivera was in prison,as rivera mistakenly asserts.instead,the court explicitly considered only the period of the conspiracy from the end of september of until january of.further,the drug quantity was calculated using the lesser amount indicated by the testimony and without considering the other drugs rivera sold or possessed.the district court drug quantity calculation was conservative and by the evidence at trial.therefore the drug quantity finding is not clearly erroneous.
leadership role 
under sentencing guidelines a,a defendant base offense level is raised by four levels if he was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.the guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.united states ziskind,cir,cert.denied,d.we review a district court decision to impose an enhancement for clear error.id.
rivera argues that he was not the main organizer or leader of the conejos conspiracy,particularly because he was in prison from to.instead,he contends,his brother,richard,was in charge of their drug points.rivera also contends that he did not have five or more subordinates whom he directed or supervised.
in determining a defendant role in the criminal activity,the court considers,among other things,
the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.
cmt.see also united states yelaun,cir.witnesses testified that rivera and his brother,piolo,owned and operated a drug point selling cocaine and heroin in the conejos organization after rivera was released from prison in as the district court found,testimony at trial established that mor
