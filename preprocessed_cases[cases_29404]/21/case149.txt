this appeal calls for us to consider the district judge determination that appellant anthony soto rivera soto rivera should be sentenced as a career offender because he committed a crime of violence as defined by the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines.the issue before us is narrow,and so is our ruling.taking this case just as it has been presented to us meaning we hold the parties to their concessions and decline to speculate on the possible merit of other arguments that might have been but were made we conclude that soto rivera particular crime of conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence under the guidelines.accordingly,soto rivera may not be sentenced as a career offender.
background 
the facts,generally speaking,are neither complicated nor disputed.we recite only those necessary to decide the issues presented by the parties.
for reasons not germane to the legal issues here,soto rivera found himself under arrest,and the arresting officers found a handgun and ammunition in his possession.this was a problem for him,as it turns out that soto rivera had a previous felony conviction on his record.
soto rivera soon faced a indictment in the puerto rico district court.count one charged him with illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition in violation of g and a,statutes which make it illegal for convicted felons to have guns or ammo.count two gave more detail about soto rivera firearm,describing it as a machinegun,that is a glock model,caliber modified to shoot automatically more than one shot,without manual reloading,by a single function of the trigger,which violated o and a general prohibition against possessing machineguns 
although he entered an initial plea of not guilty,rather than stand trial soto rivera entered into a plea agreement with the government.pursuant to their agreement,soto rivera agreed to plead guilty to count one charge of illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition,with count two falling by the wayside.
the plea agreement addressed the length of the prison sentence soto rivera could expect to receive,something that is heavily influenced by various provisions in the sentencing guidelines.the guidelines are a system under which a set of inputs specific to a given case the particular characteristics of the offense and offender yield s a predetermined output a range of months within which the defendant could be sentenced.peugh united states,d.we commend those readers interested in a general overview of how the guidelines work to the succinct and informative rundown in united states serrano mercado,cir.
for our purposes today,it is enough to know that the guidelines take into account any past crimes a defendant has been convicted of,with the idea being that t he more severe the criminal history,the lengthier the sentence.serrano mercado,at.a defendant who is over at the time he commits a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,and who has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,is a career offender.a.a career offender is considered to have the most severe criminal history provided by the guidelines.id.b.the practical effect is that a career offender generally receives a longer sentence for a particular crime which,remember,must be either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense than a offender would get for that same crime.
so,to figure out whether a particular defendant is a career offender,it necessary to know first whether that defendant is being sentenced following a conviction for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.if he is,the next question to answer is whether that defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.id.a.towards that end,a defendant and the government might stipulate in a plea agreement as to which and how many crimes a defendant has committed in the past.
but the plea agreement here which seems to assume that felon in possession is a crime of violence is silent in that regard.instead,soto rivera and the government calculated potential sentence lengths both with and without considering him to be a career offender.the plea agreement indicates that soto rivera faced months in prison if he was found to be a career offender,and some shorter amount of time if he turned out not to be one 
further,soto rivera conceded in the plea agreement that the government would have proven at trial that he had been caught with a firearm modified to fire automatically,that is,as a machine gun.he also admitted that he knew about the glock modifications,and that he already had a prior felony conviction on his record when he was caught with the gun.a district judge,after questioning soto rivera at a change of plea hearing,accepted his guilty plea after finding it to be knowing and voluntary,as well as supported by an independent basis in fact 
when it came time for sentencing,soto rivera did not object to being classified as a career offender.indeed,working off the month career offender range the parties calculated in the plea agreement,his own attorney asked for a month sentence.the government went the other way and asked for a sentence of months.
the sentencing judge stated without objection that two of soto rivera past convictions were for the manufacture,delivery or possession with intent to distribute or to deliver controlled substances,and conspiracy to do that.in the judge view,these two crimes were controlled substance offenses counting towards career offender status.the judge then stated in conclusory fashion that soto rivera latest conviction for felon in possession of a firearm is considered a crime of violence.taking into account soto rivera two prior controlled substance convictions,the judge announced he is considered a career offender.
further,though the parties had come up with a career offender range of to months,the sentencing judge calculation differed.he pegged the guidelines range as between and months 
taking into account the circumstances of the crime and soto rivera criminal history,the sentencing judge found that the parties recommended guidelines range months does not reflect the seriousness of the offense,does not promote respect for the law,does not protect the public from further crimes by soto rivera and does not address the issues of deterrence and punishment.instead,the sentencing judge concluded that the middle of the month range he had calculated would be appropriate,and sentenced soto rivera to months behind bars.
this timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
soto rivera did not object to the district court treating him as a career offender before,at,or following sentencing.yet this is exactly the issue he raises on appeal,as he says that he should have been sentenced as a career offender.
usually,soto rivera failure to object in the district court would lead us to find the issue forfeited and we would review for plain error only.but the government has declined to make a forfeiture argument.in fact,at oral argument it explicitly called for us to apply de novo review.
so,in accordance with our precedent and the government own request,we will review the issue as if it had been properly preserved.see united states tapia escalera,cir declining to apply plain error review to a forfeited argument where the government failed to request plain error review see also united states paulino guzman,cir reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the appellant sentence for abuse of discretion,despite the appellant forfeiture of any objection at the district court,because the government did not seek plain error review on appeal.
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo united states tavares,cir quoting united states cortés cabán,cir.sotorivera specific challenge is to the sentencing judge determination that he is a career offender because the crime to which he pleaded guilty felon in possession of a firearm is a crime of violence within the meaning of the guidelines.figuring out whether the guidelines define a particular offense as a crime of violence poses a purely legal question,so we review that particular issue de novo,too.united states velázquez,cir.
this appeal is all about soto rivera sentence,not his conviction.we must determine whether being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g is a crime of violence under the career offender provisions in the guidelines soto rivera says that,thanks to an opinion handed down by the supreme court while his appeal was pending,johnson united states,d,his admitted possession of a generic firearm does not constitute a crime of violence under the guidelines the government,not surprisingly,disagrees and offers us a path to affirming the sentence.
but before we can get into the specifics of the parties arguments,we need to give some details about how the guidelines define a crime of violence.and we must look at exactly what soto rivera pleaded guilty to.after doing this we will be able to unpack and consider soto rivera arguments.
according to the guidelines,
t he term crime of violence means any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
a emphasis added.the emphasized language,which has come to be known as the residual clause,is the key to this appeal.
now,soto rivera pled guilty to possession of a firearm in violation of g.this statute states that it is unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of,a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,to possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition g.if this crime is not a crime of violence,it would follow that soto rivera may not be sentenced as a career offender.
initial arguments 
in his opening brief,soto rivera argues that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not an offense that contains an element requiring the use,attempted use,or threat of the use of physical force against another.and,seemingly conceding that a conviction for the possession of a machinegun would qualify as a crime of violence,soto rivera says that though a determination was made finding the gun to be a machine gun,the crime of which he was actually convicted illegal possession of a firearm is not an offense involving a hazardous weapon.accordingly,he argues that mere possession of a generic firearm does not qualify as a crime of violence under the residual clause because simply possessing a firearm does not pose a serious potential risk of injury to anyone.
in rejoinder,the government says that soto rivera crime,although it does contain the use,attempted use,or threatened use of force as an element,nevertheless involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another given that soto rivera firearm was a machinegun.the government,therefore,urges us to find that soto rivera offense of conviction falls within the residual clause rather expansive definition of a crime of violence.
post johnson briefing 
after the parties briefs came in,the supreme court decided johnson united states,d.johnson involved a challenge to the federal armed career criminal act acca,which,like the guidelines,provides for lengthier sentences for certain defendants based on their criminal histories.in this regard,the acca contains a residual clause that is almost identical to the one found in the guidelines.see id.at recognizing the acca residual clause includes any felony that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another quoting e b.the johnson court ultimately held that the acca residual clause is void for vagueness and that i ncreasing a defendant sentence under the clause denies due process of law.id.at 
we afforded the parties an opportunity to submit supplemental briefs addressing johnson effect,if any,on this appeal.soto rivera argued that johnson reasoning applies equally to the guidelines,rendering the guidelines residual clause unconstitutionally vague and invalid as well.and since he was found to be a career offender by virtue of that residual clause,soto rivera tells us his sentence can not stand.
in its supplemental brief,the government said it acknowledge d that the guidelines residual clause is unconstitutionally vague based on johnson,and so it no longer holds the position that soto rivera sentence should be affirmed based on the residual clause.thus,for purposes of this appeal,the government concedes that it violates due process to utilize the guidelines residual clause to classify a defendant as a career offender and thereby impose a longer sentence.
nevertheless,the government says we may affirm soto rivera sentence even without the residual clause.we can do this,it says,because the residual clause is not the only route leading to sentencing soto rivera as a career offender.according to the government,we may rely on commentary explaining and further expanding upon definition of crime of violence.
specifically,application note to states that c rime of violence does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon,unless the possession was of a firearm described in a,application note.the referenced statute,a,provides various definitions of the term firearm,and it explicitly includes machinegun s within the word meaning.a.because soto rivera admits that he possessed a machinegun,and because a clearly refers to machineguns,application note,therefore,provides a basis completely independent of the residual clause for applying the career offender enhancement.or so the government argument goes.
discussion 
first things first.based on the government concession that johnson reasoning applies just as well to the guidelines as to the acca the correctness of which we do not consider we find that soto rivera career offender status may not be predicated upon the guidelines residual clause in other words,we may not rely on the residual clause to find that felon in possession of a firearm is a crime of violence.
with the residual clause out of the picture,the government is wholly reliant upon guidelines commentary the application note to to support its position.the government directs our attention to the supreme court teaching that commentary interpret ing or explain ing a g uideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that g uideline.stinson united states,d.the implication is that because application note includes possession of a machinegun as a crime of violence,and since soto rivera admitted that his modified glock was a machinegun,application note compels the conclusion that soto rivera pled guilty to a crime of violence.
but the government fails to analyze whether application note has become inconsistent with its corresponding guideline if johnson dictates that we excise the residual clause this is a significant oversight because as soto rivera points out g uideline commentary is not always to be taken as gospel.united states meléndez rivera,cir.w here commentary is inconsistent with guidelines text,text controls.united states shell,cir citing stinson,at.see also stinson,at explaining that if commentary and the guideline it interprets are inconsistent in that following one will result in violating the dictates of the other,the sentencing reform act itself commands compliance with the guideline rather than the commentary citing a,b.
the government argument requires us to look back at the applicable guideline,a,and consider whether or not application note is consistent with a text in the absence of the residual clause.excising the clause from a leaves us with a definition of crime of violence that looks like this 
the term crime of violence means any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person o
