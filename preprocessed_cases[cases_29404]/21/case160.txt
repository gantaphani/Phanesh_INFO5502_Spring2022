the criminal prosecution giving rise to this appeal stems from a mortgage rescue program organized and operated by michael prieto.in brief,prieto organization garnered large sums of money,while homeowners,sham buyers,and lenders to whom prieto and his operatives made a series of false representations ended up with substantial losses and liabilities.the united states viewed the whole arrangement as fraudulent.a jury agreed,convicting prieto of mail fraud under.prieto now appeals both his conviction and the portion of his sentence that fixes the amount of restitution that the district court ordered he pay to his victims.seeing no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
we begin by summarizing the evidence that sets the stage for evaluating prieto challenges to the sufficiency of the government proof in support of the offense for which prieto was charged and convicted.in so doing,we take the evidence in a light favorable to the jury verdict.united states burgos montes,cir,cert.denied,d mem.sufficiency challenge united states wihbey,cir variance challenge.
prieto advertised the organization that he formed in and ran until under various names as a mortgage rescue program designed to assist homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments.prieto and his associates began by identifying distressed homeowners facing foreclosure and then solicited the participation of those homeowners through targeted advertising.the pitch to these homeowners was that prieto organization would tap a pool of investors to get rid of this bad debt and let participants stay in their homes.individuals who signed up with prieto agreed to transfer their homes to the organization.in return,the organization promised to satisfy each homeowner delinquent mortgage obligation and to charge the homeowner a monthly rent that would be less than the homeowner previous monthly mortgage payment.homeowners were also promised the opportunity to repurchase their properties after two years of timely payments.
the organization then arranged sham transfers to straw purchasers who received lump sum payments from prieto group for their services.falsely claiming,among other things,an intention to use the homes as primary residences,the straw purchasers then applied for residential mortgages,which were always larger than the original homeowner mortgage and often equal to the total value of the underlying residence.the straws then executed quitclaim deeds,conveying the properties over to the organization.
the organization applied the funds from the new mortgages to the remaining balance on each original homeowner mortgage.once that first mortgage was satisfied,prieto organization extracted the remaining funds in the second mortgage through one of two methods.one method,used from march to april,was to have a corporation controlled by the organization file a false mortgage lien against the property before the transfer to the straw purchaser.the straw purchaser could then use the funds from the second mortgage to pay off the sham lien at closing.after being fined by a state regulator for this practice,the organization abandoned this method and began simply instructing straw purchasers to directly transfer the excess mortgage funds to one of the organization corporations.
prieto was ultimately involved in transactions with a total of mortgage lenders.while some of the homeowners managed to stay in their homes for a time at the reduced rent payments,prieto organization failed to stay current on the mortgage obligations.foreclosure proceedings were instituted against nearly all of the organization properties.the straw had been promised that their responsibility ended at the sham found themselves on the hook for the unpaid mortgage obligations.authorities ultimately arrested prieto and five of his associates.the other members of the scheme entered guilty pleas pursuant to plea agreements and cooperated with the government investigation and prosecution.
the ensuing indictment detailed all stages of the foregoing scheme,and expressly included all stages as parts of how the scheme worked.it described deceit of homeowners,straws,and lenders,with loans collectively exceeding foreclosure proceeds by over million.it packaged all averments under a single mail fraud count.in short,the indictment previewed the evidentiary proof of a single scheme that worked by deceiving and defrauding homeowners,straws,and lenders,all of whom were collectively left holding the bag for the sums prieto extracted from the equity and the lenders 
ii.analysis 
a.the indictment 
prieto rests the bulk of his argument on a claim that the indictment improperly characterized a series of distinct criminal activities as a single,overarching scheme.such an argument implicate s both the doctrine of duplicity the joining of two or more distinct offenses in a single count of an indictment,and the doctrine of variance the presentation at trial of evidence that varies materially from the crime charged in the indictment.united states trainor,sides of this coin.
we review preserved duplicity challenges to an indictment de novo.united states,cir,cert.granted,judgment vacated on other grounds,d mem.an indictment is improper if it joins,in a single count,two or more distinct offenses.united states canas,cir.the bar against such indictments is embodied in federal rule of criminal procedure a,providing that separate offenses be charged in separate counts of an indictment.this rule is born out of two concerns.one concern is that a criminal defendant facing such an indictment might not know which charge to prepare to defend against.united states huguenin,cir per curiam.a second concern is that a jury could find a defendant guilty without actually reaching unanimity united states valerio,cir.these concerns find no in this case.
first,the indictment created no risk that prieto did not know which of several charges he needed to defend.the indictment made clear that the government undertook the burden of proving a single,overarching scheme.while the indictment naturally and informatively described the parts of the scheme,including lying to homeowners,straws,and lenders,it did so under the rubric of showing how the scheme worked.moreover,the very object of the cash paid out by the not have been achieved but for the predicate steps of deceiving the homeowners and the straws who could lose homes or assume liabilities as a byproduct of prieto setting up the surprisingly gullible lenders.from the outset,this was,in baseball parlance,a scheme to score a run,not a scheme to hit a double that coincidentally led later to several unanticipated stolen bases.
second,there was no risk that the jury would find prieto guilty without deciding unanimously that he was guilty of the overarching scheme.the government undertook the burden of proving such a single scheme rather than proving only one or several parts.importantly,the district court also instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the single or unified scheme substantially as charged in the indictment.see united states swantz,app x,cir unpublished jury instructions are a simple cure for duplicity.
schemes to defraud are often,by their nature,complex.the accomplishment of a scheme fraudulent goal and the simultaneous evasion of detection by its victims or the authorities often necessitate patterns of criminal activity that may harm different groups of victims at different times.see united states buchmeier,cir a n indictment charging multiple acts in the same count,each of which could be charged as a separate offense,may not be duplicitous where these acts comprise a continuing course of conduct that constitutes a single offense.having put together such a scheme,prieto can hardly protest that the government was willing to charge and bear the burden of proving such a scheme.
next,prieto argues that even if the government properly alleged a single scheme,its proof at trial unfairly varied from what was alleged and that this variance prejudiced his ability to defend himself.see united states seng tan,cir.this argument draws from the same well as the duplicity claim,asking us to reverse the conviction because the government began the case alleging one set of facts but the evidence adduced at trial proved different facts than those alleged in the indictment.united states yelaun,cir.to make out a successful variance challenge,prieto is obligated to demonstrate both a factual variance between the indictment and the trial and prejudice to his substantial rights as a result of that variance.id.a variance may prejudice the substantial rights of a defendant by,for example,depriving a defendant of notice of the charges,subjecting him to prosecution twice for the same offense,or exposing him to the threat that evidence incriminating other defendants might be used against him by a jury.see wihbey,at.because prieto raised the issue in his motion for judgment of acquittal,we review it de novo.id.
prieto argues,first,that the government theory of harm at trial shifted away from one set of injured parties homeowners and toward other victims discussed in the indictment lenders.prieto also argues that the indictment reference to dozens of distressed homeowners is in tension with the government decision to call only one homeowner who had participated in the scheme out of the the government noticed as potential witnesses.more generally,prieto contends that while the indictment charged him with responsibility for a single unitary scheme,at trial he was forced to defend against multiple schemes that had been shoehorned in together.as for prejudice,prieto gestures broadly at the difficulty of defending against multiple schemes at trial and the risk of juror confusion.
prieto can show neither variance nor prejudice.the government,at most,some parts of the indictment and others,or reduced its fire when it came to proving some of the indictment allegations.the single overarching scheme conveyed in the indictment,however,lines up quite closely with the single overarching scheme proved at trial.indeed,the detailed indictment serves as a fairly good roadmap of the government case,delineating the various steps that needed to be taken for prieto overall scheme to achieve its goal.that other parties were collaterally injured on the way to the completion of the scheme does not increase the government burden of proof.it was not obligated to demonstrate harm to every individual injured by prieto scheme.united states doherty,cir even assuming that the case the government ultimately brought at trial was a simpler,version of the general scheme,this variance would not entitle the defendant to a new trial.whatever departures the government made from its indictment in its case at trial did not affect prieto substantial rights.wihbey,at.
sufficiency of the evidence 
prieto argues that the evidence offered against him is insufficient to support his conviction,and specifically that the government case came up short on two key elements materiality and intent.
materiality 
prieto argues that he should be acquitted because the government failed to offer sufficient evidence proving his misrepresentations were material to the lenders.because he made this argument at the close of the trial under federal rule of criminal procedure,we review his arguments de novo,affirming unless we find that no rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states guerra garcia,cir.
in a prosecution for mail fraud,the government must prove that the false or fraudulent representation at the heart of a scheme to defraud is material,neder united states,d,though it need not prove that the decisionmaker actually relied on the falsehood or that the falsehood led to actual damages.united states appolon,cir.proving materiality requires the government to show that the false statements relied on had a natural tendency to influence,or are capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which they were addressed.id.quoting neder,at.
in appolon,we ruled that in a prosecution stemming from a mortgage fraud scheme,the government need not produce evidence at trial showing that the specific lending officers at the harmed banks actually relied on the defendant misrepresentations.id.at.in that case,the government evidence that the victim lender had explicitly sought information from the fraudulent applicant and had received false information in return satisfied the government burden on that element.id.at.we ruled that t he fact that the lender loan application explicitly sought certain information from the applicant indicates that the defendant responses were capable of influencing its decision.id.this evidence was helpfully accompanied by testimony from an officer of a different mortgage lender about the range of criteria relevant to that lender loan processing procedures.id.at.
at prieto trial,the government introduced copies of loan application materials containing numerous misrepresentations that prieto organization had submitted to lenders.in response to direct questions on these forms,the straw purchasers falsely claimed that they intended to use the homes in question as primary residences and extent of their personal income and assets.the government also elicited testimony from john duris,a mortgage broker with a decade of experience in the industry and a cooperating witness who had submitted numerous loan applications on prieto behalf a lay witness,duris testified that based on his professional experience,whether a loan application stated that a property was being used as an investment as was arguably true here or as a primary residence as the applications falsely stated could often determine whether a loan would issue because lenders considered properties intended to be used as primary residences far less risky.prieto argues that because duris did not have insight into the particular underwriting practices of the victim institutions during the relevant time period,his testimony did not speak to the materiality of prieto misrepresentations.but this overinflates the government burden it need only show that the statements had a natural tendency to influence the lenders decisions,not that the specific lenders actually relied on the statements prieto caused to be submitted.appolon,at quoting neder,at.testimony about risks in making loans was relevant to the former even if not the latter.
as in appolon,these two sources of documents showing that the lenders required the applicants to supply the requested information and the testimony about why the answers to these standard questions could be relevant to any more than enough foundation for the jury to decide that materiality was satisfied.united states vernon,app x,cir unpublished per curiam,cert.denied,d mem.mere introduction of and testimony to submitted loan applications with false income,liability,and primary residence declarations at trial sufficient to prove materiality.even in the face of anecdotal evidence that,at the time,residential mortgage lenders were devoting scant resources to the verification of applicants income levels,it is nevertheless fair to presume that a loan applicant stated income level and plans for using the property in question would have a natural tendency to influence a lender decision.id.at.why else,after all,did the lender demand the information and prieto take the risk of providing false information 
in a mail fraud prosecution,the government need prove the defendant knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud.united states hebshie,cir quoting united states cheal,cir.prieto claims that the trial produced insufficient evidence that he possessed such an intent.specifically,he argues that the government produced no evidence that would have allowed a jury to find that he intended to defraud the lenders.
prieto did not raise this specific argument in his oral rule motion.in that motion,he raised several specific objections and,glancingly,a general objection to the evidence sufficiency.as we have previously observed 
we have not decided what happens when a general sufficiency objection is accompanied by specific objections,but we have suggested,albeit in dictum,that such a practice preserves all possible objections because i t is helpfu
