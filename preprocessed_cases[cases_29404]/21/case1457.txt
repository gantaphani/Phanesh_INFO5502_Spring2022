background 
on january,gamez,a honduran citizen,pleaded guilty to unlawful reentry to the united states after deportation in violation of a.gamez had been removed from the united states in august because in june he had pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in violation of penal law which constituted an aggravated felony,a removable offense under the immigration and nationality act.according to the presentence report psr,prepared by the probation office in connection with gamez illegal reentry conviction,which incorporated facts from the state presentence report prepared in connection with gamez guilty plea to the state offense,gamez was arrested in after shooting one person in the face and one in the stomach.when he was arrested,gamez was carrying a loaded caliber firearm,which contained four live rounds of ammunition.he pleaded guilty to a violation of penal law and was sentenced to months imprisonment.in august,gamez was transferred into the custody of the immigration and customs enforcement and removed to honduras.gamez later returned to the united states and was charged with unlawfully reentering the united states,to which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.
according to the psr prepared for the unlawful reentry conviction at issue,under a,gamez base offense level was eight.concluding that gamez prior criminal possession of a weapon conviction was for a crime of violence,the psr recommended a increase pursuant to b a ii.it also recommended a decrease for acceptance of responsibility based on gamez plea of guilty to the unlawful reentry charge.the resulting total offense level was.the parties voiced no objections to the facts contained in the psr,and the court determined it was undisputed that gamez total offense level was while the psr indicated that gamez criminal history was seven points,placing him in criminal history category iv,the district court determined that the psr was ambiguous about whether gamez illegal reentry crime was committed less than two years after he was released from imprisonment on his conviction and computed gamez criminal history at six points,thus placing him in criminal history category iii.with a total offense level of and criminal history category iii,gamez guidelines range was to months imprisonment.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court adopted the facts from the psr and concluded,after considering the guidelines range and the factors under a,that a sentence was appropriate.the district court found it significant that the defendant returned to the united states to work,rather than to obtain money through criminal activity,and the court credited gamez statement that he would not return illegally to the united states in the future.it imposed a sentence of imprisonment,sixteen months below the low end of the applicable guidelines range.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the guidelines regarding whether a particular crime is a crime of violence.see united states rubenstein,cir.
gamez argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred when it determined that his new york conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree was a crime of violence under the guidelines,thus subjecting him to a increase of his base offense level.it is undisputed that gamez did not raise this issue at sentencing,nor did he object to the court calculation of the total offense level.we therefore review the district court decision for plain error.see.b united states olano,d.under the plain error standard,t here must be an error that is plain and that affect s substantial rights.id.moreover,courts of appeals should only exercise their discretion to correct the forfeited error pursuant to.b when the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.citing united states young,d internal quotation marks omitted.this court has stated that the plain error doctrine should not be applied stringently in the sentencing context,where the cost of correcting an unpreserved error is not as great as in the trial context.see united states williams,cir 
whether there was an error 
deviation from a legal rule is error unless the rule has been waived.olano,at.the guidelines provide a base offense level of eight for unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states.see a.the specific offense characteristic provides that an increase by sixteen levels applies i f the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after a a conviction for a felony that is ii a crime of violence.b a ii.the commentary for b of the guidelines provides the following definition for crime of violence 
crime of violence means any of the following murder,manslaughter,kidnaping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,burglary of a dwelling,or any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
cmt.b iii emphasis added.because criminal possession of a weapon is not an enumerated offense,to constitute a crime of violence under this definition,it must have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.see id.
at the time of gamez guilty plea in,penal law provided 
a person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree when,with intent to use the same unlawfully against another he possesses a or he possesses a loaded firearm or he possesses a disguised gun.criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree is a class c felony.
therefore,to establish criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,the prosecution must demonstrate,beyond a reasonable doubt,that a person possessed one of the described weapons and had intent to use such weapon unlawfully against another.see penal law mckinney.as the new york court of appeals has instructed the essence of the illegal conduct defined in sections of the penal law is the act of possessing a weapon unlawfully once the unlawful possession of the weapon is established,the possessory crime is complete and any unlawful use of the weapon is punishable as a separate crime.people almodovar,internal citations omitted.
because unlawful possession of a firearm under penal law does not include as an element any unlawful use,attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person,gamez is correct that intent to use a gun unlawfully against another,an element of the offense for which he was convicted,can not be equated with the actual,attempted or threatened use of physical force,which all involve some affirmative conduct beyond the mere possession of a gun.see id.that gamez actually used the firearm he possessed to shoot two persons is irrelevant because th
