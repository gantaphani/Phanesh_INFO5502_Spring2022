this case concerns the proper evaluation of defense counsel performance under strickland washington,d.we hold that trial counsel inability to recall why he abandoned a possible defense queried seven years and seven hundred cases after petitioner not establish a sixth amendment violation where a justification appears on the record.
ronald wells is an inmate in the green haven correctional facility,incarcerated following his conviction in new york supreme court kings county for second degree murder,see penal law,and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,see penal law,for the shooting of ruben figueroa.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york bloom,magistrate judge granted wells petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his appointed counsel abandoned at trial a theory that someone the crime.a detailed description of the events surrounding wells arrest and trial assists in reconstructing the perspective of trial counsel.
in the early evening of january,two teenagers sat down on lobby steps in an apartment building at east new york avenue in brooklyn.the teens talked and smoked cigarettes while three men drank beer and smoked marijuana in the hallway.one of the teens,ruben figueroa,lived in the building,and the other,slightly older teen,josé morales,had been friends with him for three years.another friend,danny roman,stopped by to talk for several minutes before continuing on to his apartment to wait for his girlfriend.
ten minutes later,as figueroa and morales remained on the steps,two men entered the lobby.the men approached,and one asked figueroa,w hat are you doing here what i told you the responded,i just chilling.the man then pulled out a gun and shot figueroa in the chest.morales tried to help figueroa escape down the hallway,but one of the men shot figueroa again,this time in the leg figueroa told morales he could no longer move.the two men fled.paramedics arrived shortly thereafter but were unable to save figueroa.they pronounced him dead at pm.
detective nicholas tropiano investigated the homicide.tropiano interviewed morales,who was unharmed.morales described the initial shooter as a black male,about years old,weighing about or pounds,and approximately five feet,nine inches tall.on january and again on february,tropiano showed morales hundreds of photographs,and morales could not identify the shooter from any of them.wells photograph was not included.
on february,an anonymous caller left the police a tip that ronald wells,a black male in his twenties,was the shooter.the following day,tropiano prepared a array including a january photograph of wells,and,later that evening,morales viewed the photos,immediately identifying wells as the man that shot my friend.on february,morales picked ronald wells out of a six person lineup and again identified him as the shooter.tropiano placed wells under arrest and took wells pedigree reported he was,weighed pounds,and stood five feet,seven inches tall.
just three days later,on february,wells was assigned calvin simons as counsel.simons had seven years of trial experience with the legal aid society and a year in private practice in total,he had tried approximately sixty cases.in the month following simons assignment,simons hired a private investigator,david walker,to aid in wells defense.
simons developed an alibi defense for wells.wells sister stated that wells and his common law wife were with her from approximately pm on january until the following morning.wells wife recollection was similar,although her recall of the timing differed.his wife related that she and wells left their apartment around pm,arrived via subway at his sister just after pm,and remained there until the next morning.in the course of the investigation,walker informed simons that wells knew of another potential alibi witness,a police officer with whom wells had spoken at a train station the night of the homicide.unfortunately,the officer,walker explained,could not be located.
simons also received information regarding wells and others motives to kill figueroa.with regard to wells,walker reported a rumor that wells did the shooting in retaliation for the beating of one of his friends at a nearby building.however,there were also indications that someone else may have been motivated to kill figueroa,the first indication coming to simons in a redacted police report dated february.the report detailed a incident that occurred just a few days prior to the homicide and involved a conflict between figueroa brother josé and a person named richie.figueroa,purportedly,was present at the incident.the redacted report read 
on january,at approximately,i interviewed redacted in reference to this incident.she made the following statement.she is the sister of richie and danny.she said,that richie did have a problem with jose,ruben brother.several months ago,richie and jose got into a fight at blimpie.jose slashed richie with a razor and scarred him over his right eye.about two days ago,richie saw jose in front of the building.richie and jose got into a fight again.richie came inside.about twenty minutes later,jose,ruben and pito came to the apartment door looking for richie.jose said,that he was going to kill richie.she opened the door and argued with them for a few minutes.she said,that jose had a gun.richie then came to the door and told her to close the door,he did want to be bother with them.she then close the door.
she and her family were all inside the apartment when richie was looking out the window and a shot was fired at the window.richie said,that jose had fired the shot.her father made a police report.she said,that richie is presently in fort greene with their older brother,redacted.she said,that her father had taken richie over there this morning,because he was afraid for him.
simons received a memorandum from walker in may confirming pieces of the february report and indicating that the east new york avenue tenant most likely to be richie had disappeared.the memorandum explained that two residents of the apartment building had identified a male hispanic living at as having had disagreements with figueroa.it also noted that one resident identified a male hispanic living on the first floor of the building as the person involved in the window shooting incident.this individual had disappeared.walker report offered simons the opinion that i n view of the relationship the deceased had with the male hispanic on the first floor,there is a strong possibility that he was the shooter.the fact that this individual has disappeared,gives support to this probability.walker memorandum ended with his conclusion that those persons residing at the location of east new york avenue,who have been interviewed to date,are either afraid to divulge any information or are not willing to give up the shooter,for whatever reason.
simons received more information regarding richie when he received a clean version of the february police report before trial.this unredacted version of the report indicated that the name of the woman interviewed was valerie roman and that the name of the older brother with whom richie was staying at that time was alberto roman.the clean report therefore indicated that the richie and danny referenced within the report were likely valerie roman and danny roman.
using this information,simons requested that walker continue his investigation.simons specific request targeted roman family members.in a letter to walker dated november,simons noted that,according to a contemporaneous police report,there were shots fired through a window on january,intended for richie roman.simons requested that walker investigate both the january homicide and the alleged january incident.he listed names of potential witnesses and their addresses.his list included valerie roman,richie roman,alberto roman,danny roman,and alberto roman.
a week later,a possible connection between the incident and ronald wells emerged.on december,simons attended a conference in the kings county supreme court before the honorable michael gary.while discussing sandoval issues the assistant district attorney warned that if wells testified she would connect wells to a gang operating out of east new york avenue,establish that wells carried a firearm and had intimidated people at east new york avenue,and,significantly,connect wells with alberto roman,and establish that both were members of the east new york avenue gang.the assistant district attorney explained that alberto roman,was friendly with the defendant and that the roman family had a dispute with figueroa older brother and friend just before this homicide the dispute,presumably,being connected to the incident.the assistant district attorney noted the importance of using the gang associations and this connection between the romans and wells to establish a motive.she wanted to develop a record concerning a rivalry between these two gangs and to show that the deceased brother and friends were at odds with the roman family and that alberto roman is friends with the defendant and one of the gangs.
defense counsel objected,stating that f or the people to bring this out as a possible motive would not really be fair to wells and would not be the proper procedure in conducting the trial.judge gary agreed in part.he ruled that,without more proof,he would preclude all questioning regarding the gangs.however,the court would permit the prosecution to ask the defendant,if he testified,about the dispute between the romans and figueroa,as well as the defendant friendship with alberto roman.specifically,the court granted the assistant district attorney request to ask the defendant,without mentioning gangs,about his friendship with alberto roman and the fact he knew there was an ongoing dispute between the roman family and,presumably,figueroa brother.judge gary stated that the prosecution could pursue this line of inquiry d epending upon what testimony comes out at the trial,what the defendant opens the door to.
after the conference and in response to his previous request for additional investigative particular,for further investigation into the roman received a report from walker dated december,walker had been unable to interview the romans.he reported approaching the roman apartment at east new york avenue as well as the separate apartment of alberto roman,and failing to get a response at either home.walker again concluded,it is my opinion that if anyone has information,they are either afraid or unwilling to impart it at this time.
morales was the prosecution key witness at trial.simons extensively morales,bringing out morales history of criminal activity and drug use and pointing out various seeming inconsistencies in morales testimony.in particular,simons highlighted the apparent discrepancy between morales explanation to a grand jury that the three men drinking and smoking in the hallway ran outside before the shooting and his trial testimony that the men did not leave until after the shooter drew a weapon,reminding the jury,we do have these three people.simons also contrasted morales report to police that the second man fired the second shot and his trial testimony that he actually did not know who fired that shot.simons focused on other problems with morales story as well.simons highlighted the difficulties reconciling morales claim that he dragged figueroa down the hallway with the absence of any blood in that area and the discovery of shell casings and bullet fragments only where figueroa body was found rather than where he was shot.he also emphasized the discrepancy between morales grand jury testimony and trial testimony regarding whether he ran upstairs to notify figueroa stepfather about the shooting or whether he took the elevator up to notify figueroa mother.simons pressed his attack on morales credibility and testimony alongside a presentation of wells alibi defense wells sister and wife both testified that he was with them at the time of the shooting.
wells did not take the stand and the jury never heard about the incident.the prosecution had no opportunity to question wells about his friendship with alberto roman,and any possible motive stemming from a conflict between alberto,brother richie and the victim brother.neither side put the romans on the stand or otherwise introduced testimony regarding the incident.thus,defense counsel did not attempt to shift suspicion to richie,and the prosecution did not try to demonstrate that wells friendship with alberto,motivated him to murder figueroa.instead,the jury heard a less complicated pitting morales identification testimony against the testimony of wells alibi witnesses.
on december,the jury found wells guilty.the court sentenced him to years to life on the murder conviction and seven and a half years to life on the weapons charge,with the sentences running concurrently.
following the verdict,wells began the process of challenging the legitimacy of his conviction.wells pursued several routes of relief in the new york courts,repeatedly claiming that simons failure to introduce evidence concerning richie roman alleged motive to kill ruben figueroa denied wells effective assistance of counsel.new york courts,at every level,rejected his claim.
a new attorney,michael john meenan,assisted wells in filing a motion under new york criminal procedure law section to set aside the verdict due to defense trial counsel failure to explore a conflict involving decedent ruben figueroa brother,jose,and a subject identified in police reports as richie,whom the defense believes to be one richie roman.meenan argued that,significantly,nowhere in the trial record did defense counsel explore a gun conflict between the decedent brother and richie only two days prior to the murder of ruben omission which clearly ignores a plausible alternate theory of motive to kill ruben figueroa.judge gary,however,found trial counsel performance exemplary rather than deficient 
the attorney in this case gave extremely effective cross examination,and was extremely prepared both with legal research and argument.he consistently made every argument in support of defendant,and was a tough and thorough advocate,even calling two alibi witnesses.defendant can not complain now that he disagrees with the tactics of defense counsel at the trial because of the unsuccessful outcome.
judge gary rejected without separate argument that simons should have pursued the richie roman theory.the court denied wells motion.
two years later,with stanley lafazan now serving as counsel,wells filed a second challenge,this time under new york criminal procedure law section,to vacate the judgment of conviction or,in the alternative,to hold an evidentiary hearing this motion,too,was based on the claim that wells was denied effective assistance of trial counsel because simons had not introduced evidence regarding the incident and had failed to subpoena richie roman or the others involved in that incident.lafazan argued,it would have been a windfall for the defense to subpoena these witness es and have them either take the fifth amendment,or,to detail to the jury the decedent participation in the shooting.lafazan attached a personal affidavit claiming that simons had told him that he did not have a strategy sic reason or any other explanation as to why he did not introduce evidence about the incident and that simons admitted he had overlooked it.wells did not attach affidavits from valerie roman and asserted instead that her statements as recorded in a police report were sufficient nor did he attach affidavits from other witnesses,stating,any affidavits from these witnesses would have to contain statements against their penal interests.lafazan did not indicate that he had interviewed the romans or made any attempt to do so.
the district attorney office opposed the motion on several grounds.citing new york criminal procedure law section,which states that motion papers must contain sworn allegations,the prosecution argued that wells motion should be summarily had not provided sworn information from a reliable source regarding how valerie roman would testify regarding the incident the district attorney office also speculated as to other justifications for simons decision not to call valerie roman to trial.they argued,first,that if counsel had presented the jury with the theory that figueroa had been killed in retaliation for his brother wrongdoing,the theory might not have aided in defendant misidentification defense because it was so transparently speculative that it would have likely been rejected and might have deflected the jury from the more appealing alibi defense.second,they argued that valerie roman would have a strong motive to exculpate her brothers and could have explained to the jury that her brothers skin tone was not similar to that described by morales to detective tropiano,even before morales had identified wells as the shooter.
judge gary denied the motion in an order dated september.the court noted that wells had appealed its denial of his motion presenting the same ineffective assistance claim,which the court had rejected,and found that the appellate division was the more appropriate forum for a review of the issue.judge gary wrote that,if the motion were not pending on appeal,he would deny the motion just as he had denied the motion.
wells then appealed his conviction and the denial of both motions.on october,the appellate division affirmed the conviction and denial of the motion,explaining,to the extent that defendant motion was based on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel and relied on alleged deficiencies in his counsel performance which were dehors the record,those claims are not properly before this court on the appeal and that w ith respect to those aspects of trial counsel performance which are part of the record,we conclude that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.people wells,dep t.
in an opinion filed the same day,the court affirmed supreme court denial of the motion.see people wells,dep t.citing new york criminal procedure law section b the court explained that the supreme court properly denied his motion without a hearing since he failed to submit sworn allegations substantiating or tending to substantiate all essential facts necessary to support his claim.id.internal citations omitted.wells applied for a writ of error coram nobis to vacate the latter decision on the ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,but the appellate division denied the application.people wells,dep t.
wells then applied for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals.his application,drafted by lafazan,was based in part on the difficulty of securing the cooperation of the romans in preparing his motion.specifically,he argued that t he burden placed on the defense to obtain a sworn statement from a hostile witness in order to prevail on his motion is patently unreasonable.wells explained that both valerie roman and trial counsel,calvin simons,had refused to sign affidavits for the defense.wells presented his case as an excellent opportunity to clarify the cpl b requirement that a defendant submit sworn allegations,and asked,what if,as here,the witness with knowledge of the essential facts is a hostile witness who refused to submit an affidavit on january,the court denied leave.people wells.
this action began on july,when wells,incarcerated at green haven correctional facility and proceeding pro se,filed a petition under for a writ of habeas corpus with the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,again raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the district court assigned the case to magistrate judge lois bloom,and the parties agreed that the assignment would be for all purposes and that any appeal would be directly to this court.respondent charles greiner,the superintendent of the green haven facility,raised three defenses in response to the petition.he argued,first,that wells claim was procedurally barred because the appellate division had affirmed on merely procedural lack of sworn allegations second,that wells claim had not been exhausted because he could file a motion again in state court and,third,that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit.
the magistrate judge rejected the first two defenses.judge bloom found the procedural bar defense unpersuasive.she cited fama commissioner of correctional services,cir,for the proposition that a procedural bar may operate only where the state court reliance on the bar is clear from the face of the opinion,id.quoting coleman thompson,d,and reasoned that the second department denial of wells ineffective assistance claim was not clearly based on a state procedural ground.specifically with regard to the the second department had affirmed the denial of the motion on the ground that wells failed to submit sworn allegations tending to substantiate all essential facts necessary to support his magistrate judge explained,while it is plausible that the appellate division did not consider the merits of petitioner ineffective assistance claim because his moving papers were not supported by sworn allegations,this is not clear from the face of the court decision.
nor did the magistrate judge endorse the superintendent exhaustion argument,which proceeded on two theories.the superintendent argued that wells had not exhausted his claim because it was not dismissed with prejudice.he then explained that the state court retained discretion under new york criminal procedure law section c to entertain a subsequent motion on the same issue.the magistrate judge addressed neither contention.instead,she proceeded to the merits of wells claim.
judge bloom found that an evidentiary hearing would be necessary to resolve the merits.e normally precludes a court from holding an evidentiary hearing for an applicant who has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,unless the stringent conditions of that subsection are met however,the magistrate judge found that petitioner was thwarted in his efforts to develop the factual basis of the claim in the state courts.wells greiner,may.judge bloom thus ordered a hearing and appointed counsel to conduct the hearing on wells behalf pursuant to g and rule c of the rules governing section cases id.the court assigned richard ware levitt to the case.
the difficulties encountered by counsel in state court in locating the roman family members and securing their cooperation repeated themselves with habeas counsel.levitt explained those difficulties in a letter to judge bloom asking the court to order the united states marshal for the eastern district of new york to serve subpoenas on wells behalf.those members of the roman family still living at east new york,danny,and alberto,phone calls.and,as soon as levitt private investigator made it known that he was attempting to serve a subpoena,he was told that the romans no longer lived there and that they had neither a forwarding address nor a telephone number.richie roman resided at a different address and,even when neighbors told levitt investigator that richie was home,richie would not answer the door.levitt asserted that service of the subpoenas would likely only be successful with the marshal assistance.the magistrate judge entered an order dated july,ordering the marshal service to serve subpoenas on valerie,richie,danny,and alberto.
judge bloom held the hearing on july.simons had little recollection of the events surrounding wells trial that occurred over seven years stated he had handled about cases in the testified with the help of notes from his files,including memoranda from investigator walker.simons could not remember what significance he had attached to the police report memorializing valerie roman account of the incident or why he did not try to get its story before the jury to be honest with you,he stated,i do remember specific ally today why i either put something in or did not.so my answer would be i do remember why and it not reflected in any of the notes that i have viewed.he also testified that he would not have told lafazan,wells appellate counsel,that he lacked a strategy in not continuing to pursue the incident.simons testified that walker made several visits to east new york avenue but did not know whether walker made more than the one documented attempt to interview the romans.in that attempt,walker reported hearing people inside who refused to answer.simons explained that walker ultimately had no success in interviewing the romans and that he,simons,never asked the court for assistance in subpoenaing them.
richie roman testified that he lived with his father,sister,and brothers jacob and danny at east new york avenue in january of but that he was with his brother alberto roman,playing basketball in fort greene at the time of the shooting,his father having sent him to stay with alberto,earlier that day for reasons he could not recall richie explained that he and danny were good friends with figueroa.he testified that he knew figueroa brother from the neighborhood,although not too well,and that he did not know wells.upon the advice of counsel,richie invoked the fifth amendment and refused to answer wells questions regarding the incident and the circumstances of figueroa homicide 
the other romans verified certain portions of the february police report.valerie roman could not recall the slashing incident but recalled the incident and remembered that figueroa brother was involved.danny roman remembered a fight between richie and figueroa brother,as well as the slashing incident and the incident,although he could not recall who fired into the window.alberto roman,recalled figueroa brother slashing richie with a knife and then shooting through the romans window.
neither wells nor the superintendent called alberto roman.
after considering submissions,the magistrate judge granted wells petition.applying the heightened d review standard created by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,the magistrate judge determined that the appellate division rejection of wells sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim was an objectively unreasonable application of strickland.
the magistrate judge announced that simons assistance was constitutionally deficient.she cited simons failure to introduce the february police report,to investigate the possibility of an alternate perpetrator,to interview or call potential exculpatory witnesses,to complete his investigation of the crime until petitioner had already been convicted,and to offer any explanation for these omissions.judge bloom pointed to a lack of record evidence that simons had conducted a substantial investigation and stated that simons was presented with leads that any reasonably competent lawyer would have pursued.she also faulted simons for not offering the february police report into evidence and not calling roman family members to testify.
the magistrate judge rejected the superintendent argument that simons decision not to call the romans was sound.the superintendent had contended that simons made a tactical decision not to call the romans to avoid opening the door to linking wells to alberto roman,and a gang and thus providing the missing motive for the murder.judge bloom focused,however,on simons testimony that he could not recall the basis of his decision not to call the that c ounsel never stated any tactical reason for his decision and concluded,respondent theory for why the february police report was not introduced can not be imputed to petitioner counsel.
the magistrate judge then determined that simons failures were prejudicial because the result of the proceeding would likely have been different if the jury were presented with evidence of richie roman motive to commit the crime.specifically,she concluded that if simons had introduced evidence of the incident and if richie roman had either testified to the dispute or invoked his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself as he did before this court,there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.finding the state court conclusions to the contrary objectively unreasonable,the magistrate judge granted the petition.the superintendent appeals 
the magistrate judge decision followed from three determinations first,that trial counsel performance was constitutionally deficient,second,that but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,and,third,that a new york appellate division opinion rejecting wells sixth amendment claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d.
the magistrate judge erred in her first determination.contrary to her conclusion,simons conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.wells ineffective assistance of counsel claim therefore fails.accordingly,we reverse the magistrate judge grant of wells petition.we need not consider the propriety of the magistrate judge other her evaluation of strickland prejudice,her application of the heightened aedpa deference of d her rejection of the superintendent procedural bar and exhaustion arguments and her decision to grant wells an evidentiary hearing notwithstanding e 
ineffective assistance of counsel claims appear regularly in habeas corpus petitions.those claims are grounded,of course,in the sixth amendment right of criminal defendants to the assistance of counsel,const.amend.vi,a right which has long been recognized to guarantee the effective assistance of counsel,mcmann richardson,d emphasis added see also kimmelman morrison,d citing supreme court cases.that guarantee applies to the states as a component of due process under the fourteenth amendment,see evitts lucey,d pavel hollins,cir,and may be included in a petition for the writ of habeas corpus because w here a state obtains a criminal conviction in a trial in which the accused is deprived of the effective assistance of counsel,the state unconstitutionally deprives the defendant of his liberty,thus rendering the accused in custody in violation of the constitution,a.kimmelman,at.quoting cuyler sullivan,d.
the purpose of the sixth amendment effective assistance of counsel guarantee is not to improve the quality of legal representation,but simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.strickland,at.the object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel performance.id.at.rather,t he essence of an claim is that counsel unprofessional errors so upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.kimmelman,at.see also strickland,at.effective legal assistance assures the fairness,and thus the legitimacy,of our adversary process,kimmelman,at,by ensur ing that defendants have a fair opportunity to contest the charges against them,id.at.powell,concurring in the judgment.
the familiar test for evaluating an ineffective assistance of counsel claim has two components.the first requires a showing of deficient counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.see cox donnelly,cir.constitutionally effective counsel embraces a wide range of professionally competent assistance,and counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.strickland,at.the performance inquiry examines the reasonableness of trial counsel actions under all the circumstances,id.at,from the perspective of trial counsel at the time,rompilla beard,d strickland,at.as the supreme court recently reminded us,a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.rompilla.at quoting strickland,at.
in assessing performance,we must apply a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.strickland,at.we will not normally fault counsel for foregoing a potentially fruitful course of conduct if that choice also entails a significant potential downside.sacco cooksey,cir bell cone,d.thus,a lawyer decision not to pursue a defense does not constitute deficient performance if,as is typically the case,the lawyer has a reasonable justification for the decision,deluca lord,cir,and strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,strickland,at.moreover,strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.id.
prejudice forms the second half of an ineffective assistance claim.there must be a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.see also cox,at.the habeas petitioner bears the burden of establishing both deficient performance and prejudice.united states birkin,cir see also rompilla.at kennedy,dissenting.
we limit our inquiry in this case to the performance prong.t here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.strickland,at.we find simons performance reasonable under strickland.specifically,he conducted a reasonable investigation into the richie roman lead and made a reasonable decision not to call the romans to the stand or otherwise to introduce evidence regarding the incident.simons inability,seven years after the trial,to recall his process does not change our conclusion.
we begin,as we always begin,with the presumption that counsel was effective.see strickland,at.we then turn to the challenged,simon termination of his investigation and failure to put any evidence of the incident before the look for legitimate justifications for that conduct,including justifications transparent on the record and justifications offered by counsel see eze senkowski,cir.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that simons pursued an objectively reasonable course of action.this conclusion sustains the initial presumption of effective assistance.darden wainwright,d.but that does not end the matter,for we must also examine counsel processes so that if we discover,for instance,that counsel decisions resulted from incompetence,negligence,or pure serendipity,we might reconsider any assumption that a choice made by counsel was strategic no evidence establishes that simons based his decisions on any improper grounds.wells can not overcome the presumption of effectiveness his claim must therefore fail.
wells allegation that simons investigation was constitutionally deficient is,at its core,indistinguishable from his allegation that simons should have presented evidence of the incident.the duty to investigate is essential to the adversarial testing process b ecause th e testing process generally will not function properly unless defense counsel has done some investigation into the prosecution case and into various defense strategies.kimmelman,at.see,deluca,at.the duty requires counsel to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.strickland,at.see also terry williams taylor,d id.at,concurring lindstadt keane,cir.it does not,however,compel defense counsel to investigate comprehensively every lead or possible defense,see,strickland,at.united states cruz,cir,or to scour the globe on the something will turn up,rompilla.at.
the reasonableness of an investigation is obviously a reflection of the facts of a case.thus,we must make a careful examination of counsel efforts on a basis.see id.at,concurring.in some cases,reasonable investigation will require defense counsel to speak before trial with fact witnesses whose testimony would directly corroborate the defense theory of important disputes,pavel,at see also eze,at,or to obtain those readily available file s that the state has and will use against the defendant,rompilla.at.but,as a general matter,when there is reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful,counsel failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.strickland,at.darden,at.
norms of practice,reflected in national standards like the american bar association aba standards for criminal justice,are useful guides for evaluating reasonableness.see strickland,at.the supreme court has frequently cited the aba standards in its decisions evaluating the constitutional sufficiency of defense counsels investigations.see rompilla.at,wiggins smith,d terry williams,at.strickland,at.of relevance here,those standards state that defense counsel should begin a prompt investigation moreover,a new york practice treatise adds that counsel should enlist the support of an investigator to attempt to locate any witnesses whose names or locations are unknown 
but wells does not argue that his defense counsel failed to initiate a prompt investigation or to hire an investigator to locate witnesses simons did both.instead,wells contends that simons should have pursued his investigation into richie roman potential motive further by securing interviews with the romans or more neighbors.however,in light of walker reports that the romans were unavailable and that persons at east new york avenue were afraid or unwilling to discuss the case,it is transparent from the record that simons could have reasonably believed that the only way to gain information from these potential witnesses would have been by issuing a subpoena 
the decision to subpoena a witness,however,is a decision,not an investigatory decision.in new york,a subpoena is not an investigative tool for defense counsel only the state,not the defense,has the power to secure evidence by warrant,see generally crim pro.law.section of the new york criminal procedure law permits defense counsel to issue a subpoena for the attendance in such court of any witness whom the defendant is entitled to call,and section explains that a person at liberty within the state may be required to attend a criminal court action or proceeding as a witness by subpoena.a subpoena is a means for presenting witnesses to the jury.therefore,in contending that simons should have used his subpoena power,wells does not fault simons for failing to discover reasonably available evidence he does not point to any accessible evidence that simons failed to discover.he instead argues that wells should have called certain witnesses to the stand.
in nearly every case that concludes that counsel conducted a constitutionally deficient investigation,the courts point to readily available evidence neglected by counsel here,however,wells argument is identical to and no greater than his evidence simons was constitutionally deficient in deciding not to put the romans on the stand or in not otherwise introducing the incident to the jury it is not a complaint about the scope of simons investigation but,rather,a complaint about trial strategy cast in investigatory terms.
the record provides a legitimate justification for simons decision not to introduce evidence regarding the incident.in particular,if simons had chosen to present evidence regarding richie roman conflict with figueroa,he would have opened the door to the prosecution introduction of evidence linking wells and the romans and the establishment of a motive for wells to have committed the crime.counsel was justified in avoiding that scenario.
we are wary of questioning simons decision not to subpoena the romans.courts applying strickland are especially deferential to defense attorneys decisions concerning which witnesses to put before the jury.the decision not to call a particular witness is typically a question of trial strategy that reviewing courts are to.united states luciano,cir per curiam.thus,counsel decision as to whether to call specific ones that might offer exculpatory ordinarily not viewed as a lapse in professional representation.united states best,cir quoting united states schmidt,cir see also united states romero,cir bell,at.
our deference is particularly apt where,as here,an attorney decides not to call an unfriendly witness to the stand and has precious little means of determining how the witness might testify moreover,insofar as simons believed that richie roman would have refused to testify by invoking a valid motion contended that simons overlooked the windfall of having the jury witness richie roman invocation of the fifth acted consistently with the norms of practice reflected in the aba standards and with new york law in refusing to call him to the stand the new york court of appeals has instructed that it is wholly improper in most situations to allow a party to parade a witness before the jury for the sole purpose of eliciting in open court the witness refusal to testify.people thomas,see people sapia,united states myerson,cir united states deutsch,cir.
simons was also justified in keeping the incident from the jury in general.wells is right that simons could have predicted,from the information he had gathered in his investigation,that,by calling the romans to the stand or by otherwise introducing the incident,simons might have been able to show the jury that richie roman had a motive to murder figueroa but simons also knew,from his participation in the december conference,that putting the romans on the stand would allow the prosecution to develop a link between alberto roman,and wells and thus give the prosecution the opportunity to tie the incident to wells alleged conduct indeed,simons knew that the word on the street was that wells did the shooting as retaliation for the beating of one of his friends.that rumor was consistent with the prosecution theory that wells murdered figueroa in retaliation for assaults on richie roman.
we can not fault simon for refusing to introduce evidence of the incident in light of its significant potential downside,sacco,at it would have opened the door to a prosecution line of inquiry harmful to the defense.darden,at.strickland,at.mills scully,cir cruz,at.establishing richie roman motive would not have excluded wells from the role of shooter.moreover,a decision to call the romans would have risked providing the prosecution an opportunity to convince the jury that wells murdered figueroa at their bidding.the prosecution had announced its intention to use the conflict and the relationship between wells and alberto roman,to explain wells motive.simons thwarted that early attempt by the prosecution to explore motive but knew that,if his client testified or the defense somehow opened up the issue of motive,the connection might be fair game.thus,if simons had introduced the conflict,he would have invited the prosecution to inject their eyewitness case with an extra shot of credibility the state could have added a plausible motive to its prosecution.simons decision to avoid the evidence limited the state case to a thin,if ultimately successful,eyewitness prosecution and did not remove his counsel from the wide range of professionally competent assistance.strickland,at.
none of the evidence introduced at the evidentiary hearing relating to simons rationales for pursuing his trial consisted,mainly,of testimony that he could not recall his overcome the presumption that simons rendered effective assistance,a presumption sustained by the transparent logic in avoiding a defense that might actually strengthen the prosecution case.wells can not,therefore,demonstrate constitutionally deficient counsel.
evidence of defense counsel processes sometimes demonstrates constitutional deficiency.we have stated that where a habeas petitioner establishes that counsel choices were not the result of a conscious,reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client,courts may question such choices.pavel,at.indeed,courts have found deficient performance where counsel conduct resulted from an entirely absent investigation,see,kimmelman,at.see also terry williams,at,a legal error or a misunderstanding of the law,see,deluca,at united states hansel,cir per curiam,a misunderstanding of the case,see,lindstadt,at,inattention,wiggins,at,a failure of common sense,see,henry poole,cir,or a desire to avoid extra work,see,pavel,at.thus,evidence of counsel failure to make conscious,reasonably informed decisions for the benefit of the criminal defendant may at times be sufficient to overcome the presumption of effectiveness.
wells,however,has not presented any such evidence.the magistrate judge correctly placed no reliance on the statement in lafazan affidavit,attributed to simons,that simons had overlooked evidence regarding the incident first,the affidavit itself is hearsay would be introduced for the purpose of establishing that simons made that particular communication to does not fall into a hearsay exception.specifically,it does not fit into the federal rule of evidence rule b exception for admission of the former testimony of an unavailable witness because lafazan,now deceased,was never subject to.see.b.second,simons purported statement to lafazan is hearsay as well and not subject to the rule b exception for statements against interest because,at the time of the district court evidentiary hearing,simons was clearly available to did testify.see.a defining unavailability.wells relies almost entirely,therefore,on simons inability to remember his reasons for conducting the trial in the manner that he did.this is insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of constitutionally effective counsel sustained by the record justification for simons actions 
time inevitably fogs the memory of busy attorneys.that inevitability does not reverse the strickland presumption of effective performance.without evidence establishing that counsel strategy arose from the vagaries of ignorance,inattention or ineptitude,cox,at,strickland strong presumption must stand.wells has not shown that his lawyer performance was deficient the district court erred by granting wells petition.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment of april,is hereby reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss the petition by entering judgment for respondent.
in new york state courts a defendant may request a preliminary hearing,known as a sandoval hearing,to determine whether,if he elects to testify,his prior criminal record may be used to impeach his credibility.people sandoval.norde keane,cir.

wells counsel also questioned simons extensively about a investigation conducted by walker on behalf of simons.walker reports indicated that the investigation was into the possible familial link between figueroa and morales.simons had no recollection of the investigation and refused to speculate as to the rationale behind the investigation.
the romans had various recollections of where richie was at the time of the murder.valerie testified that alberto,danny,and richie were in the apartment with her,danny testified that richie went to live with alberto,after the shooting,and alberto,simply could not remember whether richie was at home,at his brother,or at his aunt.
the magistrate judge asked jeremy gutman,who was cja counsel to the court,to be present at the hearing.gutman conferred with richie roman for a few minutes before richie took the stand.when wells counsel asked questions about the incident,gutman told the court,i am put in a somewhat awkward position because i know so little about this,but that,while perhaps being overly cautious,he was advising richie not to answer because of the possibility that his answer would relate to a potential motive that would tend to incriminate him even though it would in and of itself incriminate him in the homicide.judge bloom stopped the line of inquiry.
the superintendent filed a timely but unsigned notice of appeal and an amended,signed notice of appeal thereafter.we have appellate jurisdiction despite the lack of a signature on the initial,timely submission.see becker montgomery,d i f the notice is timely filed and adequate in other respects,jurisdiction will vest in the court of appeals,where the case may proceed so long as the appellant promptly supplies the signature once the omission is called to his attention.
because we hold that wells trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient under strickland,we need not decide whether the appellate division adjudication of wells ineffective assistance of counsel claims was on the merits under section d,rather than on procedural grounds,and,thus,whether aedpa deference applies.see generally miranda bennett,cir explaining that a federal court should not give aedpa deference to a state appellate court ruling where it is impossible to determine whether the ruling is based on the merits or on a procedural bar sellan kuhlman,cir adjudicated on the merits has a well settled meaning a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.quoting d see also smart scully,cir treating the denial of a section motion on the ground of failure to include sworn allegations as a procedural denial,but concluding that such a denial was not based on adequate and independent state grounds under wainwright sykes,d.
by reaching the merits of the ineffective assistance claim,we need not determine whether the claim is procedurally barred mills scully,cir.for the same reason,we need not consider the exhaustion issue.see b an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits,notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the state.
wells petition fails even in light of the evidence introduced in the district court,and,therefore,we need not consider whether the district court erred in ordering an evidentiary hearing despite e.see aeid bennett,cir in these circumstances,where the case may be disposed of on the merits even considering the evidence produced at the disputed evidentiary hearing,we refrain from examining the arguments concerning the propriety of the evidentiary hearing.see also williams taylor,d federal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufficient effort to pursue in state proceedings.boyko parke,cir.nor must we consider the preliminary question of whether the superintendent should be deemed to have waived any objection to that hearing by not raising the issue on appeal.see aeid,at declining,where this court could dispose of the case on its merits,to address the argument that the respondent had waived any objection to an evidentiary hearing by repeated failures to object to the hearing bryan mullin,cir declining to address what steps a respondent must undertake to preserve an objection,predicated on e,to a district court decision to grant a habeas petitioner an evidentiary hearing,where the district court had not erred in holding the hearing acosta artuz,cir holding that a district court has the power to raise the aedpa limitations period sua sponte because the defense implicates values beyond the interests of the parties.
in sparman edwards,cir per curiam,we explained that a district court facing the question of constitutional ineffectiveness of counsel should,except in highly unusual circumstances,offer the assertedly ineffective attorney an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence,in the form of live testimony,affidavits,or briefs.we offer defense counsel this opportunity in part because legitimate strategic considerations that may have guided an attorney conduct are not always transparent on a cold record.eze senkowski,cir.
see,terry williams taylor,d concluding,based on evidence that trial counsel incorrectly believed that state law barred access to available records,that counsel decision not to review those records could not have been strategic pavel,at refusing to defer to an attorney decision not to call a witness where the decision was animated primarily by a desire to save himself labor and therefore was not the sort of conscious,reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client that the federal courts have denominated strategic and have been especially reluctant to disturb tippins walker,cir refusing to extend the strickland presumption of competence where counsel wa s unconscious at critical times because the court could not depend on the buried assumption in our strickland cases that counsel is present and conscious to exercise judgment,calculation and instinct,for better or worse deluca,at finding that counsel performed deficiently by neglecting to pursue a particular defense,even though the decision not to pursue the defense could have been justified,because defense counsel actual decision was so hasty and based on so little,that in light of the obvious likely benefits that could be gained from the defense,his decision can not be considered either a reasonable professional judgment or a reasoned strategic choice.
defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case aba standards of criminal justice ed.
the treatise suggests that defense counsel always interview available friendly witnesses,see new york criminal practice,and that i f there are witnesses but the defendant does not know their names or whereabouts an investigator should be hired to locate them,interview them and to try to get them to come to your office or at least to get a written statement from them as to what they witnessed,id.
moreover,to the extent that wells might argue that simons should have sent walker back to east new york avenue for additional attempts to contact the romans or that simons should have personally contacted the by is unable to show any prejudice.the record developed below demonstrates that counsel could not secure the cooperation of the romans without issuing subpoenas indeed,counsel was unable even to subpoena the romans without first enlisting the support of the united states marshal.new york counsel encountered similar difficulties,tel
