chauncey dillon dillon appeals from an august,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york george daniels,judge,granting the motion of superintendent james conway conway of attica correctional facility attica to dismiss dillon petition for a writ of habeas corpus the petition on the ground that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in d a 
background 
the facts in this case are not in dispute.on december,after a jury trial,the new york supreme court,new york county,entered a judgment of conviction against dillon for murder in the second degree,assault in the first degree,attempted robbery in the first degree,two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,and reckless endangerment in the first degree the convictions arose from dillon participation in a violent confrontation between the passengers of two cars following a collision in.dillon was sentenced principally to an indeterminate prison term of years to life.
dillon,represented by an attorney,appealed his conviction to the appellate division,first department,claiming that the prosecutor had placed inadmissible hearsay evidence before the jury during trial the prosecutor had impermissibly vouched for the credibility of a witness and improperly commented on dillon silence in discussing a statement made by dillon to the police and the trial court had erred in its instructions to the jury.on june,the appellate division unanimously affirmed dillon conviction.people dillon,dep t.dillon applied for leave to appeal the appellate division judgment to the new york state court of appeals.on august,the court of appeals denied dillon application,people dillon,accordingly,his state court conviction became final ninety days later,on november,
in order for his federal habeas petition to be timely,dillon was required to file it on or before november,unless the statute of limitations was equitably tolled.
while incarcerated,dillon had another inmate to help him draft a pro se habeas petition,which he could have and would have timely filed before november.in or around august,however,dillon retained an attorney,richard langone langone,to represent him in collateral proceedings,and specifically to prepare a petition for habeas corpus to the district court arguing that dillon had received ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceedings before the new york trial and appellate courts.when langone was retained,he was in private practice with one law partner who,soon afterwards,left the firm,saddling langone with approximately twenty active cases.joint appx.at.according to langone,because of this workload,he was not able to begin working on dillon petition for habeas corpus until.joint appx.at.
on november,langone flew to attica with a page habeas corpus petition for dillon to sign in front of a notary.by affidavit,langone affirms that during the visit he and dillon spoke about the statute of limitations for filing the petition for habeas corpus under aedpa and that dillon 
specifically asked me not to wait until the last day to file the petition.i told him that i would not wait until the last day to file the petition on november,i left attica prison with his verified petition in my hand and with him expecting that i would file it with the district court before november,the date i believed was the last day to file the petition.
joint appx.at some emphases supplied,some in original.following this meeting,langone continued to work on a lengthy memorandum of law to accompany the petition.
langone apparently operated under the incorrect assumption that the aedpa statute of limitations begins to run on the day after a petitioner is denied leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals that is,he believed he had until november,to file the petition.according to the report and recommendation r r of magistrate judge douglas eaton,whose r r was adopted by judge daniels,this assumption resulted from a misinterpretation of an opinion of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,geraci senkowski,d,aff,cir.in geraci,the district court held,in diferent circumstances,that t he aedpa statute of limitation began running the day after the petitioner was denied leave to appeal.id.langone had worked as a paralegal for one of the parties in geraci senkowski,and he allegedly relied upon that experience in determining the date by which the petition was due.
in addition,for all of october and most of november,langone,at dillon request,spent considerable time tracking down a copy of a videotape that dillon believed would be useful in preparing the petition and would exonerate him langone attempts to find the videotape reportedly took longer than expected because the legal aid society initially sent him the wrong videotape.due to the poor quality of the videotape,when langone finally obtained the correct tape he needed to hire an enhancing service to render its contents discernible.during this period,dillon wife called langone several times on behalf of dillon to ask if he had filed the petition and to report that dillon was worried about running out of time.joint appx.at.langone repeatedly told dillon wife that he was working on the papers and not to worry.id.
on november,langone filed the petition with an accompanying memorandum of law and appendix.on january,conway moved to dismiss the petition as untimely under aedpa statute of limitations.see d a.following oral argument,magistrate judge eaton issued the r r in which he recommended that the district court grant conway motion to dismiss the petition as untimely langone subsequently submitted objections to the r r,claiming that confusion existed regarding the application of the statute of limitations under aedpa his particular circumstances warranted equitable tolling for his assurance that he would file a timely petition,coupled with his miscalculation of the expiration of aedpa statute of limitation,had severed the agency relationship between langone and dillon and the combination of dillon financial inability to hire counsel at an earlier point and langone heavy professional burdens following the departure of his law partner,and langone diligent efforts to obtain evidence that dillon believed would demonstrate his actual innocence,qualified as extraordinary circumstances compelling equitable tolling for one day.
in its memorandum decision and order of august,see dilon conway,cv,wl,the district court adopted the r r of magistrate judge eaton in its entirety.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the district court determined,as a matter of law,that equitable tolling was not appropriate because the record did not reveal the requisite extraordinary circumstances.the existence of extraordinary circumstances sufficient to justify equitable tolling under d is a question of law,and we therefore review the judgment of the district court de novo.belot burge,cir if a district court denies equitable tolling because the governing legal standards would not permit equitable tolling in the circumstances that aspect of the decision should be reviewed de novo.
the aedpa statute of limitations does not set forth an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever its clock has run.holland florida,quoting day mcdonough.indeed,in holland the supreme court concluded,as had all eleven courts of appeals to consider the question,that d is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases.id.the court went on to conclude that d may be tolled only if the petitioner shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.holland florida,internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,the supreme court concluded that while a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline,does not warrant equitable tolling,id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted,the eleventh circuit erred in concluding that pure professional negligence on the part of a petitioner attorney can never constitut
