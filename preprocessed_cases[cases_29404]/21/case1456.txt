background 
during the summer of,freeman,then a resident of spencerport,new york,applied for a position in the sheriff office of maricopa county,arizona.as part of the application process,freeman was interviewed by a polygraph examiner,and,in the course of that examination,he admitted that he had previously obtained child pornography from the internet in his new york home.the sheriff office informed new york state authorities of freeman admission,and the new york authorities commenced an investigation,obtaining a warrant to search the computers located at freeman residence.on august,police officers executed the search warrant,seizing two computers.they also gave freeman the opportunity to accompany them to the police station in order to make a statement.at the station,freeman admitted that he viewed child pornography over the admission that was corroborated by a subsequent examination of the computers seized from freeman residence,which contained over images of child pornography.several of the images stored on freeman computers depicted adult males vaginally penetrating prepubescent females.
the local new york authorities referred the matter to the attorney office for the western district of new york.on january,freeman pleaded guilty,pursuant to a plea agreement,to a information alleging that he received child pornography,in violation of a.at his plea colloquy,freeman admitted that he knowingly received images of child pornography on a computer and that the images had been shipped or transported in interstate and foreign commerce.the district court accepted freeman plea of guilty and ordered his detention pending sentencing.
the district court held a sentencing hearing on april.according to a presentence investigative report psr prepared by united states probation office,freeman total offense level under the sentencing guidelines was,and his criminal history category was i,corresponding to an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.freeman total offense level in the psr included,among other things,a enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to and a enhancement pursuant to b for his possession of sadistic or masochistic images.counsel for freeman objected to these two enhancements,and the district court sustained the objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement,concluding that the facts of this case did not show that freeman had obstructed justice within the meaning of the relevant provision 
the district court denied defense counsel objection to the enhancement authorized by section b of the guidelines for the possession of images containing sadistic or masochistic conduct.in what the district court described as one of the more difficult aspects of its responsibilities,it reviewed the photographs in question to determine whether they portray ed sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence,b.the district court described a sampling of the photographs as follows 
one depicts an obviously prepubescent girl engaging in intercourse with an adult male.the second photograph depicts,again,a prepubescent girl,i judge,to be or with a penis inserted in her vagina another is a picture of an obviously prepubescent girl with a penis in her mouth and an adult penis in her vagina at the same time another picture is of an obviously prepubescent child with her legs spread open,an adult male holding his penis in close proximity to her vagina and there appears to be a sock stuck in her mouth another picture showed obviously,prepubescent children with their one hands tied to the other legs.
relying on our holding in delmarle that it is within the district court discretion to conclude that the subjection of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be painful is excessively cruel and hence is sadistic within the meaning of section b,at,the district court concluded,based on its review of the photographs,that an adult male inserting his penis into the vagina of a prepubescent child who in some cases was as young as or years old would have to be painful.having made this determination,the court ruled that the enhancement applied to freeman conduct.defense counsel objected to the ruling.
additional argument from defense counsel and the government ensued.the district court then calculated freeman sentencing range under the advisory guidelines,determining that freeman total offense level was and his criminal history category was i,which corresponded to an advisory sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the district court sentenced freeman at the low end of the guidelines months imposed a term of supervised release.judgment entered on april,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
freeman challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court erred by imposing a enhancement,pursuant to b,for the possession of images containing sadistic or masochistic conduct.he argues that,while the district court commented that the depicted act would have to be painful,it did not find that the images were sadistic or masochistic or otherwise depicted violence,as did both the sentencing court and the panel in delmarle.appellant br.freeman claims that p ain does not mean violence,and a finding that an act may have been painful to one of its subjects does not mean that it involved sadistic or masochistic conduct or otherwise depicts violence.id.the government responds that freeman argument is an end run around delmarle and n o robotic incantation of the term sadistic is required by circuit precedent or the guidelines.appellee br.
because freeman challenges the district court interpretation and application of the guidelines,we review his challenge de novo.see,united states gray,cir.
freeman and the government agree that our holding in delmarle governs this case,so we begin with a close examination of that decision.in delmarle,the defendant was convicted of shipping or transporting visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct in violation of a.see at.at sentencing,the district court imposed a enhancement under b because a photograph transmitted by delmarle depicts a nude boy,about years of age,having an unidentified object inserted into his anus.id.at.delmarle challenged his sentence on appeal,contending,inter alia,that the image did not portray sadism.id.
a panel of our court rejected delmarle challenge to the application of the section b enhancement.noting that sadism was not defined in the guidelines,the court consulted dictionary definitions of the term,which included the infliction of pain for sexual gratification,delight in physical or mental cruelty,and the use of excessive cruelty.id.quoting webster third new international dictionary.with these definitions in mind,the court described the content of the relevant photograph it is plain that the subject of the picture in question is a young child and it is also plain that a cylindrical object,of a circumference sufficiently substantial to make it quite likely
