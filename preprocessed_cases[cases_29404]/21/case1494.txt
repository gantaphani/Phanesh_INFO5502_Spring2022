derrick hayes hayes appeals from a january,judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions iii,following a guilty plea to one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine,in violation of a and b c.the court imposed a sentence of time served,a term of home confinement of months,and a term of supervised release of years.
prior to hayes guilty plea,the district court had denied,in a may,amended opinion and order,hayes motion to suppress evidence seized by police officers in and near his residence and to dismiss the indictment.the district court ruling resulted from its conclusions,inter alia,that the police canine initial sniff and alert to the possible presence of narcotics was not an unreasonable search because hayes did not possess a reasonable privacy interest in the air in front of his residence containing the scent of narcotics hayes did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a vegetated area approximately feet from the rear of his residence,where a black bag containing narcotics was detected and seized by the police canine and the police officer inspection and opening of the black bag containing narcotics was not a search and seizure implicating the protections of the fourth amendment because hayes lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag contents.
on appeal,hayes challenges these conclusions.hayes principal claim is that the area of scrub brush where the black bag containing cocaine was discovered by the police canine was within the curtilage of his home,and the canine search of that area constituted an unlawful search for purposes of the fourth amendment.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court denial of hayes motion to suppress and therefore will not disturb the judgment of conviction and sentence.
background 
at a suppression hearing held on february,the district court heard testimony and received into evidence police reports and other documents submitted by the parties.the following factual narrative is based upon factual findings made by the district court after the hearing was concluded.
shortly before on september,colchester,vermont police and rescue personnel responded to a call of a possible cocaine overdose at hayes residence located at marble island road in colchester,vermont.police and rescue personnel arrived upon the scene and ultimately transported hayes to the hospital by ambulance.after the ambulance left,police officers spoke with hayes girlfriend,lynn hepner,who occupied the residence,on a somewhat regular basis,with hayes.she gave the police officers consent to search the residence.during the course of the search,the officers discovered a duffel bag containing marijuana residue,a glass jar with some white residue believed to be cocaine,and a cigar box containing a sizable amount of cash,additional white residue,and a quantity of marijuana.
the officers decided to be safe at that point,suspended their search of the residence,and applied for a search warrant.the officers sought a warrant because they found much more than they were anticipating and believed that the contraband found was possible evidence of a drug distribution operation.for the next couple of hours,officer michael akerlind stood by alone at the hayes residence and waited for the other officers to secure a search warrant.
at approximately,officer david dewey,who had participated in the consensual search,returned to the residence.he was accompanied by his canine,kilo.officer dewey was trained as a narcotics dog handler,and kilo was trained as a narcotics canine.as officer dewey awaited the warrant,he decided to let kilo out of the car because the dog had been confined in the police cruiser for four to five hours at that point.once outside the car,which was parked in front of the house,officer dewey began to play with kilo,using a frisbee.he threw the frisbee into hayes front yard in a trajectory parallel to marble island road.kilo chased after the frisbee for a short distance,stopped and pointed its nose in the air as if it were alerted to something.at that point,officer dewey asked kilo whatta ya got according to dewey,this was a verbal signal to encourage the dog to continue investigating.
as a result of the verbal command,kilo started sniffing around the outside perimeter of the house.officer dewey testified that kilo went around the right side of the house and continued around to the rear of the residence and towards the back of the detached garage.the detached garage was behind and to the left of the main residence.kilo headed straight across the rear of the garage and towards the brush line or hedgerow located on the left side of the hayes property.dewey also stated at the hearing that kilo did really sniff around the garage at all and that the scrub brush,which kilo dove into and found the black bag in,was located approximately feet from the back door of the residence.officer dewey also testified that the scrub brush was about to feet thick.
when officer dewey called for kilo to return,kilo returned with a black,nylon bag the black bag in its mouth.officer dewey instructed kilo to leave it,and kilo spit the bag out of its mouth at officer dewey feet.officer dewey then opened the black bag and discovered a number of plastic baggies containing white powder that was later identified as approximately ounces of cocaine.a short time later,just before,other colchester officers arrived with a search warrant signed by vermont state court judge ben joseph,but it does not appear that any contraband was seized pursuant to the warrant 
following his arrest,hayes was charged,on april,in a indictment with possessing with the intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine,in violation of a and b c.on september,hayes filed a motion to suppress evidence and a motion to dismiss.hayes argued,inter alia,that the initial canine sniff constituted a warrantless search of the property kilo subsequent search of the property invaded the curtilage and thus was improper and officer dewey illegally searched the black bag after it was retrieved by kilo following a hearing held on february,the district court denied hayes motion in a written opinion issued on may.the district court rejected the argument that the initial canine sniff constituted an illegal search.citing united states place,d,and distinguishing hayes case from this court decision in united states thomas,cir,the district court reasoned that kilo sniff in this case merely assessed the contents of the air in hayes front yard,an area which is entitled to a lesser degree of fourth amendment protection that sic the interior of the residence.
the court also rejected the argument that kilo improperly searched the curtilage of the property.the court analyzed the curtilage factors set forth in united states dunn,d,and united states reilly,cir,and considered whether hayes had any expectation of privacy in the area where kilo found the black bag.the court ruled that hayes did not because the brushy area to the left of and behind the garage was not within the curtilage of the home.finally,the court determined that,contrary to hayes claims,officer dewey did not violate the fourth amendment when he opened the bag retrieved by kilo.according to the court,hayes,like the defendant in united states arboleda,cir,
lost any reasonable expectation of privacy by throwing or causing the bag to be thrown into the bushes at the edge of his property 
hayes manifested no intent to prevent access to the bag or its contents by locking it or taking other affirmative steps to protect it from passersby and animals.the bag was casually thrown to the edge of hayes lot in fact,it may even have landed on his neighbor property.as in arboleda,under these circumstances,even if hayes did not intend to relinquish possession of the bag on a permanent basis,he lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents,and officer dewey inspection of the bag was not improper.
after the district court denied his motions,hayes pleaded guilty,pursuant to a plea agreement,to an information charging him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of a and b c.under the terms of the plea agreement,hayes specifically reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress and agreed not to appeal the aspect of the district court order related to the consensual search of his home.we therefore express no opinion as to that part of the district court order.
standard of review 
in reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,factual determinations are reviewed for clear error and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.see ornelas united states,d.review of a district court curtilage decision involves the same analysis.w hile most curtilage cases concern factual determinations about use,privacy,and other such questions,which are reviewable for clear error only,these factual findings are themselves subject to a legal framework which is,of course,reviewable in a plenary fashion.united states reilly,cir.
ii.the initial sniff 
the fourth amendment protects people from unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of privacy.united states thomas,cir quoting united states chadwick,d.where evidence is secured in violation of the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches,the evidence may be excluded from the prosecution case against the defendant whose fourth amendment rights were violated.see weeks united states.a fourth amendment search,however,does not occur unless the search invades an object or area where one has a subjective expectation of privacy that society is prepared to accept as objectively reasonable.see illinois caballes,d official conduct that does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy is not a search subject to the fourth amendment.internal quotation marks omitted.in this regard,the home or an individual dwelling place has been afforded a heightened privacy interest.thomas,at.
both the supreme court and this court have held that c anine sniffs are recognized as being less intrusive than a typical search used to determine the presence of contraband,and the practice of using trained dogs to sniff baggage at airports has been held not to constitute a search.thomas,at citing united states place,d united states waltzer,cir united states bronstein,cir.and,insofar as the presence of narcotics is revealed by a canine sniff,the supreme court has held that any interest in possessing contraband can not be deemed legitimate,and thus,governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest.see caballes,at.holding that a canine sniff during a traffic stop is not a search quoting united states jacobsen,d see also id.at.holding that the use of a that does not expose noncontraband items that otherwise would remain hidden from public view during a lawful traffic stop,generally does not implicate legitimate privacy interests quoting place,at.place,at.holding that a canine sniff of luggage at an airport is not a search.this is because the expectation that certain facts will not come to the attention of the authorities is not the same as an interest in privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
consistent with the strong expectation of privacy in the sanctity of one home,however,this court has held that a canine sniff at the door of an if the only function of the sniff is to reveal illegal narcotics inside that nonetheless a search subject to the constraints of the fourth amendment.see thomas,at.as we explained in thomas,with regard to a canine sniff at the door to an apartment that revealed narcotics inside the apartment,the defendant had a legitimate expectation that the contents of his closed apartment would remain private.id.at.this court explained that although a dog 
sniff in an airport is not a search,it is quite another thing to say that a sniff can never be a search.the question always to be asked is whether the use of a trained dog intrudes on a legitimate expectation of privacy.while one generally has an expectation of privacy in the contents of personal luggage,this expectation is much diminished when the luggage is in the custody of an air carrier at a public airport.
although using a dog sniff for narcotics may be discriminating and unoffensive relative to other detection methods,and will disclose only the presence or absence of narcotics,see united states place,it remains a way of detecting the contents of a private,enclosed space.with a trained dog police may obtain information about what is inside a dwelling that they could not derive from the use of their own senses.
thomas,at citations omitted.
hayes urges us to declare that the sniff by kilo was an illegal search,relying on our decision in thomas.hayes reasons that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy that extended to the area where the sniff occurred and that the sniff,therefore,was a search.from this,hayes contends that the strong fourth amendment protection traditionally granted to the sanctuary of the home also applies to scrub brush located feet from the back door of his house and on the border of his neighbor property,as well as in the front yard where the initial sniff took place.hayes claims that this case is distinguishable from place because the area closely surrounding his home is unlike a public place such as an airport.
we reject hayes arguments and his reliance on thomas and hold that the police canine act of sniffing for narcotics here did not violate hayes legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private.caballes,at.thomas is clearly distinguishable from the facts of this case.the contents of the black bag that kilo smelled were not located inside hayes dwelling or residence but in brush outside the house,approximately feet from the back door of the residence and bordering an adjoining property.a critical consideration in thomas,one not present here,was that the canine there smelled the presence of narcotics located inside the defendant home.
hayes also relies on kyllo united states,in which the supreme court held that the use of a thermal imaging device to detect from lamps used to grow a home was an unreasonable search,d.hayes likens the canine enhanced sense of smell to the thermal imaging device at issue in kyllo.but in kyllo,like in thomas,the means of detection was directed inside the defendant home.here,the canine sense of smell was directed towards an area feet behind the back door of the home.
in its order,the district court designated the area where the sniff occurred as the air in hayes front yard.united states hayes,at.may.we agree with the district court that hayes had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the front yard of his home insofar as the presence of the scent of narcotics in the air was capable of being sniffed by the police canine.see caballes,at.the record indicates,and the lower court so found,that the front yard where the dog sniff occurred was clearly within plain view of the public road and adjoining properties.
the sanctuary of the home simply does not extend to the front yard of hayes property,where the initial sniff occurred.see united states titemore,cir holding that a homeowner has no reasonable expectation of privacy in a patch of front lawn visible from the road and leading up to the front porch see also oliver united states,d o pen fields do not provide the setting for those intimate activities that the fourth amendment is intended to shelter from government interference or surveillance moreover,as a practical matter these lands usually are accessible to the public and the police in ways that a home,an office,or commercial structure would not be.accord esmont city of new york,d,unobstructed,open areas in front of a residence are not entitled to fourth amendment protection.
iii.path to the contraband 
the heightened privacy interest afforded to a dwelling place extends to the curtilage,which has been described as an area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a person home and the privacies of life.oliver,at.
in united states dunn,d,the supreme court reaffirmed the principle of curtilage first se
