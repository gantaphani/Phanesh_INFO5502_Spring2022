defendant appellant robert rossignol pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and to failing to report the importation of more than in united states currency.both charges stemmed from rossignol role in an international drug smuggling conspiracy stretching from new brunswick,canada to houston,texas.the district court imposed a below guidelines sentence of months in prison.on appeal,rossignol contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.we affirm his sentence.
because rossignol pled guilty,our discussion of the facts is drawn from the colloquy,the presentence report psr,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states cintrón echautegui,cir.
from at least january,until june,rossignol was a member of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine that spanned the canadian united states border.because he was a member of the van buren,maine border community,rossignol was responsible for transporting cash and drugs across the border.a typical transaction in that conspiracy occurred as follows.in canada,a,a,would provide rossignol with considerable amounts of cash.rossignol would then transport that cash across the border into the united states,delivering it to a third member of the conspiracy.that third person,b,in turn,would transport the money to texas where he would meet up with a.a would then secure multiple kilograms of cocaine from suppliers in texas,which b would transport by car back to northern maine.those drugs were handed off to rossignol,who resumed his role and would drive the drugs into canada for delivery to a or b.rossignol was compensated for each successful round of smuggling.
the last successful trip before rossignol arrest took place in february or march of and involved the transport of eight kilograms of cocaine from maine into canada.during the subsequent,stymied trip that led to his arrest,rossignol entered the united states from canada at hamlin,maine while carrying some in united states and canadian currency,which he failed to report.
over the course of their investigation,federal agents learned that rossignol was also involved in the transportation of firearms,providing the basis of a sentencing enhancement the district court later imposed.a and b purchased several handguns from members of the conspiracy in texas and transported those guns to maine.pursuant to a side agreement between rossignol and b,rossignol took those guns into canada at b s request for an additional.rossignol separately carried another gun into canada for a s personal use.
rossignol was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of and a,and one count of failing to report the importation of more than in united states currency,in violation of a b,b,and.he pled guilty to both counts.the psr calculated a guidelines sentencing range of to months,which included a dangerous weapons enhancement under b.at sentencing,the district court adopted the psr guidelines calculation and sentenced rossignol to months in prison,below the guidelines range rossignol timely appealed.
rossignol argues that his sentence is unreasonable.our framework for assessing the reasonableness of a defendant sentence is ground.we first examine whether the district court committed any procedural missteps and,if the sentence is procedurally sound,we then ask whether the sentence is substantively reasonable.see united states king,cir.the linchpin of our substantive reasonableness assessment is determining whether the sentence reflects a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states martin,cir.we owe considerable deference to the district court and our review is limited to determining whether its sentence,in light of the totality of the circumstances,resides within the expansive universe of reasonable sentences.king,at.overall,we review the district court discretionary sentence determinations for abuse of discretion,findings of fact for clear error,and conclusions of law de novo.united states reverol rivera,wl,at cir.having carefully reviewed the record here,with particular emphasis on the sentencing colloquy,we are unable to conclude that rossignol sentence is unreasonable.
rossignol makes no argument,so we proceed directly to his substantive plaint he cites four considerations which,he claims,the district court gave insufficient weight to or ignored altogether.he contends that the court ignored his age years,discounted the fact that he had no prior criminal record,gave insufficient weight to the fact that except for the instant offense he was an upstanding member of society,and created an unwarranted sentencing disparity by applying the dangerous weapons enhancement to his sentence but not to the sentences of other members of the conspiracy.the record suggests otherwise.
in fact,the record reveals that the court placed particular emphasis on the history and characteristics of the defendant,the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities in other words,the exact factors rossignol now recites.far from ignoring them,the sentencing transcript makes plain that the district court specifically considered each of these factors but viewed many as cutting against rossignol in the context of this drug conspiracy.most tellingly,the court emphasized 
t his is an unusual situation because of the respect that the defendant had garnered in the van buren madawaska community.this was not your typical drug smuggler.this was a former police officer this was a former veteran,member of the united states army,a man who carried the colors of this country according to the parish priest,an active church member,somebody who could be counted on to be present at religious services a coach.
this is clearly a sword because although it indicates,as defense counsel said,the conduct seems to be aberrational,it also conduct that is the height of hypocrisy and conduct that as a consequence of the defendant community involvement provided a cover for his criminal activity.and i agree with the government this based on this defendant history and characteristics,he would literally be the last person you would expect to be smuggling drugs,firearms,and cash across the border.
beyond this overarching rationale,it is evident that the district court amply considered each particular point the defendant now raises.first,the above demonstrates that the district court identified rossignol strong community ties and considerable civic service but,instead of weighing those factors in favor of leniency,viewed them as evidencing a particularly acute breach of the public trust in rossignol border community.this assessment is grounded on a sensible though not obligatory view of the circumstances.martin,at.
second,the court likewise invoked rossignol stature in the community as one reason he received a longer sentence than several noting that the other people involved in this conspiracy would not have been waved through customs like this defendant was.and the record reveals additional reasons why rossignol claim that the district court failed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among the fails the court acknowledged that rossignol received a longer sentence than three other members of the conspiracy,but noted that he,unlike the others,had not cooperated.as the court explained,the others testified at the trial of a particular which resulted in a conviction in large part because of their testimony.in light of this critical difference,the district court did not abuse its discretion in giving rossignol a longer sentence than other members of the conspiracy which included a dangerous weapons enhancement the others did not receive.a defendant sentence is not unreasonable simply because his codefendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences.united states vázquez rivera,cir.
third,that rossignol had no prior criminal history was also acknowledged by the district court.in fact the court based its decision to grant a sentence below the guidelines range and well below the government month recommendation on its view that it i
