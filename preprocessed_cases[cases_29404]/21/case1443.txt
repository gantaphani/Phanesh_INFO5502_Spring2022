defendant syed hasan defendant or hasan appeals from an october,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra townes,judge convicting him,after a jury trial,of various crimes.specifically,hasan was convicted of one count each of making a false statement on a passport application,in violation of conspiracy to commit kidnapping,in violation of and international parental kidnapping,in violation of a hasan was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.on appeal,hasan argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him the sentence imposed was unreasonable and he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
background 
we present below the relevant evidence presented at trial,viewed in the light most favorable to the government.see jackson virginia,d.
hasan entered into an arranged marriage with ayesha taqueer.soon after they married,hasan became verbally and physically abusive.the couple attempted to resolve their problems,and in february,taqueer became pregnant.throughout her pregnancy,however,hasan continued to be verbally and physically abusive.on october,taqueer gave birth to a son,syed muzammil hasan muzammil.
in december,hasan suggested that he and taqueer obtain a passport for muzammil,so that in the future he could visit relatives in india.at trial,taqueer testified that she signed the third page of the passport application but never saw the first two pages,which set forth the mailing address to which the passport would be sent.importantly,taqueer signed the third page of the form three days before hasan signed the first two pages.although taqueer testified that she believed the passport would be sent to the family home in brooklyn,hasan had listed his brother south carolina address as muzammil residence and mailing address on the first two pages of the application.
on friday,january,taqueer went to the brooklyn home of abdul neighbor who cared for muzammil during the week while taqueer and hasan bring muzammil home for the weekend.when she arrived at abuzaid apartment,abuzaid informed her that hasan had taken the child.hasan and muzammil,however,were not at the family home.taqueer attempted to call hasan numerous times,but hasan never answered his phone.he later called from a pay phone to inform taqueer that his mother had taken muzammil to south carolina to the home of hasan brother.taqueer demanded that hasan return muzammil to her immediately,but hasan refused.taqueer then moved out of the family home and into a friend apartment,which was also in brooklyn.over the next several weeks,taqueer repeatedly contacted hasan and hasan family in south carolina to demand that they return muzammil,but they refused.
because hasan refused to cooperate,taqueer hired an attorney,who recommended that she file a petition in family court to obtain a court order for the child return.upon taqueer informing hasan that she had retained an attorney,hasan fled brooklyn,leaving the family home and his job without notice.
several weeks later,hasan informed taqueer that his parents had taken muzammil to india,but he refused to provide contact information.over the next several months,taqueer repeatedly demanded that hasan return the child to her he continually refused.taqueer offered to travel to india to get muzammil,but again,hasan refused.instead,he insisted that he would never return muzammil unless taqueer reconciled with him and dropped her petition pending in the family court.taqueer refused these demands.
beginning in may,taqueer sought the assistance of the federal bureau of investigation fbi to find muzammil.an fbi special agent provided taqueer with a recording device and instructed her to record any conversations she had with hasan.she recorded two such conversations in which hasan repeatedly refused to return muzammil and demanded that taqueer drop her family court petition.
because hasan refused to attend the proceedings in family court,that court entered a default judgment against him.in july,the family court issued an order granting taqueer custody of muzammil and issued a warrant for hasan arrest.
finally,on october,hasan was arrested in detroit,michigan,after he arrived on a flight from india.hasan was traveling with muzammil,who was soon reunited with taqueer.
hasan was then tried in the district court.on november,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts of the indictment.the district court then imposed a sentence principally of months imprisonment.hasan now appeals.
discussion 
on appeal,hasan argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him the sentence imposed was unreasonable and he received ineffective assistance of counsel.he further in a cursory he did not have the intent to commit these crimes.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
first,hasan argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury guilty verdicts.specifically,he argues that the evidence was insufficient to conclude,as the jury apparently did,that taqueer did not give her permission for hasan parents to take muzammil to india.he further contends that misstating a mailing address on a passport application is not sufficiently material to establish guilt of the offense of making a false statement on a passport application.
because the task of choosing among competing,permissible inferences is for the jury and not for the reviewing court,united states mcdermott,cir,we are required to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,united states gaskin,cir,and resolve all issues of credibility in favor of the jury verdict,united states desena,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see generally jackson,at.
at trial,the government introduced much evidence that taqueer had not given permission to hasan parents to take muzammil to india.first,taqueer testified that she did not give her consent to hasan parents.furthermore,several emails were admitted into evidence that were written by hasan and demonstrated that hasan knew that taqueer had filed a petition in family court,knew that taqueer desired the return of muzammil,and had control over muzammil whereabouts.hasan did testify that he had taqueer consent to allow his parents to take muzammil to india,but we resolve all is issues of credibility in favor of the jury verdict,desena,at,and thus we conclude that the jury found taqueer testimony,and not hasan testimony,credible.
the government also presented other evidence at trial that supports hasan conviction.the evidence,for example,that hasan signed the first two pages of muzammil passport pages that contained the false days after taqueer signed the third page of the application undermines hasan claim that they filled out the pages together.similarly,evidence presented at trial that hasan purchased a ticket to india undermines hasan claim that he had only planned a brief trip to india in july to retrieve muzammil.perhaps most importantly,the recorded telephone conversations between hasan and taqueer contradict hasan statement that he continually made valiant efforts to return muzammil to taqueer.taken together,along with other evidence presented at trial,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish that hasan intended to,and did,commit the kidnapping crimes and thus to support the jury guilty verdicts.for this reason,we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to the convictions for international parental kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping.
next,hasan argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury guilty verdict on the charge of making false statements on a passport application.specifically,hasan argues that his use of the incorrect address on muzammil passport application can not support his conviction of this charge because it was not a material misstatement.whether the statute prohibiting making false statements on a passport application,contains a materiality requirement is a question of first impression in this circuit.
when construing a federal statute,we begin with the text of that statute.see,united states kozeny,cir quoting united states albertini,d.where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states ron pair,d.
beginning with the text of,we conclude that the statute plainly does not require that the false statement be material.see note ante text of statute.unlike other statutes involving false statements,does not contain a materiality requirement.for example,prohibits the making of any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the federal government.emphasis added.the fact that a defendant knowingly and willfully made a false statement on the passport application is sufficient to sustain a conviction.although we have not directly addressed this question before,each of our sister circuits that has considered this question has agreed with our conclusion that does not require that the alleged false statement be materially false.see united states ramos,cir holding that,unlike,does not have a materiality requirement see also united states salinas,cir same united states hart,cir adopting the holding in ramos,at.
here,hasan listed his brother south carolina address as muzammil residence,even though muzammil actual residence at the time was in brooklyn.on appeal,hasan only challenges that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish materiality and does not dispute that the evidence was otherwise sufficient to establish that he knowingly made a false statement with the intent to obtain a passport.because we conclude that does not require proof of materiality,we affirm the judgment of the district court on this count.
reasonableness of sentence 
on appeal,hasan challenges three aspects of the district court guidelines calculation used in his sentencing.specifically,he argues that the district court erred procedurally in imposing pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines b a enhancement for substantial interference with the administration of justice imposing pursuant to a enhancement for obstruction of justice and finding pursuant to that the passport fraud conviction should not be grouped with the kidnapping convictions.
following united states booker,d,a district court has broad latitude to impose either a guidelines sentence or a sentence.united states sanchez,cir see also united states cavera,cir en banc.accordingly,the role of the court of appeals is limited to examining a sentence for reasonableness,which is akin to review under an standard.see cavera,at see also gall united states,d holding that courts of appeals must review all inside,just outside,or significantly outside the guidelines a deferential standard sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal alteration,citations,and quotation marks omitted.this standard applies both to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence itself and to the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.united states verkhoglyad,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when a defendant challenges the district court interpretation of a guidelines provision,we review this interpretation of the as we would review the interpretation of any novo.see,united states.hertular,cir in general,we review a district court determination that a defendant deserves a n enhancement de novo.de novo review of the interpretation of a guidelines provision does not exceed the narrow appellate review prescribed by gall.at.rather,de novo review of the law is adequately captured in the deferential standard that gall requires.id.as the case sims blot,cir,notes,a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal alteration,citations,and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.put differently,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if it makes an error of law.in this way,review for abuse of discretion and de novo review are not entirely distinct concepts,but rather,review for abuse of discretion incorporates,among other things,de novo review of district court rulings of law.see,united states legros,cir the standard incorporates de novo review of questions of law including interpretation of the guidelines and review of questions of fact.
further complicating and confusing the discussion of standards of review is that abuse of discretion is a misnomer in the review of a district court rulings on matters of law.the interpretation of guidelines any not discretionary in the ordinary sense of the word,see webster third new international dictionary defining discretion as power of free decision or choice within certain legal bounds,because,when there is a settled interpretation of a given law,judges do not exercise their discretion on whether or how to interpret or apply the law.instead,they attempt in good faith to apply relevant precedential interpretations of that law.nevertheless,the phrase abuse of discretion a phrase that has been a source of some confusion and more than occasional and understandable irritation to district an expansive definition in the federal courts.see zervos verizon,cir.this definition sweeps sufficiently far to define district court rulings that are based on erroneous conclusions of law as abuses of discretion.see,cooter gell hartmarx,d sims,at zervos,at.understanding that appellate courts apply the term abuse of discretion to the overall review of a district court implementation of a sentence and that the use of the term does not imply discretion on the part of the district judge in deciding a matter of law,we review the district court interpretation of the guidelines here de novo.see belot burge,cir see also zervos,at explaining the differences among de novo,and review.
hasan first challenges the enhancement imposed by the district court pursuant to b for interference with the administration of justice.specifically,hasan argues that this enhancement should not apply to him because he was never served with process from the family court and thus was not under the jurisdiction of that court.
in united states amer,we concluded that this enhancement did apply to a set of nearly identical facts.cir.the defendant in amer abducted his children and took them abroad without their mother knowledge,as hasan did here.in amer,the mother then filed a petition in family court in new york,which awarded her full custody of the children and issued a warrant for the defendant,as taqueer did in this case.finally,the defendant in amer was eventually arrested and convicted of international parental kidnapping,as hasan was.we upheld the district court imposition of this enhancement,reasoning that the defendant abduction of the children prevented proper legal proceedings from occurring by taking matters completely outside the purview of the administration of justice.id.at.we conclude that our holding in amer controls and thus that the district court did not err in imposing this enhancement.
next,hasan argues that the district court erred in applying,pursuant to,a enhancement for obstruction of justice by committing perjury at trial.specifically,he argues that this enhancement punishes him for testifying at trial.this enhancement,however,does not violate a defendant constitutional right to testify in one own defense if the defendant has made sworn statements that he knows to be false.united states johnson,cir.hasan further argues that the enhancement should only be imposed after a jury finds that he did obstruct justice.because the guidelines are no longer mandatory,the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant when the trial judge selects a sentence within a defined range.booker,at.the district court selected a specific sentence from within the range applicable under the guidelines,thus hasan was not entit
