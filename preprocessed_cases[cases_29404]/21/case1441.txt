we would be remiss if we did not,at the outset,commend the district court for its thoroughness,thoughtfulness,and effectiveness in the conduct of these unusually lengthy,difficult,and sensitive proceedings.much of what follows simply reports what it did and tracks what it said.
we affirm the judgments of conviction.we also affirm the sentences of yousry and sattar.we remand the case,however,with respect to the sentence of stewart,and also with respect to the sentences of yousry and sattar in light of the resentencing of stewart.
in particular,we affirm the judgments as to each defendant conviction of conspiring to defraud the united states,in violation of,by violating sams imposed upon abdel rahman.contrary to the defendants arguments,the evidence is sufficient to sustain these convictions.moreover,we reject both stewart argument that,as a lawyer,she was not bound by the sams,and her belated argument collaterally attacking their constitutionality.
we affirm as to sattar conviction of conspiring to murder persons in a foreign country in violation of,and his conviction of soliciting persons to commit crimes of,murder and conspiracy to commit violation of.we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to sustain these convictions,especially in light of testimony establishing that sattar attempted to undermine a unilateral by an egyptian terrorist organization and to draft a fatwa calling for,inter alia,the killing of jews and crusaders.
we affirm as to stewart and yousry convictions of providing and concealing material support to the conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign country in violation of and,and of conspiring to provide and conceal such support in violation of.we conclude that the charges were is neither unconstitutionally vague as applied nor a logical absurdity,as stewart that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the convictions.we also reject stewart claims that her purported attempt to serve as a zealous advocate for her client provides her with immunity from the convictions.
finally,we affirm stewart convictions for knowingly and willfully making false statements in violation of when she affirmed that she intended to,and would,abide by the sams.in light of her repeated and flagrant violation of the sams,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that stewart representations that she intended to and would abide by the sams were knowingly false when made.
we reject the remaining challenges to the convictions.we affirm the district court rejection of sattar vindictive prosecution claim because there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the government decision to add new charges against sattar amounted to an effort to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.and,because stewart conduct was materially different from,and more serious than,the conduct of other lawyers representing abdel rahman who may also have violated the sams,we affirm the district court rejection of stewart claim that she was selectively prosecuted on account of her gender or political beliefs.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sever the trial of stewart and yousry from that of sattar in light of the general preference for joint trials,the specific charges at issue here,and the district court curative instructions.nor did the district court abuse its discretion by empaneling an anonymous jury in light of the particular allegations of criminal wrongdoing at issue,involving the corruption of the judicial process,and the widespread publicity about the case.we find no fault with the district court resolution of allegations of juror impropriety.we also agree with the district court treatment of confidential information,including its denial of stewart motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa,its ex parte,in camera examination of fisa wiretap applications,and its rejection of stewart more general challenges to the constitutionality of fisa.finally,we find no fault with the district court treatment,in accordance with the classified information procedures act cipa,of stewart motion to compel disclosure of information related to potential surveillance conducted by the national security agency.
we therefore affirm the convictions in their entirety.
we also affirm the sentences of sattar and yousry.we conclude that the district court committed neither procedural error in calculating the applicable guidelines ranges,nor substantive error in varying from those ranges pursuant to its consideration of the factors set forth in a.we nonetheless remand their cases to the district court to allow it to reconsider their sentences should it choose to do so in light of the resentencing of stewart.
we can not affirm stewart sentence on the basis of the record before us.because the district court declined to find whether stewart committed perjury at trial,we can not conclude that the mitigating factors found to support her sentence can reasonably bear the weight assigned to them.this is so particularly in light of the seriousness of her criminal conduct,her responsibilities as a member of the bar,and her role as counsel for abdel rahman.we therefore remand the cause to the district court for further consideration of her sentence,in light of,among other things,the charges of perjury against her and of any other matter it deems necessary or advisable,and direct the court to revoke stewart and yousry bail pending appeal and to order them to surrender to the united states marshal to begin serving their sentences forthwith.

in october,sheikh omar ahmad ali abdel rahman was convicted of a variety of crimes in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.according to the government evidence at his trial,
abdel rahman,a blind islamic scholar and cleric,was the leader of a seditious conspiracy,the purpose of which was jihad,in the sense of a struggle against the enemies of islam.indicative of this purpose,in a speech to his followers abdel rahman instructed that they were to do jihad with the sword,with the cannon,with the grenades,with the missile against god enemies.abdel rahman role in the conspiracy was generally limited to overall supervision and direction of the membership,as he made efforts to remain a level above the details of individual operations.however,as a cleric and the group leader,abdel rahman was entitled to dispense fatwas,religious opinions on the holiness of an act,to members of the group sanctioning proposed courses of conduct and advising them whether the acts would be in furtherance of jihad.
united states rahman,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d citations omitted.the crimes of conviction included soliciting the murder of egyptian president hosni mubarak while he was visiting new york city attacking american military installations conspiring to murder president mubarak conspiring to bomb the world trade center in,which succeeded conspiring subsequently to bomb various structures in new york city,including bridges,tunnels,and the federal building containing the new york office of the federal bureau of investigation fbi,which did not succeed and conspiring to commit crimes of sedition.id.at.for these crimes,abdel rahman was sentenced to be incarcerated for the remainder of his life.id.at.following his conviction and appeal therefrom,abdel rahman legal team focused on two goals improving his conditions of confinement,and obtaining his transfer from prison in the united states to egypt.

federal regulations provide that the bureau of prisons may implement sams,u pon direction of the attorney general,when reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of death or serious bodily injury.a.in re basciano,cir alteration in original,cert.denied,d.the bureau of prisons,following abdel rahman remand to its custody in august,imposed severely restrictive sams upon him.they were designed to prevent him from directing or facilitating yet more violent acts of terrorism from his prison cell.the sams have been renewed,and sometimes modified,every days since they were first imposed.
the may,sams applicable to abdel rahman prohibited him from having contact with others except as noted in this document that could foreseeably result in his communicating information sending or receiving that could circumvent the sam intent of significantly limiting his ability to communicate send or receive terrorist information.sams of may.to enforce this general prohibition,the measures regulated abdel rahman telephone contacts,id,his mail,id,and his visitors visits,id.the measures limited his telephone contacts solely to his attorneys of record and his wife,id.a,and prevented matters discussed in those calls from being divulged in any manner to any third party,id.c i.the measures required the screening of all his outgoing and incoming mail,id,and prohibited him from talk ing with,or otherwise communicat ing with,any representative of the news media,including through his attorney s staff,or otherwise,id.the measures also provided for the monitoring of all visits.id.on the condition that his attorneys would not divulge any information to third parties,abdel rahman was permitted to communicate with his legal team by telephone,id.a d,mail,id.a,and in person,id,with fewer restrictions than with other persons.members of this legal team included lawyers ramsey clark,abdeen jabara,lawrence schilling,and defendant lynne stewart.
subsequent versions of the sams retained similar prohibitions and screening mechanisms including the prohibition against communications with the news media.see,sams of,sams of.they retained similar provisions regarding legal communications,and incorporated provisions requiring abdel rahman attorneys to sign affirmations acknowledging their receipt of the version of the sams in effect.see,sams of,sams of.by virtue of those affirmations,counsel agreed to abide by the terms of sams then in effect.see,unsigned affirmation of abdeen jabara,unsigned affirmation of ramsey clark,affirmation of ramsey clark,affirmation of abdeen jabara,affirmation of ramsey clark.

defendant mohammed yousry,a new york university graduate student who served as one of the legal team translators had also been,in that capacity,a member of abdel rahman trial team.as a translator,yousry was permitted to read to abdel rahman,who is blind,and to take dictation from him.
various members of the team,including stewart and yousry,also maintained contact with defendant ahmed abdel sattar,who had served as a paralegal during abdel rahman trial.the evidence established that sattar was in continual contact with various members of a abroad.see,transcript of conversation between ahmed abdel sattar and ahmad taha musa,may.
the visits to abdel rahman 
sometime in,more than three years after abdel rahman was taken into federal custody,a faction of a declared a unilateral,a halting of violent operations,in egypt.when the was first announced,abdel rahman was understood to support it.
in november,despite the,a group associated with a attacked,killed,and mutilated the bodies of more than sixty tourists,guides,and guards at the hatshepsut temple in luxor,egypt.taha musa taha a military leader of a,a follower of abdel rahman,and an unindicted involved in the incident alaa abdul raziq atia atia,later a leader of a military wing in egypt,was also involved in the killings.a later claimed responsibility for the attack and demanded abdel rahman release from prison in the united states.
in january,abdel rahman was assigned by the bureau of prisons to the federal medical center in rochester,minnesota fmc rochester.in march,stewart and yousry visited him there.prior to the visit,stewart signed and delivered to the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york a document in which she affirmed,under penalty of perjury,that she would abide by the sams imposed by the bureau of prisons on abdel rahman.
at about this time,defendant sattar was in contact with members of a,who were divided over their support for what remained of the.and factions developed,and members of the organization wanted abdel rahman to take a position on the matter.to that end,several wrote messages addressed to abdel rahman,which they sent to sattar for delivery to abdel rahman.sattar gave the messages to stewart and yousry,who surreptitiously brought the messages with them to abdel rahman during a subsequent visit in may.
yousry read the messages to abdel rahman during the visit,and abdel rahman dictated to yousry responses to some of them.yousry and stewart then smuggled the responses out of fmc rochester among their legal papers,and sent them to sattar.as directed by abdel rahman,sattar informed various members of a that abdel rahman was willing to reconsider the effectiveness of the and had rejected the associated idea that a should form a political party in egypt.
news of abdel rahman purported position spread.but some members of the media in the middle east expressed skepticism about the veracity of sattar representations,questioning whether they in fact came from abdel rahman or whether sattar had fabricated them himself.to refute those reports,sattar and yousry asked one of abdel rahman lawyers,former united states attorney general ramsey clark,to tell a reporter for an newspaper that abdel rahman opposed a formation of a political party.clark,they thought,would be perceived as more authoritative than sattar.clark eventually agreed to talk to the reporter.he told the reporter that t he sheikh has said he believes that the formation of a new political party to engage in politics in egypt at this time is not correct and should not be done.transcript of conversation between ahmed abdel sattar,mohammed yousry,ramsey clark,and muhammad i,at.
in september,farid kidwani,the of a military wing,was killed along with three other members of the group in a shootout with egyptian police.kidwani death precipitated further tension and debate within a regarding the advisability and efficacy of the.
taha sent another message to sattar to be relayed to abdel rahman urging abdel rahman to support the termination of the and noting that taha and his associates needed a powerful word from abdel rahman to achieve this goal.taha told sattar that such support from abdel rahman would strengthen me among the brothers.sattar agreed to send the message to abdel rahman and prepared a letter to abdel rahman for that purpose.in,clark and yousry surreptitiously took the letter,along with newspaper articles relating to the killing of kidwani in egypt,with them during a visit to abdel rahman in fmc rochester.yousry read the letter and newspaper clippings aloud to abdel rahman.from these documents,abdel rahman first learned of kidwani death.
abdel rahman dictated a letter to yousry in response.
to those against whom war is made,permission is given to fight,because they are wronged oppressed and verily god is most powerful for their aid the latest thing published in the newspapers was about the egyptian regime killing of four members of the group.this is enough proof that the egyptian regime does not have the intention to interact with this peaceful initiative,the which aims at unification.i therefore demand that my brothers,the sons of a do a comprehensive review of the initiative and its results.i also demand that they consider themselves absolved from it.
transcript of conversation between ahmed abdel sattar and ahmad taha musa,at emphasis omitted,parenthetical in original.sattar expected clark to make a public statement to similar effect,but clark declined to do so.
on february and,yousry and abdeen jabara,an lawyer and member of abdel rahman legal team,visited abdel rahman at fmc rochester.they brought with them another letter which included another message from taha,again asking for abdel rahman support for ending the.but jabara would not permit abdel rahman to dictate a letter to yousry in response.and,notwithstanding pressure from sattar and taha,jabara,like clark before him,refused to issue any public statement regarding abdel rahman position on the matter.
on may,defendant stewart signed another affirmation that she and her staff would abide by the sams.she did not submit that affirmation to the united states attorney office until may.
on may,stewart met with sattar,who gave her more letters for abdel rahman,including another message from taha yet again seeking abdel rahman approval of an end to the.taha asked abdel rahman to take a more forceful position regarding the end of the and to dictate some points we can announce in a press conference with lynne.transcript of second audiovisual recording involving omar abdel rahman,mohammed yousry,lynne stewart,and others,may,video tr.may,tape at.

from the beginning of the visit,stewart was aware of the prison guards presence.for example,she asked yousry,do they usually sit like this and watch us id.at.and during this meeting,stewart and yousry took overt steps to ensure that the nature of their communication with abdel rahman would be concealed from the prison guards.as she suggested to yousry,they should give them,the guards something to watch.id.at.when the guards were standing close to the window of the conference room in which abdel rahman,stewart,and yousry,were meeting yousry told stewart to look at me and talk a little bit because they are watching us closely.id.at.while yousry read the message to abdel rahman,stewart uttered a meaningless series of phrases to yousry so that it would appear to an observer as though she was taking part in a conversation i am talking to you about him going to have a,uh,chocolate eh heart attack here why do you stop a minute now.and ui say to him that,you know,you understood what we are saying,ui.id.as stewart spoke,yousry said to abdel rahman,i do know,sir,they are standing very close by the glass lynne says,ui when they look,you look at me a little,talk,then look at the sheikh.id.

stewart and yousry also took evasive action when a guard appeared to take interest in their conversation.at one point,while yousry was conversing with abdel rahman,stewart touched yousry hand and said why do you stop there and we talk a minute urn,the,uh ahmed youngest son needs glasses,did you know that id.at.yousry then explained to abdel rahman,lynne says,stop a little because they are by the glass.id.not long afterwards,stewart tapped with the pen on the paper in front of yousry and told him to continue reading this cause this is setting up the organizational system around his conditions.id.yousry continued reading.stewart then made a series of statements unrelated to the substance of the conversation between yousry and abdel rahman.yousry kept abdel rahman informed of what yousry and stewart were doing,noting that lynne continues to eh,she watching them,she watching them,to which abdel rahman replied,v ery good,very good.id.at.after yousry finished reading taha message to abdel rahman,he returned it to a notebook that he had brought with him and with which he left.
on the second day of the same visit,abdel rahman dictated to yousry,among other things,a letter to an a lawyer who favored the,asking him to allow others in a to criticize it,and another to taha asking him to escalate the language of criticism of the.video tr.may,tape,at.
meanwhile,stewart and yousry continued to engage in what stewart later called c overing noises,video tr.july,tape,at,and other tactics designed to obscure the nature of what they were doing.after one such incident,yousry explained to abdel rahman,s he just has to say that in order to break the the people are looking.video tr.may,tape,at.stewart told yousry,i am making allowances for them looking in at us and seeing me never speaking and writing away here while you talk arabic.id.at.she then directed yousry to talk back to me now,because otherwise it does make any sense so say something in english id.as yousry explained to abdel rahman,we are now acting,i talk to her in arabic,and she responds in english,and they do understand what is going on.video tr.may,tape,at.
at the end of the visit,stewart and yousry took the responses from abdel rahman with them from the prison,and later gave them to sattar.sattar then passed them along to taha and another member of sattar also spoke to various members of a,informing them that abdel rahman would have no objection to a return to violence.transcript of audio recording of ahmed abdel sattar,ahmad taha musa,and salah hashim,may,at.
at about this time,sattar told members of a that stewart would be making a public statement about abdel rahman views on the.sattar and stewart first discussed what stewart would say to the press.then,on june,sattar and stewart spoke to esmat salaheddin,a reuters reporter based in cairo.stewart told salaheddin that abdel rahman is withdrawing his support for the ceasefire that currently exists.trial transcript trial tr.at,testimony of salaheddin.she explained that abdel rahman had made the statement from prison two weeks before.

ii.count one 
each defendant asserts that the evidence admitted at trial was insufficient to support his or her conviction under for defrauding the united states and obstructing the department of justice and the bureau of prisons in the administration and enforcement of the sams in force with respect to abdel rahman.stewart also argues that the sams do not apply to lawyers,and that the district court improperly prevented her from challenging the underlying validity of the sams.
sufficiency of the evidence 
in order to establish a offense under as charged in count one of the indictment,a reasonable jury must have been able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants entered into an agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the government in this case,the administration and enforcement of the sams by deceitful or dishonest means and at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states ballistrea,cir,cert.denied,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.both the existence of a conspiracy and a given defendant participation in it with the requisite knowledge and criminal intent may be established through circumstantial evidence.united states huezo,cir quoting united states stewart,cir alteration omitted.
evidence as to stewart.stewart argues that her defiance of the sams was open,not deceitful.one aspect of her defiance was undoubtedly conveyance of abdel rahman statements regarding the and related matters to the reuters journalist.but we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury could certainly have found that stewart gained access to abdel rahman and thereby the information that she conveyed to the journalist by deceit and dishonest means.sattar v,d at.without stewart agreement to abide by the sams and the other representations contained in her affirmations,she knew that she would not have been allowed to visit abdel rahman,see also id.at,and therefore would not later have been able to defy the regulations openly by publicizing messages on his behalf.
stewart insists that she acted with the intent,not to defraud the government,but to zealously represent her client but the jury had a reasonable basis on which to disbelieve this,and to disbelieve that zealous representation included filing false affirmations,hiding from prison guards the delivery of messages to abdel rahman,and the dissemination of responses by him that were obtained through dishonesty.id.at.moreover,even if stewart acted with an intent to represent her client zealously,a rational jury could nonetheless have concluded that stewart simultaneously acted with an intent to defraud the government.a genuinely held intent to represent a client zealously is not necessarily inconsistent with criminal intent.
evidence as to yousry.yousry argues that,as a translator who was taking direction from others,he did only what he was told to do and acted in reliance on the guidance and conduct of the members of the bar for whom he worked.based on the evidence admitted at trial,however,a rational jury could have found that yousry knew of and understood the terms of the sams.
yousry had in his possession the december version of the sams as well as a copy of the underlying regulations.that version of the sams provided that abdel rahman legal team could pass along to him only inmate correspondence,and set forth a process for screening all mail.sams of.the sams in yousry possession also specifically prohibited abdel rahman communication with news media in person,by telephone,by furnishing a recorded message,through the mails,through his attorney s,or otherwise.id.yousry himself acknowledged that members of the legal team were not to disclose any portion of their conversation with the sheik to the media.excerpts from draft of dissertation of mohammed yousry at.yousry also knew that clark and jabara had refused to relay messages from abdel rahman.
from this evidence,a reasonable factfinder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that yousry knew that his assistance,by providing translation services,in facilitating abdel rahman continued contact with members of a violated the sams.moreover,as with stewart,yousry deceptive and evasive conduct during the course of his visits to abdel rahman undercuts his claim of good faith.
yousry argues that the evidence established,at most,that he intended to violate the sams,not that he knew that doing so might constitute a crime.but even if he misunderstood the law in that respect,such a mistake provides no defense to a charge of criminal misbehavior.see cheek united states,d.the fact that yousry was aware that his acts,in knowing violation of the sams,would defraud the government is sufficient to sustain the conviction.the government need not also prove that he knew that there was a criminal criminalized such behavior.the general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution is deeply rooted in the american legal system.cheek,at.
propriety of the sams 
stewart argument.stewart contends that the district court erred by preventing her from challenging the validity of the sams as part of her defense.she sought to argue that the attorney general has no authority to have lawyers held criminally liable for violating the sams and that the sams are unconstitutionally vague as applied to her.under dennis united states,d,however,stewart strategy of collaterally attacking the validity of the sams is futile.
as the supreme court recognized in dennis,there are appropriate and inappropriate ways to challenge acts of government thought to be unconstitutional.id.at.there is no reason for federal courts to consider the constitutionality of a statute at the behest of petitioners who have been indicted for conspiracy by means of falsehood and deceit to circumvent the law which they now seek to challenge.id.at.stewart,like the defendants in dennis,was indicted for engaging in a voluntary,deliberate and calculated course of fraud and deceit.id.at.this is a prosecution directed at stewart fraud,not an action to enforce the law claimed to be unconstitutional.id 
the result may be different where the constitutionality of a law is challenged by those who of necessity violate its provisions and seek relief in the courts,id.at,or where the governmental action at issue was taken with no colorable authority,united states barra,cir but,as with dennis,t his is not such a case.at.
we have no basis upon which to entertain a doubt as to the authority of the attorney general of the united states to ensure that reasonable measures are designed and implemented in an attempt to prevent imprisoned criminals who are considered dangerous despite their incarceration from engaging in or facilitating further acts of criminality from their prison cells.see a setting forth the boundaries of that authority.nor have we any reason to doubt the attorney general conclusion that abdel rahman fits within that category of prisoner.he has demonstrated his willingness to engage in violent criminality not by acting violently himself,but by ordering,encouraging,and conspiring with others who would actually shed the blood.the likelihood that he would continue to order,direct,or encourage such acts from prison,if he could,was plain,and his incapacitation reasonably required not just his physical immobility,but also his virtual silence the world at large.
stewart might have effectively challenged the sams by refusing to sign the affirmations in which she said she would abide by them.she might then have invoked the jurisdiction of the courts by bringing suit on abdel rahman or her own behalf to challenge their validity.she might have she forcefully does the sams interfered with her capacity to effectively represent rahman.but she did not.instead,she signed the affirmations.having chosen that path,she can not be heard to attack the validity of those measures when called to account for violating them,especially where,as here,her fraudulent and deceptive conduct endangered people lives.
the district court did not err in preventing stewart from challenging the validity of the sams as part of her defense,and the jury acted within its province when it found that stewart intentionally and fraudulently subverted them.
sattar related arguments on appeal.sattar relies on stewart and yousry arguments with respect to count one.for the reasons set forth above addressing those arguments,we conclude that they are also unpersuasive as applied to him.
iii.counts two and three 
only sattar was charged in counts two and three of the superseding indictment.he does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his count two conviction for conspiring with abdel rahman,taha,and others to murder persons in a foreign country,in violation of instead,he asserts that the district court should have dismissed this count on the grounds of vindictive prosecution.similarly,sattar does not challenge his conviction on count three for soliciting persons to engage in crimes of and conspiracy to commit violation of he argues instead that he was denied a fair trial.these arguments are addressed below in the context of the defendants more general challenges to the probity of the proceedings.
iv.counts four and five 
stewart and yousry challenge their count five convictions for violating and by providing and concealing material support for the conspiracy for which sattar was convicted and their count four convictions for conspiracy to provide and conceal such support,in violation of.they argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their conviction on either count,and contend that their conduct was constitutionally protected in any event.
history of the charges 
by way of background,the initial indictment charged all three defendants with violating the defendants argued before the district court that is unconstitutionally vague with regard to the statute prohibition on providing material support or resources in the form of communications equipment and personnel.sattar i,d at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court agreed,and therefore dismissed those charges.id.at 
the government then filed a superseding indictment alleging that by essentially the same course of conduct,coordinating the surreptitious passage of a messages to and from abdel rahman,stewart and yousry violated the relevant version of section,entitled providing material support to terrorists,provided in relevant part 
whoever,within the united states,provides material support or resources or conceals or disguises the nature,location,source,or ownership of material support or resources,knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out,a violation of various enumerated statutes related to terrorism or in preparation for,or in carrying out,the concealment of an escape from the commission of any such violation,or attempts or conspires to do such an act,shall be subject to criminal punishment.
a.for purposes of both sections and,material support or resources may be provided in the form of 
currency or other financial securities,financial services,lodging,training,safehouses,false documentation or identification,communications equipment,facilities,weapons,lethal substances,explosives,personnel,transportation,and other physical assets,except medicine or religious materials.
b see also id.g t he term material support or resources has the same meaning given that term in section.section,however,in contrast to section,does not penalize the provision of material support without regard to what the support is for.section requires instead that the defendant provide support or resources with the knowledge or intent that such resources be used to commit specific violent crimes 
the government charged that the defendants provided material support or resources in the form of personnel namely,abdel the conspiracy,knowing or intending that abdel rahman,as an active,would help commit crimes.see sattar iii,d at.the government further asserted that stewart and yousry conceal ed and disguise d the nature,location,and source of their material support by means of the defendants covert conduct disguising abdel rahman participation as a.see id.the government had initially argued that stewart and yousry could be convicted for providing themselves as personnel to a foreign terrorist organization and by providing communications equipment to the conspiracy.after the dismissal of the section charges and following the filing of the superseding indictment,however,the government abandoned those contentions.see id.
as an initial matter,stewart and yousry challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions on this count.they also argue that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the elements of a violation of section.in addition,they raise more general challenges to the statute,arguing that section does not criminalize the behavior alleged in the indictment,that the provision is unconstitutional as a inchoate offense,and that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.we examine their arguments in the context of the statutory elements of the crime,addressing first the sufficiency arguments.
elements of section 
proof of the underlying conspiracy to kill persons abroad there was sufficient evidence of the existence of the predicate conspiracy to kill or which sattar was convicted.indeed sattar,the only defendant charged with and convicted of participating in the conspiracy,does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to this count.
the government offered evidence that sattar and taha composed a fatwa in abdel rahman name calling for the killing of the jews wherever they are ui and wherever they are found.audio tr,at.it also offered proof that this fatwa was communicated to atia,an a military leader.although the evidence may not have established any particular plan of action to execute the fatwa,a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt from the fatwa exhortations and atia readiness to act on it that there was a concrete,illegal objective to murder persons abroad.
a review of the transcripts of various intercepted telephone conversations introduced into evidence,particularly the september,conversation involving sattar,taha,and another party,bolsters this conclusion.the discussion goes well beyond the abstract and contemplates the coordination with atia of violent actions,presumably along the lines of the luxor massacre.in light of such evidence,a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy as charged in count two existed.
proof of material support to the conspiracy.stewart and yousry also assert that they did not provide material support in the form of personnel to the conspiracy.a reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise.there was evidence introduced at trial sufficient to support a reasonable juror inference that stewart and yousry helped abdel rahman participate covertly in the conspiracy to engage in violence abroad by communicating to members of a and others his withdrawal of support for the.abdel rahman instrumental,his,as the district court observed,have been unavailable to the conspiracy without the active participation of stewart and yousry.sattar v,d at.
the defendants argue that the government established only that they provided the underlying conspiracy with abdel rahman pure speech and therefore did not provide personnel within any constitutional interpretation of section.the government does not deny that section may not be used to prosecute mere advocacy or other protected speech,but contends that the defendants were prosecuted for criminal actions that did not amount to protected speech.
resolution of this dispute does not turn on whether the prosecution introduced evidence of pure speech.numerous crimes under the federal criminal code are,or can be,committed by speech alone,and certain crimes are characteristically committed through speech.rahman,at.the issue is,instead,whether abdel rahman statements were protected speech.we conclude that the statements were not protected such as to cast doubt on the convictions.
words that are the very vehicle of a crime are not protected merely because,in part,the crimes may have involved the use of language.united states rowlee,cir,cert.denied,d.as we recognized when affirming abdel rahman sentence,freedom of speech and of religion do not extend so far as to bar prosecution of one who uses a public speech or a religious ministry to commit crimes.abdel rahman,at.i f the evidence shows that the speeches crossed the line into criminal solicitation,procurement of criminal activity,or conspiracy to violate the laws,the prosecution is permissible.id.at.words that instruct,solicit,or persuade others to commit crimes of violence violate the law and may be properly prosecuted regardless of whether they are uttered in private,or in a public speech,or in administering the duties of a religious ministry.id.
the dissemination of some of the speech introduced at trial might be viewed as nothing more than the expression of views on the broad political situation in egypt.for example,in reaffirming that he was withdrawing his support for the,abdel rahman said that he had expressed his opinion and left the matters to his brothers to examine it and study it.statement for release,abdel rahman,june.
but a reasonable jury could have found,in light of abdel rahman role as spiritual leader of a,that his messages were ultimately intended to sway a members to end the,and by implication to commit criminal acts of violence.abdel rahman statements were therefore not an expression of opinion,but a call to arms.
the evidence establishes,moreover,more than a broadcast of abdel rahman views.abdel rahman comments were made in direct response to solicitations of his views from other a members who were seeking to effect an end to the and to resume violence.in light of the information available to abdel rahman at the time,a reasonable jury could have read his statements as tailored to and necessary for a operations and increased use of violence.viewed through this lens,abdel rahman statements were not materially different in substance from a crime boss making decisions about his criminal enterprise from prison and ordering a hit.
proof regarding knowing or intentional provision of material support.stewart and yousry argue that the prosecution did not prove the requisite mental state to sustain their convictions.they contend that they were not aware of the existence of the conspiracy charged in count two and therefore could not have intended to aid it.
these arguments are unavailing.from the evidence at trial,a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that stewart and yousry knew that an active group of people within a including,most notably,taha,sought to commit violent crimes but were hindered by the and by those members of a who sought to adhere to it that the support of abdel key leader of the critical to the continued maintenance of the and that,in light of the letters and messages from taha and sattar that yousry read to abdel rahman in prison,abdel rahman particular opinion regarding the not the view of any other be dispositive on the question of whether a members would continue to abide by the.a reasonable factfinder could thus have concluded that yousry and stewart actively and intentionally facilitated communications between abdel rahman and a,in part by engaging in various ruses during the course of their visits to abdel rahman,and thereby effectively delivered abdel rahman order to commit violence.stewart also did so by reaffirming to the press abdel rahman stated withdrawal of support for the,thereby dispelling any notion that the message came not from abdel rahman himself,but was instead fabricated by members of the faction of 
c.other challenges with respect to 
vagueness.section criminalizes the provision of material support or resources knowing or intending that they are to be used to assist in certain enumerated crimes of terrorism.a full text set forth on page,supra.stewart and yousry assert that insofar as the statute does not require conscious,knowing intent or knowledge and intent,the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.they argue that the district court should have dismissed the section charges for substantially the same reasons that it dismissed the section charges that were contained in the initial indictment.the government urges to the contrary that the text of section,which requires knowing or intending,a emphasis added,is sufficiently precise.
in analyzing the defendants arguments in this regard,we must focus on two major differences between the initial and superseding indictment.
first,the statutes upon which they were based differ.unlike section,section penalizes the knowing provision of material support alone.unlike section,section does not require for conviction proof that the defendant has provided support or resources with the knowledge or intent that such resources be used to commit specific violent crimes 
second,the factual bases for the charges differ.in the initial indictment,the government alleged that the defendants violated section by the provision of communications equipment to the conspiracy,sattar i,d at,and the provision of themselves as personnel to the conspiracy,id.at.in the superseding indictment,the government charged instead that the defendants acted with the knowledge or intent to provide material support.and rather than proceeding on the theory that the defendants provided themselves as personnel to the conspiracy,the superseding indictment alleges that the defendants provided abdel rahman as the personnel.
as we have explained,the district court dismissed the section charges on the ground that they were unconstitutional as applied to the defendants.the basis for dismissal of the communications equipment charges was that the statute,as read to apply to the facts of this case,could criminaliz e the mere use of phones and other means of communication with neither notice nor standards for the statute application.id.and the basis for the dismissal of the personnel charges,as framed in the initial indictment,was that such a charge could criminalize the actions of s omeone who advocates the cause of the foreign terrorist organization.id.at quoting humanitarian law project reno,cir,cert.denied,d brackets omitted.without more,the district court concluded,such conduct can not be punished without violating the first amendment.see id.
the initial charges raised the possibility,moreover,that under the government reading of the statute,a lawyer,acting as an agent of her client,an alleged leader of an fto,could be subject to criminal prosecution as a.id.as we shall see,the charges in the superseding indictment do not pose this risk.
a statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado,d accord united states rybicki,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.as a general matter,scienter requirements may ameliorate concerns of improper notice.see hill,at.
we are satisfied that section formulation saves the statute from being unconstitutionally vague as applied here.unlike the application of section proposed in the initial indictment,the superseding indictment required the jury to find that the defendants knew or intended the criminal uses to which the conspiracy would put the material support they provided,thereby eliminating concerns about inadequate notice.in other words,if stewart and yousry knew that their actions provided material support to a conspiracy to end the and thereby unloose deadly acts of terrorism by a and others,then they were on notice that what they were doing was prohibited by a statute that criminalizes the provision of material support knowing or intending that such support is to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out,criminal actions.
stewart and yousry argue nonetheless that several statutory terms,such as personnel,are unconstitutionally vague as applied to them.they note that personnel,undefined at the relevant time,applies equally to sections and,compare id.b with id.g they point out that the district court held this term to be unconstitutionally vague in sattar see d at.
we agree,however,with the district court conclusion that t he meaning of personnel is clear in the context of when applied to personnel who are to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out,specific crimes.sattar iii,d at.by applying,in the first indictment,the prohibition against providing personnel to the conspiracy to a circumstance in which the defendants provided themselves,the government created a situation in which the defendants could be punished for,in effect,providing themselves to speak out in support of the program or principles of a foreign terrorist organization,an activity protected by the first amendment.see sattar i,d at.the more limited charge that they knowingly or intentionally provided abdel rahman as personnel,whose voice of command or words of approbation were a means by which a members could prepare for,or carry out,terrorist acts in egypt,does not carry the same risk with its corresponding constitutional implications.
in addition,the heightened scienter requirement in section constrains prosecutorial discretion,and ameliorates concerns of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.similar scienter requirements have saved other statutes from challenges.see,hill,at.see also colautti franklin,d citing cases united states curcio,cir.
nature of the offense.stewart and yousry also contend that count four,alleging a conspiracy to violate section,acts impermissibly as a charge of a inchoate offense,a logical absurdity that violate s due process.stewart br.the gist of their argument is that the charge effectively criminalizes a conspiracy to conspire,thereby violating due process by extending criminal liability to a degree too remote from any substantive criminal offense to pass constitutional muster.id.at.we need not consider this argument count five charges the knowing provision of substantive,not inchoate,count four,pursuing a conspiracy to commit that substantive offense,functions as a traditional conspiracy charge.
as what seems to us to be a variation on the same theme,stewart and yousry assert that the district court erred by impermissibly dilut ing the proof required for conviction of the conspiracy in the context of the material support convictions under section.stewart br.but the government need not have established beyond a reasonable doubt that stewart or yousry engaged in a conspiracy to kidnap or commit murder abroad neither was charged with doing either.instead,both were charged with and convicted of violating section,and,as discussed,the evidence is sufficient to sustain the conviction on those charges.stewart and yousry do not,presumably because they can not,suggest that congress did not have the power to criminalize the relevant underlying conduct.
counts six and seven 
stewart challenges her convictions on counts six and seven for violating the blanket provisions of,which subjects to criminal sanctions 
whoever,in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states,knowingly and willfully 
falsifies,conceals,or covers up by any trick,scheme,or device a material fact 
makes any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation or 
makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or entry 
a.stewart argues that,at worst,she broke a promise,and that the statute criminalizes false statements,not false promises.
we conclude otherwise.on may,stewart signed an affirmation stating that she would shall abide by the sams.on may,stewart submitted the affirmation to the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york.on may,stewart signed a revised affirmation to the same effect and telecopied it to the same office.before,after,and between executing these affirmations,she helped smuggle messages to and from abdel rahman in violation of the sams.
stewart at least thrice affirmed under the penalties of perjury the truth of certain statements.the may,statement reads in pertinent part 
i understand that neither i nor any member of my office shall forward any mail received from inmate abdel rahman to a third person.nor shall i use my meetings,correspondence or phone calls with abdel rahman to pass messages between third parties including,but not limited to,the media and abdel rahman.
stewart may aff.gov t ex.in the may,statement,stewart affirmed 
i specifically understand that the meetings shall not be for the purpose of presenting statements to the defense team for further dissemination to third parties,including the media.i will only allow the meetings to be used for legal discussion between abdel rahman and me.
stewart may aff.gov t ex.
a reasonable factfinder was entitled to conclude that stewart affirmed under penalty of perjury that she had the intent to have her actions conform to the terms of the sams.from stewart smuggling messages to and from abdel rahman,the factfinder could conclude that the assertion about her intent was knowingly and willfully false when it was made.see united states uram,cir concluding that allegation of a false representation as to future use of loan proceeds was an allegation of a present statement and the assertion of existing intent united states shah,cir observing that a promise may amount to a false,fictitious or fraudulent statement if it is made without any present intention of performance and under circumstances such that it plainly,albeit implicitly,represents the present existence of an intent to perform.
stewart seeks support for her argument from williams united states,d.there,the supreme court reversed a conviction of the defendant under for his making of a false statement a check drawn on an account containing insufficient the purpose of influencing the actions of a federally insured institution.but central to the williams court analysis was the proposition that a check,even a bad check,is not a factual assertion at all.id.at.a check d oes not,in terms,make any representation as to the state of the drawer bank balance but serve s only to direct the drawee banks to pay the face amounts to the bearer,while committing the drawer to make good the obligations if the banks dishonor the drafts.id.at.
williams does not apply to the conduct at issue here.a reasonable jury could have concluded that stewart affirmations that she would abide by the sams amounted to factual assertions regarding her intent to abide by the sams.based on her repeated affirmations,and her repeated violations of those affirmations,moreover,a reasonable jury could have concluded that at the time stewart executed and submitted the affirmations at issue,she did not intend to abide by other words,that her representations were knowingly false when made.on this basis,a reasonable jury could have properly concluded that stewart violated section as charged in counts six and seven.
vi.general challenges to the validity of the convictions 
in addition to their challenges to specific counts in the indictment,stewart and sattar make general assertions of error regarding the government conduct during the course of the prosecution.stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted on account of her gender and political beliefs,and both stewart and sattar assert that the government decision to file a superseding indictment following their successful efforts to dismiss several counts of the initial indictment constitutes vindictive prosecution.
the defendants also raise various challenges to the district court case administration.first,they allege a variety of pretrial errors in the denial of their motions to sever their trial from sattar in the empaneling of an anonymous jury in the denial of stewart motion to suppress certain evidence obtained pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act of,stat,et fisa and in the denial of stewart motion for disclosure of whether she,her,or others were subject to surveillance by the national security agency.the defendants also argue that the district court made various evidentiary errors.finally,the defendants argue that the district court erred in addressing claims of juror misconduct.
selective prosecution 
stewart argues that she was selectively prosecuted on account of her gender and political beliefs in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.this argument requires stewart to establish that she was treated differently from other similarly situated individuals and that such differential treatment was based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure her.harlen assocs.vill.of mineola,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord united states fares,cir united states moon,cir,cert.denied,d.
stewart compares her treatment with that of abdel rahman former lawyers ramsey clark and abdeen jabara,who,even though they allegedly violated the same sams as she did,were not prosecuted for doing so.clark and jabara alleged misconduct,however,was different from stewart adjudicated misconduct in at least one crucial respect both clark and jabara refused to publicize abdel rahman withdrawal of support for the a,something stewart did at least twice.like stewart,clark spoke to the media on abdel rahman behalf.but unlike stewart,the message clark disseminated in apparent violation of the abdel rahman did not support the formation of a political party in not have the same potential for inciting violence.for that reason and those set forth by the district court in its decisions addressing the matter,see sattar v,d at denying selective prosecution claim,sattar iii,d at denying vindictive prosecution claim,and order,denying selective prosecution claim,stewart arguments in this regard are without merit 
vindictive prosecution 
sattar argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge in the superseding indictment because the institution of the charge was driven by prosecutorial vindictiveness.this argument is also without merit.
the government filed the original indictment in april.in it,sattar,stewart,yousry,and were charged with providing,attempting to provide,and conspiring to provide material support and resources to an fto in violation of.sattar moved to dismiss these charges on the ground that section was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the allegations in the indictment.by opinion and order dated july,the district court agreed with sattar.sattar i,d at.following that decision,the government filed a superseding indictment adding a new count charging sattar with conspiring to murder persons in a foreign country in violation of.
sattar argues that the government decision to file the superseding indictment and add the charge of violating section was a retaliatory act motivated by the embarrassment the government suffered as a result of the dismissal of two central counts in the original indictment.sattar br.he asserts that an inference of vindictive prosecution is supportable in two ways first,the addition of count carries a potential sentence of life imprisonment,a longer sentence than that authorized by the dismissed charge pursuant to section up ped the ante for the consequences of conviction.sattar iii,d at.second,the government could have brought the section charge in the original indictment,inasmuch as it was based on information known to the government prior to the filing of the initial indictment,but the government declined to do so.
t he decision as to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor,and a prosecutor pretrial charging decision is presumed legitimate.united states sanders,cir,cert.denied,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,a prosecution brought with vindictive motive,penalizing those who choose to exercise constitutional rights,would be patently unconstitutional.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we will dismiss an indictment if actual vindictiveness has been demonstrated,or if,under the circumstances,there is a presumption of vindictiveness that has not been rebutted by objective evidence justifying the prosecutor action.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we review a district court factual findings on prosecutorial vindictiveness for clear error,and its legal conclusions de novo.united states johnson,cir per curiam.we review a district court decision denying discovery on claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness for abuse of discretion.sanders,at.
th e need to avoid the appearance of vindictiveness has taken the form of a presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness,applied when but only when the circumstances of a case pose a realistic likelihood of such vindictiveness.united states king,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found no reason to presume that the actions at issue,which arose in a pretrial setting,were vindictive.see sattar iii,d at.
the circumstances must present a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness that would be applicable in all cases,and any such presumption may be overcome by objective evidence justifying the prosecutor action.sanders,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.t his court has consistently adhered to the principle that the presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness does not exist in a pretrial setting.paradise cci warden,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted see also sanders,at same.sattar provides no reason for us to deviate from this general rule here,and no basis upon which we can conclude that the district court findings in this respect were clearly erroneous.
sattar claim of actual,as opposed to presumptive,vindictiveness is also without merit.a finding of actual vindictiveness requires a showing that a prosecutor charging decision is a direct and unjustifiable penalty,that resulted solely from the defendant exercise of a protected legal right.sanders,at internal citation omitted.the evidence sattar offers in this regard is that the government possessed the same information when preparing the original and superseding indictments,that the maximum punishment sattar faced if convicted under the superseding indictment was greater than that he faced if convicted under the original indictment,and that the superseding indictment was the result of the district court dismissal of the section material support charges in the original indictment.we have no warrant to conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that the charging decision was not vindictive,or that the government was attempting to do anything more than hold sattar criminally responsible for engaging in the underlying acts that form the basis of the indictment.see paradise,at.put another way,it does not follow from the facts sattar recites that the resulting charge was necessarily brought vindictively for this reason the district court did not err in concluding otherwise.
trial administration 
alleged errorsa.severance 
stewart and yousry assert that the district court abused its discretion by denying their motions to sever their trial from the trial of sattar because sattar was charged with,and convicted of,conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign different from and more serious than those with which stewart and yousry were charged.to succeed on this argument,stewart and yousry must show that the district court abused its discretion in this regard and that the resulting prejudice rose to the level of a miscarriage of justice.see united states yousef,cir.stewart and yousry complain primarily that as a result of the district court denial of their motion for severance,evidence irrelevant to their actions and unfairly prejudicial to their case permeated the trial.they further contend that the volume of limiting instructions given to the jury rendered them effectively useless in attempting to curb any prejudicial effect.
but the district court did not abuse its discretion in this respect.count two charged sattar with conspiring to murder persons in a foreign country.count five charged stewart and yousry with providing and concealing material support to that conspiracy,and count four charged them with conspiring to provide and conceal that support.most of the evidence against sattar that stewart and yousry assert to have been unduly prejudicial to submitted to establish the existence of the conspiracy charge against have been admissible against stewart and yousry even had the trial been severed.see sattar i,d at.this is so because the conspiracy was an element of the crimes charged against stewart and yousry in counts four and five,and the government would have been entitled,and expected,to elicit relevant evidence regarding its existence.t he fact that testimony against a codefendant may be harmful is not a ground for severance if that testimony would also be admissible against the moving defendant tried separately.united states rosa,cir,cert.denied,d.
to the extent that evidence introduced at trial was not admissible against a particular defendant,the district court gave necessarily instructions to the jury.neither stewart nor yousry proffer instructions that should have been given,but were not.nor do they identify improper curative instructions that were given.this is not a case where the risk that the jury would not,or could not,follow instructions was so great,and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant,that the practical and human limitations of the jury system could not be ignored.bruton united states,d.despite the length of the instructions,we presume,as did the district court,see sattar v,at,that the jurors followed them,see,richardson marsh,d noting that it is an almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions united states salameh,cir,cert.denied,d juries are presumed to follow their instructions.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.neither stewart nor yousry provide us with a convincing reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in this regard.
empaneling an anonymous jury 
by order dated april,the district court granted the government motion to empanel an anonymous jury,in light of the substantial publicity surrounding the case and the seriousness and nature of the charges in the indictment,especially the charge that the defendants had attempted to interfere with the ordered procedures of law enforcement and the judicial process.order.as a general rule,a district court may order the empaneling of an anonymous jury upon a concluding that there is strong reason to believe the jury needs protection,and b taking reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure that his fundamental rights are protected.united states paccione,cir,cert.denied,d.a defendant apparent willingness to tamper with the judicial process will support the use of an anonymous panel.united states aulicino,cir internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted.where otherwise warranted,
the use of an anonymous jury does not infringe a defendant constitutional rights,so long as the court conducts a careful voir dire designed to uncover any bias as to the issues or the defendants and takes care to give the jurors a plausible and reason for not disclosing their identities.
id.if there is evidence to support the district court finding of reason to believe the jury needs protection,and if the court has taken reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure protection of his fundamental rights,the decision to empanel an anonymous jury is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.united states thai,cir,cert.denied,d.
in light of a the charges against the defendants,which included a terrorist conspiracy to murder,and stewart and yousry alleged provision of material support to that conspiracy b the reasonable likelihood that the pervasive issue of terrorism would raise in the jurors minds a fear for their individual safety c the fact that the charges against stewart and yousry were in significant part about their alleged corruption of the judicial process d the widespread pretrial publicity about the case and e the extensiveness of the voir dire administered to the jury by the court,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion.
suppression of evidence 
suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to fisa.the defendants argue that evidence obtained from electronic surveillance pursuant to fisa should have been suppressed because such surveillance was improperly instituted for the purpose of a criminal investigation,rather than for the gathering of intelligence,and because fisa was unconstitutional as applied in this case.
by opinion and order dated september,the district court denied the defendants motions to suppress the relevant evidence.sattar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.at a pretrial hearing held on april,the government informed the district court and the defendants that it had 
conducted a series of electronic surveillance over a period of several years authorized under fisa,consisting of the electronic surveillance of defendant sattar home phone,his computer,and fax machine,and defendant yousry telephone.the government also monitored several prison visits,both audio and video,to sheik abdel rahman over the past several years,one of which involved defendant stewart in may of.
id.at,dist.lexis,at.a month later,by letter dated may,the government also informed the defendants that information obtained or derived pursuant to the authority of the fisa was used,and will continue to be used,in connection with the prosecution of this case.see c providing that where the government intends to disclose information obtained from fisa surveillance,the government shall,prior to the trial notify the aggrieved person and the court that the government intends to so disclose or so use such information.
as part of its pretrial obligations under fisa,the government 
made extensive disclosures to the defendants,including over audio recordings of voice calls,sounds,and sounds obtained through audio surveillance of telephone numbers used by sattar and yousry the fbi written summaries of approximately voice calls that the fbi deemed to contain foreign intelligence information and therefore did not minimize approximately draft transcripts of voice calls and approximately pages of obtained through electronic surveillance of an account used by sattar.the government has also disclosed certain evidence solely to stewart and yousry,including audiotapes of telephone conversations between the imprisoned sheikh abdel rahman and his attorneys and yousry,and audio and video recordings of three prison visits to sheikh abdel rahman by his attorneys and yousry on february,may and,and july and.

in accordance with the procedure set forth in fisa,see e,sattar and stewart moved to suppress the evidence arising out of the fisa surveillance,and for access to classified information regarding that surveillance.the government argues on appeal,as it did before the district court,that the fisa surveillance at issue was lawfully authorized and conducted.the government moved the district court to order that none of the classified documents or classified information contained therein would need to be disclosed to the defendants.pursuant to f,the government requested that the court conduct an in camera and ex parte review of the materials and proffered an affidavit of general john ashcroft stating,in relevant part,that it would harm the national security of the united states to disclose or have an adversary hearing with respect to materials submitted to the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court in connection with this matter.sattar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
after reviewing the classified materials,the district court concluded that all of the requirements of fisa were satisfied and each of the fisa surveillances was authorized by a fisa court order that complied with the statutory requirements for such orders and was supported by the statements and certifications required by the statute.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also concluded that this was not a case where disclosure of the classified fisa materials was necessary or where a review of all of the materials suggested that due process required disclosure to the defendants.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
on appeal,stewart argues that the materials generated pursuant to the fisa surveillance should have been suppressed because the surveillance was instituted for the purposes of a criminal investigation,not for the purpose of intelligence gathering.in addition,stewart contends that the fisa review process lacks meaningful judicial review,and that due process required that her counsel have access to the fisa applications and warrants.
stewart attacks on the constitutionality of the fisa statute are foreclosed by this court decision in united states duggan,cir,which,despite its age,remains binding precedent in this circuit.there,we concluded that the procedures fashioned in fisa are a constitutionally adequate balancing of the individual fourth amendment rights against the nation need to obtain foreign intelligence information.id.at.
congress created the fisa system in an attempt to accommodate the legitimate need of government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens.united states district court,d.as we have explained,congress passed fisa to settle what it believed to be the unresolved question of the applicability of the fourth amendment warrant requirement to electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes,and to remove any doubt as to the lawfulness of such surveillance.duggan,at internal quotation marks omitted.fisa primary focus is surveillance for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information,which is defined to include information that relates to,and if concerning a united states person is necessary to,the ability of the united states to protect against inter alia international terrorism.e.
fisa established a court the fisa court comprised of designated district court judges fisa judges.the fisa court has jurisdiction over applications for electronic surveillance relating to the gathering of potential foreign intelligence information under the procedures set forth in fisa.see id.fisa generally permits a federal officer,when authorized by the president of the united states acting through the attorney general,to obtain from any fisa judge an order approving electronic surveillance of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information.id.b.a group engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor,is a foreign power,id.a,and an agent of a foreign power includes any person who knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism,or activities that are in preparation therefor,for or on behalf of a foreign power or knowingly aids or abets any person in such conduct,id.b c e.
in order to secure an order authorizing surveillance from a fisa judge,the officer application must meet the statutory requirements set forth in.for example,the application must set forth the identity or description of the target of the surveillance,id.a,and a statement of facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the officer belief that the target is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power and that each facility or location to be subjected to surveillance is being used or is about to be used by the target,id.a.prior to october,such a federal officer was required to certify to the fisa judge that the purpose of the fisa surveillance was the interception of foreign intelligence information.see id.a b.in duggan,we interpreted this provision to mean that the interception of foreign intelligence information must be the primary objective of the surveillance.duggan,at.the statute was changed in the wake of the events of september,however,to require only that a significant purpose of the surveillance be the interception of such information.see a b see also a b redesignated from a.
only after a fisa judge has been satisfied that the application meets fisa requirements will he or she authorize the surveillance.to enter an order approving surveillance,the fisa judge must find that the application was properly filed and properly authorized by the attorney general that associated procedures designed to minimize the acquisition and retention of available information concerning united states persons satisfy fisa requirements,see id.h that the facts set forth in the application provide probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign power or agent of such a power and that the locations to be subject to surveillance are being used,or are about to be used,by the target,id.a.
when the application is complete and properly certified by an executive branch official,however,
it is,under fisa,subjected to only minimal scrutiny by the courts.congress deemed it a sufficient check in this regard to require the fisa judge to find probable cause to believe that the target of the requested surveillance is an agent of a foreign power to find that the application is complete and in proper form and when the target is a united states person,to find that the certifications are not clearly erroneous.
duggan,at.stewart argument that fisa does not ensure adequate judicial view is therefore foreclosed by duggan.see id.at.
although the purpose of the surveillance must be to obtain foreign intelligence information,otherwise valid fisa surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can anticipate that the fruits of such surveillance may later be used as evidence in a criminal trial.id.at.to the contrary,the statute specifically contemplates the introduction of fisa surveillance evidence in criminal prosecutions.see b.as both congress and this court have recognized,in many cases the concerns of the government with respect to foreign intelligence will overlap those with respect to law enforcement.duggan,at.
when such fisa information is introduced in the course of a criminal prosecution,and upon review of a suppression motion,the trial court has the opportunity to review the fisa court order,issued pursuant to,in light of the underlying applications for surveillance,filed pursuant to,in order to determine whether the surveillance at issue was lawfully authorized and conducted.f.the district court review of the fisa judge decision is,like the fisa judge decision itself,deferential.a reviewing court has no greater authority to the executive branch certifications than has the fisa judge.duggan,at.
fisa applications are likely to contain allegedly sensitive information relating to perceived issues of national security.the applications are required to set forth how and why the executive branch knows what it knows,which may include references to covert agents and informers.for.this reason,ex parte,in camera determination is to be the rule.id.at quoting united states belfield.the district court has the discretion to disclose portions of relevant materials,under appropriate protective procedures,but only if it decides that such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance or is otherwise required by due process.id.quoting f.
stewart argues on appeal that the primary purpose of the fisa wiretapping in this case was to pursue a criminal investigation,not to collect foreign intelligence information.the district court,having reviewed the fisa materials,concluded that all of the surveillance at issue was conducted with the appropriate purpose,whether with a primary purpose or a significant purpose to obtain foreign intelligence information.sattar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
upon our own in camera review of the underlying material and the district court order filed under seal,we are confident that the district court did not err in so concluding.since the interceptions meet the primary purpose test,we,like the district court,need not and do not address stewart argument that fisa new and less demanding significant purpose test is unconstitutional.in re sealed case,fisa.rejecting the primary purpose test in favor of a significant purpose test.similarly,based on the relevant evidence which,as adduced at trial,is outlined above,the district court did not err in finding there to be ample probable cause to believe that the targets of the relevant,yousry,and sheikh abdel acting as agents of a foreign power as defined by fisa,a,and that each of the facilities at which the surveillance was directed was being used,or was about to be used,by that target.sattar ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
stewart also argues that she was an inappropriate target of the surveillance.as the district court noted,however,stewart was never designated as a target in any of the applications at issue her alleged were.once the proper preconditions are established with respect to a particular target,there is no requirement in fisa that all those likely to be overheard engaging in foreign intelligence conversations be named.duggan,at.because stewart were targeted pursuant to proper procedures,the fourth amendment did not require that stewart also be identified or described as a target in order for her intercepted conversations to be used in a criminal prosecution.id.at.
stewart further argues that the district court erred in declining to disclose fisa materials to her counsel.the district court may order disclosure of fisa materials under appropriate security procedures and protective orders,but only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.f.when the district court determines that the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted,it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due process requires discovery or disclosure.id.g.
as we have noted,in these circumstances disclosure is the exception and ex parte,in camera determination is the rule.duggan,at.the need to disclose materials to defense counsel may arise if the judge determines there to be potential irregularities such as possible misrepresentation of fact,vague identification of the persons to be surveilled or surveillance records which include a significant amount of nonforeign intelligence information,calling into question compliance with the minimization standards contained in the order.id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.but stewart does not point to any case where any court has ordered disclosure in a situation similar to hers.upon our own review of the materials,we conclude that there was no error in the district court determination that disclosure was unnecessary for an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance at issue or to satisfy the requirements of due process.
ii.disclosure regarding nsa surveillance.on june,stewart moved to compel disclosure as to whether she or any of her were subject to surveillance by the national security agency nsa.the government filed,ex parte,a classified response to be reviewed in camera.at a hearing on september,the government insisted that its classified submission was properly filed under section of the classified information procedures act cipa,stat.codified at app.the government also argued that none of the defense counsel was properly cleared for access to the information and that,without going into the details of the classification level of our submission,i do think any defense counsel would ever have a need to know the details of the terrorist surveillance program,especially in this case.h g tr.following the hearing and in response to subsequent orders from the district court,the government filed supplemental ex parte confidential responses dated october,october,and october,for in camera review.after additional materials were submitted by the government,the district court granted,in part,the motion for disclosure,ordering the government to make specified disclosures but otherwise denied the motion.order,at.in that public order,the district court noted that it had filed an ex parte order under seal containing classified information which explains in detail the reasons for the court decision,and found that there was a 
compelling reason for filing the additional order ex parte and under seal because it contains classified information that can not reasonably be segregated from the other material in the order,and that such a filing is consistent with the classified procedures act and the rights of the defendants.see united states yunis.
through cipa,congress established procedures for handling classified information in criminal cases.classified information is defined to include information or material that has been determined by the united states government pursuant to an executive order,statute,or regulation,to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security.app.a.cipa is meant to protect and restrict the discovery of classified information in a way that does not impair the defendant right to a fair trial.united states aref,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted,cert,d.
section of cipa establishes procedures for discovery of classified information.it provides 
the court,upon a sufficient showing,may authorize the united states to delete specified items of classified information from documents to be made available to the defendant through discovery under the federal rules of criminal procedure,to substitute a summary of the information for such classified documents,or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified information would tend to prove.the court may permit the united states to make a request for such authorization in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the court alone.if the court enters an order granting relief following such an ex parte showing,the entire text of the statement of the united states shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.
this section clarifies district courts power under federal rule of criminal procedure d to issue protective orders denying or restricting discovery for good cause,which includes information vital to the national security.aref,at internal quotation marks omitted.cipa does not itself create a government privilege against the disclosure of classified information it presupposes one.id.the most likely source for the protection of classified information lies in the privilege against disclosure of state secrets.id.
we have recently held that the privilege applies to criminal cases,but that it must give way under some circumstances to a criminal defendant right to present a meaningful defense.id.at.to determine such circumstances,we have employed the standard first articulated in roviaro united states,d,in the context of the informer privilege in criminal prosecutions,see aref,at 
first,the district court must determine whether the material in dispute is discoverable,and if so,whether the privilege applies.id.at.it applies if there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged,and the privilege is lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter,after actual personal consideration by that officer.id.at quoting united states reynolds.if the information is discoverable but the privilege applies,then the district court must determine whether the information is helpful or material to the defense,useful to counter the government case or to bolster a defense.id.citation omitted.in order to be helpful or material,the evidence need not rise to the level that would trigger the government obligation under brady maryland,d,to disclose exculpatory information.id.
we review the district court decision to issue a protective order under cipa section and federal rule of criminal procedure d for abuse of discretion.aref,at.similarly,we review for abuse of discretion the district court finding whether evidence is helpful or material to the defense.id.
at the time of the district court decision and order,our decision in aref had not yet issued.as noted in the district court public order denying the motion to compel,however,the district court relied on an opinion by a sister circuit embracing a test similar to that embraced by the aref panel.order,at citing united states yunis,
here,the government has invoked the privilege.it asserts that the details of the nsa operations,including the surveillance vel non of any particular individual or group,implicate national security and are among the nation most guarded secrets.gov t br.id.quoting halkin helms.where evidence is intercepted,the sensitive nature of the information might lie not so much in the contents of the information,as in the time,place,and nature of the government ability to intercept the information at all.yunis,at 
in light of these general concerns and the principles set forth in yunis and aref,and based on our own review of the underlying materials and the district court sealed order,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in denying stewart motion to compel disclosure.
we note,as we did in aref,which postdated the district court order here,the absence of a formal public claim of privilege lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter,after actual personal consideration by that officer.reynolds,at.see aref,at.as in aref,we conclude that in the context,such a flaw is not necessarily fatal,and that i t would be of little or no benefit for us to remand for the purpose of having the department head agree that disclosure of the classified information would pose a risk to national security here.aref,at.but the absence of the formal claim is not a trivial matter.we do not demean it.we expect that,in light of the holding in aref,we will not need to address this issue in appeals from future prosecutions in which the privilege is invoked as the government is now of this obligation.id.based on our holding today we trust that this issue will not arise in future cipa cases.
we reject stewart claim that the district court erred in reviewing materials ex parte and in camera.as we noted in aref,b oth cipa section and rule d authorize ex parte submissions when the government is seeking to withhold classified information from the defendant,an adversary hearing with defense knowledge would defeat the very purpose of the discovery rules.aref,at.
the cipa procedures followed by the district court place all parties involved except perhaps the government at a substantial disadvantage defendants are hampered in contesting the assertions that are being made to the court by the government district courts and courts of appeals are deprived of the opportunity for an adversarial proceeding upon which they are typically dependent in attempting fairly and properly to resolve disputes and the public,as well as the litigants,are deprived of the assurances that come with public scrutiny of the work of the courts.the procedures are also,of course,subject to abuse by the executive.but a method for protection of classified material is necessary,and these procedures have been established by congress and held to be constitutional.we,as did the district court,therefore accept them as a necessary,if imperfect,accommodation of the varied interests implicated.
alleged trial errors.both sattar and yousry challenge various evidentiary rulings made by the district court.sattar argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting a book by taha and a videotape of taha,osama bin laden,and other a members encouraging violence,and by excluding news footage purporting to depict israeli violence against palestinian demonstrators.in addition,yousry challenges the exclusion of several statements he made to fbi agents.
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see united states kelley,cir per curiam united states anglin,cir.here,the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to any such rulings.
we are guided by certain basic principles established by the federal rules of,as a general rule,a ll relevant evidence is admissible,but that even relevant evidence,although admissible,may be excluded by the district court if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.a district court is obviously in the best position to do the balancing mandated by rule.salameh,at.we will a district court only if there is a clear showing that the court abused its discretion or acted arbitrarily or irrationally.id.internal quotation marks omitted accord united states szur,cir.
taha book was relevant and admissible as evidence of the existence of the conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign country.the bin laden video was similarly admissible,and relevant to taha intent to murder or kidnap.the district court did not err in failing to find that the evidence was unduly prejudicial.
it was also within the district court discretion to exclude both the news video,which it found to be of minimal relevance yet highly prejudicial and confusing,and yousry statements to the fbi,which it found to be essentially duplicative of yousry own testimony.
the district court made a conscientious assessment of whether unfair prejudice substantially outweigh ed probative value,salameh,at internal quotation marks omitted,and did not otherwise abuse its discretion in making this assessment.we therefore will not disturb its judgments on these grounds.
allegations of juror misconduct.it was brought to the district court attention after the jury rendered its verdict that a juror,referred to by the parties as juror,had come forward with allegations concerning improprieties during the jury deliberations.the defendants requested that the district court follow up and conduct an inquiry into these allegations.sattar iv,d at.by written opinion,the district court denied the request.id.sattar argues on appeal that the district court actions were an abuse of its discretion,insisting that the court should have met,with juror to conduct an inquiry.we disagree.
the district court properly construed the request as one for an evidentiary hearing,and concluded that there was no clear,strong,substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,impropriety has occurred,united states ianniello,cir,especially in light of the fact that the juror had several opportunities to communicate directly with the court regarding any potential improprieties,but failed to do so,jacobson henderson,cir.as the district court explained,the fact that juror had direct access to the court and did not complain of any problems supports the conclusion that these allegations are post hoc efforts caused by dissatisfaction that do not require further inquiry.sattar iv,d at.we agree.
cumulative error doctrine.yousry also argues on appeal that we should reverse under the cumulative error doctrine.but the defendants have not identified any error in the district court rulings,and the accumulation of does not warrant a new trial.united states lumpkin,cir.
vii.propriety of the sentences 
the government appeals from the sentences imposed on the defendants,asserting that they are unreasonable and unduly lenient.the government principal brief was submitted prior to the supreme court decisions in gall united states,d,and kimbrough united states,d,which,as recognized by this circuit in its en banc decision in united states cavera,cir,have significantly altered the landscape of sentencing jurisprudence.the supreme court issued both gall and kimbrough before the government filed its reply brief and oral argument took place,but not before this circuit had spoken in cavera 
standard of review 
the principles that guide our review of the district court sentences are,at first glance,beguilingly simple.cavera,at.generally,we review for abuse of discretion.id.at.that deferential scrutiny encompasses two components procedural review and substantive review.id.
procedural review.we first determine whether the sentence was procedurally reasonable.see id.ordinarily,the district court must first correctly calculate the appropriate range set forth by the united states sentencing guidelines.id.at.then it must form its own view of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,id.at,as mandated and guided by a in this context,we review factual findings for clear error and the court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states jeffers,cir see also gall.at stating that a court procedurally errs when it select s a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.in imposing the chosen sentence,the court must adequately explain that sentence,including any deviation from the guidelines range.cavera,at.
district courts are generally free to impose sentences outside the recommended guidelines range but must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,a district court must satisfy us that it has considered the parties arguments and that it has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority.id.at quoting rita united states,d brackets in cavera.when a court commits significant procedural error,we may remand to the district court so that it can either explain what it was trying to do,or correct its mistake and exercise its discretion anew rather than proceed ing to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
substantive review.once we are satisfied that a sentence was procedurally proper,we then review the district court determination for substantive reasonableness,tak ing into account the totality of the circumstances,giving due deference to the sentencing judge exercise of discretion,and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.id.at.our role is no more than to patrol the boundaries of reasonableness.id.at.indeed,we must defer heavily to the expertise of district judges,id.at,and will set aside a district court substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
we do not presume that a sentence is unreasonable,nor do we require extraordinary circumstances to justify a deviation from the guidelines range.id.at quoting gall.at.in evaluating a sentence substantive reasonableness,we may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the guidelines.id.we may consider whether the factor,as explained by the district court,can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in the case.id.at.a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.gall.at.but we must not employ a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.cavera,at internal quotation marks omitted.
some decisions by the district court may be entitled to more deference than others.for example,as both the supreme court and we have noted,variations from the guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply.kimbrough.at internal quotation marks omitted accord cavera,at.when,on the other hand,the variation is based on a general disagreement with the guidelines applicability in a case,then closer review may be in order.kimbrough.at.
but such closer review is less appropriate where the guideline in question is not based on empirical data and national history.the issuance of that sort of guideline do es not exemplify the commission exercise of its characteristic institutional role.id.a categorical disagreement with and variance from such a guideline,or,at least from the crack cocaine guidelines,is not suspect.spears united states,d per curiam.
the supreme court has yet to address fully the contours of the respect that should be afforded to an inside the heartland departure,from guidelines created by the commission pursuant to its characteristic institutional role.such a departure would necessarily be based on a policy disagreement with the guidelines and would necessarily disagree with the guidelines on a categorical basis.id.we have recognized,however,that some guidelines enhancements and reductions apply without modulation to a wide range of conduct.cavera,at.thus,a district court may find that even after giving weight to the factors that drive the enhancement or reduction there is still a wide variety of culpability amongst defendants and,as a result,impose different sentences based on the factors identified in a.id.of course,irrespective of whether the conduct is found to be inside or outside the heartland,the district court must explain its reasons for its chosen sentence.id 
affording greater discretion to the district courts may result in greater apparent disparities in sentences.but the supreme court has made clear its view that disparities in sentences imposed by different district judges are more likely to reflect justified differences than are those arising from differences of opinion among appellate panels.cavera,at.
application to this case 
the government principal claim of error on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion by imposing unreasonably lenient sentences.the government also argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply the guidelines terrorism adjustment,to yousry offense level.
yousry sentence.the district court initially calculated yousry guidelines range based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i,for a range of to months.according to the government,yousry applicable guidelines range should have been enhanced in accordance with the terrorism enhancement provided by the guidelines.the district court concluded to the contrary that the terrorism enhancement did not apply to yousry because he did not act with the requisite state of mind.based on the district court findings,we agree with its conclusion.
upon consideration of the various factors set forth in section a,the district court concluded that a significant downward was appropriate,and ultimately sentenced yousry to a sentence of months of imprisonment,followed by years of supervised release.
guidelines calculations 
we review the district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo,and the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states legros,cir.we interpret the guidelines as though they were a statute,giving the words used their common meaning.united states kirvan,cir.section,the terrorism enhancement,provides 
a if the offense is a felony that involved,or was intended to promote,a federal crime of terrorism,increase by levels but if the resulting offense level is less than level,increase to level.
b in each such case,the defendant criminal history shall be category vi.
the application notes incorporate g by reference.see id.cmt.that section defines a federal crime of terrorism as 
an offense that 
a is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct and 
b is a violation of any one of many statutes,including,relating to the provision of material support to terrorists,and a,relating to conspiracies to murder persons abroad.
g.the conventional meaning of calculated is devised with forethought.ii oxford english dictionary ed.therefore,if a defendant purpose in committing an offense is to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct,the first requirement of section g a is satisfied.if,however,there is no evidence that the defendant sought to influence or affect the conduct of the government,the crime is not a federal crime of terrorism.see united states leahy,cir.
the enhancement is not limited,however,to offenses that are themselves federal crimes of terrorism.by including the intended to promote language,the drafters of the guideline unambiguously cast a broader net.united states mandhai,cir,cert.denied,d.the criminal conduct at issue need not itself meet the statutory definition of a federal crime of terrorism if a goal or purpose of the defendant act was to bring or help bring into being a crime listed in g b.id.at accord united states arnaout,cir.
the district court declined to apply the terrorism enhancement to yousry sentence.the court explained 
this is a motivational requirement and focuses on the defendant purpose.the government has conceded the lack of motivation or purpose and has failed to show that the defendant offenses were calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion or to retaliate against government action.
sent g tr.see g a defining federal crime of terrorism.the government does not challenge this finding,which we conclude to be consistent with the record and not clearly erroneous.
nonetheless,the government argues that the enhancement is appropriate despite the fact that yousry has committed neither a federal crime of terrorism nor any other crime with the intent to promote such a crime.according to the government,the enhancement applies because yousry offense was a felony that involved a federal crime of terrorism.emphasis added.but under the involved prong of section,the enhancement would be applicable to yousry only if he himself had committed a federal crime of terrorism.see arnaout,at the ordinary and plain meaning of involved means to include.united states graham,cir,cert.denied,d w e believe that in the context at hand,the word involved signifies that a defendant offense included a federal crime of terrorism in other words,that a defendant committed,attempted,or conspired to commit a federal crime of terrorism as defined in g.and,as the fourth circuit has recognized,commission of a federal crime of terrorism,which would trigger the involved prong of the enhancement,incorporates a specific intent requirement,namely,that the underlying felony was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct.g.united states chandia,cir.so the problem for the government remains there is no evidence that yousry himself sought to influence or affect the conduct of a government.the enhancement therefore does not apply under the involved prong.see leahy,at.
the government maintains that any motivational requirement imposed by the terrorism enhancement can be imputed to yousry from his relevant conduct under section a of the guidelines.it provides,in relevant part 
a djustments in chapter three including the terrorism enhancement shall be determined on the basis of the following 
a all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant and 
b in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity a criminal plan,scheme,endeavor,or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others,whether or not charged as a conspiracy,all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,in preparation for that offense,or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense 
a.the government asserts that it was reasonably foreseeable to yousry that his were acting in a manner calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government,so that the requirement of section g a is satisfied as to him.
but sections a a and b apply to acts and omissions,while,as noted above,section g a describes a motivational requirement,a specific intent.chandia,at.we can not conflate yousry acts with his mental states.as one member of this court has pointed out,we have never regarded mens rea as an act of the defendant for purposes of the relevant conduct guideline,nor should we.united states mchugh,cir newman,concurring.section a a permits selection of an enhanced guideline for acts committed by the defendant the natural meaning of act connotes conduct,and the meaning of the guideline should not be strained to include state of mind.id.here,too,the terrorism enhancement motivational requirement,as incorporated by reference to section g a,is not an act or omission under section a b.the enhancement is therefore not applicable.
we have examined the other arguments made by the government in support of its expansive reading of the involved prong of the terrorism enhancement and we find them to be similarly without merit.
section a factors 
we conclude,then,that the district court properly calculated yousry guidelines range to be to months.we must therefore determine in light of that range and the totality of the circumstances whether yousry sentence of months of imprisonment,imposed following the district court section a inquiry,was substantively unreasonable.
we need not outline again the nature of the crimes of which yousry was convicted.we focus instead on the reasons given by the district court in support of its downward variance.
first,the court found that yousry conduct was unusual and f e ll outside the heartland of material support for terrorist activity.sent g tr.a district court decision to vary from the guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply.cavera,at quoting kimbrough.at.we perceive no basis for concluding that the district court erred in deciding that to be the case with respect to yousry,particularly because he was acting as a translator,not a lawyer or other professional.
second,the district court found that no actual harm to victims occurred although the court was well aware that such harm is not required and that if such harm occurred the guideline range would be higher.sent g tr.we conclude that it was not unreasonable for the district judge to decide that the fact that no injury occurred in the case mitigated the gravity of yousry offense the criminal law often punishes the substantive commission of a crime more severely than an attempt to commit the same crime,even when that which separates an attempt from the substantive commission of an offense is not culpability but fortuity.fortuitous events are not categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.as the supreme court has recently noted,although i t is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental conduct,it is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful acts.see,dean united states,d id.at concluding that a defendant who carried a firearm during and in relation to a bank robbery in violation of c a is subject to a year mandatory minimum pursuant to c a iii because his firearm was discharged in the course of the robbery,even though the gun went off accidentally,was not pointed at anyone when it discharged,and nobody was hurt.
third,the court noted that although yousry offenses were plainly serious,his role in the offenses was subservient to the others involved in the conspiracy.sent g tr.the guidelines were intended to eliminate national disparity,but w e do not,as a general matter,object to district courts consideration of similarities and differences among when imposing a sentence.united states wills,cir emphasis omitted,abrogated on other grounds by kimbrough.at,as recognized in cavera,at accord united states williams,cir.we also defer to the district court conclusion that yousry conduct was less culpable than that of his.on this basis,we conclude that the district court did not err by giving weight to this factor.
fourth,the district court found that yousry did not engage in the offenses for profit and did not support or believe in the use of violence to achieve what he wanted.sent g tr.these facts mitigate the gravity of the conduct at issue.they also affect consideration of the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and to afford adequate deterrence.a.the court concluded that a substantial downward variance was thus justified on the grounds that a lesser degree of punishment than otherwise called for would be sufficient for purposes of deterrence and the protection of the public.as the gall court noted,a district court is to make determinations about the character of the defendant and whether,given such a character,the defendant is more or less likely to return to criminal behavior or constitute a danger to society.gall.at.
the district court did not err in finding that yousry was not motivated by potential profit and did not believe in the use of violence.nor did it err in considering these factors while fashioning a sentence for him.in evaluating culpability,we can not discount the relevance of the defendant,whether mercenary,see,murder for hire,or born from a commitment to the use of violence.the district court acted well within its discretion in deciding that yousry was both less dangerous and more easily deterred than had he been acting on a basis or committed to the use of violence for political ends.
fifth,the district court found that yousry conviction made it doubtful that the defendant could pursue his career as an academic or translator,and therefore that the need for further deterrence and protection of the public is lessened because the conviction itself already visits substantial punishment on the defendant.sent g tr.the district court is specifically required by section a to consider the just punishment for the offense.a a.it is difficult to see how a court can properly calibrate a just punishment if it does not consider the collateral effects of a particular sentence.upon careful review of the record and the reasons given by the court,we are convinced that the court did so appropriately.
sixth,the district court found that yousry provided extensive cooperation to the government following the terrorist attacks of september.sent g tr.the court concluded that this cooperation demonstrates a willingness to help law enforcement and reduces the need for rehabilitation and deterrence.id.we defer to the district court evaluation of the extent of yousry cooperation.and of course,use of a defendant cooperation to justify significant variances or departures from the otherwise applicable guidelines calculations is commonplace.the government argues that yousry assistance was not as extensive as the district court found it to be,but we have been given no cause to question the court relevant findings of fact or the manner in which it accounted for them in sentencing.
seventh,the court found that yousry will not be in a situation to commit the offenses of conviction again,because it is unlikely that he will ever be able to serve as an interpreter in an official capacity.id.we defer to this finding,too.it is not error for a district court to evaluate,based on the defendant individual circumstances,the extent of punishment necessary to deter him from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts.gall.at see a b c.
the district court did not,of course,assign precise weights to particular factors.doing so would presuppose the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications,and would constitute a species of mathematical approach which has been expressly disavowed by the supreme court as a classic example of attempting to measure an inventory of apples by counting oranges.gall.at.
in evaluating the ultimate substantive reasonableness of yousry sentence,we must determine,under the totality of the circumstances,whether these various factors can bear the weight assigned to them by the district court.we are satisfied that they can.we are equally satisfied that the district court consider ed the extent of the deviation and ensure d that the justification was sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variance.id.at.
in conducting our review,we are further satisfied that the district court did not ignore the guidelines or treat them merely as a body of casual advice.cavera,at internal quotation marks omitted.even were we inclined to think that the district court did not appreciate the weight of the,as we say,we are light of all of the foregoing,including the court and intimate involvement with these proceedings,any such conclusion would be purely a matter of surmise on our part.see rita,at.noting that the sentencing judge had greater familiarity with the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the commission or the appeals court see also gall.at.the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing yousry.
sattar sentence.the district court calculated sattar total offense level to be and his criminal history category to be vi,for a guidelines range of life imprisonment.but in conducting its own independent review,as guided by section a,the district court concluded that such a sentence would be seriously disproportionate to the offense.sent g tr.the court imposed a sentence of years months of imprisonment,to be followed by five years of supervised release.
guidelines calculation 
the district court calculated sattar sentence,as it did yousry,under the november guidelines.the court ultimately adopted the recommendations of the probation department in making its guidelines calculation,except insofar as the district court added enhancements based on sattar obstruction of justice.
enhancements.sattar guidelines range of life imprisonment was arrived at based in part on the sentencing court determination that the terrorism enhancement applied to both sattar and conduct.the district court also enhanced sattar sentence on the ground that he obstructed justice.see.
ii.departures.sattar moved for a downward departure based on the conditions of his confinement.the district court recognized that it was able to depart under the guidelines for severe conditions of detention,but because thus far th ose conditions reflect only strict security measures rather than an abuse of those measures,it declined to do so.sent g tr.instead,the court concluded that it would take sattar conditions of confinement into account in considering the section a factors.
section a factors 
the district court began its section a analysis with a correct calculation of the applicable guidelines range life imprisonment.the court then imposed the sentence of years imprisonment,for which it gave three principal reasons.
first,the court concluded that the terrorism enhancement overstated the seriousness of sattar crime by.transforming a guidelines range of to months to life imprisonment.the court found that the guideline range was relatively low because sattar was convicted of conspiracy to murder and not of murder itself,and that the terrorism enhancement failed to account for the fact that no injury actually occurred in this case.sent g tr.the district court noted that a variance downward from a guidelines range driven upward by the enhancement is permissible when the enhancement prevents the penalty from fitting the crime,based on the facts of th e record.id.at citing mandhai,at.
second,the terrorism enhancement put sattar in the highest criminal history category,vi,without a single past criminal history point.id.at.the district court concluded that such a jump overstates sattar past conduct and the likelihood that the defendant after a substantial period of incarceration would commit further crimes.id.
third,the court noted that sattar had been under extremely restrictive conditions of confinement for years,and there is every reason to expect that his conditions of confinement will continue to be substantially more severe than the average prisoner.id.at.these conditions include being kept in a cell for hours a day and under constant surveillance.as a result,the court concluded,the punitive aspects of the defendant confinement are increased and the deterrent effect of the defendant confinement is also increased.id.
the court further noted that,for reasons explained in part under seal,a downward variance is warranted based on factors relevant to the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need to afford adequate deterrence the district court observed that based on the totality of the circumstances and on its review of cases presented by the government as comparators,sattar sentence of years incarceration does not promote unwarranted sentencing disparities.
the government principal argument on is that sattar sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his conduct and dedication to violence.gov t reply br.we have no quarrel with the government as to the nature and quality of sattar conduct.neither,to any significant extent,did the district court.it considered,at length,the seriousness of sattar crimes.
a sentence outside the guidelines carries no presumption of unreasonableness.irizarry united states,d.t he guidelines are only one of the factors to consider when imposing sentence gall.at.taking those precepts as a starting point,we are satisfied that in fashioning a sentence,the district court did not clearly err in according weight to the factors it identified.as we recently noted in cavera,at the procedural part of review,we will not categorically proscribe any factor concerning the background,character,and conduct of the defendant,with the exception of invidious factors.cavera,at.the object is always to fashion a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in a.and it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that a criminal history category of vi significantly overstated sattar criminal history and likelihood of committing further offenses.
we have recognized that the sentencing commission had a rational basis for creating a uniform criminal history category for all terrorists under b,because even terrorists with no prior criminal behavior are unique among criminals in the likelihood of recidivism,the difficulty of rehabilitation,and the need for incapacitation.united states meskini,cir,cert.denied,d.but in the same virtual breath,we said,a judge determining that b the seriousness of the defendant past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes always has the discretion under to depart downward in sentencing.id.
and even with enhancements of,those that sharply increase the recommended sentences there still may be a wide variety of culpability amongst defendants.cavera,at.there may therefore be different sentences based on the factors identified in a.id.sattar crimes are indeed grave he may well be the most culpable of these defendants.but the district court has a responsibility,inter alia,to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,a.perhaps all who merit this enhancement are culpable and some among them are more culpable,more dangerous,with crimes more serious,than others.it is the district court that is primarily charged with the responsibility for making such distinctions.
the district court is also in the best position to make an individual determination about the history and characteristics of a particular defendant,and to adjust the individualized sentence accordingly.see a permitting downward departure where the court concludes that a defendant criminal history category significantly the seriousness of a defendant criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes.upon examining the reasons the district court gave,we have no reason not to defer to its assessment here.
it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the severity of the conditions of confinement would increase the severity of the punishment and the amount of deterrence associated with a given term of imprisonment in light of the particular conditions of confinement under which sattar is incarcerated.the district court did not abuse its discretion in varying downward based on those conditions here.we think that the factors upon which the district court relied in determining sattar appropriate sentence can bear the weight the district court assigned to them.cavera,at.
we note,finally,that the court sentenced sattar to more than twice what the maximum guideline sentence would have been without the terrorism enhancement.
the sentence thus adequately reflected the severity of the crime.
stewart sentence.before sentencing stewart,the district court calculated her offense level under the november guidelines to be,her criminal history category to be vi,and her guidelines range to be months,or years,the statutory maximum.the court concluded,however,that a sentence of months imprisonment was sufficient but no greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in a.
guidelines calculations 
enhancements.over stewart objection,the district court concluded that the terrorism enhancement of section applied because she had committed a federal crime of terrorism.the enhancement was triggered in part by the district court finding that stewart actions were calculated to affect the conduct of the egyptian government through intimidation and coercion.sent g tr.the district court noted that stewart conduct can not be found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement,but stated that it nonetheless would take all of the defendant arguments as to why the enhancement did not properly apply to her conduct into account in performing the analysis under section a.id.
the district court noted that the terrorism enhancement automatically placed stewart in criminal history category vi.the court appeared to accept stewart argument that the enhancement overstated the seriousness of her past conduct or the likelihood that she would commit further crimes.instead of adjusting the criminal history in the context of the guidelines calculations themselves,however,the court found this to be one of the rare cases under united states crosby,cir,where it would be more appropriate to determine the extent of the downward adjustment in the context of the section a analysis.sent g tr.
the government also sought an enhancement of stewart sentence on the ground that she obstructed justice.the guidelines provide that where a defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice with respect to the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction and where the obstructive conduct related to the offense of conviction or a closely related offense,that the applicable guidelines should be enhanced by levels.the government argued that stewart committed perjury by testifying that she understood that there was a bubble built into the sams whereby the attorneys could issue press releases containing abdel rahman statements as part of their representation of him and testifying about her purported lack of knowledge of taha.sent g tr.as we have noted,taha was a follower of abdel rahman and a military leader in a who claimed responsibility for the november massacre at luxor,and was allegedly part of the conspiracy.the district court noted that there was evidence to indicate that stewart statements were false statements.id.it concluded,however,that it was unnecessary to reach the question whether the defendant knowingly gave false testimony with the intent to obstruct the proceedings for two reasons first,the guidelines calculation already provided for the statutory maximum permitted by the statutes of conviction,and second,a sentence was,in the estimation of the court,reasonable and most consistent with the factors set forth in section a.id.at.
ii.departures.stewart sought a downward departure pursuant to section of the guidelines,which provides that while p hysical condition is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range,nonetheless an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.stewart proffered substantial documentation of serious illness.as with stewart criminal history calculations,the district court concluded that it did not have to reach the question of whether stewart medical condition,given her age and continuing treatment,is sufficient in itself to warrant a departure from the guidelines,because it would take that condition into account in making its determination under section a.sent g tr.
the district court declined to adjust the guidelines calculations based on stewart argument that she committed her crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm as set forth in lesser harms policy statement of the guidelines.see.stewart argued before the district court that her conduct was the product of her perception that her client health and were seriously jeopardized by his continued imprisonment in the united states.stewart sent g br.under the policy statement,where a defendant commit s a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm,a reduced sentence may be appropriate,provided that the circumstances significantly diminish society interest in punishing the conduct,for example,in the case of a mercy killing.however,w here the interest in punishment or deterrence is not reduced,a reduction in sentence is not warranted.id.here,the district court found this case not to be one where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.
the policy statement further provides that a reduction in the otherwise applicable sentence might be appropriate where conduct may not cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law proscribing the offense at issue such as where a war veteran possessed a machine gun or grenade as a trophy,or a school teacher possessed controlled substances for display in a drug education program.but the court declined to conclude that stewart conduct did not cause or threaten the harm sought to be prevented by the statutes that stewart violated.
stewart also moved for a departure on the ground that her conduct was aberrational.a guidelines policy statement provides that a sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted in an extraordinary case if the defendant criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.but the court,noting that stewart conduct was committed over an extended period of time,involv ing repeated acts of deception,and significant planning,sent g tr,concluded that such a departure would be inappropriate,and declined to grant it.
the district court thus reached its final guidelines calculation,using the november guidelines,with a total offense level of,a criminal history category of vi,and therefore a guidelines range of months,the statutory maximum.the government sought a term of life imprisonment stewart sought a sentence.
section a factors 
based on its section a analysis,the district court sentence substantially varied from the applicable guidelines range.
as the starting point for its section a analysis,the court addressed the applicability of the terrorism enhancement,which while correct under the guidelines,would result in an unreasonable result and produce a guideline range about quadruple the range that would otherwise apply without the enhancement.sent g tr.the district court then observed 
first,that stewart was an atypical case for the terrorism enhancement inasmuch as the thrust of the violation was the provision of a to a terrorist conspiracy,id.at second,as with sattar,that the structure of the terrorism enhancement prevented the guidelines from taking into account the fact that no victim was harmed as a result of the offense as charged and third,again as with sattar,that the enhancement operated to prevent the guidelines from taking into account stewart actual criminal history.by virtue of the terrorism enhancement,stewart was automatically classified as within criminal history category vi,the highest possible category,whereas if her sentence were based on her actual criminal history,she would have been classified in category i,the lowest possible category.
the court therefore concluded that the terrorism enhancement was dramatically unreasonable and overstates the seriousness of her past conduct and the likelihood that she will repeat the offense.id.stewart has no criminal history and yet is placed in the highest criminal history category equal to that of repeat felony offenders for the most serious offenses including murder and drug trafficking.id.at.the criminal history category was inappropriate,the court determined,in light of the likelihood of recidivism,the difficulty of rehabilitation and the need for incapacitation.id.at.
the court found that stewart opportunity to repeat the crimes to which she had been convicted will be nil because she will lose her license to practice law and will be forever separated from any contact with sheikh omar abdel rahman.id.loss of her license to practice law both removes the occasion for her offenses and is itself a punishment.id.at.
the district court viewed stewart personal characteristics as extraordinary and thought they argue d strongly in favor of a substantial downward variance.id.at.the court described her as a dedicated public servant who had,throughout her career,represented the poor,the disadvantaged and the unpopular,often as a attorney,thereby providing a service not only to her clients but to the nation.id.at.and h aving spent her professional career often representing the poor,she is now,at the end of her career,financially destitute.id.at.
the court also took into account stewart ill had,for example,suffered from cancer,for which she had undergone surgery and radiation therapy,and for which there is a significant chance of recurrence.the district court was of the view that in light of those conditions and her age,years old at the time,prison would be particularly difficult for her,and that at her age,moreover,her sentence would represent a greater portion of her remaining life than for a younger defendant and provide increased punishment.id.at.
i.the scope of review.the government principal argument on appeal is that in light of the crimes of which stewart stands convicted,her sentence was substantively unreasonable.section a instructs that the sentence must reflect the seriousness of the offense,promote respect for the law,and provide just punishment for the offense and afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.a a b.our review for substantive reasonableness is a particularly deferential form of review.cavera,at citing gall.at.but our review must also be meaningful.gall.at gerard lynch,letting guidelines be guidelines and judges be judges,ohio.amici views from the field,at http w e should let appellate judges be judges,performing their traditional function of reining in excess and gradually developing a common law of what is and is not sensible.emphasis deleted.
like the district court,we are impressed by the factors that figured in stewart modest her admirable history of providing,at no little personal cost to herself,proficient legal services in difficult cases to those who could not otherwise afford them.we think it noteworthy,moreover,that the last of the acts for which stewart is being punished occurred a short time before the september attacks on the united states.that carnage might have raised in her,as it surely has in many or most of us,a heightened awareness of and sensitivity to the imminent dangers of terrorism and the possible scope of the deadly capabilities of the terrorists with whom she was dealing.
we also recognize,as did the district court,that the terrorism enhancement may apply to persons who are culpable in substantially different degrees that stewart culpability may well be understood to be less than sattar and that the district court may differentiate between different levels of culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial enhancement.yet stewart sentence is strikingly low in light of what the district court correctly described as the irreducible core of her extraordinarily severe criminal conduct,sent g tr,which was committed over an extended period of time,involved repeated acts of deception,and involve d significant planning,id.at.
we are obliged to patrol the boundaries of the reasonableness of a sentence.cavera,at.while we will not lightly deem unreasonable a sentence imposed by the judge who has access to,and greater familiarity with,the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the sentencing commission or the appeals court,rita,at,we think that in light of the fact stewart used her privileged status as a lawyer to facilitate her serious violation of the law,and possibly committed perjury at trial in an attempt to avoid punishment for her conduct,her sentence at least tests those boundaries.
ii.stewart abuse of her status as a member of the bar.stewart argues that she did no more than serve as a zealous advocate for her client.that belief,if indeed she harbored it,gave her no license to violate the law.stewart actions tended ultimately and ironically to subvert the same fundamental right of which she took constitutional right to making it less likely that other incarcerated persons will have the same level of access to counsel that her client was given.
the district court seemed to appreciate that fact,noting that stewart abused her position as a lawyer in committing her crimes.sent g tr.the court did not,however,explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected the seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact that stewart was engaged as a member of the bar when she committed them.
the question therefore remains whether,because she was an experienced and dedicated lawyer acting as such when she broke the law in the manner that she did,her punishment should have been greater than it was 
iii.a comparison of yousry and stewart sentences.a comparison of stewart and yousry offense conduct serves to highlight the seriousness of stewart crimes and the seemingly modest sentence she received for it.unlike yousry,stewart publicly disseminated potentially lethal statements on abdel rahman behalf.unlike yousry,stewart was convicted of making false statements to the government when she agreed to abide by the terms of the sams.unlike yousry,stewart was a member of the bar and therefore acting as an officer of the court.see,united states seltzer,cir.she was legally knowledgeable,highly experienced,and politically sophisticated,a lawyer acting in her professional capacity he was a student working for her and abdel rahman as a translator.
yet yousry sentence was months stewart only eight months longer.
iv.stewart alleged perjury.also unlike yousry,stewart may well have obstructed justice at trial.the government,supported by substantial evidence,argued that stewart committed perjury at trial.the district court summarized the argument as follows 
first,the government contends that stewart knowingly gave false testimony when she testified that she understood that there was a bubble built into the sams whereby the attorneys could issue press releases containing abdel rahman statements as part of their representation of him.
the government also contends that stewart testified falsely when she denied knowing who taha was until learning about him in the course of the trial except for an article that she came across in her representation of yasir ahmed.
sent g tr.the court,having thus recited the allegations at sentencing,declined to decide the issue.
as noted,the district court gave two reasons for not making such a finding.first,it concluded that because stewart guidelines calculations had reached the statutory maximum of months,a finding of obstruction of justice would not have changed the calculation.this would be true if the terrorism enhancement had been applied in stewart case,but the district court,after determining that stewart conduct was in the enhancement heartland,may not have applied it.see infra.and even were it true,the question of stewart perjury is nonetheless relevant to her sentence pursuant to section.section a requires the district court to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to,among other things,promote respect for the law.see a.whether stewart lied to the jury under oath or upon affirmation at her trial is relevant to whether her sentence was sufficient under the circumstances.
the district court second reason for declining to determine whether stewart committed perjury during the course of her testimony was that it had determined that a sentence was reasonable and most consistent with the factors set forth in section a.sent g tr.but as noted,we think that whether stewart lied under oath at her trial is directly relevant to whether her sentence was appropriate in light of section a.her willingness as a lawyer knowingly and falsely to affirm her intention to obey the sams and then to seek to cover up this knowing violation of the law with perjurious testimony might well,if proven,influence our conclusion as to the propriety of her sentence.any or attempt to evade responsibility by a failure to tell the truth upon oath or affirmation at her trial would compound the gravity of her crime.
we conclude that by declining to decide whether stewart committed perjury or otherwise obstructed justice,the district court procedurally erred.
effect of lack of harm.noting particularly that the absence of harm was fortuitous and not the result of efforts by stewart to prevent harm,judge walker argues that it was error both procedural and substantive for the district court to use that factor as a basis for downward variance,especially such a large one.the issue is discussed also in judge calabresi opinion.this court makes no ruling on that issue now,in the circumstances of stewart case.we note simply that it is a serious issue to be given consideration by the district court upon reevaluating stewart sentence.in view of the fact that the court must resentence,we think it preferable to defer this issue until after it has been reconsidered by the court,upon its consideration of the commentary in the opinions of judges walker and calabresi.
vi.the terrorism enhancement.the terrorism enhancement is set forth in section of the guidelines.
a if the offense is a felony that involved,or was intended to promote,a federal crime of terrorism,increase by levels but if the resulting offense level is less than level,increase to level.
b in each such case,the defendant criminal history category from chapter four criminal history and criminal livelihood shall be category vi.
whether or not the district court applied the terrorism enhancement to stewart in its guidelines calculation may be subject to disagreement.without reaching that issue,we nonetheless note that in light of the facts of this case and the judgments of conviction,which we affirm,the terrorism enhancement plainly applies as a matter of law to the district court calculation of the applicable guidelines range,irrespective of whether stewart behavior was atypical and whether it resulted in death or injury factors that may or may not be employed in rendering the ultimate sentence.
whether or not the district court gave appropriate consideration in its section a analysis to whether support of terrorism is an aggravating factor in this case,similarly,may be subject to disagreement.judge walker argues that the district court sentence was deficient in this respect,and constituted both procedural and substantive error.but we need not decide whether error in this respect,if any,would be procedural or substantive.without reaching these issues,and without suggesting that the district court was bound to follow either the guidelines generally or any guidelines enhancement specifically in imposing its section a sentence,we note that the district court section a analysis must include consideration of whether support of terrorism is an aggravating factor in light of the court obligation to consider the nature and circumstances of stewart offense and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense.a a.
a district court failure to find particular facts will in no way impede our review in some,perhaps in most,situations this,however,is not one of them.especially in light of the absence of a finding that stewart did not commit perjury at trial or otherwise obstruct justice,we think it preferable not to determine whether her sentence was substantively reasonable.
we therefore remand this matter to the district court for resentencing,in the course of which we direct the court to determine the issue of perjury and if it finds such perjury,to resentence stewart so as to reflect that finding.the district court should also consider whether stewart conduct as a lawyer triggers the enhancement under the guidelines,see,and reconsider the extent to which stewart status as a lawyer affects the appropriate sentence.finally,the district court should further consider the overall question whether the sentence to be given is appropriate in view of the magnitude of the offense,which the court itself has explicitly recognized.although we do not preclude the district court election to continue to impose a sentence,we do require that such a sentence,selected after the reconsideration we have directed,begin with the terrorism enhancement and take that enhancement into account.we have serious doubts that the sentence given was reasonable,but think it appropriate to hear from the district court further before deciding the issue.
we have identified actions taken or not taken by the district court in imposing sentence that we conclude constituted procedural error and thus require resentencing.other issues are raised by judge walker,who finds that they resulted in procedural error and substantive unreasonableness,and addressed by judge calabresi in response.to the extent we did not discuss or rule on those issues in this majority opinion,our silence should not be construed by the district court,or by others relying on this opinion,to mean that the majority has adopted judge calabresi views or rejected judge walker.we have not.
although we find no procedural or substantive error in connection with the sentencing of sattar and yousry,we nonetheless remand their cases,too.we conclude that,inasmuch as the interrelationship among the sentences of the is a principal consideration as to a proper sentence of stewart,the district court should have the ability,if not the obligation,to resentence them as well.
after the district court completes the resentencing,jurisdiction may be restored to this court by letter from any party,and the office of the clerk of this court shall set an expeditious briefing schedule and refer the matter to this panel for further review.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the conviction of stewart,but remand this cause to the district court for resentencing of stewart,see united states phillips,cir,and resentencing of sattar or yousry or both if the district court determines that they should receive different sentences in light of the sentence imposed on stewart.inasmuch as the current sentences will remain in effect as to stewart and yousry until the district court resentences sattar or yousry if it decides to do in light of the fact that we affirm on all issues related to the guilt of all defendants,the district court is directed to order stewart and yousry to surrender forthwith to begin serving their terms of incarceration.
i join judge sack opinion in full.i write separately to comment on our decision with respect to stewart sentence.in doing so,i do not wish to express any disagreement with the majority opinion,which has withheld a final judgment on various aspects of stewart sentence in light of the decision to remand.where i express views on which the majority opinion is silent,i write only for myself.
when a judge of extraordinary ability and a reputation for exceptional judgment has spent as much time on a case like this,making many decisions of tremendous on review we are all in agreement were correct and wisely the usual deference that the supreme court indicated should be paid to the district court sentencing must constitute an understatement.this is especially so with respect to any notions as to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence.we may find that there are some procedural or technical matters that warrant more consideration by the district judge,such as the question of whether stewart committed perjury and the relevance of this in determining an appropriate sentence,given the district court treatment of the terrorism enhancement.but for have not been involved in the case and do not know all the backs and forms,some of which may even be best left not fully second guess the district court judgment seems to me to be precisely what both the supreme court and our court sitting en banc in united states cavera,cir,have said we should not do.i join the majority opinion because i understand it to avoid second guessing,and because i believe it wisely provides the district court with an opportunity to explain further and perhaps to modify the sentence it has imposed.i write here to explore some of the principal issues on which this panel is divided and to give fuller expression to the importance of having appellate courts appreciate the limited,though still important,institutional role we play,particularly in a case such as this one,where the temptation to go beyond that role is so great 
after calculating stewart sentence under the guidelines,the district court applied the a factors and concluded that the effect of the terrorism enhancement,while correct under the guidelines,would result in an unreasonable result in this particular case.sent g tr.the district court arrived at this conclusion based on,inter alia,what it described as the somewhat atypical nature of stewart case for the imposition of the terrorism enhancement,and the lack of evidence that any victim was harmed as a result of the charged offense id.at.while i agree with the majority opinion that these grounds do not render the terrorism enhancement inapplicable in determining the relevant guidelines range,i do believe that each ground,if properly articulated,is,as a procedural matter,within the district court discretion to consider in its application of the a factors.what is more,i would be extremely reluctant to disturb a district court careful effort to look to the unique circumstances of a defendant like stewart and arrive at an individualized sentence where the guidelines recommendation is controlled by an undeniably broad enhancement or reduction like the terrorism enhancement.
when the terrorism enhancement is applied,it has dramatic consequences on the applicable guidelines range because it automatically increases both the offense level of a crime and the defendant criminal history category.in stewart case,for example,the recommended sentence range without the enhancement was to months,while imposition of the enhancement resulted in a recommended sentence of months,the statutory maximum.yet as both the majority opinion and judge walker,in his partial dissent,recognize,the terrorism enhancement casts a very broad net.in this case,that breadth was compounded by the fact that the federal crime of terrorism for which stewart was convicted,the provision of material support,itself covers a wide range of conduct of varying degrees of culpability ranging from the supply of lodging to the contribution of weapons,lethal substances,and explosives.see.when a guidelines recommendation has such dramatic consequences and yet covers a multitude of sins,unusually broad sentencing discretion in the district court is essential.indeed,it must be so to comply with the supreme court remedial holding in united states booker,d.
we articulated this precise point in cavera,recognizing that some guidelines enhancements and reductions apply without modulation to a wide range of conduct.at.we identified as examples several financial crimes where the recommended sentence under the guidelines varies dramatically according to the money involved,but the culpability of an individual defendant might not be captured accurately by a single variable like financial impact.id.perhaps more closely analogous to the terrorism enhancement,we pointed to the armed career criminal guidelines,under which the recommended sentences for firearms offenses increase sharply if the defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence an expansive term that places crimes like attempted burglary of a dwelling under the same umbrella as crimes like murder and rape.see id.citing a.the terrorism enhancement in its breadth of coverage is akin to these examples from cavera.the majority opinion understands this when it says that the terrorism enhancement may apply to persons who are culpable in substantially different degrees,and that the district court may differentiate between different levels of culpable conduct that nonetheless trigger the same substantial enhancement.op.at.
we indicated in cavera that when a district court faces such over and guidelines recommendations and when,after considering the a factors,it promulgates a sentence that varies from that recommendation,the district court decision,if adequately explained,should be reviewed especially deferentially.at emphasis added.nothing we hold here should be understood to conflict with that principle,or to cast doubt on the district court apparent conclusion that there must be much room for discretion under the terrorism enhancement 
while we have raised questions about the closeness of yousry and stewart sentences in light of stewart seemingly greater level of responsibility and status as a lawyer,and while we would benefit from greater explanation by the district court on this and other issues,it remains the district court task,for purposes of sentencing under a,to assess where stewart criminal behavior falls within the spectrum of terrorism enhancement culpability.and i would be very and if i had to review a sentence in this case for substantive find an abuse of discretion in a conclusion by the district court that stewart conduct,though undeniably serious,was significantly less serious than that of other defendants subject to the terrorism enhancement.
i am more ambivalent about the degree to which absence of harm is a valid ground on which to mitigate a sentence.i join the majority opinion in withholding judgment on this issue with respect to stewart.my general view,however,is that while a district court ought to be careful about giving too much weight to a factor like harm that might vary based on events beyond the defendant control,we should not preclude a district court from giving lack of harm some weight,even for some crimes of terrorism.
whether it is fair to assign different levels of culpability in criminal sentencing to the same criminal conduct based on the fortuity of whether harm results has long been a contested question in jurisprudence.see hart,the concept of law why should the accidental fact that an intended harmful outcome has not occurred be ground for punishing less a criminal who may be equally dangerous and equally wicked.but whatever significance the consequences of a defendant actions ought to have,it is an inevitable part of human our we as a society do give consequences considerable weight when we mete out punishment and blame this is deeply entrenched in our legal system.the majority opinion identifies the law of attempts as one generally accepted instantiation of this tendency,op.at,but there are many as crimes of culpable risk creation,like vehicular homicide.and while it is true that material support to terrorism is a complete crime rather than an inchoate one,and so fully punishable even if no further harm results,it simply does not follow that the amount of punishment may not at least in part depend on the harm that occurred.the level of punishment for a completed crime varies all the time based on the amount of harm that has occurred,and the guidelines themselves often directly embrace such a policy 
judge walker suggests terrorism is different,and that,at least in the very broad heartland of cases,it is procedural error for the district court to consider absence of harm as relevant to the application of the terrorism enhancement and ultimately to the imposition of a sentence he argues that treating harm as a consideration relevant to sentencing those convicted of terrorism related crimes,such as for material support,would effectively nullify the policy considerations of congress and the sentencing commission,who have not made reductions for lack of harm part of the terrorism enhancement.even if the guidelines do not themselves make lack of harm relevant for the application of the terrorism they fail to do so only in the narrow sense that the enhancement does not positively reflect the existence of supreme court has made clear that a district court,which has greater familiarity with the individual case and the individual defendant,may properly decide that sentencing judgments made by the guidelines fail properly to reflect the a considerations.see rita united states,d.
what is more,the court has evidenced profound skepticism toward arguments that certain policy judgments,which require departing from the guidelines,have implicitly been taken off the table as a result of congressional silence or inaction.see kimbrough united states,d.as the court explained,it is usually inappropriate to draw inferences from congressional silence on sentencing practices because congress has shown that,when it wants to,it knows how to direct levels of sentencing in express terms.id.at citing h,which required sentencing commission to set guidelines sentences for recidivist offenders at or near the statutory maximum.as a result,the fact that congress increased the statutory maximum in for material support convictions that caused death,see op.of walker at,and did so without saying anything whatever about how a district court may treat harm when issuing a sentence that is less than the applicable maximum,can not be read to diminish the discretion the district court otherwise has under a 
i also rather doubt that we would be willing to apply consistently a principle that harm is irrelevant in terrorism cases.consider two potential defendants,both of whom provide funds to different terrorists and have the requisite mens rea to support a conviction under.in one case,the terrorist whom the defendant funds attempts to detonate an explosive in a public place,but the explosives do not go off properly and so cause only a few injuries and one death that results,in part also,from inadequate medical treatment.in the second case,the terrorist detonation attempt succeeds,blowing up a city bus and causing a major traffic collision that kills or injures hundreds of people.while reasonable minds might differ as to the weight the level of harm should be given in this scenario,surely we would not hold it procedurally unreasonable for the district court to take the amount of harm into account when sentencing the respective defendants sentencing the first it as a reason to give the second defendant a much greater sentence.yet if that is so,the converse must hold,because sentencing discretion is like an elevator in that it must run in both directions.cavera,at.to concede,as i think we must,that when hundreds of people are injured or killed rather than just one a district court may take the amount of harm into account and impose a higher sentence,but then to deny the court that same discretion to reach a lower sentence when,through fortuity,no harm results,would manifestly contravene that principle 
i have focused to this point on factors the district court may consider procedurally when sentencing,but this case also illustrates the importance of our adherence as an appellate court to the right procedure for review of district court sentences.in cavera,we explained that our review involves a process.we first ensure that the district court has not committed procedural error,and only later engage in substantive review to examine whether the district court has rendered a sentence that is one of the exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.at internal quotations and emphasis omitted.following this sequence of review is central to our limited role.because district courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts when making sentencing decisions,koon united states,d,our job as a reviewing court is mainly to ensure that a district court sentence resulted from the district court considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various,often conflicting,purposes of sentencing.cavera,at.evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence before we have found it free from procedural defect risks the substitution of our considered judgment for that of the district court.
when we identify procedural error,we have recognized the desirability of remanding to the district court to let it correct its mistake and exercise its discretion anew,rather than proceeding prematurely to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness.see cavera,at.while we have not held that this course must necessarily be followed in all instances,a review of our cases makes clear that it is the ordinary and much preferred remedy.see,united states williams,cir in light of our decision to remand,we reject,as premature,the defendant challenge to the substantive reasonability of his sentence.united states williams,cir vacating sentence without reaching issue of whether sentence was substantively reasonable because we conclude that the district judge committed procedural error united states wills,cir because we hold that the sentence is procedurally unreasonable,we do not reach the government argument that if the district court had not relied on procedurally erroneous factors,defendant sentence should be deemed unreasonable based on its length alone.emphasis added,abrogated on other grounds by kimbrough.at,as recognized in cavera,at.
other circuits have expressed a similar preference,and have sometimes stated it in even more categorical terms first remand to allow a district court to correct procedural errors and only later review for substantive reasonableness this is no formalism.it is consonant with our system of sentencing,which asks the district court to reach a complete judgment about the appropriate sentence in light of the factors enumerated in a.procedural errors prevent the district court from properly arriving at such a holistic judgment.and in light of our obligation to defer significantly to a procedurally correct sentence,we should almost always wait until we have such a sentence to review before evaluating overall reasonableness.
judge walker argues that judicial efficiency compels us to identify substantive error at the same time we remand for procedural error.no one wants unnecessary appeals.but i fail to see any systemic advantages from issuing advisory opinions on the reasonableness of sentences that we are vacating,and hence that are now no longer really before us.the decision to remand for procedural unreasonableness presupposes that we believe the district court might not have imposed the same sentence but for the procedural defect.see,united states jass,cir recognizing that procedural errors in sentencing are subject to harmless error rule.when we remand for procedural flaws,it may seem inviting to comment at the same time on other factors relied upon by the district court that,though procedurally proper,do not,in our judgment,bear the weight the district court attributed to them.it may even be appropriate in dicta to suggest our preliminary view on the matter.but it is not our role to weigh the individual a factors ourselves and,in a holding,to give binding advice to the district court based on our views.see gall.at.
let me repeat substantive reasonableness calls for review of the overall sentence,not individual factors.and a calls for balancing all the relevant factors.as a result,any procedural errors necessarily affect the sentencing calculus.our task is to evaluate deferentially the district court finished product,and not to grade its individual ingredients.to do this properly,we must almost always wait for the district court to correct the procedural errors that we have identified and to explain its sentence,and only then to consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.
i do not mean to suggest an absolutist view on this matter.it may be that there are cases where there is procedural error though it is not sufficiently separate from any serious substantive concerns that we have,so as to make it plausible to address the two issues at once.i can not think of any such cases offhand,however.and,for the reasons well expressed by the majority opinion in its decision to remand,this case is not one of them.
another,perhaps uncomfortable,issue deserves discussion.stewart does not appear to have been the only member of abdel rahman legal team both to agree to abide by the sams imposed upon rahman and then subsequently to violate them.one of rahman lawyers,abdeen jabara,read to rahman newspaper articles and letters from followers,while another,ramsey clark,the former attorney general of the united states,acknowledged issuing a statement to the media on behalf of rahman yet neither jabara nor clark was prosecuted for these apparent violations.this does not mean that the government decision to prosecute only stewart was invidious or improper,and i join the majority opinion in rejecting stewart claim of selective prosecution.but though stewart selective prosecution challenge fails,it does not follow that the alleged misconduct of jabara and the district court may well have decided shared in certain respects the culpable behavior for which stewart was entirely irrelevant to stewart and to her sentence.i think it possible that it is relevant,and i believe that usually only the district court is positioned to evaluate that relevance.
as to claims of selective prosecution,we have properly recognized that our scope of review is limited,for the decision as to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor.united states alameh,cir.as the supreme court has explained,this is because the decision to prosecute is particularly to judicial review.wayte united states,d.yet this does not mean that unfettered even when it is prosecutorial discretion over who gets charged,and for what,is categorically desirable.quite the contrary while prosecutorial discretion may be salutary in a wide variety of cases,when left entirely without any controls it will concentrate too much power in a single set of government actors,and they,moreover,may on occasion be subject to political pressure.the result may well be to produce disparities in the way similarly situated people are treated,disparities that our complex,system has sought to minimize.the district court exercise of its sentencing discretion may provide the only effective way to control and diminish unjustified disparities,without operating in the blunt fashion of selective prosecution judicial review.it may reduce improper differences in treatment,without impinging on the executive obligation to enforce the law.
our case law provides support for this approach.for instance,while we have not required a district court to consider sentencing disparities among,we have held that district courts are permitted to do so.as we explained,it is appropriate for a district court,relying on its unique knowledge of the totality of circumstances of a crime and its participants,to impose a sentence that would better reflect the extent to which the participants in a crime are similarly or dissimilarly situated and tailor the sentences accordingly.wills,at internal emphasis omitted.this,as has been recognized,allows district courts to provide a check against certain otherwise unbounded prosecutorial decisions,as to what charges to bring and as to whether to make substantial assistance motions with respect to only some defendants it is not much of an extension to permit the district courts to exercise analogous supervision over those decisions as to which prosecutors enjoy the greatest discretion and that result in the greatest disparities the decisions on whether to bring any charges at all.
there are,of course,many reasons for prosecutors to fail to bring charges or to bring lesser charges than they could have,and some of these reasons are clearly irrelevant to the proper sentence of the person who has been charged and convicted.but other reasons may be relevant because they may suggest arbitrariness and can lead to as the political clout of some potential defendants as against others.we as appellate judges are to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant reasons in any given case.the same can not be said,however,for a district court judge who has presided over a whole trial in which the behavior of uncharged or undercharged parties was part and parcel of the discussion.
this does not mean that when a district court issues a sentence that it should articulate its reliance on the prosecution decision not to charge or to undercharge other parties.i am not sure.while we generally ask a district court to explain the reasons behind its sentence,and indeed indicated in cavera that a district court errs if it fails adequately to explain its chosen sentence,and must include an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range,at internal quotations omitted,there are some things that are perhaps best left unsaid by the district court,even though their potential relevance is apparent on the record a prosecutor decision to charge only some parties rather than others may be one of these things.the district court might quite reasonably want to avoid impugning the reputation of parties who have not been indicted or tried,and hence have not had the opportunity to assert innocence in open court.but that does not mean that a judge who has presided over a full trial may not have valid reasons to conclude that the failure to charge some potential affects,under the factors,the propriety of a sentence 
i am inclined to think that the district court should not be barred from considering the relevance of prosecutorial discretion in a particular case,and that our legal system should take advantage of the district court unique position to consider a defendant sentence in its complete relevant context,wills,at emphasis added.as appellate courts we should therefore also keep this issue in mind when we review a district court sentence,and recognize it as a further reason to defer to a district court sentencing judgments.in particular,though we may properly ask the district court to explain apparent sentencing anomalies among convicted defendants as both the majority opinion and the partial dissent do here,we should not forget that there might be even greater disparities between a defendant and other individuals who were not charged at all 
finally,i would be remiss if i did not follow the majority opinion in observing the fact that all of the acts for which stewart was convicted occurred before the attacks of september,an event that illustrates in particularly excruciating fashion that results do matter to us.it does not diminish the gravity of stewart crimes to take judicial notice of their timing,and to recognize that our attitudes about her conduct have inevitably been influenced by the tragedy of that day.to suggest otherwise,and to ignore that has profoundly influenced our retrospective assessment of the culpability of certain actions related to terrorists and terrorist organizations,would be to ignore reality.as the majority opinion says,stewart herself might well have viewed her actions differently after when the dangerousness of terrorism became so palpable,so stark,proximate.see op.at.we must be careful then in judging stewart based on lessons that we learned only after were committed in the end,this factor too is part of the district court obligation to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense,and to impose a sentence that reflect s the seriousness of the offense and provide s just punishment.see a.
for two years,defendant lynne stewart,through artifice and deception,and despite sworn commitments to the contrary made to the government,carried out a criminal plan to transmit instructions from her imprisoned client,a terrorist leader,to his jihadist followers in the middle east,including,ominously,his withdrawal of support for a fragile in egypt,an action that effectively sanctioned renewed terrorist attacks and indiscriminate loss of human life.the district court termed these deliberate and horrific crimes of terrorism,for which the sentencing guidelines recommends years imprisonment,extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.and yet the district court imposed a breathtakingly low sentence of years.because the majority fails to recognize that this sentence trivializes stewart extremely serious conduct with a slap on the wrist that is substantively unreasonable,and because the majority fails to appreciate the full extent of the district court numerous procedural errors,i respectfully dissent 
in imposing stewart comparably insignificant sentence,the district judge rejected entirely a major enhancement,established by the sentencing commission under congress express command,that applies generally to the material support of terrorism.despite finding that stewart crime was within the enhancement heartland,sent g tr,the district court found that the atypicality of stewart material support conduct in provi ding a to a terrorist conspiracy,sent g tr,justified discarding the terrorism component of stewart crime in its a analysis.but,wholly apart from the fact that the provision of personnel falls squarely within the definition of material support provided in b,it trivializes stewart conduct to even suggest that enabling a jailed terrorist leader,with enormous sway over his jihadist followers,to actively conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill innocent people somehow mitigates the gravity of the crime.the district court also based its rejection of an enhancement for the material support of terrorism on the fact that stewart conduct did not result in actual injuries or death,even though that fact is rarely,if ever,a mitigating circumstance,much less a reason to jettison the terrorism enhancement altogether in its a analysis.
in addition to failing to make required findings on obstruction of justice based on evidence of stewart double perjury at trial,as the majority recognizes,op.at,the district court also all but ignored stewart gross abuse of the fiduciary trust placed in her by the united states government,and,in the face of contrary policy statements by the sentencing commission,gave unjustified controlling weight to its mitigating view of stewart age,health,and previous career.numerous additional errors attended the radical reduction of stewart sentence from the recommended years to years.
section a of title of the united states code,which governed stewart sentence,requires that every sentence take into appropriate account the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the history and characteristics of the defendant reflect the seriousness of the offense promote respect for the law and adequate ly deter similar conduct in the future.a.the statute also mandates consideration of the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc ing disparities.id.a.recognition of the full scope of the district court procedural errors makes plain that stewart sentence fails to respect these goals and is so extraordinarily lenient as to manifest an abuse of discretion resulting in a substantively unreasonable sentence.
the majority appropriately acknowledges the fine reputation of the district court judge,a point with which i concur.and,like the majority,i commend the district court management of this complex and difficult trial.however,the majority goes on to suggest,with judge calabresi concurrence being quite explicit,that because of the district court reputation,our review of the stewart sentencing should be more deferential than would normally be the case.this court has never recognized two classes of who are so good that their judgment is beyond reproach,and all the rest.indeed,no judge on any federal court,including the supreme court,can lay claim to infallibility.great respect for a particular judge can not be a basis for overlooking what,in my view,amounts to a distortion of our sentencing laws.for the foregoing reasons,and others that i will describe,stewart sentence must be vacated and she must be resentenced.
i.the defendants exceptionally serious criminal conduct 
sheik abdel rahman,stewart client,is a dedicated terrorist leader with a large jihadist following in the middle east,known as the islamic group among other names,op.at,and a more discrete following in the united states.see united states rahman,cir per curiam.abdel rahman was locked up in federal prison in rochester,minnesota,to serve a life sentence imposed in,after he was convicted for both trying to wreak havoc in new york city by blowing up bridges,tunnels,and buildings,and attempting to assassinate egyptian president hosni mubarak.see id.at.
for two years,and,the defendants in this,another jihadist with direct links back to abdel rahman egyptian followers stewart,abdel rahman lawyer and yousry,stewart student sure that abdel rahman could continue to communicate with his jihadist cohorts.the department of justice had employed special administrative measures sams specifically designed to prevent such communications while still enabling an imprisoned terrorist to speak to,and be effectively represented by his attorney.compliance with the sams system largely depends upon the trust placed in the attorney.in accordance with the sams,stewart,repeatedly swore under oath that she would not transmit any communications to or from abdel rahman.she swore falsely.
undeterred by the sams,stewart,assisted by yousry,executed a scheme of lies and deception against the government to keep the lines of communication open between abdel rahman and sattar,and,through sattar,the egyptian jihadists.these communications included a declaration by abdel rahman that he was withdrawing his support for a tenuous that,for some time,had aimed at curbing violent attacks by abdel rahman followers upon targets in egypt stewart even went so far as to deliver this statement to an arab journalist on abdel rahman behalf,which resulted in the message wide dissemination through the media in the middle east.
the federal crimes committed by the defendants are numerous.all three conspired to defraud the united states,in violation of.rahman,sattar,and other jihadists conspired to kill and to kidnap persons in a foreign country,in violation of a,a a,and solicited crimes of violence,in violation of.stewart and yousry,both individually and in conspiracy,provided and concealed material support to terrorist rahman and sattar conspiracy to kill and to violation of.additionally,stewart made multiple false statements to the department of justice and to the bureau of prisons,in violation of.such behavior constitutes extraordinarily serious,indeed horrendous,criminal conduct that there was no evidence that stewart conduct ultimately resulted in death and injury to innocent people was due to law enforcement diligence,and not to any lack of effort by the defendants or their confederates.
for such crimes,the advisory sentencing guidelines effective on november,applicable here,provided for lengthy sentences life imprisonment for sattar,months imprisonment for stewart,and to months imprisonment for yousry.a guidelines recommendation,of course,is just a district judge has considerable discretion to sentence outside of the guidelines.see gall united states,d.the district court sentenced the defendants well below the recommended guidelines ranges,lowering sattar sentence from a recommended life term to years,yousry sentence from months to months,and stewart sentence from months to a mere months.
what is immediately striking about stewart sentence is not simply its extraordinary percent reduction from the recommended guidelines range but also the fact that the actual term of incarceration unprecedented in convictions for material support of terrorism the supreme court has made clear that the guidelines provide the starting point and the initial benchmark for sentencing,and that district judges must remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.id.at,accord united states cavera,cir en banc.when faced with an unusually lenient sentence such as stewart,we must ensure that the district judge has offered sufficient justifications to support his conclusion that the sentence is appropriate.gall.at.despite the significant discretion accorded to district judges,we retain a limited but important reviewing function we must review sentences for both procedural and substantive reasonableness.
ii.relevant legal standards 
our review proceeds under a deferential standard,gall.at,and a district court decision to vary from the guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case to be outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply,cavera,at quoting kimbrough united states,d.however,closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the guidelines based solely on the judge view that the guidelines range fails properly to reflect a considerations even in a case.kimbrough.at internal quotation marks omitted accord cavera,at.the basic contours of our role are as follows.
to evaluate procedural reasonableness,we must ensure that the district court,in imposing a sentence,followed the procedural steps prescribed by law.procedural reasonableness requires that we be confident that the sentence resulted from the district court considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various,often conflicting,purposes of sentencing.cavera,at.thus,a district court commits procedural error when it fails to calculate or incorrectly calculates the guidelines range,treats the guidelines as mandatory,neglects to consider the factors set forth in a or bases its sentence on a clearly erroneous factual finding.see id.at.to avoid procedural error,a district court must also adequately explain its chosen sentence,including the reasons that the sentence should be different in this case,extraordinarily different from that recommended by the guidelines,in order to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing,gall.at.
we do not categorically proscribe any factor concerning the defendant background,character,and conduct,with the exception of invidious factors.see also cavera,at united states kaba,cir.still,while a district court may take into account any information known to it,united states concepcion,cir,it does not possess a blank check to impose whatever sentences suit its fancy,cavera,at quoting united states jones,cir.and a district court,despite its discretion,can not ignore any of the a factors it must consider them all,gall.at,including the relevant guidelines range and any pertinent sentencing commission policy statement,cavera,at.see also a.as we stated in united states fernandez 
as long as the judge is aware of both the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable,and nothing in the record indicates misunderstanding about such materials or misperception about their relevance,we will accept that the requisite consideration of the a factors has occurred.
cir quoting united states fleming,cir emphasis from fernandez omitted.however,if the district court has ignored or slighted a factor that congress has deemed pertinent in a,it has abused its discretion.united states taylor,d gall.at alito,dissenting see also id.at majority opinion directing district courts to consider all of the a factors emphasis added.
in performing substantive reasonableness review,we must determine whether the district court sentence is located within the range of permissible decisions.cavera,at internal quotation marks omitted.w e take into account the totality of the circumstances,giving due deference to the sentencing judge exercise of discretion,and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.id.at.but we must accept that such discretion is not boundless.in sentencing,as in other areas,district judges at times make mistakes that are substantive circuit courts exist to correct such mistakes when they occur.rita united states,d.because the a factors are to guide sentencing,the factors also guide appellate courts in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.united states booker,d.and because it is fair to assume that the guidelines,insofar as practicable,reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve a objectives,rita,at,our judgment of a sentence substantive reasonableness must be informed by the extent of any variance from the guidelines range,gall.at.
in light of a district court wide discretion in sentencing,we do not presume that a sentence is unreasonable.cavera,at.but when a district judge chooses to step away from the guidelines,we must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.gall.at accord cavera,at.there is no rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.gall.at.rather,our focus on the degree of deviation is derived from the uncontroversial proposition that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.id.at.whatever the justification,its persuasive power depends in large part on the quality of its reasoning.accordingly,in order to determine whether the sentencing court acted reasonably,we must examine how it reached its conclusions,and determine how persuasive its stated reasons are in supporting its exercise of discretion.see id.at.if the district judge reasoning is sound,we will not second guess the weight or lack thereof that the judge accorded to a given a factor as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.fernandez,at,emphasis added.we have noted,however,that unjustified reliance upon any one factor is a symptom of an unreasonable sentence,united states rattoballi,cir,but only a symptom we must reach our decision by examining the reasoning of the district court in light of the totality of the circumstances,with due deference to the district court judgment.
iii.stewart sentence 
a.the district court findings and conclusions 
in sentencing stewart,the district court began by calculating her sentencing range under the guidelines,and found it to be months,the statutory maximum sent g tr.the district court guidelines calculation was clearly appropriate.the majority speculates that the district court might not have fully applied the terrorism enhancement in calculating stewart range,see op.at this speculation is belied by the record and is therefore unwarranted,see sent g tr.over stewart objection,the district court found that the guidelines terrorism enhancement,applied because she had committed a federal crime of terrorism.sent g tr.in light of the ample evidence showing that stewart actions were calculated to affect the conduct of the egyptian government through intimidation and coercion,the district judge held that her conduct can not be found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement.sent g tr.the district court acknowledged stewart arguments that the enhancement did not apply,and that its effect on her criminal history category overstated the seriousness of her past conduct and the likelihood that she would commit further crimes.sent g tr.the district court,however,did not waver from its heartland determination,and chose to defer consideration of stewart and overstatement claims to its a analysis,instead of determining whether they warranted departures within the guidelines scheme.sent g tr.
the district court also declined to determine whether stewart conduct warranted a guidelines enhancement for her potential obstruction of justice under.the government had urged this enhancement based upon stewart alleged double perjury at trial.sent g tr.the district court found evidence to indicat e that stewart statements were false.sent g tr.the court nonetheless chose not to consider the enhancement applicability,on the basis that the guidelines,because of the terrorism enhancement,already provided for the statutory maximum.sent g tr.the district court also noted that it believed a sentence would be most consistent with the a factors.sent g tr.
stewart sought several downward departures under the guidelines.first,she argued that she deserved a lesser harms departure pursuant to because she committed her crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm rejecting this argument,the district court found that the circumstances of this case do not diminish society interest in punishing the conduct at issue,and that t his is not a case where the interest in punishment or deterrence is reduced.sent g tr.the district court also rejected stewart request for a downward departure under,which applies to aberrant behavior.the district court refused to grant this departure because stewart conduct was committed over an extended period of time,involved repeated acts of deception,and involve d significant planning.sent g tr.finally,the district court stated that it would take into account stewart requested departure for extraordinary medical conditions,pursuant to,when making its a determination.
having found that the guidelines called for stewart to receive the statutory maximum of months,the district court proceeded to its a analysis.the district court cited what it believed to be numerous factors that argue in favor of a very substantial downward variance.sent g tr.first,the district court noted that this is an atypical case for the terrorism enhancement,because there are few,if any,cases where the thrust of the violation was the provision of a to a terrorist conspiracy.sent g tr.moreover,the district court explained,there is no evidence that any victim was in fact harmed as a result of the offense as charged sent g tr.the district court also found the terrorism enhancement impact on stewart criminal history category to be dramatically unreasonable.sent g tr.
the district court thus concluded that application of the full terrorism enhancement,while correct under the guidelines,would result in an unreasonable result in this atypical case and produce a guideline range about quadruple the range without that enhancement.sent g tr.accordingly,the district court proceeded to consider stewart sentence as if there was no terrorism component to her material support.although the district court reached the appropriate guidelines calculation,the district court,in its analysis,effectively set aside the enhancement,sentencing stewart as if the guidelines ranges were to months imprisonment without the government requested obstruction enhancement,and to months imprisonment with that enhancement.sent g tr.the district court then stated that these ranges did not tak e into account the extraordinary personal characteristics of the defendant,which also argue strongly in favor of a substantial downward variance.sent g tr.
noting that t he personal characteristics of the defendant are intertwined with several of the a factors,sent g tr,the district court then discussed at length stewart age,health,and career.the district court described stewart career of represent ing the poor,the disadvantaged,and the unpopular,and concluded that it was no exaggeration to say that stewart performed a public service not only to her clients but to the nation.sent g tr.although acknowledging that,under the guidelines,prior good works are not ordinarily relevant to a defendant sentence,the district court noted that even the guidelines permitted extraordinary contributions to take a defendant outside the guidelines ra n ge.sent g tr.accordingly,the district court held that stewart past work warranted a substantial downward variance.sent g tr.
the district court then explained that stewart conviction would likely prevent her from ever practicing law again.the court found that this is itself a punishment,and means that the occasion for offenses will be removed and that a lengthy sentence of imprisonment would be an excessive one for deterrence and protection of the public.sent g tr.
the district court noted that stewart was years old,making imprisonment particularly difficult on her.sent g tr.and the court found stewart history of overcoming cancer relevant because she had a statistically significant chance of recurrence and suffers from other medical conditions including sleep apnea.sent g tr.the district court acknowledged that m edical care can be delivered while in prison,but found it clear that prison will be particularly difficult for this defendant.sent g tr.
despite noting that age and physical condition are discouraged factors under the guidelines,the district court concluded that,b ecause imprisonment will be particularly hard on the defendant,a lesser sentence than otherwise called for by the advisory guidelines would be sufficient to accomplish the goals of section a.sent g tr.but the district court reiterated that there still was an irreducible core of extraordinarily severe criminal conduct.sent g tr.the court point ed out that the offenses of conviction were serious,involved dishonesty and breach of trust,and had potentially lethal consequences sent g tr.however,the district court felt that the seriousness of the offense d id not wipe out the three decades of service and the other characteristics of the defendant and the particular effects of the sentence on this defendant.sent g tr.accordingly,t aking all of the a factors into account,the district court sentenced stewart to months imprisonment.sent g tr.
b.the district court procedural and analytical errors 
the majority raises four issues concerning stewart sentence it does not understand why stewart abuse of her position as a lawyer did not warrant a higher sentence,op.at it does not understand why stewart sentence was only eight months longer than yousry,despite her significantly more egregious conduct,op.at it finds that the district court procedurally erred by ignoring stewart potential perjury,which was relevant to her sentence under a,op.at and without finding error,it notes the district court failure to include consideration of whether support of terrorism is an aggravating factor and suggests that the district court reconsider whether stewart sentence was appropriate in view of the offense for which she was convicted op.at.accordingly,the majority remands for resentencing,directing the district court to address the perjury issue,consider whether stewart conduct as a lawyer triggers the enhancement under,reconsider the extent to which stewart status as a lawyer affects the appropriate sentence,and examine the overall appropriateness of stewart sentence,taking into account the terrorism enhancement,in light of the magnitude of her offense.op.at.
although i share the majority four concerns and its conclusion that resentencing is required,the district court made several substantial errors that the majority refuses to identify as legal errors.our error correcting function requires us to specify these errors now,when they are evident to the court,to prevent their repetition on remand and in other cases.notably,because the district court stated reasons for effectively removing altogether the terrorism object of stewart material support in its a a analysis can not,in fact,mitigate the seriousness of stewart crime,i identify procedural error in the district court application of a a.this grave error in assessing the seriousness of stewart crime,moreover,was compounded by the district court failure to account for two aggravating factors plainly relevant under the guidelines stewart perjury,and her persistent and blatant abuse of a position of trust to commit her crime.see a.while the majority acknowledges these last two procedural errors,its failure to explicitly recognize the error that they compound minimizes the magnitude of the district court error in identifying the seriousness of stewart criminal,in turn,contributed to other errors.
without a reasonable assessment of the seriousness of stewart crime,the district court could not reliably determine the sentence necessary to afford adequate general and specific deterrence for crimes of material support of terrorism.see a b.the district court error in assessing the seriousness of stewart crime further precluded a reliable determination of the sentence necessary to avoid unwarranted disparities with similarly situated criminals.see a.
moreover,the district court error in assessing the seriousness of stewart crime prompted it to accord stewart age,health,and career mitigating weight that they can not reasonably bear.the totality of these procedural errors,all originating in a disturbing misunderstanding of the seriousness of stewart conduct,contributed to a sentence that so trivializes the terrorism crimes of conviction as to present a rare occurrence in this court a sentence that can not be deemed to fall within the wide range of substantively reasonable choices available to a sentencing judge.jones,at.
assessing the seriousness of stewart crime as required by a a 
a.the terrorism enhancement 
in,congress expressly mandated that the sentencing commission provide for a terrorism enhancement to ensure that crimes of terrorism were met with a punishment that reflected their extraordinary seriousness.see violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat.the commission accordingly created an enhancement that operates both vertically,increasing the offense level to indicate the seriousness of the crime,and horizontally increasing the defendant criminal history category to reflect the need for deterrence,regardless of the defendant prior record.see as the majority acknowledges,the sentencing commission unambiguously cast a broad net when drafting the terrorism enhancement.op.at quoting united states mandhai,cir.the import of this enhancement could not be clearer it reflects congress and the commission policy judgment that an act of terrorism represents a particularly grave threat because of the dangerousness of the crime and the difficulty of deterring and rehabilitating the criminal,and thus that terrorists and their supporters should be incapacitated for a longer period of time.united states meskini,cir emphasis added.under the applicable guidelines,the enhancement increases the guidelines sentence for a terrorism crime to a minimum of months or years particularly serious crimes,such as stewart,have even higher sentences after the enhancement is applied 
despite finding that stewart crime fell within the terrorism enhancement heartland,the district court,in its a analysis,sentenced stewart as if there was no terrorism component to her material then proceeded to reduce her sentence considerably further for additional reasons.the district court effectively sentenced stewart as though she had committed no federal crime of terrorism,even though the jury and the district court itself had expressly found to the contrary.in an effort to avoid addressing this issue today,the majority suggests that the record could support the conclusion that the district court,in fact,considered the terrorism aspect of stewart crime as an aggravating factor and thus did not commit error by failing to factor the terrorism component of stewart crime into its a analysis.this suggestion has no basis in the record,and the majority does not even begin to explain how the terrorism component could have possibly been an aggravating factor in a sentence that radically reduced stewart sentence from the recommended years to a mere years.
whatever the merits of the district court disregard of the enhancement on the basis that it overstated stewart criminal history,the district court complete elimination of the effect of the enhancement vertical component in assessing the seriousness of stewart crime can not withstand scrutiny in light of the district court obligation to impose a sentence sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the crime of conviction.the district court offered two rationales for ignoring the terrorism enhancement vertical component when determining stewart sentence under a the atypical nature of stewart crime,and the lack of evidence of harm to victims.neither rationale is sustainable in this case.
because the district court offered unsound rationales for mitigating the seriousness of the terrorism aspect of stewart crime,effectively sentencing stewart as if there was no terrorism component to her crime whatsoever,i find error.the error is evident in light of the values inherent in the guidelines,which provide a very strong signal that crimes in furtherance of terrorism objectives are to be considered exceptionally serious,see providing for a offense level increase with a minimum offense level of and minimum criminal history category of vi.jettisoning the terrorism component of stewart crime in its a analysis is particularly inexplicable when considered against the district court recognition that stewart conduct fell within the enhancement heartland,and the fact that terrorism was a required element of the crime for which stewart was convicted.
offering its first rationale,the district court stated that stewart conviction was an atypical case for the terrorism enhancement despite concluding minutes earlier that stewart conduct can not be found to be outside the heartland of the enhancement.sent g tr.the atypical heartland conduct,the district court added,was the provision of a to a terrorist conspiracy.sent g tr.the district court did not explain this conclusion,nor can the record support a reasonable explanation.at the outset,i question the atypicality of this conduct as a mitigating factor.congress itself has made plain that giving material support,which is a crime of terrorism under the guidelines,can be satisfied entirely by the provision of personnel.see b including the provision of personnel in the definition of material support.indeed,it is absurd and therefore necessarily unreasonable to even suggest that enabling an incarcerated terrorist leader with enormous influence to actively conspire with others in a scheme to kidnap and kill innocent persons somehow mitigates the seriousness of the crime.
sheik abdel rahman was no ordinary.he was the head of the snake,a spiritual leader of a violent terrorist group whose words carried the force of a holy writ among his followers,and a man serving a life term for conspiring to bring deadly chaos to new york city.see rahman,at.after abdel rahman influence had been sapped by the incarceration and isolation attending his lawful conviction,stewart crime specifically targeted undoing this protection by successfully enabling abdel rahman,as the islamic group spiritual leader,to communicate with his followers and to support the renewal of bloodshed.abdel rahman unique stature in the terrorist world surely renders stewart crime atypical,but this atypicality is an aggravating factor,not a mitigating one,thereby making stewart more culpable than a defendant engaged in more typical material support,such as providing money or a cache of firearms to a terrorist group.
although material support of terrorism may cover a multitude of sins,as judge calabresi concurrence states,op.of calabresi at,this observation does no work in justifying a district court complete disregard of the terrorism enhancement.each sin has a critical feature in common it supports terrorism.and congress has sent a clear signal that this feature alone warrants enhancement of punishment.see providing for a offense level increase with a minimum offense level of and minimum criminal history category of vi.that signal was not heeded in this case.the procedural concern with the district court sentence is not with where stewart conduct was placed on the terrorism spectrum it is with whether that conduct was placed on the spectrum at all.removing stewart from the spectrum on account of the nature of her sins is particularly egregious given that stewart conduct supported abdel rahman,a terrorist at the highest level.
beyond erroneously finding mitigating atypicality in provi ding a to a terrorist conspiracy,sent g tr,the district judge offered no further explanation of why stewart atypical conduct should lessen stewart culpability or justify ignoring the terrorism object of stewart material support as an aggravating factor in its a analysis,particularly in view of its heartland finding.as a result,we are left only with the district judge bare assertion of atypicality,which can not reasonably support the complete rejection of the terrorism enhancement.see cavera,at.
the district court second rationale for giving no effect to the terrorism component of stewart material absence of evidence that stewart terrorism crimes resulted in actual similarly flawed several points must be made before explaining why this reasoning amounted to procedural error.first,the absence of harm is in no sense attributable to stewart.alaa abdul raziq atia,the leader of the violent faction of the islamic group,including abdel rahman,was located and killed by egyptian authorities after the was lifted but before he could act upon it.second,the district court did not simply consider the absence of harm as a factor to lessen the effect of the terrorism enhancement it used that fortuity to completely eliminate the effect of the terrorism enhancement in its a consideration,so that stewart,in substance,was punished as if she had committed no crime of terrorism at all.third,the district court provided no reason,much less a persuasive one,for why the absence of death or injury should have such a steep mitigating effect in this case.
i take issue with the majority failure to identify as procedural error the district court deeply flawed reliance on the fortuity that stewart crime did not have the horrific consequences that she and abdel rahman intended.in doing so,the majority fails to appreciate the unique nature of terrorism support crimes,and the enhancement punishment they warrant as envisioned by congress.judge calabresi concurrence mistakenly equates such crimes to ordinary crimes and attempts,and erroneously permits the district court to eliminate the enhancement altogether primarily because the intended destruction of innocent life did not come to pass.op.of calabresi at.
congress and the sentencing commission plainly intended for the punishment of crimes of terrorism to be significantly enhanced without regard to whether,due to events beyond the defendant control,the defendant conduct failed to achieve its intended deadly consequences.see united states abu ali,cir.such intent is plain from the many criminal statutes and guidelines unrelated to terrorism that specifically account for the level or absence of injury,while the material support statute and terrorism enhancement do not moreover,congress amended stewart statute of conviction in so that causing death increased the statutory maximum from years to life imprisonment contrary to the suggestion in judge calabresi concurrence that the achievement of harm,like a elevator,can not be an aggravating factor unless the absence of such harm is a mitigating factor,op.of calabresi at,congress has been unmistakably clear that,as a general matter,the achievement of actual harm may aggravate the seriousness of a terrorism crime but that the absence of proven harm does not mitigate such a crime.as such,the district court decision to place substantial mitigating weight upon the absence of harm is thus so far contrary to the policy choices of congress and the commission that it can not be deemed reasonable under a a without persuasive explanation.see kimbrough united states,d.
unremarkably,courts routinely,and unflinchingly,apply the terrorism enhancement in the absence of proven harm here,the egyptian police caught and killed alaa abdul raziq atia,a violent,after abdel rahman and stewart withdrew rahman support for the,but before atia could act on that message.this fortuity likely prevented stewart crime from harming victims,but f ortuity has no bearing on culpability,united states mitchell,cir,nor does it mitigate to any degree the seriousness of stewart conduct abdel rahman himself was appropriately given a life sentence even though his plans to assassinate president hosni mubarak and to blow up bridges,tunnels,and buildings in new york city were frustrated.see rahman,at.there is no reason why fortuity should have enabled stewart,rahman supporter,enabler,and,to be sentenced as if no terrorism crimes had ever occurred.
in suggesting that the district court heavy reliance on the lack of proven harm was reasonable,neither the majority opinion nor judge calabresi concurrence finds support in the case law,and i have found none.judge calabresi is reduced to observing that attempted crimes are sometimes treated differently from completed crimes,even when only fortuity separates the two.op.of calabresi at.but how the law treats attempts is besides the point.as the majority itself recognizes,material support of terrorism is a substantive,not inchoate,offense.op.at.this is an independent crime,complete in its most serious form when the material support is complete and nothing is added to its criminality by success or consummation,as would be the case,say,of attempted murder.spies united states.
the fourth circuit recently agreed with my position,vacating a sentence of years imprisonment because the district court impermissibly reduced,on the basis of lack of harm,the sentence of a defendant,as here,convicted of conspiracy to provide material support.abu ali,at.it reasoned that t o deviate on the basis of unrealized harm is to require an act of completion for an offense that clearly contemplates incomplete conduct.by definition,conspiracy offenses do not require that all objects of the conspiracy be accomplished.the guidelines appropriately recognize this fact while they normally afford a decrease for offense conspiracies that were not on the verge of completion,they specifically exclude from this decrease any conspiracies that involve or promote a federal crime of terrorism.id.citing.i completely agree with this statutory conclusion.as the fourth circuit aptly stated,we are not relegated to wait ing until there are victims of terrorist attacks to fully enforce the nation criminal laws against terrorism.id.
stewart completed her crime as congress chose to define it,and the sentencing commission,in drafting the terrorism enhancement,elected not to mitigate its seriousness by rewarding a defendant whose crime did not ultimately result in death or serious injury with a reduced sentencing range.it is for this reason that lack of success can not normally be a mitigating factor even though achievement of harm may be an aggravating factor.permitting a district judge to require success in harming innocents before he will consider the terrorism component of a crime,particularly in a heartland case,is to permit that judge to disregard the fact that material support is itself a fully completed crime.
the majority states that f ortuitous events are not categorically irrelevant to the determination of a just punishment nor is their consideration necessarily inappropriate.op.at.as a general matter,of course,i agree.in addition,i do not mean to suggest that there can never be a terrorism case in which absence of harm might be an appropriate consideration.rather,i am suggesting that there is a very broad heartland of cases in which it should not be considered,and further that in this heartland,as here,it is error to use lack of harm as a primary reason for rejecting the terrorism component of a material support conviction.if,for example,an incompetent terrorist satisfies the enhancement by putting a small amount of arsenic into a reservoir for new york drinking water with every intention of killing thousands,but without understanding that the quantity is insufficient to cause harm,the complete absence of any practical possibility that the plot could cause harm may well be relevant.but,that is far from the instant case,in which stewart actions were designed to embolden rahman followers to resume a murderous jihad against scores of innocent individuals in egypt and elsewhere.in this case,it was unreasonable for the district court to place any weight on the fortuitous and attenuated events that saved the potential victims of stewart crime,much less to use it to wipe out the terrorism component of stewart crime in its a analysis,in light of the values signaled by the guidelines terrorism enhancement.
judge calabresi attempt to defend the district court analysis,by offering a hypothetical comparing the punishment of a terrorist who succeeds in causing harm with the punishment of one who does not misses the mark.see op.of calabresi at.the question at issue is not whether the amount of harm can never be a factor in sentencing.it is whether the terrorist who attempts to detonate a bomb in a public place,with the intent of killing many innocent americans,should be able to escape the terrorism enhancement altogether simply because his plan happens to fail or be foiled by authorities.the answer,as the sentencing commission has made clear,is no.a more persuasive reason than the mere absence of injury must be provided by the district judge who uses that factor to eliminate entirely the effect of the terrorism enhancement.to permit a judge to completely ignore the terrorism component of a material support conviction in a heartland case simply because the terrorist did not succeed,without further explanation as to why that case is sui generis,is to overlook the reality that the objective of terrorism is to kill large numbers of innocent people and that maximum deterrence needs to be achieved irrespective of success.see abu ali,at.
actual harm is a flawed metric when determining culpability in material support prosecutions.precisely because of the devastating consequences at stake,it is,and should be,the focus of enforcement authorities to make every effort to prevent those consequences before they occur.when enforcement authorities are successful,it is to their great credit and their efforts should in no sense lessen the deterrent effect of punishment by conferring a sentencing benefit on those whose efforts were thwarted.indeed,the house report accompanying the comprehensive antiterrorism act of,which criminalized the material support of terrorism,explained that one of the legislation primary goals was to enhance law enforcement capability of thwarting,frustrating,and preventing terrorist acts before they result in death and destruction,at emphasis added.
i fully recognize that district judges must develop ways of distinguishing whether and why one form of material support is more or less reprehensible than another,given the broad range of conduct that the material support statute criminalizes,see.however,it makes little sense to have the presence or absence of resultant harm to victims be a factor in that determination.united states whiteskunk,cir finding it unfair not to recognize and accommodate th e varying spectrum of culpability when sentencing for a broad category of conduct emphasis added.because material support providers often have been,and hopefully will continue to be,apprehended before the crimes that they foster come to fruition,the lack of physical injury is more likely to be the norm than the exception.
accordingly,the lack of injury here was not a fact of critical relevance distinguish ing stewart conduct not only from that of all her codefendants,but from the vast majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court.gall.at.giving the absence of harm mitigating significance thus not only fails to recognize the extreme seriousness of such crimes even without achievement of actual harm,it undermines one of a express goals eliminating sentencing disparities.see a united states simpson,cir noting that focusing on the defendant culpability instead of fortuity when sentencing prevents arbitrary disparities emphasis added.the happenstance lack of devastating injury implicit in terrorism crimes generally and stewart in particular simply can not bear the weight the district court assigned to it.cavera,at.the district court acted unreasonably by using the absence of proven harm to justify completely discarding the terrorism component of stewart crime and to support an unwarranted mitigation of the seriousness of the crime of conviction.see a a.
my colleagues in the majority also suggest that because stewart terrorism crimes preceded the events of september,her view of her own culpability might have been different than would be true after that tragic day.while such a lack of awareness may be true of the ordinary new yorker,such attribution is for stewart who,as abdel rahman lawyer,sat through extensive horrific evidence at his trial,including that the islamic group was responsible for the slaughter of scores of innocent tourists at luxor and the islamic group plans to bring new york to its knees by blowing up buildings,bridges,tunnels,and by assassinating the egyptian president while in new york city.
b.the absence of an enhancement for perjury and obstruction of justice 
after jettisoning the terrorism component of stewart crime in assessing the seriousness of stewart crime of conviction pursuant to a a,the district court then noted this guidelines absent the terrorism enhancement would provide for a sentencing range for stewart of either to months or to months,depending on whether the obstruction of justice enhancement applied.i join the majority view that the district court failure to make any findings regarding obstruction was procedurally unreasonable.op.at.the district court reason for not making such findings was that there was no point in doing so,because the terrorism enhancement took the guidelines sentence to the statutory maximum.after the district court rejected the terrorism component of stewart sentence,however,the obstruction enhancement became relevant to its hypothesis of a revised guidelines calculation.in addition,as the majority notes,it was error for the district court not to account for stewart potential perjury in the a calculus.see cavera,at.
c.the absence of an enhancement for abuse of trust 
the majority properly faults the district court for failing to explain how and to what extent the sentence reflected the seriousness of the crimes of conviction in light of the fact that stewart was a member of the bar when she committed them.op.at.the majority asks whether,in that light,her punishment should have been greater than it was,and then suggests the obvious answer.op.at.i agree with the majority criticism.as a guardian of the law,a lawyer has a special obligation to refrain from all illegal and morally reprehensible behavior.new york code of professional responsibility,preamble,ec effective through march.however,the majority does not go far enough.stewart was not just a lawyer who committed crimes.and she did not use her professional position simply to gain access to her client and to carry his jihadist messages by criminal means,conduct that,as noted in the previous section of this opinion reflects an extreme seriousness unreasonably overlooked by the district court.stewart also committed her material support crimes by garnering the trust of the government,and then blatantly violating that fiduciary obligation that lies at the core of the sams system and that protects the right to counsel,even for convicted terrorists.
under the guidelines,the enhancement applies when a defendant has abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.as the commentary explains,a position of trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion,for p ersons h
