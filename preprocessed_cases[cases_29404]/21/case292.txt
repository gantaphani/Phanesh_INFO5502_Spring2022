following his guilty plea,juan felix santiago rivera was sentenced to a term of immurement above the top of the applicable guideline sentencing range gsr.the defendant appeals,arguing that the district court failed to make an individualized assessment of his case and,in the bargain,imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.after careful consideration,we affirm 
the relevant facts are easily assembled.on march,a police officer saw the defendant walking down a road in morovis,puerto rico.the defendant fit the description of a suspect in an aborted carjacking that had been attempted earlier that day.the officer drew his sidearm and ordered the defendant to halt.in response,the defendant shot the officer,seriously wounding him.he then struck the officer in the head with his firearm,stole the officer gun,and fled in the officer patrol car.
in due season,a federal grand jury handed up an indictment against the defendant.count charged carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury,see count charged use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,see id.c a iii and count charged possession of a stolen firearm,see id.j,a.count carried a maximum incarcerative term of years,count carried a mandatory minimum and consecutive term of years,and count carried a maximum term of years.
after some preliminary skirmishing,the defendant pleaded guilty to all three counts.there was no concomitant plea agreement.the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psi report,which grouped counts and because they involved the same victim and were connected by a common criminal objective.see ussg.for the grouped counts,the probation officer recommended an adjusted offense level of and a criminal history category of iii.these calculations yielded a gsr of to months on the grouped counts.as to count,the psi report noted that the statutory mandatory minimum sentence was months and that any sentence on count had to run consecutive to whatever sentence was imposed on the grouped counts.
the psi report identified certain factors that might warrant an upward variance.those factors included the seriousness of the offenses of conviction,the defendant notorious history of criminal conduct,and his commission of violent acts for which he had not been charged.the probation officer also noted that charges,unrelated to the offenses of conviction,were pending against the defendant for attempted murder and illegal use of a firearm.finally,the psi report contained a victim impact statement describing the considerable physical,psychological,familial,and financial devastation wrought by the defendant attack.
at the disposition hearing,the district court accepted the guideline calculations limned in the psi report.defense counsel argued for a downward year sentence.the attorney emphasized that the defendant had endured a troubled childhood and asserted that he suffered from diminished mental capacity.the prosecutor rejoined that the victim had been forced to beg for his life after the defendant put a gun to his head,declared that the victim was lucky to be alive,and asked for a sentence of life imprisonment.the prosecutor argued that the defendant was a person who has no respect for the law and no respect for the life of others.
after hearing the lawyers importunings and giving the defendant an opportunity to allocute,the district court remarked the high incidence of violent crime in puerto rico including carjackings resulting in serious bodily harm and offenses involving f irearms like the one that the defendant possessed.the court went on to say that it was to consider puerto rico high firearms and violent crime rate in shaping the defendant sentence.
when all was said and done,the court varied upward and imposed an incarcerative sentence of months with respect to the grouped counts to be followed by a consecutive month term of immurement the statutory mandatory minimum on count.this timely appeal ensued.
before us,the defendant contends that his sentence is both procedurally flawed and substantively unreasonable.these two contentions pivot on a common theme that the district court focused too little on the potentially mitigating circumstances of his upbringing and mental capacity and too much on the high incidence of crime in the community.
federal criminal sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines regime are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,d united states martin,cir.within this rubric,we assay the district court findings of fact for clear error and its interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo.see united states walker,cir.if no procedural error emerges,the district court ultimate choice of a sentence is evaluated for abuse of discretion simpliciter.id.
we start with the defendant claim that the district court gave too short shrift to relevant sentencing factors while at the same time giving too much heft to peripheral factors.the general of sentencing factors is delineated in.it is common ground that a sentencing court may commit procedural error by failing to consider the a factors.gall,at.but the weighing of relevant factors is largely within the court informed discretion.united states clogston,cir.
the defendant does not contend that it was error for the district court to consider the puerto rico crime rate and kindred matters in reaching its sentencing determination.nor could he.we have squarely held that a sentencing judge may consider and geographic factors.united states flores machicote,cir.such an appraisal is appropriate because c considerations are inextricably intertwined with deterrence,and d eterrence is widely recognized as an important factor in the sentencing calculus.id.at citing a b.
here,the defendant makes a narrower argument he insists that it was error for the district court to put so much weight on these parochial concerns.this insistence is misplaced.although i t is possible for a sentencing judge to err by focus ing too much on the community and too little on the individual,id.at,that phenomenon did not occur here.
to begin,the sentencing judge explicitly noted that he had considered all of the section a factors.such a statement is entitled to significant weight,see,united states dávila gonzález,cir,and the record here offers no reason to doubt the judge word.indeed,the judge discussed albeit briefly a number of the section a factors,including the serious nature of the offenses of conviction,the defendant unattractive criminal history and the need for adequate deterrence.
so,too,the judge specifically addressed the defendant potentially mitigating personal background and traits.while he explained that he had considered the defendant arguments concerning these matters as well as the available documentation,he did not give them much credit.by the same token,he heard extensive arguments and engaged in a protracted colloquy anent the defendant claim of diminished mental capacity in the end,however,he was singularly unimpressed.
it would serve no useful purpose to cite additional book and verse.the short of it is that the record reflects that the sentencing court sufficiently reviewed the section a factors.on the one hand,the court considered the violent circumstances of the defendant crime and the implications of his criminal history on the other hand,it considered the defendant personal circumstances,including his claim of diminished mental capacity.the court weighed the aggravating factors more heavily than the mitigating factors,and then explained why a substantial upward variance was indicated.
the defendant alleges that the district court did not adequately explain his sentence see gall,at discussing sentencing court duty to adequately explain the chosen sentence.this allegation is belied by the record the court below may not have waxed longiloquent but brevity is not to be confused with inattention.united states turbides leonardo,cir.here,moreover,any gaps in the court reasoning can easily be filled by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.united states jiménez beltre,cir en banc.
this sort of triage is the essence of the
