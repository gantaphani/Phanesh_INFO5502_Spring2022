calvin johnson appeals from a criminal judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,entered october,on a plea of guilty without a plea agreement to a drug conspiracy in violation of a and,and to being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.a few months after his plea on july,but before his sentencing,johnson wrote to the district court seeking to withdraw his plea and replace his lawyer,asserting that he did not understand that his guilty plea would necessarily entail a mandatory life sentence.if he understood that the judge would have no discretion,johnson explained,he would have gone to trial.the district court denied the motion without a hearing,and johnson also appeals from that denial.
we conclude that johnson plea was not entered voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently.in the plea hearing,the impression was given that there was a range of sentencing options the judge spoke of the potential sentences the prosecutor gave an account of multiple maximum and minimum sentences,discussed supervised release,and warned of the forfeiture of rights including the right to hold public office and the court and prosecutor discussed sentencing guidelines ranges and judicial discretion to weigh the facts and circumstances.although the prosecutor at one point stated that a minimum sentence of life would trump other considerations,that critical advice was overwhelmed by incompatible advisories.the sentencing transcript suggests that johnson counsel on whom johnson would rely to sort it out may not have understood the inexorable nature of the sentence either.and johnson assertion that he would have gone to trial if he knew that a life sentence was foreordained is rendered plausible by the arresting fact that he derived absolutely no benefit or advantage from the plea.
accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and johnson plea,direct that the case be reassigned,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in october,a grand jury indicted calvin johnson on one count of participation in a conspiracy in violation of a and and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of g.the statutory determinants of his sentencing exposure appear relatively complex,but his actual sentence if convicted could hardly be simpler.
the firearm count,pursuant to a,carries a maximum sentence of ten years of imprisonment and no mandatory minimum.the drug count,pursuant to b a and,carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum that depends upon the application of enhancements the baseline is a mandatory minimum of ten years of imprisonment a prior conviction for a felony drug offense makes a defendant eligible for a mandatory minimum of twenty years and two such prior convictions make a defendant eligible for a mandatory life sentence.pursuant to,the imposition of an enhanced penalty is not automatic,but is triggered when the government files an information notifying the defendant in advance of trial or prior to the acceptance of a plea that it will rely on that defendant prior convictions to seek a penalty enhancement.united states labonte.
the government did seek an enhancement it filed an information establishing that johnson had been twice convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of new york state penal law.those judgments were entered nearly years earlier,in september and december of,when johnson was years old.johnson was incarcerated from until.he appears not to have had significant involvement with the criminal justice system after his release until he was indicted in the present case,when he was years old.
this indictment charges johnson with responsibility for drug trafficking that allegedly occurred in or through a nightclub that johnson operated in binghamton,new york.the weapon that gives rise to the firearm count was apparently discovered behind a jukebox.by operation of the information,conviction on the count entails a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.no other sentence is possible.
in march,johnson and his lawyer,lee kindlon,appeared by videoconference from albany before senior district judge thomas mcavoy in binghamton.the purpose of the hearing was to enter a guilty plea.judge mcavoy advised johnson that he had a right to appear in the same room and asked whether it was okay with him that they proceed by videoconference,and johnson said that it was.app.johnson had no plea agreement,but that circumstance was never mentioned at his plea hearing.it is not clear from the record whether his lawyer attempted to negotiate an agreement,or whether the government was willing.
in colloquy,the judge asked johnson whether kindlon had explained to him the potential sentences in the plural,or consequences of pleading guilty,and johnson said yes the judge asked him if he had understood them,and johnson said that he had.id.at.
later,the judge asked the prosecutor,miroslov lovric,to please advise johnson and the court what the maximum or any minimum penalties would be.id.at.lovric said that the possible maximum penalty is life imprisonment and that the mandatory minimum pursuant to statute is life imprisonment.id.he went on to add that there a supervised release term required of at least ten years that i f there any violation of the terms of supervised release,the court would have the power to add an additional five years of imprisonment for any violation thereof that the second count had a possible maximum sentence of ten years with no mandatory minimum required and that,with respect to both counts,in addition to these possible maximum penalties,johnson would lose certain rights,including the right to vote,to possess a firearm,to hold certain public offices,and to obtain certain licenses.id.at.he summed up,saying that he believe s those are the possible maximum penalties and the statutory minimum penalties.id.at.
without discussing the prosecutor remarks or asking johnson whether he understood them,judge mcavoy then addressed johnson 
t he court also has to inform you that under and pursuant to certain sentencing guidelines that used to be mandatory but are no longer mandatory but still must be considered by the sentencing court,that my discretion in sentencing you is thereby affected and the court must enforce the law as it stands today but sometimes the court can sentence you above the guidelines,below the guidelines or e ven outside of the guidelines depending upon the facts,the circumstances and the law that brought to the court attention at or about the time of sentencing.
id.at.he asked whether johnson understood what i just said about the sentencing guidelines and johnson said yes.
judge mcavoy asked the prosecutor for a preliminary guidelines calculation,and lovric then delivered about two pages of transcript in the jargon of the united states sentencing guidelines.he described one calculation with the result that the guidelines range is to life,another that is also to life,another that would be to months,another that would be to months,another that is to months and one that is to months.id.at.he then added 
all of the guideline provisions i just described are nevertheless trumped by the fact that the statutory mandatory minimum is a life term under section b a sic and as i indicated that is the statutory mandatory minimum in this case when i indicated the possible penalties under count one.so the guidelines are trumped by that statutory mandatory minimum.
id.at.without commenting on the prosecutor description of the guidelines calculations or asking johnson whether he understood their applicability or that,as a practical matter,they simply had no applicability because of the mandatory life sentence,the judge asked johnson,now that you heard about the statutory sentence and guidelines,do you still wish to plead guilty johnson said,yes,your honor.
judge mcavoy then turned his questioning to johnson lawyer.kindlon described his background and his experience,including dozens of cases over more than a decade.he also said that he and members of his firm had spent dozens and dozens of hours on johnson case,in preparation,reviewing all the documents,going over them with johnson and even trial prep over the past weekend and then meetings yesterday with johnson in preparation for today plea.id.at.the judge asked him whether he knew of any defenses that would prevail at trial and kindlon answered that a gain,your honor,after going over this thing from soup to nuts over the weekend,we could think of nothing.no viable defense to the charges.id.at.the judge asked if kindlon knew any reason why johnson should not plead guilty,and kindlon said no.there is nothing to suggest why johnson in the midst of trial preparation would knowingly elect to plead when a plea could yield no discount from the worst that could happen at trial.
judge mcavoy accepted and entered the plea.
on june,just shy of four months after his plea hearing johnson sent a handwritten letter to judge mcavoy requesting that his plea be withdrawn and that kindlon be replaced 
my plea was not made knowingly or voluntar il i was mislead and ineffectively assisted by my attorney into believing that your honor could sentence me to a sentence lower than the statutory sentence provided in section b a of the sentencing codes.
during my plea allocution you stated that you had the power to go above,below,or even outside the guidelines depending on the laws at the time of my sentencing.i misunderstood you to mean you could sentence outside of the statutory sentences as well.
without being lead to believe this by my attorney i would never have plead guilty to charges that sentence me to a mandatory term of life in prison.
i have everything to gain going to trial versus just accepting a life sentence.khindlon has provided me with ineffective assistance,not only by advising me to plead guilty to a mandatory life sentence,but also by stating to me as well as stating to your honor on the plea allocution record that he can not come up with a defense.
id.at.it does not appear that kindlon was asked to respond.in any event,he did not.the government filed an opposition.
a few days after the date of johnson letter,but one day before it was filed by the clerk,kindlon filed a sentencing memorandum.that memorandum does not mention the mandatory sentence.it argues that the enhancement should not apply and that the court should use a ratio.it thus assumes application of the sentencing guidelines,even though they could have no effect as a result of the mandatory sentence.the government sentencing memorandum responds to those arguments but also points out that the mandatory life sentence applies.
on october,judge mcavoy ruled without a hearing,denying the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and to replace kindlon.most of the decision is a detailed restatement of the plea hearing it concludes that johnson under oath,informed the court that he understood the charges against him and the consequences of pleading guilty,and that his attorney had explained both to him,and therefore that his claims here are contradicted by his own sworn statements at the plea allocution.id.at.
on october,johnson and kindlon appeared before judge mcavoy for sentencing.the judge asked kindlon what he would like to say on behalf of his client,and kindlon briefly discussed the phenomenon of overly harsh sentences and seemingly asked the judge to use discretion though he could not lawfully do so 
w e stand here next to johnson on sic watching the sands shift in front of us in terms of the sentencing guidelines and i only ask that the court take this into consideration so we not standing here in five years or ten from now,you know,asking to have johnson resentenced to something other than what he may be sentenced to today,something much less.i ask the court to be prospective in how it sentences johnson.look at all the things he done and balance them against the things which he pled guilty to and sentence him accordingly.
id.at.judge mcavoy said that he thought a more appropriate sentence would be something in the neighborhood of months but that he was bound by the law.id.at.accordingly,johnson was sentenced to life in prison.
with new counsel,johnson appealed.he argues that his guilty plea should be vacated because it was not knowing,intelligent,and voluntary that his motion to withdraw the plea should have been granted and that it was an abuse of discretion to deny his motion to replace counsel without a hearing.
discussion 
a guilty plea operates as a waiver of constitutional rights,including the rights to a jury trial and against,and it is therefore valid only if done voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently,with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.bradshaw stumpf,quoting brady united states.
procedurally,pleas are governed by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.given the constitutional implications,this circuit has adopted a standard of strict adherence to rule and therefore we examine critically even slight procedural deficiencies to ensure that the defendant guilty plea was a voluntary and intelligent choice,and that none of the defendant substantial rights has been compromised.united states livorsi,cir.quotations,citations,and modifications omitted.when a rule violation is raised in the district court,this court reviews for harmless error.see united states tien,cir.in demonstrating harmless error,it is not enough to negate an effect on the outcome of the case.rather,the government must prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
rule provides that the court must address the defendant personally in open court and must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands a long list of things,fed.crim.b,including any maximum possible penalty and any mandatory minimum penalty.id.b h i.the district judge in this case did not personally inform the defendant of any sentence at the plea hearing,but it is enough that the court directed the prosecutor to do so.the baffling complexity of the prosecutor account did,however,render serious the failure by the court to confirm that johnson understood the sentence that his guilty plea entailed.johnson says that he was confused,and it is easy to see how that might be.johnson was not trained in the law.
the most significant fact for johnson at his plea hearing a fact that he had to understand for his plea to be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent was that life imprisonment was the certain consequence of pleading guilty.this was not merely a potential sentence,or one possible maximum among other possibilities,but his certain and inevitable sentence upon conviction.by pleading guilty,he was effectively sentencing himself to spend the rest of his life in prison yet this fact was not conspicuous at his plea hearing,which included discussion of many other possible though actually impossible sentences and robotic references to inapplicable calculations and judicial discretion.
johnson plea hearing,in relevant part,proceeded in three explanatory stages,each of them comprehensible only from the perspective of a lawyer or judge for whom plea hearings are routine.
the prosecutor first lengthy recital,specifying the possible maximum,a mandatory minimum,the loss of certain rights,and statutory periods of supervised release with additional terms of incarceration for violations,was technically sound,but
