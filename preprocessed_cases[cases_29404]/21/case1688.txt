the united states appeals from so much of the april,final judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut alfred covello,judge as sentenced john canova to a term of probation after a jury trial at which defendant was found guilty of various substantive and conspiratorial crimes relating to his involvement in a medicare fraud.the government asserts that the district court erred in refusing to apply loss and obstruction enhancements to the calculation of canova sentencing guidelines,and in granting a downward departure based on defendant history of public service and good works.canova defends the district court sentencing rulings but from its denial of his motion for a new trial.
we reject canova argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a new trial,and,accordingly,affirm the judgment of conviction as it pertains to canova guilt.as for the government sentencing challenge,its request for de novo review of the district court departure decision pursuant to e is now foreclosed by united states booker,d,which specifically excises e from federal sentencing law and instructs that sentences be reviewed on appeal only for reasonableness.because the reasonableness of a sentence,even under the discretionary regime recognized in booker,depends in part on a district court consideration of the sentencing guidelines,see a,a significant error in the calculation or construction of the guidelines may preclude affirmance.see united states rubenstein,cir.we conclude that there was such an error in the district court calculation of the loss amount relevant to the fraud guideline,but we find no error in the district court rejection of a guidelines enhancement for perjury nor in its exercise of guidelines departure authority based on defendant public service and good works.accordingly,we remand the case with directions to vacate the sentence and to resentence consistent with this opinion and the supreme court decision in booker,and not inconsistent with united states crosby,cir.
background 
a.the crimes of.the charges 
john canova,who at the relevant time served as vice president for operations of raytel cardiac services,raytel,was charged in a indictment with conspiring to defraud the united states from october through october by making false statements to medicare agents in violation of,and to influence,obstruct,or impede a medicare audit in violation of,see falsely representing in a december,letter to medicare that raytel was in compliance with medicare specifications for testing pacemakers when he knew that it was not,see id.making a similar false representation in a january,letter to a medicare auditor,see making various false representations with respect to raytel records and archive system in a march,letter to a medicare auditor,see obstructing a medicare audit on january,by directing raytel connecticut employees falsely to represent that raytel was in full compliance with government testing specifications,see id.and obstructing a criminal investigation by making false statements to federal agents on june,with respect to raytel pacemaker testing,see id.
count six was dismissed prior to trial for reasons not relevant to this appeal.on the remaining charges,a jury found canova guilty on counts one,two,three,and five,and not guilty on count four.in light of that verdict,and the district court subsequent denial of a motion for a new trial,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting any inferences that the jury might have drawn in its favor.united states boyd,cir quoting united states salameh,cir per curiam accord united states rubenstein,at.
the conspiracy to defraud medicare 
raytel pacemaker testing for medicare 
at times relevant to the indictment,raytel performed transtelephonic pacemaker testing for medicare patients at government expense.transtelephonic monitoring allows a technician at a remote location to test the operation of a pacemaker by having a patient use a portable device to transmit telephonic signals that can then be converted into a conventional electrocardiogram ecg report for review by a supervising cardiologist.
for medicare to cover the expense of its transtelephonic testing,raytel was obliged to comply with section of the medicare coverage issues manual,which required that a pacemaker be monitored in three functioning modes for thirty seconds each,with the results recorded on strips of magnetic tape the test.see medicare program national coverage decisions,at the of the test,a technician records on a magnetic strip the pacemaker operation for thirty seconds in a or demand mode,during which the pacemaker supplies an electric charge to the heart only when it senses that the organ is falling behind the programmed heart rate.at the second step,a technician records a strip of the pacemaker operation for thirty seconds in a magnetic mode,during which the patient uses a magnet to close a switch inside the pacemaker,causing the device to fire an electric charge to the heart at regular intervals regardless of the patient pulse.this exercise typically reveals whether the pacemaker battery needs to be replaced and whether the heart is properly responding to the charge firing.at the third step,a technician records a strip of the pacemaker operation for a final thirty seconds in the mode,during which the magnet is removed and the pacemaker is allowed to return to functioning.this segment of the test permits a technician to verify that a pacemaker internal switch has reopened and that the patient has suffered no ill effects from the constant firing of the pacemaker during the phase of the test.
because a cardiologist would typically need to review only representative segments of the first two phases of the test,a technician would generally attach only strip excerpts to the report submitted to the doctor,providing the full test results upon specific request.before,when raytel switched to computerized testing,its technicians were able to prepare strip excerpts from the first two test modes as the third was concluding.because the computer only displayed information as it was being recorded,however,it took longer for technicians employing this technology to identify and prepare representative strips.this delay in processing assumed significance in the aggregate because of the number of tests each raytel technician was expected to in from to to forty tests per day this,in turn,led some raytel technicians to depart from medicare specifications and to record only an abbreviated no strip at the last test phase.at trial,the government offered evidence indicating that,in the period december to march,technicians at raytel connecticut facility complied with medicare pacemaker testing specifications only to percent of the time.
canova involvement in the fraud scheme 
at trial,canova did not seriously dispute raytel with medicare testing requirements.rather,he challenged the government ability to prove his knowing participation in any scheme to defraud the government in connection with these tests or to obstruct a medicare audit.
to carry its burden on the issue of canova guilty knowledge,the government relied on both circumstantial and direct evidence.as background,it sought to demonstrate that it was canova heightened performance quotas that led raytel technicians to abbreviate the test.ronald vincent,a former manager of raytel connecticut facility who pleaded guilty to obstruction pursuant to a plea agreement,testified 
john canova would call and want to know why,what are we going to do to get to that target,depending on,you know,if we were fairly close,you know,it would be that bad,but if we were far behind on target,john would be pretty animated as to why we were not on target,and want to find out why we were on target,and what we were going to do to get close to being on target.
trial tr.at.
various employees of the connecticut facility,including vincent,his predecessor alexander puziak,and technician dawn amaro,testified that,under pressure to meet the higher quotas,technicians began to cut short the phase of the test.amaro explained that,instead of recording a full strip for this phase,some technicians would run or seconds of strip,thereby converting the required test into a test.id.at.
sometime before leaving raytel employ in october,puziak brought this fact to canova attention,reporting that there were some individuals not in compliance with the test requirements.id.at.when canova replied t hat everyone had to be in compliance,that nothing could suffer,puziak told him that such a demand was unreasonable in the allotted time.id.
by the spring of,connecticut managers and technicians were so frustrated with canova performance quotas that with the last phase of the test had become routine.vincent bluntly reported this situation to canova look,it not an option of not doing the demand after magnet in the computer anymore.we not doing it,period.there no demand after magnet being done,period,in the computer,no one doing it id.at.raytel manager glenn pelletier,also testifying pursuant to a cooperation agreement,stated that in march,he too told canova that technicians were not performing the entire test all the time.id.at.
sometime in,a notice was posted at the connecticut facility instructing technicians that they were not required to run any strip for the phase of pacemaker testing they could simply listen to the transmitted signal to satisfy themselves that the pacemaker had returned to its functions.steven boecklin,another connecticut manager,testified that this action had its origins in a conversation in which canova suggested that the medicare manual requirement of a minimum seconds of readable ecg strip might be construed not to require a technician to create a contemporaneous strip of the phase of the test because such a strip,if needed,could be generated later from the archived recording of the telephone call.id.at.boecklin stated that when he attempted to confirm this interpretation with medicare,the persons with whom he spoke could not answer his questions.nevertheless,he and vincent decided that there was,in fact,a loophole in the medicare requirements that did not require a tape of the test 
canova efforts to obstruct the medicare audit 
the health care financing administration hcfa,part of the department of health and human services administers and supervises the medicare program by contracting with private carriers,who,among other things,receive,disburse,and account for medicare funds paid to the providers of covered services.see.during the times relevant to this case,medicare connecticut carrier,united healthcare insurance company united healthcare,received an anonymous complaint suggesting that raytel was not in compliance with medicare specifications for transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring.after reviewing medical records,united healthcare informed raytel by letters dated october,october,and december,that it refused to pay or was seeking reimbursement for having paid medicare claims for monitoring that failed to produce test strips for each of the three required test modes.the december,letter explicitly warned raytel that misrepresenting your services to medicare is a fraudulent situation and that the inspector general has the authority to exclude from coverage your services should you decide to continue to bill your services incorrectly to medicare.letter from united healthcare to raytel of,at.
in a december,letter that was the basis for the first substantive charge,canova appealed medicare reimbursement demands,falsely insisting that raytel ha s complied with all relevant regulations.letter from canova to united healthcare of.indeed,canova specifically stated that raytel was complying with medicare requirements for the production of strips at each phase of the testing process the guidelines require that a monitoring service obtain a strip in mode,seconds in magnet mode and seconds after magnet.raytel obtains these strips utilizing its pc based testing system.id.
canova appeal prompted a medicare audit of raytel connecticut facility.the day before the auditors january,inspection,canova sent an to raytel connecticut managers that was the basis for the substantive obstruction charge.noting that the focus of the audit was medicare requirement that raytel take seconds of ecg,canova instructed the managers to tell the auditors that raytel do es follow the required procedures for the production of these strips,when,in fact,he knew that was not the case.from canova to meroe of.
at the conclusion of its tour,the audit team asked raytel to produce monitoring records from june through december for fifteen pacemaker patients.by the end of the day,raytel could supply testing records only for september and october,showing six seconds of data.nevertheless,in a january,letter to the head of the audit team that was the basis for the second substantive charge,canova falsely asserted that raytel standard operating procedure was to obtain the full seconds of ecg required by medicare as outlined in publication,section,part b,definition of transtelephonic monitoring.letter from canova to toor of,at.canova further represented that raytel would promptly retrieve and forward to the auditors a complete printout of the entire recording for the tests of the fifteen patients you asked to see.id.at.
by march,it was apparent that raytel could not supply the requested records.the audit team nevertheless decided to treat its review of raytel operation as educational and to require the company to reimburse medicare only for those fees referenced in united healthcare december,letter or paid on behalf of the fifteen patients whose records could not be produced during the audit.otherwise,raytel was afforded thirty days to correct deficiencies in its archive system and to certify that raytel is in compliance with medicare regulations and that the data in its records meet all the requirements for pacemaker testing as listed in publication,section of the mcm.letter from toor to canova of.
on march,canova ordered vincent to prepare a chart identifying the fifteen patients whose records had been sought by the auditors as well as the months when raytel had tested their pacemakers.vincent transmitted the information to canova by telefax,only to have the chart returned to him the same day,also by telefax,with certain dates blacked out.canova instructed vincent to retrieve copies of raytel summary reports for the remaining dates and to delete from those reports certain signatures to make it appear that they had been printed directly from archive records.pelletier,whom vincent recruited to help with this task,testified that vincent told him that canova wanted the records cleaned up,because he represented to medicare that raytel computer system could produce these,and it ca.trial tr.at.both vincent and pelletier testified that they transmitted the altered reports to canova in new york 
pelletier further testified that,in march,at canova request,he attempted to retrieve raytel full computer records for certain pacemaker patients.of thirty retrieved reports,only one demonstrated compliance with medicare test specifications.when,in a march,telephone conversation,pelletier so advised canova,canova directed that the records be sent to him.
testifying contrary to puziak,vincent,pelletier,and boecklin,canova stated that it was not until march,when he reviewed the documents forwarded by pelletier,that he learned that connecticut technicians had not been complying with medicare test requirements.see id.at canova instructed his new york and connecticut supervisors to issue memoranda to raytel technicians emphasizing the need to obtain a total seconds of strip to satisfy medicare testing specifications 
a few days later,on march,canova wrote to the chief medicare auditor.without any mention that raytel had now located some of the test records formerly requested,much less that those tests demonstrated the company with the test,canova reported simply that the company had established a new archive system populated with tests starting with december,and that he was certifying raytel compliance with medicare regulations for tests conducted after that date.letter from canova to toor of.
b.the rule motion for a new trial 
the timing of the motion 
two days after verdict,on september,canova moved,with the government consent,for an extension of the time to file motions to october of that year.the court granted the motion on october.on october,canova sought and the court granted another unopposed extension to october.
the grounds for seeking a new trial 
on october,canova moved for a new trial pursuant to,on the ground that the government evidence,particularly as to his guilty knowledge,was flawed,contradictory,and in some respects false.
canova argued that vincent testimony about canova returning the march,telefax transmission with certain test dates blacked out was belied by trial evidence,specifically,the fact that the cover sheet for the telefax had not been found in vincent connecticut office,and the condition of the telefax found in canova new york files suggested that the dates had been blacked out before canova received the document.further,canova reported that investigation into the operation of his telefax machine and telephone numbers demonstrated the falsity of vincent account.canova submitted that the telefax legend at the bottom of the document found in his file was properly understood to indicate its receipt,not.he submitted that the difference between the legends at the top and bottom of the retrieved document could be explained by the discovery of a comparable time discrepancy in the internal clocks of canova and vincent telefax machines.
canova further argued that the prosecution had unfairly insinuated that he had lied on in explaining that the deletion of certain information from a pacemaker test report found in his files was done to permit the document to be used for marketing purposes he offered a affidavit from raytel marketing manager,indicating that such redactions were consistent with her department practices.
canova also argued that the march,donovan memorandum did not support the government suggestion that raytel new york technicians were not complying with test requirements.he offered a affidavit from michael donovan stating that his memorandum was intended to remedy a different problem the tendency of technicians to run both the demand and the demand after strips in the demand screens of their computers.donovan aff.donovan explained that in january,he had instructed technicians that they needed to show the test in the magnet screen.id.his march,memo was intended to communicate the need to record the entire test in the screen,and to highlight the impropriety of recording part of the test on that screen and part on the demand screen.id.
the district court denial of a new trial 
although the government opposed canova rule motion as both untimely and lacking in merit,the district court agreed only with the latter argument.in an unpublished memorandum opinion,the court concluded that a jury could reasonably have found from the trial evidence that canova,in an effort to increase the volume of tests and revenue,had importuned technicians at raytel to skip the third medicare testing requirement not take the minimum seconds of ecg strips in each of the three portions of the test.united states canova,cr avc,at.further,the jury may have reasonably found that in order to conceal raytel with the monitoring requirements,the defendant conspired to obstruct a federal audit,and knowingly made false statements to medicare representatives.id.
insofar as canova specifically challenged the government proof of his guilty knowledge,the court summarized the testimony of puziak,vincent,and pelletier,and concluded therefrom that the jury could reasonably have found that,as early as,defendant knew that raytel was not complying with medicare testing specifications,id.at,and that his knowledge of this problem continued into december and january,when he made the false statements of which he was found guilty,id.at.
to the extent canova presented new evidence to challenge the prosecution case,the court decided that no new trial was warranted because the defendant had failed to prove that he was justifiably ignorant of said evidence at the time of the trial despite due diligence.id.at.the court rejected the suggestion that the prosecutors had presented improper argument or evidence at trial,so as to excuse canova failure to secure the aforementioned evidence for trial.in any event,the court concluded that,even if canova new arguments might add new support to his claim of innocence with a second jury,he ha d not demonstrated a miscarriage of justice or exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant a new trial.id.at.
canova sentencing 
the probation department,in its report psr to the court,recommended that canova total offense level under the sentencing guidelines be calculated by grouping the four counts of conviction pursuant to b and using the fraud guideline then applicable to the substantive and conspiratorial crimes,see a stating that for offenses grouped pursuant to b,the offense level for the group should be determined by reference to the highest offense level of the counts in the group.following this path,the psr calculated canova base offense level at six,see id.a,with enhancements of thirteen levels for a loss to medicare,see id.b n two levels for more than minimal planning,see id.b a two levels for leadership role,see id.c and two levels for obstruction of justice based on his trial testimony,see id.with a total offense level of,and a criminal history of i,the psr reported canova sentencing guidelines range at to months of incarceration.the psr also noted,however,three grounds for a possible downward departure the loss determination might be viewed to overstate the seriousness of the offense,see id,cmt.canova work as a volunteer firefighter might be considered extraordinary community service,id.and these two factors in combination,if not individually,might take canova case outside the heartland of the guidelines,see id.
canova filed written objections to the psr proposed loss and obstruction enhancements and moved for a downward departure based on a history of public service and good works.the government did not respond to defendant guidelines objections either in writing or when afforded an opportunity to be heard orally by the court,nor did it object to a departure.
in considering canova objections,the district court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support a loss calculation of five million dollars.sentencing tr.at.it observed that to find such a loss,it would have to conclude that raytel abbreviated tests were worthless.and there simply was not evidence that the tests were of no value.id.at.to the contrary,defense evidence indicated that no loss,or no value was lost,by the abbreviation of the required tests.id thus refusing to apply any loss enhancement to the calculation of canova fraud guideline,the district court decided to adopt an alternative method of calculating the disposition here.id.it relied on rather than to determine the applicable guidelines range.see sentencing guidelines manual,app.a identifying as appropriate guideline for violations of identifying as appropriate guideline for violations of see also a.
starting with the base offense level of twelve prescribed by,the district court applied a enhancement for canova leadership role,see c,but rejected any further enhancements.specifically,the court declined to apply a obstruction enhancement for canova trial testimony,see id,observing that such an enhancement would require it to find that the defendant not only perjured himself,but he did so with the specific intent to obstruct justice.sentencing tr.at.upon review of the case massive record,the court concluded that it was unable to find that there was such a specific intent.id.thus,with a total offense level of and a criminal history of i,canova faced a guidelines sentencing range of to months of incarceration.
the court decided not to sentence canova within this range,but to grant a downward departure in consideration of service to his country and his community,which included six years service in the united states marine corps,exemplary and many times courageous service as a volunteer firefighter,and good samaritan aid to three total strangers who were in extreme medical distress.id.at.the court further supported its departure decision by reference to trial evidence suggesting that medicare representatives could not themselves tell from the language of medicare policy that the demand after magnet phase of this test was required.id.at.
accordingly,on each of the four counts of conviction,the district court sentenced canova to one year of probation,a fine,and a special assessment,the sentences to run concurrently as to the probation term and fine,consecutively as to the special assessment for a total of 
ii.discussion 
we address canova from the district court denial of a new trial before the government appeal of canova sentence because a favorable ruling on the would render the government sentencing challenge moot.
canova motion for a new trial 
canova asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial pursuant to.the government submits that we can reject this argument on either of two grounds the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain canova rule motion because it was not timely filed,or the district court denial of the motion was well within its discretion.while canova motion may,indeed,have been untimely,recent supreme court precedent casts doubt on whether such a defect is properly characterized as jurisdictional.see kontrick ryan,d.if the defect is not jurisdictional,the timeliness challenge is necessarily forfeited because the government initially consented to the filing extension that it now claims the district court was not empowered to grant.see id.at.noting that a critical difference between a rule governing jurisdiction and an inflexible rule is that the latter can be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.the parties did not have the benefit of kontrick when they briefed the question of jurisdiction nevertheless,we do not request further submissions on the issue because the government jurisdictional challenge,at best,raises a statutory not a constitutional concern,see fama commissioner of corr,cir noting that the supreme court has barred the assumption of hypothetical jurisdiction only where the potential lack of jurisdiction is a constitutional question,and its alternative argument that the district court did not abuse its discretion clearly supports affirmance.
the timeliness of canova rule filing 
a.the filing limitations of rule 
rule states that u pon the defendant motion,the district court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.a.the time limits for filing a rule motion are as follows 
newly discovered evidence.any motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence must be filed within years after the verdict or finding of guilty.
other grounds.any motion for a new trial grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed within days after the verdict or finding of guilty,or within such further time as the court sets during the period.
b these time limits were expressly framed to resist ad hoc relaxation and,thus,may fairly be characterized as rigid.carlisle united states,d ginsburg,together with souter and breyer,concurring discussing identical language in.prescribing time limits for filing a motion for a judgment of acquittal.indeed,the sternness of rule time limitations is emphasized by rule b.subpart of that rule recognizes that district courts generally enjoy broad discretion to extend filing times under the federal criminal rules either a before the originally prescribed or previously extended time expires or b after the time expires if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.b,but subpart identifies a specific exception to this principle the court may not extend the time to take any action under rules,and,except as stated in those rules emphasis added.see also carlisle united states,at.rejecting argument that a district court retains inherent authority to grant extensions outside the time limits identified in the rules referenced in rule b 
rule states that a district court may extend the time for filing new trial motions,but only if the court takes such action during the period following the verdict or finding of guilty.b.moreover,the plain language of the rule does not contemplate extensions the further time within which a defendant must file a rule motion must be set during the seven day period.id.emphasis added.reading rule to mean what it says a court can only extend the time in which to grant a motion for a new trial if a court fixes such time within days of the verdict or finding of guilty.united states hall,at construing identical language in rule united states hocking,cir explaining that district court lacked authority to extend time to file rule motion after period had elapsed.
in this case,although the district court october,order extending canova rule filing date to october,fell within the prescribed period,see.a specifying rules for calculating time,the court subsequent october,order granting canova a further extension to october,fell well outside that narrow window.accordingly,it appears that the district court was prohibited from entering the october order or entertaining the october motion.
in an effort to avoid this result,canova asserts that his october,filing does not depend on the district court untimely october,extension order.rather,he insists that his filing was timely under the district court october,order.canova notes that the district court itself characterized its october,order as one extending canova filing time until october,plus any reasonable additional time that canova needed to file the motions.canova reply br.at quoting united states canova,cr avc,at.we accord substantial deference to a district court construction of its own orders,united states spallone,cir,but the construction can not be based on an error of law,see generally zervos verizon new york,cir.the construction that canova attributes to the district court would be so impermissibly based because an extension bounded only by reasonableness fails to comport with the rule mandate that any extended filing time be set during the period following verdict.
in reaching this conclusion,we note that the language cited by canova plus any reasonable additional time that canova needed to file does not actually appear in the district court october,order.that order simply states that canova september,motion is granted.united states canova,cr avc.nor did canova employ the quoted language in his motion,such that the district court succinct order might be construed to adopt the motion prayer for relief.what canova requested was an extension of the time to file motions to a specific date,october,with a boilerplate request for such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.motion for extension of time to file motions,at.the reasonable conclusion to draw from this motion and the court order is that the court granted canova request to extend his filing time to october,but did not identify any other just and proper relief to be granted on october.
canova submits that a broader construction of the court october order is supported by the context in which the ruling was made.he points specifically to a telephone conversation between his counsel and the trial judge law clerk occurring on september,two days after verdict.in that conversation,counsel advised the clerk that he intended to seek a extension of the prescribed time to file motions.the clerk responded favorably and,representing that he was speaking for the court,advised counsel that any reasonable extension beyond the three weeks would also be granted.grudberg aff.at.because the district court accepted counsel account of this conversation as correct,we do likewise.nevertheless,it makes no difference to the outcome.because rule requires a court to set any further time for the filing of a rule motion within seven days of verdict,a court could not expand its extension authority by granting a defendant timely rule relief to some indefinite additional time that the court may subsequently deem reasonable.such an extension order would be erroneous as a matter of law 
in sum,because the only extension date actually set by the district court within seven days of verdict was october,and because canova failed to adhere to that deadline,the district court was not authorized under rule to entertain his untimely october,motion.in view of the perils involved in timely pursuing extensions to move for a new trial pursuant to rule or a judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule,trial counsel would be well advised,on rendition of a verdict,to make an oral motion for a new trial or judgment of acquittal asking the court to extend time for briefing,where necessary rather than simply to request additional time to make the motion.
b.the jurisdictional implications of rule filing limitations 
because the government initially consented to canova filing his rule motion on october,its timeliness challenge to the motion,even if meritorious,is necessarily forfeited unless the error is jurisdictional.see kontrick ryan,at.this court has previously characterized the time limits of rule as jurisdictional,see united states mccarthy,cir united states lussier,cir,as have our sister circuits,see,united states glenn,cir united states eberhart,cir united states correa,cir united states erwin,cir united states emuegbunam,cir united states villalpando,cir united states hall,at united states quintanilla,cir united states gaydos,cir united states smith,cir united states cook,cir.this is hardly surprising given the supreme court characterization of rule b strictures on extensions of time as mandatory and jurisdictional.see united states robinson,d.
more recently,however,the supreme court has reminded us that j urisdiction is a word of many,too many,meanings.kontrick ryan,at.quoting steel citizens for better env t,d.as a result,courts,including the supreme court,have been less than meticulous in using the term,frequently employing jurisdictional to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court,when the word should,in fact,be reserved for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.id.at.in making this point,kontrick specifically contrasted the supreme court past use of the term jurisdictional in united states robinson,at,to refer to the time limitations of.b,with its careful avoidance of that term in carlisle united states,at,when analyzing the time limitations of rule,see also id.at.ginsburg,together with souter and breyer,concurring expressing view that rules and are simply tight time prescriptions,not limitations on a court subject matter jurisdiction.
in light of kontrick discussion of the ambiguity in the word jurisdictional,it might be appropriate for us to explore the meaning of our past characterization of rule filing limitations as jurisdictional.but see united states eberhart,at continuing to treat rule as jurisdictional because kontrick did not specifically overrule united states robinson,at,or united states smith.we are loath to do so,however,in this case in which the parties filed their briefs without the benefit of kontrick.while we could,of course,request supplemental briefing,there seems little point in putting the parties to that extra burden because,even if,in the end,we were to reject the government jurisdictional challenge and to consider its timeliness challenge forfeited,we would still undoubtedly affirm the district court denial of a new trial because the record amply demonstrates that this ruling was well within the court discretion.accordingly,because the jurisdictional challenge in this case is statutory rather than constitutional,we may assume hypothetical jurisdiction,see fama commissioner of corr,at,and proceed to explain our reasons for reaching that conclusion,leaving to another day resolution whether rule time limits are appropriately characterized as jurisdictional in light of kontrick.
the district court rejection of the motion on the merits 
even if canova rule motion had been timely filed,that would not entitle him to relief on appeal because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying him a new trial.as canova acknowledges,a trial court exercises broad discretion in ruling on a new trial motion,and we review its decision deferentially,reversing only for abuse of discretion.united states ferguson,cir.in considering whether to grant a new trial,a district court may itself weigh the evidence and the credibility of witnesses,but in doing so,it must be careful not to usurp the role of the jury.see united states autuori,cir accord united states ferguson,at.the ultimate test is whether letting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice there must be a real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted.united states ferguson,at citation and quotation marks omitted see also united states,cir per curiam.
in concluding that this case does not present such a concern,the district court pointed to a number of prosecution witnesses who had offered direct evidence of canova guilty knowledge of the raytel testing fraud and of his active role in deceiving medicare auditors about this fraud.canova argues that these witnesses were not credible because their accounts were riddled with inconsistencies,and they had motives to testify falsely.these arguments,however,were forcefully presented to the jury through the vigorous and arguments of canova able trial counsel.nevertheless,the jury,which had the opportunity to see the witnesses testify,to weigh their testimony against the other evidence in the case,and to hear the arguments of the prosecution,found canova guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on four of the five charges tried.only exceptional circumstances warrant a district court intruding upon the jury function of credibility assessment,united states sanchez,cir accord united states ferguson,at united states autuori,at,and the experienced trial judge found none in this case.to the contrary,he explicitly found that the jury could reasonably have concluded from the totality of the evidence that canova had importuned raytel employees not to comply with medicare testing requirements and had then made false statements to conceal this conduct.under these circumstances,the district court decision not to grant canova a new trial fell well within its broad discretion.
the fact that canova proffered some new evidence in support of his rule motion warrants no different conclusion.when a defendant proffers new evidence to support a rule motion,a court may appropriately consider whether counsel could have discovered the evidence with due diligence before or during trial the evidence demonstrates that a witness in fact committed perjury the new evidence is material and the new evidence is not cumulative.united states middlemiss,cir.as the district court observed,canova new evidence,which essentially derived from raytel employees and records,was certainly available to him at the time of trial.canova assertion that he had no reason to procure this evidence for trial because he had not anticipated certain government tactics and arguments is unconvincing.the evidence in question all pertained to matters that canova knew would be in issue at trial,even if he did not know the government exact position on these matters.in any event,the evidence,even when viewed most favorably to canova,did not demonstrate any witness actual perjury.at best,it would have afforded defense counsel additional grounds on which to impeach prosecution witnesses whose credibility had already been vigorously challenged or to bolster canova own suspect credibility.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such evidence was insufficient to raise a real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted.united states ferguson,at citation and quotation marks omitted see generally united states monteleone,cir noting that inconsistencies in testimony do not,by themselves,demonstrate that the witness actually committed perjury for purposes of reviewing a new trial motion united states gambino,cir nondisclosure of cumulative evidence tending only to further impeach a witness general credibility is not grounds for granting a rule motion.
in sum,assuming jurisdiction to hear canova new trial motion,we conclude that the denial of that motion on its merits was not an abuse of the district court discretion.accordingly,we reject defendant and affirm so much of the judgment of conviction as establishes his guilt on the four specified crimes.
canova sentence 
the government appeals canova probationary sentence on the grounds that the district court miscalculated his sentencing guidelines range and,in any event,erred in granting him a downward departure based on extraordinary public service and good works.to the extent it urges this court to examine the departure decision de novo pursuant to e,as amended in by the protect act,see,stat,united states simmons,cir,such review is now foreclosed by the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,which,inter alia,excised e from federal sentencing law to permit the federal sentencing guidelines to be treated as advisory rather than mandatory,thereby surviving a sixth amendment challenge,see id.at.booker instructs that sentences should be reviewed on appeal only for unreasonableness.id.at.
in applying this more deferential standard of review,we focus primarily on the sentencing court compliance with its statutory obligation to consider the factors detailed in a.id.at noting that a factors will guide appellate courts,as they have in the past,in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.prior to booker,sentencing courts understandably gave predominant,indeed controlling,weight to two factors identified in a the sentencing range established by the federal sentencing guidelines,see id.a,and the pertinent policy statements of the sentencing commission,see id.a.to assess whether this formerly common error resulted in an unreasonable sentence in a particular case,this court has remanded unpreserved sixth amendment challenges to sentences to the district court for it to determine if a defendant sentence would have been materially different if the court had understood that the guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.see united states crosby,at.
this case differs from most appeals in that the defendant raises no sixth amendment challenge to his probationary sentence.rather,the government complains that the district court miscalculated the applicable guidelines as well as misapprehended its departure authority within the guidelines system.the argument is not rendered irrelevant by booker.as crosby recognized,even under an advisory guidelines system,district courts will normally have to determine the applicable guidelines range in the same manner as before booker,id.at,in order to decide whether i to impose the sentence that would have been imposed under the guidelines,a sentence within the applicable guidelines range or within permissible departure authority,or ii to impose a sentence,id.at in united states rubenstein,we recently ruled that a guidelines error that appreciabl y influence s this decision could render the final sentence unreasonable.at.
thus,we review the government sentencing challenges to determine whether any error presents this concern so as to warrant remand for resentencing.
the enhancement challenges 
a.the fraud loss 
the government contends that the district court erred in concluding that no loss enhancement to the base offense level for fraud,see a,was supported by the evidence.it asserts that the record compelled a enhancement because defendant crimes caused or were intended to cause a loss to medicare of million.see id.b n.we review the factual determinations underlying a district court loss calculation at sentencing for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.see united states garcia,cir.explaining that clear error standard of review remains applicable for appellate challenges to judicial at sentencing after united states booker united states selioutsky,cir recognizing that,after excision of e,court continues to review issues of fact for clear error see also united states crosby,at observing that,with the mandatory use of the guidelines excised,a court identification of the applicable sentencing range to be considered pursuant to a proceeds in the same manner as before booker.
because fraud is a crime of infinite variety,see generally united states altman,cir,it presents particular challenges for sentencing courts striving to achieve proportionality in sentencing while reducing unwarranted disparity,see generally sentencing guidelines ch,pt.identifying reduced disparity and proportionality based on the severity of the offense as two key goals of the sentencing reform act of,et united states booker.at explaining that sentencing contemplates consideration of guidelines to serve goals of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities and proportionality.the sentencing commission has identified loss as a critical factor in assessing the relative seriousness of a fraud offense it defines loss as the value of the money,property,or services unlawfully taken from the victim,cmt,and provides for a series of step increases from the base offense level of six depending on the dollar loss at issue in the particular fraud offense,see id.b.
the commission has long recognized that the calculation of exact loss amounts in individual cases is no easy task.accordingly,it instructs that,in applying the sentencing guidelines,loss need not be determined with precision a sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.id,cmt.see united states carboni,cir united states crosby,at noting,in deciding whether to impose a sentence,judges might avoid the need to resolve all of the factual issues necessary to make precise determinations,in appropriate cases,of monetary loss where either of two sentencing ranges is applicable.the district court acknowledged this principle,but concluded that the government had failed to adduce reliable evidence that it had sustained any loss from the testing fraud.indeed,it noted that the defendant evidence suggested that medicare had suffered no loss of clinical value.we identify two flaws in this analysis.
a victim who pays for goods or services on the fraudulent representation that they conform to certain specifications has sustained a loss 
to the extent defendant adduced evidence that the tests performed by raytel were as clinically sound as the tests required by medicare,this fact does not mean that the government sustained no loss from the charged fraud.canova fraudulent representations did not,after all,pertain to the clinical value of the tests performed,see,cmt.a they pertained to the particular test specifications being performed,see,cmt.c.when a party fraudulently procures payment for goods or services by representing that they were produced or provided according to certain specifications,it is not the task of a sentencing court to the victim judgment as to the necessity of those specifications.whether the testing time on a pacemaker,the number of rivets on an airplane wing,or the coats of paint on a refurbished building is a matter of necessity or whim,the fact remains that the victim has been induced to pay for something that it wanted and was promised but did not get,thereby incurring some measure of pecuniary loss.see united states bhutani,cir ruling that loss calculation did not depend on whether defendant fraudulent adulteration of a drug in fact had an adverse medical effect there was a loss because consumers did not get what they bargained for united states maurello,cir noting that a victim who contracts to have a building constructed according to certain specifications and receives the services for which he bargained sustains no loss despite the fact that he has received them from a person who was not legally authorized to offer them jacob youngs,kent,cardozo,explaining that doctrine of substantial performance is available only to the transgressor whose default is unintentional and trivial by contrast,t he willful transgressor must accept the penalty of his transgression.for him there is no occasion to mitigate the rigor of implied conditions.citations omitted.
united states chatterji,cir,discussed at length by the parties,is not to the contrary.in that case,the fourth circuit concluded that a defendant fraudulent representations to the food and drug administration fda to secure approval for a particular drug did not cause any loss to consumers because the marketed products were exactly what they purported to be.id.at.under the circumstances,the court viewed the fraud as purely regulatory nevertheless,it expressed little doubt that economic loss would exist if a drug with fda approval is something less than it is represented to be.id.at see also,cmt.f v iii now providing special rule for loss calculation in cases involving regulatory approval obtained by fraud.in this case,the tests for which the government paid raytel millions of dollars were not exactly what they purported to be,tests,but something less with respect to the specified production of thirty seconds of magnetic tape in the final test phase.similarly distinguishable is united states schneider,a case finding no loss to a victim where the defendant procured a contract by fraud but thereafter performed to the perfect satisfaction of the contracting agency,cir in this case,raytel did not perform to the perfect satisfaction of the government.instead,the very essence of canova fraud scheme was to conceal from the government the fact that raytel was not performing pacemaker tests according to medicare specifications in order to induce payments that would otherwise not have been made.
this does not mean that a victim loss in a substitute goods or services case necessarily equals the full contract price paid.the guidelines suggest that,in such cases,loss is properly measured by looking to the reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose,plus the reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to the victim operations caused by the product substitution,cmt.c.in some circumstances,product adjustments may so easily be accomplished that the fraudulent substitution causes the victim only a small loss.in other circumstances,where the goods or services must be recommissioned,the loss may be considerable.but in no case do the guidelines contemplate a court rewriting the parties contract to excise specifications paid for but not received and,thereby,concluding that the victim sustained no loss.
the government does not appear to have urged the district court to engage in any calculation of loss along the lines outlined in note c.we need not here consider whether such a calculation could be made on the present record because,for reasons discussed in the next section,we conclude that the government right to recoup monies paid raytel for testing not conforming to specifications provides a satisfactory alternative for calculating intended loss.before turning to that discussion,however,we reiterate the key point of this part of our analysis a party who contracts to have goods produced or services performed according to certain specifications,and who pays for those goods or services in reliance on a fraudulent representation that they conform to the specifications,has sustained a measure of pecuniary loss for purposes of calculating the fraud guideline,and a defendant can not avoid a loss enhancement by offering evidence that no one other than the victim places any value on the demanded specification.
the defendant fraudulent scheme to prevent medicare from recovering payments made to raytel pursuant to the testing fraud itself caused a calculable intended loss 
the sentencing commission has clearly stated that if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.id,cmt.as this court explained in united states carboni,i ntended loss is tantamount to the probable loss from a particular misstatement because one is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of one acts.at quoting united states jacobs,cir quotation marks omitted.canova submits that intended loss has no bearing on the calculation of his guidelines range because it pertains only to unconsummated frauds,and his charged fraud was complete.we are skeptical as to whether fraud lends itself to the bright line drawing urged by canova,but we need not resolve that question in this case because defendant conspiratorial crime,in fact,involved two closely related fraud schemes.
canova completed conduct relates only to the first fraud raytel procurement of millions of dollars in medicare funds through false representations that it was testing pacemakers in accordance with government specifications.this was understandably the focus of the district court attention when it considered whether the government had sustained a loss from raytel abbreviated testing procedures.but canova also engaged in a second fraud,which was not fully consummated as a result of government detection.pursuant to this fraud,canova made further false representations to medicare agents to obstruct an audit of raytel,thereby preventing the government from recovering monies paid to raytel pursuant to the testing fraud.indeed,each of canova substantive convictions involved false statements made in furtherance of this second fraud.
the parties apparently agree that the government,through its carrier united healthcare,was legally entitled to recoup from raytel its full payment for any pacemaker tests not performed according to medicare specifications nor does there appear to be any question that canova was aware of this right.united healthcare december,letter demanded that raytel reimburse medicare its payment for two pacemaker tests that did not conform to specifications.the auditors march,letter also ordered raytel to reimburse medicare the monies paid for fifteen tests that raytel could not document complied with specifications.canova trial testimony made plain that he understood what was at stake i processed in connecticut about,tests a month.that a large bullet to take as a financial hit.trial tr.at.
the intended loss calculation from a fraud scheme aimed at preventing this recoupment is,therefore,relatively straightforward the medicare payments to raytel for pacemaker testing during the period covered by the audit approximately million can be multiplied by the percentage of tests found not to comply with medicare specifications to percent.opting for a more conservative approach,the government urged the district court to conclude that at least percent of raytel tests did not conform to medicare specifications,resulting in a loss of million.this loss amount finds support not only in the cited trial evidence,but in raytel own acceptance of a restitution order as part of the plea agreement in its criminal case.while canova may not be bound by raytel acknowledgment of this restitution obligation,such an admission by a perpetrator of the charged fraud scheme precludes a court from concluding that no reliable evidence supports a loss calculation.
in sum,although a district court enjoys considerable discretion in calculating the loss applicable to a particular fraud,the record in this case did not permit it to conclude that the government sustained no loss from canova fraudulent schemes to substitute an abbreviated pacemaker test for the longer one required by medicare specifications and to conceal that fraudulent substitution in order to prevent the government from exercising its right to recoupment.the record supports an intended loss of recoupment in an amount of million,and such a loss should have been factored into the guidelines considered by the district court in imposing sentence.
because there is a significant difference between a guidelines range calculated to include this loss and the guidelines range relied upon by the district court,the error might well have affected the ultimate sentence,even though the district court applied a downward departure.see generally united states elefant,cir recognizing that t he degree of downward departure appropriate from one starting point will not necessarily be the same as is appropriate from a lower or higher starting point.indeed,such an appreciable influence could obtain even under the discretionary sentencing regime that will govern a resentencing,because the applicable guidelines range may serve as a benchmark or a point of reference or departure as the court exercises its expanded discretion.united states rubenstein,at.we do not here decide that every incorrectly calculated guidelines sentence will necessarily require a remand for resentencing.see id.at cardamone,concurring cautioning against such a conclusion.we conclude simply that the influence of a error in the calculation of a fraud guideline has sufficient potential to appreciabl y influence the ultimate sentence even under the more discretionary sentencing regime to warrant a remand with instructions to vacate canova sentence and to resentence him.id.at,united states godding,cir per curiam ordering crosby remand and noting concern that the brevity of the term of imprisonment imposed does not reflect the magnitude of the theft of nearly over a period,explaining that a a requires sentencing court to consider the need for sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense quotation marks omitted.
b.the perjury enhancement 
the government argues that the district court further erred in failing to enhance canova offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to in light of his trial perjury.in reviewing a challenge to a district court application of,we examine its findings of fact only for clear error,and whether those facts constitute obstruction of justice is a question of law that we review de novo.see united states garcia,at see also united states crosby,at.
section provides for a enhancement if a defendant willfully obstructs or attempts to obstruct justice in the course of prosecution.see.the relevant commentary identifies perjury as conduct that can trigger this enhancement.see,cmt.b.the government submits that the district court,therefore,likely relevant case law because it stated that a enhancement required it to find that the defendant not only perjured himself,but that he did so with the specific intent to obstruct justice,sentencing tr.at,when obstructive intent is already an element of perjury.the government further contends that the trial record compelled a finding that canova intended to obstruct justice,and that the district court findings to the contrary were not sufficiently specific to permit review.we reject these arguments as uniformly without merit.
to begin,we reject the government contention that the district court misunderstood the elements of perjury.as the supreme court recognized in united states dunnigan,the criminal law establishes three elements for perjury false testimony given under oath or affirmation concerning a material matter given with the willful intent to provide false testimony,rather than as a result of confusion,mistake,or faulty memory,d citing see also leonard sand,et,modern federal jury instructions criminal,instr.acknowledging that some of its own precedents had not interpreted perjury to constitute obstruction of justice unless the perjury is part of some greater design to interfere with judicial proceedings,united states dunnigan,at,the supreme court ruled that,when a defendant objects to a enhancement based on trial testimony,a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice,or an attempt to do the same,under the perjury definition we have set out,id.at.emphasis added.
following dunnigan,this court,in united states zagari,stated that to base a enhancement upon the giving of perjured testimony,a sentencing court must find that the defendant willfully and materially committed perjury,which is a the intentional b giving of false testimony c as to a material matter,cir accord united states,cir per curiam indeed,zagari emphasized that the willfulness contemplated by was distinct from the intent required to prove perjury.see at.the former refers to a defendant specific purpose of obstructing justice,whereas the latter refers to his purposeful giving of the false testimony.id.in light of this distinction and zagari identification of perjury as one of three elements necessary to a enhancement,we can not conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in observing that application of a enhancement required it to find more than perjury.it was further required to find that the perjury had been committed with the specific intent to obstruct justice.
the district court having correctly identified the applicable law,its conclusion that the requisite obstructive intent was not established by a preponderance of the evidence is a finding of fact to which we accord considerable deference.indeed,because a witness obstructive intent,like his credibility,is sometimes revealed by the demeanor of his testimony as well as its content,we are particularly hesitant to a trial judge finding that a witness testimony,though perjurious,was not specifically intended to obstruct justice.see generally mathie fries,cir noting particularly strong deference due a district court findings of fact based on credibility assessments of witnesses it has heard testify while the government points us to certain statements by canova that are not easily attributed to confusion or mistake,or to some purpose other than obstruction,we can not conclude that the record as a whole leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court erred in failing to find obstructive intent established by a preponderance of the evidence.united states united states gypsum.accord mathie fries,at.
finally,to the extent the government suggests that the district court findings on the issue of obstructive intent were inadequate,this court has already ruled that a district court is not required to support a decision not to apply an obstruction enhancement with specific findings of fact.see united states vegas,cir.
for all these reasons,we find no error in the district court decision not to apply an obstruction enhancement to the calculation of canova sentencing guidelines range.
the departure from the guidelines range 
the government argues that the district court overstepped its departure authority under the guidelines when it granted canova a downward departure based on public service and good works.defendant submits that the government failure to object to this departure ground in the district court waives the argument on appeal.we agree and specifically reject the government attempt to excuse its omission by claiming lack of adequate notice to the challenged departure before sentencing.nevertheless,because we remand this case for resentencing and because a contemplates consideration of policy statements issued by the sentencing commission,including departure authority,united states crosby,at,it is appropriate for us briefly to explain why we reject the government departure challenge on the merits 
sentencing guideline states that m ilitary,civic,charitable,or public service contributions and similar prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.as the government concedes,the guideline generally discourages departures on the stated grounds it does not bar them absolutely.in such circumstances,even under a mandatory guidelines system,a court was authorized to grant a downward departure if the discouraged factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.koon united states,d accord united states sprei,cir.
the record plainly demonstrates the exceptional degree of canova public service and good works.as a college student,he volunteered for the marine corps,in which he honorably served his country for six years,mostly in the active reserves.for seven years,he also served his long island community as a volunteer firefighter,sustaining injur
