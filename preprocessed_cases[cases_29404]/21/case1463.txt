background 
of the events leading to the guilty plea 
timewell,a native of new zealand,was engaged as an international distributor and smuggler of drugs over a period of many years.he began his career as a local distributor of marijuana in australia and new zealand and expanded his interests to become a financier and organizer of worldwide smuggling operations.his successful efforts in distributing tons of hashish and marijuana in the united states and elsewhere enabled him to accumulate millions of dollars in personal assets.
the specific enterprise giving rise to the prosecution leading to this appeal was an undertaking by timewell,along with patrick bowler and stephen johnson,to smuggle tons of hashish through new york for distribution in upstate new york and canada.efforts to accomplish this goal occurred between and,but the goal never was realized.the enterprise was infiltrated by undercover agents of the drug enforcement administration dea.one undercover agent was recruited as a ship captain to the hashish from a mother ship in the and to smuggle the drugs into long island,new york.the agent was to be paid to cover his expenses for the,arrangements for payment having been made by timewell through johnson.before the offloading could take place,the mother ship,sailing from pakistan under the direction of bowler,sustained mechanical failure.the ship was rerouted,and its load of drugs ultimately was smuggled into portugal and ireland.timewell and johnson were arrested in canada in.timewell subsequently waived extradition to the united states.
timewell was indicted in the eastern district of new york for operating a continuing criminal enterprise,conspiracy to import kilograms or more of hashish and marijuana into the united states and conspiracy to distribute kilograms or more of hashish and marijuana.the indictment included a demand for forfeiture of o ne h undred m illion d ollars in united states currency and property constituting the proceeds of and derived from,directly and indirectly,the foregoing offenses.timewell early on manifested a desire to cooperate with the government.upon his arrival in the united states,he was extensively debriefed by agents of the dea as well as officials of foreign governments.he provided information to them about his own criminal conduct and assets and shared with them his knowledge regarding the activities of the with whom he associated in the united states and throughout the world.
in a cooperation agreement dated february,timewell agreed,inter alia,to plead guilty to conspiracy to import hashish into the united states and further agreed to provide truthful,complete,and accurate information to the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york.timewell also agreed to testify at any proceedings,regardless of location,when requested to do so by the office and to make full and complete financial disclosure.the agreement identified numerous assets belonging to timewell,consisting of bank accounts as well as real estate and currency in various countries throughout the world,all of which he agreed to forfeit to the government.for its part,the government agreed,inter alia,to file a motion pursuant to guidelines manual and e with the sentencing c ourt setting forth the nature and extent of timewell cooperation,thereby enabling the court to impose a sentence below the guidelines range and below any applicable mandatory sentence,and not to oppose a downward adjustment of three levels for acceptance of responsibility under guidelines manual.the agreement provided that,as determined by the united states attorney office,if timewell intentionally violated any provision of th e agreement,he would not be released from his plea of guilty but th e office would be released from its obligation a not to oppose a downward adjustment of three levels for acceptance of responsibility,and b to file the motion described relating to the nature and extent of timewell cooperation.timewell pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge on february.
timewell entered into a supplemental plea agreement with the united states attorney dated march,in which he agreed to waive indictment and plead guilty to a superseding information charging him with making a false statement to federal officers in violation of.this charge was occasioned by the discovery that timewell had misled agents regarding more than million in swiss francs that he had concealed in switzerland.the discovery came about through continuing investigations relating to the arrests of timewell,including bowler,who was arrested in switzerland.confronted with his failure to reveal these drug proceeds,timewell arranged through his counsel to surrender to the government in swiss francs,that amount being the remainder of the proceeds.timewell story was that he originally believed that the funds in question had been removed by bowler or those acting for bowler.he later learned that jim wilson,a canadian friend,had obtained the money and was sending monthly payments to timewell family.timewell failed to notify the government of these developments and thereby violated the terms of his cooperation agreement.it is not contested by the government that timewell otherwise provided extensive and substantial assistance to the government in identifying and describing the international narcotics operation of numerous individuals,including bowler,thomas sherrett,and michael vondette,timewell having testified as a witness at the trial of vondette.see united states vondette,d.
ii.of the sentencing 
the report recommended a total offense level of.starting with the base level of,predicated upon kilograms of marijuana,see a,four levels were added for leadership role,see a,and two levels were added for obstruction of justice in the concealment of assets,see.from the levels thus arrived at was subtracted levels for acceptance of responsibility,see,with level as the final result.applying criminal history category i as recommended,the guidelines sentencing range was months of incarceration.prior to sentencing,the government submitted pursuant to a letter dated march,setting forth the basis for its recommendation that the court grant a significant downward departure in formulating timewell sentence.the letter,signed by an assistant united states attorney for the eastern district of new york,described in detail timewell extensive cooperation with the authorities and noted that the information provided was detailed,corroborated and consistently aided the agents in developing their investigation.according to the letter,timewell substantial assistance resulted in the arrest and conviction of major drug violators and the seizure of millions of dollars in drug proceeds.
timewell was sentenced on march.during the sentencing proceeding,timewell counsel,urging a substantial guidelines reduction,recounted at length timewell extensive cooperation,assistance to various law enforcement authorities,and testimony provided at the trial of vondette.before imposing sentence,the court noted that timewell had not fully cooperated and therefore was in violation of the cooperation agreement.counsel for timewell pointed out that the calculation accounted for that by including a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.the court responded 
i saw that.but it does affect the g uidelines as such,the g uideline computation.
as i said in percent of the cases where this happens the government says you do get any cooperation letter by breaching your opportunity to cooperate fully.and that a fact i had to take into consideration in this case with respect to other features.
the court then observed that,according to the report,
information received from the government indicates that between january and may timewell and others conspired to import and distribute kilograms of hashish into the united states via pakistan.this has been going on for many,many years.
the volume is staggering of what timewell did.it mind boggling,with the exception of vondette.it is one of the biggest i have ever come across in my years here.
the court further observed 
the money involved in addition to the drug quantities is mind boggling.it is to me,maybe not to other people but it is an enormous amount of money involved.
were it not for the government letter i would have had no hesitancy in imposing months,the upper end of the g uidelines and departing upward.
so i will depart down effectively from the months,and that to the minimum of months.
the court also imposed a term of imprisonment of months on the false statement count,to be served concurrently.a timely appeal followed.
iii.of the initial appeal 
on his initial appeal,timewell 
assert ed that his sentence was unconstitutional because it was premised on facts not proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury as required by the sixth amendment,see blakely washington,d and the district court erred in granting a departure from the guidelines because a it mistakenly thought defendant guidelines were not affected by his conviction,and b it was improperly influenced by the united states attorney office policy of not making specific sentencing recommendations in connection with its motions.
united states timewell,cir.we rejected these arguments,holding that downward departure from the sentencing guidelines generally is not reviewable on appeal,that even if the district court erred in misapprehending the effect of the conviction on the guidelines calculations a fact of which we were not convinced,it was not mistaken that the false statements had obstructed justice and therefore properly considered that fact in determining the extent of departure,id.at and that there was no abdication of judicial responsibility,since the district court carefully considered the parties submissions as well as the facts outlined in the report,id.as to timewell claim that the sentence was imposed in violation of his sixth amendment rights,we made the following determination in light of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,and this court decision in united states crosby,cir,this case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in conformity with crosby.id.at.
iv.of the proceedings on the crosby remand 
seeking on remand a sentence significantly lower than the term of imprisonment handed down on march,timewell attorney submitted to the court a letter dated july,arguing that timewell original sentence was keyed to the mandatory guidelines then in place and urging a sentence taking into account the factors set out in a.in the letter,counsel recounted the extensive cooperation provided by his client to the authorities and again explained timewell failure to disclose his knowledge of the transfer of the million swiss bank account.counsel took special note of the sentence imposed upon sherrett,whose original sentence of months which took into account a downward departure for assisting a prison guard attacked by inmates was reduced to months for cooperation,which included testimony at the trials of vondette.counsel letter concluded as follows 
i urge your honor to reflect carefully about an error you may have made with regard to the guidelines computation relating to the conduct,to consider the sentence you imposed on codefendant thomas sherrett,and to consider the government functional equivalent of its highest recommendation of timewell as the best of cooperators in this case.
the government submission on remand consisted of a letter dated july,signed by assistant united states attorney burton ryan.the letter included a brief review of the history of the case and a description of the purpose of a crosby remand as well as the procedure to be followed on such a remand.noting that the government letter enabled the court to depart from the guidelines and impose a sentence of months,the letter concluded as follows 
o nly the court can determine to what extent the then mandatory nature of the guidelines a ffected the sentence the court imposed.the question of whether the sentence would have been materially different if the guidelines were only advisory,we leave to the court discretion.
an additional submission came in the form of a letter dated july,from david katz,president and ceo of global security group.katz was a former special agent of the drug enforcement administration and was the agent charged with debriefing timewell.in his letter to the court,katz detailed the extensive information he gleaned from timewell cooperation during the period.according to katz,the overwhelming majority of information provided by timewell was previously unknown to the government and would never have been known without timewell cooperation.katz characterized timewell as an extremely valuable source of information that furthered the investigation he had been conducting.katz noted that the international drug trafficking information provided not only furthered his own investigation but was also provided to the law enforcement authorities of canada,switzerland,australia,thailand,belgium,pakistan,singapore,spain,portugal,the netherlands,ireland and the united kingdom.
in a letter submission dated september,counsel for timewell noted that timewell cooperation was much more extensive than that of sherrett.counsel also noted that assistant united states attorney ryan had commented as follows in comparing the sentences of timewell and sherrett while their roles were similar,the amounts of the drugs sherrett was held accountable for were much less.alteration in original emphasis omitted.
the proceedings on remand concluded with extensive arguments by counsel and colloquies with the court on september.counsel for timewell argued that more culpable than timewell received more lenient sentences,with special references to sherrett and johnson.although johnson was sentenced after this court ordered timewell crosby remand,the government had consented to an adjournment of timewell crosby hearing to permit consideration of johnson sentence,which was to a term of incarceration of fifteen years months.
at the hearing,assistant united states attorney charles kelly advised the court that timewell may have been put in a situation worse than johnson because of his extensive disclosures.he noted that dealing with johnson proffers was like pulling teeth and that johnson was in no way as forthcoming as timewell.johnson did not receive a letter recommending consideration for his cooperation.kelly referred to the good faith of timewell and made this statement and so we ask the c ourt to give serious consideration and weight to the argument that there should not be a significant disparity between johnston sic and timewell.
despite the urging of the government,the district court was concerned that timewell failed to disclose the account in switzerland and therefore,in accordance with past practices in the united states attorney office,should not have had the benefit of the cooperation letter supplied by the government 
well,mainly my understanding of this case,probably,and the principle that the attorney office in this is unique as far as any district is concerned in this country as far as i can you did cooperate properly,and you violated your agreement with the government and did give full and accurate descriptions of everything,you lose all your benefits.not just a partial,or not just some of it,but all benefits in the cooperation letter.
now,when you hide million dollars in drug money in switzerland,and it comes out through other sources than the happened to that rule 
assistant united states attorney kelly,to whom the court remarks were addressed,responded that his office decided to continue with the cooperation and penalize him by having him plead to the false statement charge.kelly went on to emphasize the importance of timewell cooperation and the resultant benefit to the government,specifically pointing out the disparity in sentences between timewell and johnson and the failure of johnson,who did not receive a letter,to make full disclosure.the court persisted in expressing its concern 
i n several prior cases,the moment a defendant has told the government a material falsehood,the g uidelines go like hard rock rules in those days.and there was no such thing as a reduction once he has taken that position.and i think there was a universal rule.i know it happened many times in this court.
timewell counsel then stated that in his experience t here is no rule that requires the government to shred a cooperation agreement for failure to disclose assets.the court responded there is no rule.but it has been invoked in this c ourt more times than you can imagine.in a later colloquy with timewell counsel in which counsel argued that the court had erroneously referred to the government customary practice as a rule,the court responded t hey said to me it was a rule.and they have been representing that to me for years not my rule.i certainly do make up the rules.
the district court also discussed with the government the sentencing range that would have applied to timewell absent the submission of a letter.kelly indicated that timewell was at an offense level of at one point,which carried a minimum sentence of life imprisonment.the district court appeared to accept this summary of the applicable guidelines calculation,suggesting that timewell had benefitted substantially from his cooperation since he received a sentence of only months.in fact,however,and as previously noted,timewell actual guidelines sentencing range was to months,not life imprisonment as represented by the government.
of the decision on remand 
by memorandum and order entered on october,the district court issued its decision on remand.classifying the matter before it as a motion to reconsider its sentence,the court noted that counsel had advanced a claim of unwarranted disparities.according to the district court,timewell counsel put forth the names of four defendants for comparison as similarly situated to timewell michael vondette,mark johnson,patrick bowler and thomas sherrett.the court reviewed the sentences imposed upon these and the quantities of marijuana for which they were held responsible and found that timewell was in a position different from the others 
the major factor in the difference between timewell and three other,bowler and and is the fact that timewell violated his plea agreement with the government by failing to reveal five million dollars in drug proceeds that he had concealed in europe.when confronted with this fact,he revealed only sic,leaving about for which there has been no account.
in view of the foregoing facts,the court justified its disparate treatment of timewell as follows 
in innumerable cases notwithstanding counsel for timewell claim to the contrary that have come before this c ourt,the government has advised that when a defendant violates his plea agreement with the government,the agreement is voided.this court took that into account in substantially increasing timewell sentence from what it otherwise would have been.
emphasis supplied.accordingly,the court denied timewell motion and this appeal followed.on appeal,timewell argues that the district court decision was procedurally as well as substantively unreasonable.he also requests that any remand of his case be to a different judge for sentencing.
of the district court mandate on remand 
following the supreme court determination in united states booker,d,that the sentencing guidelines were to be considered advisory and not mandatory,this court formulated the rule in crosby for plain error review of sentences.see united states garcia,cir discussing rationale and procedure for crosby remand.concluding that such a review requires a resolution of the issue of whether the sentence originally imposed is materially different from the sentence that would have been imposed under the booker regime,we formulated the protocol now known as the crosby remand to enable the district court to decide the issue in the first instance.on such remand,district judges are to sentences in light of the following 
a ny of the errors in the procedure for selecting the original sentence would be harmless,and not prejudicial under plain error analysis,if the judge decides on remand,in full compliance with now applicable requirements,that under the regime the sentence would have been essentially the same as originally imposed.conversely,a district judge decision that the original sentence would have differed in a nontrivial manner from that imposed will demonstrate that the error in imposing the original sentence was harmful and satisfies plain error analysis.
accordingly,the question to be resolved by the district court is whether the challenged sentence is materially different from the one that the district court would have imposed with a correct understanding of federal sentencing law as now explained by the supreme court.garcia,at.if the district court decides not to resentence,it should explain that decision on the record if it decides that the sentence should be vacated,it must resentence in accordance with booker,with an explanation.crosby,at.the explanation referred to in crosby is required by c,which provides in part that t he court,at the time of sentencing,shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.
to sentence in compliance with booker,the court is constrained to consider the sentencing factors set out in a 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant 
the need for the sentence imposed 
a to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense 
b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct 
c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and 
d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,medical care,or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner 
the kinds of sentences available 
the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for 
a the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to a 
any pertinent policy statement a issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to a 
the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct and 
the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.
however,all sentencing proceedings must commence with the district court calculation of the applicable guidelines range,with the guidelines as the starting point and the initial benchmark.gall united states,d.the court must then consider all the a factors and then undertake an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.id.at.if a sentence is indicated,the court must consider the extent of the deviation from the guidelines and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.id.finally,a fter settling on the appropriate sentence,the district court must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.id.citation omitted.
of the standards of review 
following booker,we are constrained to review sentences for reasonableness.see booker,at.see also united states fernandez.reasonableness review requires an examination of the length of the sentence substantive reasonableness as well as the procedure employed in arrivi
