this criminal appeal challenges a sentence for a narcotics violation on the ground that the government violated the plea agreement by recommending a sentence higher than the range estimated to be applicable at the time of the plea.the appeal also challenges the reasonableness of the sentence,which included months imprisonment.carlos macpherson appeals from the april,judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york dora irizarry,district judge.applying plain error review to the challenge to the plea agreement,see puckett united states,d,we conclude that,if any error occurred with respect to the plea agreement,it was not plain error,and that the sentence survives review for reasonableness.we therefore affirm.
background 
macpherson and his were charged in a three count indictment with various narcotics offenses.pursuant to a plea agreement,macpherson pled guilty to one count,which charged him with conspiring to import into the united states grams or more of heroin and five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of,a,b a,and b b ii.in conformity with united states pimentel,cir,the government included in the plea agreement its estimate of a likely guidelines sentencing range.the agreement stated,in pertinent part 
the office will advise the court and the probation department of information relevant to sentencing,including criminal activity engaged in by the defendant,and such information may be used by the court in determining the defendant sentence.the office estimates the likely adjusted offense level under the guidelines to be level calculated from base offense level,see c,less levels for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a.this level carries a range of imprisonment of to months in criminal history category i.if the defendant pleads guilty on or before june,the government will move the court,pursuant to.b,for an additional reduction,resulting in an adjusted offense level of.this level carries a range of imprisonment of to months,assuming that the defendant will be sentenced within criminal history category because the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence is ten years imprisonment,the applicable guidelines range is expected to be to months.the defendant stipulates that his sentence should be calculated based on a drug type and quantity of fifteen kilograms or more of a substance containing cocaine and waives any right to a jury trial in connection with such issue.
the guidelines estimate set forth in paragraph is not binding on the office,the probation department or the court.if the guidelines offense level advocated by the office,or determined by the probation department or the court,is different from the estimate,the defendant will not be entitled to withdraw the plea.
the office agrees that 
based upon information now known to the office,it will 
take no position concerning where within the guidelines range determined by the court the sentence should fall and 
make no motion for an upward departure under the sentencing guidelines.
if information relevant to sentencing,as determined by the office,becomes known to the office after the date of this agreement,the office will not be bound by paragraphs b and c.
at the plea hearing the district court,after ascertaining that the defendant understood the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty,stated 
let me just also remind you that by entering into this plea agreement you have stipulated that your sentence should be calculated based on the drug type and quantity of kilograms or more of a substance containing cocaine and that you have waived any right to a jury trial in connection with any such issue,do you understand that 
the defendant answered,yes.
the court then discussed the guidelines and stated 
the bottom line is that until the date of sentencing when we get a presentence report,as i said before,and i hear from you,your lawyer and from the government,we will not know with any certainty what the guidelines will be or whether there will be grounds to depart from them or whether the court will impose a sentence,do you understand that 
the defendant answered,yes.
in response to the court inquiry,the prosecutor stated that the government estimates that the defendant would fall within adjusted offense level with a sentencing range,because of the ten year mandatory minimum,of to months.the court then ascertained that the defendant understood that these are all estimates that are not binding on the government,probation or the court and that if this estimate is wrong,that you will not be permitted to withdraw your plea of guilty.
the court then turned to the specifics of count one,reading it verbatim to the defendant,including the references to importing grams or more of a substance containing heroin and kilograms or more of a substance containing cocaine.the defendant explicitly acknowledged repeatedly traveling to peru to make arrangements to purchase heroin and meeting a courier at john kennedy airport who was carrying ten kilograms of cocaine.
the court accepted the guilty plea to count one.
the presentence report psr determined that the defendant conspired to import and distribute fifteen kilograms of cocaine and seven kilograms of heroin.the psr recommended an upward adjustment of levels for the role that the defendant played in the offense,managing criminal activity involving more than five conspirators.as a result,the psr found appellant total offense level to be,levels higher than the estimate of in the plea agreement.the sentencing range at offense level in criminal history category i is to months.
at sentencing,the defendant objected to the four level enhancement for his role in the offense and the inclusion of the seven kilograms of heroin in the determination of his offense level.the defendant did not object on the basis of the inconsistency between the estimate of the guidelines sentencing range in the plea agreement and the psr,nor did he seek to withdraw his guilty plea.the government advocated a sentence based on seven kilograms of heroin,in addition to the cocaine,and a role adjustment.the district court overruled the defendant objections,reviewed the section a factors,and determined that a sentence was not appropriate.the court also found that the defendant had not been forthright in his acceptance of responsibility.the court found that the defendant offense level was with a sentencing range of to months and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a special assessment.
discussion 
there are two issues for review whether the government violated the plea agreement and whether appellant sentence at the high end of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate.
claimed violation of the plea agreement 
standard of review.although we have previously ruled that a defendant need not object in the trial court in order to preserve for appeal a claim that a plea agreement has been violated,see,united states griffin,cir united states lawlor,cir,the supreme court has more recently ruled that such claims are to be reviewed only for plain error in the absence of objection in the trial court.see puckett.at.to prevail on plain error review,an appellant must show that there is error,it is plain,it affects a substantial right,and it seriously affects the fairness of the judicial proceedings,resulting in a miscarriage of justice.see united states zvi,cir.
applying plain error review.
for the first time on appeal,macpherson contends that his sentence violated the plea agreement.his claim is based not only on the government advocacy of a sentence based on the seven kilograms of heroin that were not included in the pimentel estimate,but also on the sentence in the plea agreement in which the defendant stipulates that his sentence should be calculated based on a drug type and quantity of fifteen kilograms or more of a substance containing cocaine.he contends that the government advocacy that his sentence should be based on the seven kilograms of heroin,which were known to the government at the time of the plea agreement,shows that the government estimate was in bad faith and justifies an opportunity to withdraw his plea.
