apolinar appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine for distribution and to distribute it.we affirm.
mathieu leblanc orchestrated a cocaine distribution conspiracy that completed a number of transactions beginning in.he would typically arrange for robert rossignol to receive money in canada and smuggle it across the border into maine.leblanc then would drive the money to texas or have others,including chad hallett,transport it for him.ahead of his and the money arrival in texas,leblanc would notify victor charles and kyle macdonnell that he was coming so that they could arrange a meeting between leblanc and a cocaine supplier,most frequently.charles and macdonnell would provide protection and logistical support during the transaction.after the exchange,hallett or charles would drive the cocaine from texas to maine,where it would be handed off to rossignol.
in may,charles was incarcerated for a parole violation,but he sought to preserve his place in the conspiracy even while in custody,by receiving payment on future deals between leblanc and in recognition of the logistical groundwork he had helped to lay in the past.both leblanc and agreed to pay charles for deals completed while he was locked up.at one point,contacted charles wife to obtain leblanc phone number,and charles ensured that leblanc and knew how to make contact with each other.
leblanc planned to complete a deal in june and spoke ahead of time directly to,since charles was in custody.leblanc made the plans known to charles,who requested that his share be paid to his mother.hallett received the money for the june deal from rossignol in maine,and,for this particular trip,was supposed to meet leblanc in new jersey,where they would exchange canadian currency for american dollars.hallett then would drive the converted cash to texas,where he would connect with leblanc again.as part of the june deal,agreed to front cocaine to leblanc would give leblanc more drugs than he paid for on the understanding that leblanc would make up the difference in a subsequent transaction.
but the june arrangements went awry.hallett was arrested driving the cash from maine and agreed to participate in a controlled delivery of the money to leblanc in new jersey,as planned.leblanc was then arrested in new jersey on june and,like hallett,agreed to cooperate.he placed recorded phone calls to,fabricating a reason to stall and work out new logistics for what would be a controlled transaction.
while leblanc and were still hashing out the details of the delayed deal,on august a grand jury in maine indicted rossignol,charles,and for conspiring with persons known and unknown to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine in maine and elsewhere over a period beginning no later than january,and continuing until no earlier than june,the date of leblanc arrest.
what was supposed to be the june deal ended as a sting operation on september.met with a federal agent posing as leblanc courier and was arrested as they approached the location of the planned swap,where cocaine was seized.
rossignol and charles,who were included in the indictment alongside,pleaded guilty,as did leblanc and hallett,who were charged separately.macdonnell received immunity.at trial,charles,leblanc,hallett,and macdonnell testified against him,charles attesting that on behalf of leblanc he made about six trips to maine transporting cocaine purchased from.the first was said to involve three kilograms,and the quantity on each subsequent trip was at least five.the jury convicted of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine in violation of a.
at sentencing,the district court found accountable for almost kilograms of cocaine,which at the time gave him a base offense level of under sentencing guidelines manual c sentencing comm.the court applied a increase in light of evidence that possessed a gun at some of the drug deals,id.b,but varied back downward by two levels at the parties urging in recognition of impending guidelines amendments providing reductions in offense levels.an offense level of and a criminal history category of i yielded a guidelines sentencing range of to months.id.sentencing table.the government recommended a sentence at the top of this range.but taking account of the other conspirators sentences hallett received months,leblanc got,and charles and rossignol each,the court sentenced within the guidelines range to months imprisonment.he appealed.
raises four issues,none of them meritorious.
according to him,there was an impermissible variance between the indictment charge and the government proof.while the evidence may have shown that he conspired to sell cocaine to leblanc in texas,he says,it failed to place him in a conspiracy with leblanc to distribute the drugs in maine or elsewhere.
when a defendant asserts a claim of variance premised on the notion that multiple conspiracies existed and that his activities were not part of the charged conspiracy,the initial question is one of evidentiary sufficiency.united states,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states dellosantos,cir.we review sufficiency challenges de novo.we consider all the direct and circumstantial evidence in the light most flattering to the g overnment,drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict to determine whether a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at citations omitted quoting united states,cir.
three factors guide our assessment of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that a set of criminal activities constituted a single conspiracy the existence of a common goal,overlap among the activities participants,and interdependence among the participants.united states,cir.quoting united states ciresi,cir.in considering these three factors,we must remember that the existence of a single conspiracy does not require the participants to know of all the other participants,understand all the details of the conspiracy,or participate in each aspect of the conspiracy.dellosantos,at.
here,all three considerations point to a single conspiracy.the first,existence of a common goal,is broadly drawn and in a case like this is satisfied by evidence of a shared interest in furthering the distribution of drugs,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states portela,cir.that was the common goal here namely,to sell drugs for profit,at.contrary to characterization,he had more than a mere relationship with leblanc he was engaging in selling wholesale quantities obviously purchased for further sale,and he was even willing to front cocaine to leblanc,an act of trust that assumed an ongoing enterprise with a standing objective.
the second,overlap among the activities participants,is satisfied by the pervasive involvement of a single core conspirator.dellosantos,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states,cir.here,leblanc fills that bill.he would i arrange for rossignol to smuggle currency from canada into maine,ii pay hallett and others to drive the cash to texas,iii inform charles and macdonnell of his upcoming arrival in texas,iv meet with among others to swap the money for cocaine,and v direct hallett,charles,and others to transport the drugs back to maine.
remarkably,denies that the required overlap occurred,relying on united states 
t he mere fact that a central person the hub of a wheel is involved in multiple conspiracies the wheel spokes does not mean that a defendant who participated in a spoke conspiracy may be convicted of participating in an overarching conspiracy encompassing the entire wheel.the g overnment must also produce evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the spoke defendant knew about and agreed to join any larger overarching conspiracy.
cir.citation and some internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states,cir,abrogated on other grounds by musacchio united states.but this was not a conspiracy,where one core figure supplies drugs to multiple participants.united states niemi,cir.this,rather,was a chain conspiracy 
conspiracies to distribute narcotics,which normally involve numerous sales and resales of drugs until they reach the ultimate consumers,are often chain conspiracies.because the success of participants on each level of distribution is dependent upon the existence of other levels of distribution,each member of the conspiracy must realize that he is participating in a joint enterprise,even if he does not know the identities of many of the participants.accordingly,a single conspiracy does not become multiple conspiracies simply because each member of the conspiracy did not know every other member,or because each member did not know of or become involved in all of the activities in furtherance of the conspiracy.
united states giry,cir.quoting united states warner,cir.
the third consideration,interdependence among the participants,exists where the activities of one aspect of the scheme are necessary or advantageous to the success of another aspect of the scheme,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states rivera calder√≥n,cir.among other evidence of interdependence here,contacted charles wife while he was incarcerated to get leblanc phone number,thus indicating that leblanc trafficking of cocaine from texas to maine was advantageous to distribution of the product.to the same effect,the conspirators put their unified and continuing enterprise before immediate profit and leblanc each agreed to pay charles even when his incarceration prevented his customary contribution to the conspiratorial project.
argues contrariwise by pointing to dellosantos.there,an indictment charged numerous individuals,including the two appellants,with conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana.at.but as we saw it,rather than the single conspiracy charged in the indictment,the evidence demonstrated at least two one based in massachusetts to distribute only cocaine revolving around three individuals,including the appellants,and another based in maine to distribute both cocaine and marijuana centered around three different individuals.id.at.both conspiracies sought to sell cocaine that traveled the same supply chain,but we had no trouble distinguishing the two.id.with respect to interdependence,although the evidence showed that the appellants participated in supplying cocaine to the conspiracy,we noted that nothing was presented to the jury to suggest that either of them believed that the success of their cocaine distribution operation likely depended on the conspiracy marijuana distribution venture.id.
here,by contrast,there was no second,conspiracy distinct from activity supplying cocaine to leblanc in texas.it is true that at one time leblanc and rossignol had conspired to sell canadian marijuana in the united states,but there is no claim that any marijuana conspiracy even endured into the period covered by the cocaine conspiracy charged here.simply says that he was indifferent to the success of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine in maine or elsewhere.but his actions belie his words.as noted,for example,the importance of sustaining a regular course of business was in evidence when showed his willingness to front drugs to leblanc on the understanding that leblanc would pay in the course of a subsequent transaction.the jury could reasonably have inferred that the continuing vitality of leblanc distribution business was of some importance to.and sufficient evidence supported an inference that knew this distribution business extended to maine and elsewhere leblanc and charles both testified that they told that leblanc was from canada,and sought,obtained,and used leblanc phone number,which began with its maine area code.
in sum,there was no variance.the indictment charged,and the government proved,a single conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in maine and elsewhere.
the next claim on appeal is that,because the september sting transaction occurred after the indictment issued in august,the district court erroneously admitted evidence of it.evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states georgiadis,cir.
this point is most easily resolved by recognizing that even if the disputed evidence was not what our case law calls intrinsic to the charged conspiracy,it was admissible under federal rule of evidence b.see united states mare,cir.explaining supplementary character of that rule to the rule where challenged evidence is intrinsic to crime charged in indictment,rule b is not implicated at all internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states villarman oviedo,cir.rule b distinguishes admission of e vidence of a crime,wrong,or other act to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character,which it prohibits,from admission of such evidence for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident,which it permits.fed.evid.b.
in this case,as in others like it,t he evidence in question was not just about some random drug crime by the defendant from which could be inferred a propensity on his part to commit drug crimes.it was closely linked in time to the alleged conspiracy and proved the identities and relationships of the conspirators.niemi,at citation and alterations omitted quoting united states fanfan,cir.here,evidence of the final,faux deal merely illuminated what had been going on among the relevant parties for over a year,a course of conduct that was firmly shown through overwhelming evidence including testimony.the district court accordingly acted within its discretion in admitting the contested evidence.
final two claims of error relate to his sentence.in assessing sentencing decisions,we review matters of law de novo,findings of fact for clear error,and the reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
the first of these objections goes to the district court application of the relevant sentencing statute b.subparagraph c establishes a default range of imprisonment for the criminal objects of the conspiracy charged in this case irrespective of drug quantity,with a maximum of twenty years and,through silence,a minimum of zero.as relevant here,subparagraph a sets a higher range,a minimum of ten years and a maximum of life,if the offense involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.
the statutory maximum may be based on the quantity of drugs attributable to the conspiracy as a whole,as found by the jury.see united states razo,cir.and because this jury found that the conspiracy involved at least kilograms of cocaine,the district court declared that subparagraph a maximum of life was applicable.
a statutory minimum must rest on a jury finding as well,see id.at,and we have previously held that it must be based on the drug quantity attributable to the defendant individually,rather than to the conspiracy collectively,see id.at.here,the jury made no finding on the amount of cocaine for which was personally responsible,and thus the government did not seek,and the district court did not apply,a statutory minimum.declining to apply a statutory minimum was functionally equivalent to applying the implicit minimum under subparagraph c.
takes these circumstances as an opportunity to contend that the district court used the maximum from subparagraph a and the minimum from subparagraph c.we have to say that we find the claim improbable,given the sentence actually imposed,which is far from life imprisonment the court reference to the life maximum strikes us as more like a stray remark than a ruling that it would apply subparagraph a.but even assuming both that characterization of the district court actions is accurate and that such mixing and matching is impermissible,obviously suffered no harm.see id.at noting that we have previously reserved judgment on this question and reviewed for harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.application of subparagraph a lifetime maximum did no harm because the district court did not apply the cognate statutory minimum,and the sentence it did impose was well below even
