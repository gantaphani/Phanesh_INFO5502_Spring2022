yeifrin rafael ozuna cabrera appeals his conviction for aggravated identity theft,and the reasonableness of his month prison sentence.after careful review,we affirm.
background 
the pertinent facts are uncomplicated.on march,ozuna cabrera applied for a passport under the alias howard bond.in support of the application,he presented an expired passport that bore howard bond name,but ozuna cabrera picture.the inconsistency was promptly discovered,and upon his arrest,ozuna cabrera admitted to purchasing the passport,as well as a social security card,from the real howard bond.
facing multiple charges,ozuna cabrera pled guilty in march to two counts of false statements in a passport application,one count of unlawful of a deported alien,and one count of aggravated identity theft.the district court imposed a mandatory month term of incarceration on the count of aggravated identity theft,consecutive to a month prison term on the remaining counts,for an aggregate sentence of months.
ii.analysis 
ozuna cabrera appeals both his conviction and sentence.first,he contends that his guilty plea to aggravated identity theft must be vacated because it violated rule b requirements that it be knowing,voluntary,and amply supported by facts.see.b g,b and b.specifically,he argues that because he purchased,rather than stole,howard bond passport,he had lawful authority to use the misrepresented identity and was therefore not guilty of a violation.second,he challenges the district court sentence calculation,asserting that it was unreasonably enhanced based on a nearly conviction.we review each of these claims in turn.
rule claims 
ozuna cabrera rule arguments turn almost entirely on his construction of.the aggravated identity theft statute provides,in relevant part 
whoever,during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection c,knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such felony,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of years.
a emphasis added.ozuna cabrera concedes every element of the offense but one that his use of howard bond identification was without lawful authority.he argues that,because bond willingly sold him the means of identification,its subsequent use in support of ozuna cabrera passport application was lawfully authorized.this claim presents an issue of first impression for us whether,in the context of a,the phrase without lawful authority must be construed to require that the means of identification be stolen,or otherwise taken without permission of the owner.we reject such a narrow reading.
as a preliminary matter,because ozuna cabrera failed to raise this claim below,we review it only for plain error accordingly,ozuna cabrera bears the heavy burden of showing that his interpretation of the phrase without lawful authority to require theft of the means of identification is compelled by the language of the statute itself,construction of the statute in light of the common law,or binding judicial construction of the statute.united states caraballo rodriguez,cir.we begin by looking at the language of.
ozuna cabrera reliance on the statutory text itself is unavailing.the phrase without lawful authority,he argues,definitionally equates to without authorized permission.we disagree.though authorized activity may in many cases also be lawful,the terms are not interchangeable.rather,black law dictionary defines lawful as not contrary to law,and authority as t he right or permission to act legally on another behalf.black law dictionary ed.combining these definitions,a reasonably proscribes the transfer,possession,or use of another person means of identification,absent the right or permission to act on that person behalf in a way that is not contrary to the law.in other words,regardless of how the means of identification is actually obtained,if its subsequent use breaks the law specifically,during and in relation to the commission of a crime enumerated in subsection c it is violative of a.
ozuna cabrera contextual argument also fails.as he points out,the aforementioned language of a is virtually identical to that of the general identity fraud statute,which provides 
whoever knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person 
a emphasis added.thus,ozuna cabrera asserts that unless we construe the phrase without lawful authority to require theft under a,the statute would cover the same conduct as a,and consequently be rendered superfluous.he further submits that this construction is supported by the statute title,aggravated identity theft,and its enhanced penalty provision,which he suggests is intended to punish the theft of an identity more harshly than merely putting it to fraudulent use.
this argument ignores the broader statutory framework.as a general rule of statutory construction,identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.united states upton,cir quoting gustafson alloyd,d internal quotation mark omitted.this rule is strengthened where,as here,the relevant statutory provisions are in close proximity to each other.comm r lundy,d.if congress had intended for the phrase without lawful authority to have substantially different meanings in a and a,it would have manifested its intention in some concrete fashion.upton,at quoting finnegan leu,d internal quotation mark omitted.there is no reason to diverge from this canon of construction here.instead,to discern the interplay between these two statutes,we need only refer back to the statutory language.
the identity fraud statute,a,covers the commission,or aiding and abetting in the commission,of any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law,or a felony under any applicable state or local law.by contrast,the aggravated identity theft statute,a,covers any felony violation enumerated in subsection c a discrete list of federal felonies.the statutes are therefore distinguishable not by the method of procuring the means of identification,but by the underlying criminal conduct that they respectively target.section a is a logical extension of a,and punishes more severely those identity crimes committed during and in relation to a specifically enumerated subset of problematic felonies see,united states godin,cir lynch,concurring in enacting,congress was responding to the drastic upsurge in what are called identity theft crimes and which encompass a variety of situations.united states jimenez,cir t he purpose of is to create an additional penalty for using false identities that are particularly difficult to expose or that are used in conjunction with terrorism offenses.
legislative history supports this interpretation.ozuna cabrera accurately notes that congress added to the united states code through the identity theft penalty enhancement act,stat.he is also correct that the house report is replete with references to theft and thieves,and that one stated purpose of the statute is to increase sentences for identity thieves,at,as reprinted in.the report provides several examples of conduct that fit within the traditional definition of theft,like stealing and social security numbers,and stealing identities to file false tax returns or apply for social security benefits.id.at,at.
without question,congress harbored concerns over criminals who actually steal other people identities.there is nothing to suggest,however,that congress intended to so narrowly restrict the statute reach to identity crimes involving such traditional notions of theft.on the contrary,the same house report stated that t he terms identity theft and identity fraud refer to all types of crimes in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person personal data,at,at.indeed,the report describes several anecdotal examples of identity theft that do not involve stealing the means of identification.in one instance,a man used his name and social security number to obtain social security benefits,and in a similar case,a woman used her husband social security number to collect disability benefits.id.at,a
