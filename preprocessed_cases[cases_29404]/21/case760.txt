duplicitous indictment 
first contends that the hobbs act extortion charge was duplicitous.the indictment charged with one count of interfering and attempting to interfere with interstate commerce through extortion argues that attempted extortion and completed extortion are separate crimes which had to be indicted in separate counts.the district court disagreed 
duplicity challenges to an indictment are reviewed de novo.see united states kelley,cir united states caldwell,cir united states trammell,cir united states bryan,cir.duplicity is the joining in a single count of two or more distinct and separate offenses.united states verrecchia,cir.the prohibition against duplicitous indictments arises primarily out of a concern that the jury may find a defendant guilty on a count without having reached a unanimous verdict on the commission of any particular offense.united states valerio,cir citation omitted.the bar against duplicitous indictments is embodied in.a,which provides that separate offenses must be charged in separate counts of an indictment.see united states damrah,cir united states buchmeier,cir.d etermining whether there is duplicity in an indictment is often a difficult and subtle question.charles alan wright,federal practice procedure criminal ed.
the question here is whether an indictment charging a completed and attempted extortion in one count is duplicitous.ordinarily,it has been thought that attempt is a offense of the completed crime and need not be charged at all.see.c united states summit refrigeration group,wl,at,unpublished disposition i f a defendant can be found guilty of attempt even if attempt is not charged,it can not be duplicitous to charge attempt and the completed offense in one count.united states stotts,wl,at.july,unpublished disposition indictment charging attempt to manufacture methamphetamine and completed crime in same count was not duplicitous because attempt was offense of completed crime united states quinn,stating that by including attempt in the same count of the indictment as the completed offense,the government is merely making explicit its right to a verdict finding the defendant guilty of an attempt whether an attempt is charged or not.
where,however,attempt is not a offense of the completed crime,at least one court has held that an indictment charging attempt and the completed crime in the same count is duplicitous.see united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states lopez,cir en banc.in,the ninth circuit found an indictment duplicitous where it charged a defendant,in a single count,with both transporting and attempting to transport undocumented aliens within the united states.see a a ii.according to the court,a conviction for attempted transport requires proof that the defendant had a specific intent to transport undocumented aliens,while a conviction for actual transport requires proof only that the defendant had a general intent to transport aliens with knowledge or reckless disregard of their undocumented status,at.
the cases hold that attempts are offenses of completed hobbs act violations.united states coyazo,cir unpublished disposition robbery united states gregory,wl,at cir,unpublished disposition robbery united states bernard,wl,at,unpublished disposition extortion united states blair,extortion.that is,all the elements of attempted extortion are elements of the completed crime,unlike the separate elements present in.see united states bailey,cir.as count i of the indictment in this case may be read to include only one hobbs act or the lesser included offense of attempted extortion,we agree with the district court that the indictment is not duplicitous on its face.see united states mastelotto,cir in reviewing an indictment for duplicity,our task is not to review the evidence presented at trial to determine whether it would support charging several crimes rather than just one,but rather solely to assess whether the indictment itself can be read to charge only one violation in each count,overruled on other grounds by united states miller,d,cited with approval in united states trainor,cir 
in asserting that he was prejudiced by the allegedly duplicitous indictment,argues in his reply brief,as he did before the district court,that he was denied the right to a unanimous jury verdict.contends that some jurors might have found him guilty of attempted extortion based in part on a finding that he believed the payment of he received from gostoves would deplete assets of the donuts franchise.says that this belief,if proved,could supply the interstate commerce nexus required for conviction for attempt under the statute we discuss the interstate commerce requirement further in part of this opinion.but,he argues,his belief about the source and effect of the payment was irrelevant to whether a completed extortion was committed an actual impact on interstate commerce is required.given that the proof for attempted extortion and completed extortion could be different,the argument concludes,the jury may not have been unanimous about whether was guilty of extortion or attempted extortion.
while,as we have noted,one of the purposes of the prohibition against duplicitous indictments is to guard against conviction without a unanimous jury verdict,the fact that an indictment is not duplicitous on its face of course does not guarantee that a jury verdict will be unanimous,based on the evidence actually presented.we have observed a lack of clarity in the law about the requirement for juror unanimity when,as here,there are alternate paths to a verdict,and we have acknowledged that a count may contain alternative theories,factual scenarios and lines of evidentiary inference,making generalizations about unanimity hazardous.united states,cir.we need not decide whether would have been entitled to a unanimity instruction,for he did not seek one at trial,and on appeal he expressly disclaims that he is challenging the failure to give such an instruction,preferring instead to rest on his claim that the trial should not have proceeded on the indictment as drafted.because the indictment was not duplicitous,we reject that claim.
promise of an official act 
next challenges the district court denial of his.motion for a judgment of acquittal.he contends that the government failed to prove,as it must,that he accepted the payment from gostoves in exchange for a promise to perform an official act.
we review sufficiency of the evidence claim de novo.see united states hall,cir.in so doing,we must decide,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict of guilt,whether a reasonable factfinder could find the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states boulanger,cir.
in relevant part,the hobbs act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another with his consent,induced under color of official right.b.to establish guilt for extortion under color official right,the government must show that the defendant,a public official,has received an emolument that he was not entitled to receive,with knowledge that the emolument was tendered in exchange for some official act.united states,cir.additionally,where the payment was treated as a campaign contribution,the government must demonstrate that the payment was in return for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official to perform or not to perform an official act.mccormick united states,d.in other words,where the payment takes the form of a campaign contribution,the government must prove a specific quid pro quo between the public official and the payor.united states,cir.
this last requirement is rooted in the recognition that candidates for political office must raise money to fund their campaigns and that,to do so effectively,they often must make promises concerning their plans if elected.as the supreme court explained 
money is constantly being solicited on behalf of candidates,who run on platforms and who claim support on the basis of their views and what they intend to do or have done.whatever ethical considerations and appearances may indicate,to hold that legislators commit the federal crime of extortion when they act for the benefit of constituents shortly before or after campaign contributions are solicited and received from the beneficiaries,is an unrealistic assessment of what congress could have meant by making it a crime to obtain property from another,with his consent,under color of official right.to hold otherwise would open to prosecution not only conduct that has long been thought to be well within the law but also conduct that in a very real sense is unavoidable so long as election campaigns are financed by private contributions or expenditures,as they have been from the beginning of the nation.
mccormick,at.
the government contends that the quid pro quo requirement does not apply in this case because there was evidence from which a jury could conclude that gostoves payment to was not a campaign contribution.but,whatever inference the evidence may have permitted,the district court instructed the jury that to find guilty,it had to conclude that the payment was made in return for an agreement or a promise by to perform some official act the quidpro quo is a promise to use the office for the benefit of the payor.this instruction,unobjected to by the government,is the law of the case and supplies the standard by which we measure the sufficiency of the evidence.see united states zanghi,cir thus,for the conviction to stand,there must be adequate evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that promised to perform an official act in exchange for the payoff from gostoves.
contends that,by the time gostoves paid him,the plan to widen the road in front of gostoves donuts had already been approved by the city council.this undisputed fact,contends,compels the conclusion that there was no quid pro quo.we disagree.
a reasonable jury could have found the following facts.in august,the quincy city council considered issuing a permit to allow home depot,to construct a new building on the same street as gostoves donuts.at the council meeting where this permit was considered,told the quincy traffic engineer,jack gillon,that he would oppose the permit unless home depot was required to pay for widening the road in front of the donuts.as a result of demand,home depot agreed to pay for the project as part of the permit requirements.
on october,approximately two months after home depot agreed to pay to widen the road,gostoves and met at in the parking lot of gostoves donuts to execute the payoff gostoves made clear that he was paying for the road improvement and because he needed a friend to make sure that this is going to happen and happen the right way.assured gostoves that the widening project would proceed but also promised that he would meet periodically with the traffic department just to keep it going.promising to meet with the traffic department was not an empty gesture because there was a further approval process for the project,even after the home depot permit issued.in fact,as promised,contacted the traffic engineer shortly after receiving the payoff to make sure that the project remained on track.
a reasonable jury thus could have concluded that explicitly promised gostoves that,in exchange for the payment,he would use his influence as a city councillor to pressure the traffic department to pursue the project.this conclusion is sufficient to ground a conviction.until the project was completed,gostoves had an interest in having an influential public official advocating for the project,and willingly agreed to serve as that advocate.
interstate commerce requirement 
in addition to the requirements discussed above,to prove a completed extortion,the government had to satisfy the hobbs act jurisdictional element of showing that conduct obstruct ed,delay ed,or affect ed commerce.to meet this requirement,the government had to prove only that there was a realistic probability that conduct would affect interstate commerce.united states capozzi,cir.
in an vein similar to his duplicity contention,argues that the jury was presented with a legally invalid theory for establishing this realistic probability.as mentioned above,the money that gostoves paid to belonged to the fbi.supra at.relying on united states dicarlantonio,cir,contends that the jurisdictional requirement for a completed hobbs act violation is not met where the money used for an extortion belongs to the government.he does not dispute,however,that the government established a valid effect on interstate commerce through evidence that the extortion depleted assets of home depot,a business engaged in interstate commerce,by requiring it to pay for the project.see united states,cir recognizing depletion of assets of business in interstate commerce as valid way of showing effect on commerce under the hobbs act.thus,does not contend that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal.rather,he seeks a new trial,relying on the rule that a general verdict can not stand where the jury was presented with valid and legally flawed theories of liability and may have relied on the flawed theory to convict.see griffin united states,d 
the primary problem with argument is that it does not appear that the jury was presented with the theory that gostoves payment of fbi money to established the effect on interstate commerce required for a substantive extortion conviction.the government did not make this argument,and the jury instructions,unchallenged on this point,did not suggest this theory.thus,even if we assume that the payment of fbi money was insufficient to ground the jurisdictional finding,there is little likelihood that the jury was led astray.
closing argument 
finally,claims that statements made by the prosecutor during her closing argument were improper and require a new trial.we review de novo whether the challenged statements were improper.united states,cir.the district court decision whether to award a new trial on the basis of any identified improper statements is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.id.
during the trial,the government had sought to introduce evidence that in,while a city counselor,had accepted another payment from gostoves.the district court excluded this evidence.it did,however,allow the fbi agent who arranged gostoves october payoff to to testify that she was investigating because gostoves told her about an alleged prior payment to.this testimony was admitted only to explain the reason for the fbi investigation.the agent did not testify that gostoves told her that the prior payment had been in the amount of.
despite the fact that no evidence had been allowed about the amount of the prior payment,the prosecutor stated that the agent told you that when she debriefed gostoves he said that he made a payment to the defendant in the past.and the agent told you that she wanted to corroborate that information by seeing if the defendant would take another such payment from gostoves.objected to this statement.the court immediately sustained the objection,commenting that it did not recall this evidence,and told the jury to disregard any of this.at the end of the government argument,moved for a mistrial.the court denied the motion,ruling that,while the prosecutor comment about the prior payment was improper,had failed to show prejudice,especially in light of the court instruction to the jury members that they disregard the remark.
contends that the prosecutor entire statement concerning the prior payment was improper because there was no substantive evidence that gostoves had ever made such a payment to.the
