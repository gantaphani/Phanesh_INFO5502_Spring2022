following an amendment to the united states sentencing guidelines,defendant appellant emmanuel zayas ortiz filed a motion for sentence reduction pursuant to c.the motion was opposed by the united states and the probation officer.the district court denied the motion with a short form order.the defendant now appeals.we affirm.
facts background 
on december,emmanuel zayas ortiz zayas was charged,along with,with knowingly and intentionally conspiring,combining,confederating,and agreeing to possess,with intent to distribute,controlled narcotics specifically,five kilograms or more of cocaine,fifty grams or more of cocaine base,and one kilogram or more of heroin.zayas eventually entered into a plea agreement with the united states,which stipulated,inter alia,that zayas was one of the drug trafficking operation leaders,that zayas was an enforcer and owned drug points where the illicit products were sold,and that zayas possessed a firearm in the course of the offense.
consistent with this agreement,the parties recommended the following sentencing calculations under the united states sentencing guidelines manual or the guidelines zayas would receive a base offense level of for violations of a,b a,and.pursuant to,zayas would receive a enhancement for his leadership role in the conspiracy,and,pursuant to,he would receive another enhancement for the use of firearms within the conspiracy.these increases would be partially offset by a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under a and b,resulting in a total adjusted offense level of and yielding an imprisonment range of to months.the parties agreed to recommend a term of imprisonment of months.the probation officer prepared a pre sentence report psr with calculations mirroring those found in the plea agreement.
on january,the district court sentenced zayas at the bottom of the guidelines range to a term of imprisonment of months and a supervised release term of five years.that judgment was appealed and subsequently affirmed by this court.
this recitation is merely background for purposes of the instant appeal.on march,zayas filed his first motion to reduce his sentence under c,pursuant to amendments and to the guidelines.the government stipulated to the reduction,which resulted in a offense level decrease,an adjusted offense level of,and an amended sentencing range of to months.the district court granted the motion,sentencing zayas at the bottom of the guidelines range to a term of imprisonment of months.
the district court was faced with a case of déjà vu when,on december,zayas filed a second motion to reduce his sentence under c,this time pursuant to amendments and to the guidelines.the government again stipulated to the reduction,which resulted in another offense level decrease,an adjusted offense level of,and an amended sentencing range of to months.the district court granted the motion,sentencing zayas at the bottom of the amended guidelines range to a term of imprisonment of months.
on november,the court then faced déjà vu all over again,as the late yogi berra might have said,when the defendant filed his third motion to reduce his sentence under.c,this time pursuant to amendments and to the guidelines.this reduction would have resulted in yet another offense level decrease,an adjusted offense level of,and a sentencing range of to months.but this time there was a twist.rather than stipulating to the reduction,both the government and the probation officer opposed the motion,citing the defendant leadership and enforcement roles,ownership of drug points,and possession of a dangerous weapon in the course of the offense conduct.
in response,the defendant urged the district court to reject the government position.the defendant argued that these factors had already been accounted for when the sentence was initially imposed and did not,taken alone,reflect any increased danger to public safety.the defendant also noted his positive disciplinary record and rehabilitative efforts in prison.
on march,the district court denied the motion using a form order.the form states,in relevant part that,having considered the defendant motion,and taking into account the policy statement set forth at and the sentencing factors set forth in a,to the extent that they are applicable,the motion is denied.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a judgment of conviction that includes a sentence of imprisonment constitutes a final judgment and may not be modified by a district court except in limited circumstances.dillon united states,d quoting b.the district court power under c to reduce the prison term of a defendant who was sentenced based on a guidelines range that has subsequently been lowered by the united states sentencing commission the commission constitutes one such exception to the general rule of finality governing such sentences.id.
district courts proceeding under c follow a approach.united states candelaria silva,cir.first,the court determines the prisoner eligibility for a sentence modification and the extent of the reduction authorized.id.quoting dillon,at.at this stage,the court considers whether it has the legal authority to grant the reduction requested thus,its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,and its factual findings,for clear error.id.

zayas contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the a factors and by failing to give sufficient reasons for its decision he claims that one can not discern what factors,if any,the court relied on in denying his motion.according to zayas,no reasons whatsoever were given by the district court in its order denying his motion and there is no correlation to the statutory factors set forth in a.this,the defendant contends,was an error of law necessarily constituting an abuse of discretion.see united states caraballo,cir a material error of law is perforce an abuse of discretion.
despite the district court admittedly spartan denial order,the defendant argument comes up short zayas himself acknowledges that the judge is not required to articulate the applicability of each factor,as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.united states vautier,cir quoting united states eggersdorf,cir.in the sentencing context,we have held that a judge statement that he has considered the relevant a factors is entitled to significant weight.united states santiago rivera,cir citing united states dávila gonzález,cir.zayas has offered no reason why this rule should not apply with equal force in the c context.
here,the district court utilized a form order that explicitly states that the judge took into account the policy statement set forth at and the sentencing factors set forth in a.zayas derides this as stock language,but fails to provide any rationale as to why the judge must type this phase afresh for each and every reduction order rather than saving himself the effort by relying upon a form prepared for this very purpose.
moreover,the record as a whole is sufficient for us to infer the pertinent factors taken into account by the court below.united states rodriguez rivera,cir a court reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.quoting united states jiménez beltre,cir en banc.the government opposed the motion based on public safety concerns and argued that a reduction would not be appropriate given the defendant leadership and enforcement
