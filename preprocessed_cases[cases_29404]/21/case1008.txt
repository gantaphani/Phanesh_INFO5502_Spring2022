lennell york,pled guilty to mailing a threatening letter to his estranged spouse in violation of.in september,york was sentenced to months in prison,to be followed by three years of supervised release.as part of his supervised release,the district court required york to participate in a sex offender treatment program and to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to ensure his participation in that program.
on appeal,york attacks these two conditions,neither of which will take effect until he begins his supervised release program upon his release from prison in early.we construe an ambiguous provision in the supervised release order to minimize the risk to york of coercive in violation of his fifth amendment rights,and we affirm the judgment as construed.
though this is solely a sentencing appeal,the facts of york underlying offense and criminal history are pertinent to the district court choice of supervised release conditions.this is so by statute.under d,the district court may impose any special condition of supervised release that it considers appropriate,provided that the condition satisfies certain specified criteria.one such criterion is that the condition imposed be reasonably related to the factors set forth in section a.id.d.section a,in turn,requires the court to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.see also b.in this case,the facts are drawn from the report,as amended to reflect york minor objections,and from the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states lopez,cir.
in july,york was an inmate in a massachusetts house of corrections,where he was serving a sentence for a conviction for sexually assaulting a girl under the age of fourteen.on july,york mailed a letter to,his estranged wife and a relative of the girl whom he had assaulted.in the letter,york wrote i can not and will not let you live.i make this statement knowing full well what the consequences are you will be dead,and i will be in jail.you may take this as an idle threat if you choose to,but i will find and exterminate you.you will cease to exist.he signed the letter york.
reported the letter to the authorities,and on july,the fbi visited york in jail.he agreed to be interviewed,signed a waiver of his miranda rights,and admitted that he had sent the letter.his lawyer later explained that york decided to write the letter when he learned that was planning to move away and take their children with her 
a federal criminal complaint was filed against york in the district of massachusetts in february,and york was ordered detained pending indictment and trial.in april,the government formally charged york with violating,which makes it a crime to send via the postal service any communication addressed to any other person and containing any threat to injure the person of the addressee.c.on may,york pled guilty to the charge.
at the sentencing hearing in september,the district court determined,and the parties agreed,that york criminal history qualified him as a career offender under.among york prior offenses were two convictions in massachusetts state court for indecent assaults upon minors.in the first incident,which occurred in,york bought alcohol for a minor girl who was over the age of fourteen and then subjected her to an indecent assault and battery.the second incident,which occurred in,was york sexual assault on the girl related to 
in light of york criminal history and the dictates of the career offender guideline,the district court determined that the applicable guidelines range was to months.york sought a downward departure on the basis of diminished capacity,see,which the court denied on the ground that does not permit departures where the defendant conduct involved a serious threat of violence.id.the court then added 
i also agree with the government that this particular defendant criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate him to protect the public.he has shown himself capable of committing,not one,but two very dastardly and heinous sexual crimes against defenseless young women 
the court warned york that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he were ever arrested again for committing a violent crime,particularly a crime against people who are defenseless.york was sentenced to months in prison plus a term of supervised release.
in addition to the standard conditions of supervised release,see c,the court imposed on york several special conditions 
the defendant is to participate in a sex offender specific treatment program at the direction of the probation office.the defendant shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program.no violation proceedings will arise based solely on a defendant failure to pass the polygraph.such an event could,however,generate a separate investigation.when submitting to a polygraph exam,the defendant does not give up his fifth amendment rights 
the government had not asked the court to impose these conditions on york,nor had the probation office recommended them in york report psr defense counsel,however,did not object when the court listed them among the conditions it was imposing.
several months after the sentencing hearing,york filed a motion to modify the sex offender treatment and polygraph testing conditions.the district court denied the motion because york had already filed a notice of appeal to this court raising the same issues.york motion to reconsider that denial was denied on the same ground.united states distasio,cir pending notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over the substance of the appeal 
york attacks the conditions of his supervised release on multiple grounds.he argues that the district court could not require him to attend a sex offender treatment program as a condition of supervised release because his conviction did not involve a offense and that the mandatory polygraph testing condition is invalid because i it will compel him to incriminate himself in violation of his fifth amendment rights ii it constitutes an impermissible delegation of the judicial function to officers and iii it is an inherently unreliable and thus unreasonable means of ensuring compliance with supervised release conditions.we address each of these contentions in turn,saving for last the more troublesome issues raised by york fifth amendment challenge.
standard of review 
the parties disagree on the applicable standard of review.this court ordinarily reviews challenges to conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion,but if the issue is forfeited,review is for plain error only.united states,cir.the government argues that york forfeited his objections to the conditions of his supervised release by failing to raise them during the sentencing hearing.we have accepted this argument elsewhere.see,united states brown,cir.
york acknowledges that he failed to object below.nevertheless,he argues that a contemporaneous objection was not required because,given that the conduct for which he was convicted was unrelated to sex,and given that neither the government nor the psr proposed sex offender treatment or polygraph testing,he could not reasonably have anticipated the special conditions imposed by the court.we are doubtful.considering york history of sexual offenses and violence against women,it should not have been difficult to predict the court interest in such conditions.
in any event,we need not decide which of these arguments should prevail,for our conclusion in york case is the same under either standard of review.but there is a serious consequence to the belatedness of york attack.as the government correctly points out,there is no factual record developed as to the specific sex offender treatment program that york will be required to attend,the types of polygraph exams that may be administered,or even the questions that york will likely be required to answer.while the relevant treatment programs or polygraph technology may be somewhat different in,information as to existing programs and polygraph exams is surely available and would have been helpful.a timely objection and the creation of a record would have permitted both the district court and this court to review york claims with the benefit of that information.
sex offender treatment requirement 
york argues that because his conviction was for mailing a threatening communication,not for a crime,the requirement that he participate in a sex offender treatment program imposes a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to deter criminal conduct or protect the public.b.york misunderstands the law.
the sentencing guidelines do not limit district courts to consideration only of the facts of the crime charged.a sentencing court should consider each defendant history,regardless of the nature of the crime of conviction.the judge has the authority to impose any condition of supervised release that is reasonably related to the defendant offense,history,and characteristics the need to deter the defendant from further criminal conduct the need to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant and the effective educational,vocational,medical,or other correctional treatment of the defendant.b see also d,at united states peppe,cir.although these factors are connected by the word and,see d b,the critical test is whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to one or more of the permissible goals of supervised release.brown,at emphasis added see also united states barajas,cir noting that every circuit to have decided the issue has adopted this interpretation notwithstanding the and conjunction.so the fact that a condition of supervised release is not directly related to york crime of conviction does not render that condition per se invalid.
york acknowledges these principles but argues that sex offender treatment is uniquely reserved for cases involving sex offenses.he points to d,which provides that a special condition requiring the defendant participation in a treatment program should be imposed if the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense.but this is little aid to york,as the guidelines conspicuously do not say that treatment is appropriate only if the underlying crime was a sex offense.in fact,the preamble to d provides that the special conditions listed therein,including participation in a program for sex offenders,are recommended in the circumstances described and,in addition,may otherwise be appropriate in particular cases.emphasis added.and nothing in the statute underlying limits the special condition of treatment to defendants under prosecution for sex crimes see.
there are,however,several limitations on a district court power to fashion special conditions of supervised release.we list a few.first,a special condition must in fact be tailored to the circumstances it can involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of supervised release.b.second,the condition imposed must be consistent with any pertinent policy statements from the sentencing commission.id.finally,the trial court decision to impose the challenged condition must have adequate evidentiary support in the record.brown,at united states thurlow,cir per curiam.
given york criminal history and in light of the record in this case,which includes a threat of violence by york against yet another woman,the district court was well within its discretion in requiring york to participate in the sex offender treatment program.the condition that he attend treatment is plainly related to his criminal history york has twice been convicted for sexually assaulting young girls,including one conviction only a year before he mailed his threatening letter to see united states peterson,cir approving a special release condition of treatment for a defendant convicted of bank larceny where the defendant had been convicted of a sex offense in state court five years earlier.
york proven recidivism,moreover,makes the condition reasonably related to another permissible purpose of supervised release protecting the public from further crimes by the defendant.in mckune lile,d,the supreme court observed that convicted sex offenders who reenter society are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.id.at.furthermore,treatment programs of the kind the district court has required york to attend may enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way reduce recidivism.id.the district court remarks during sentencing make clear that the court believed that york needed such treatment and that he continued to pose a risk to young girls.
the district court committed no error,plain or otherwise,in requiring york to participate in a treatment program as a condition of his supervised release.
mandatory polygraph testing 
more serious is york fifth amendment challenge to the mandatory polygraph testing requirement in his supervised release conditions.we turn to that question after addressing york two threshold objections to the polygraph testing condition.
impermissible delegation 
york contends that the polygraph testing requirement,as worded in the district court order,unlawfully delegates to officers the power to determine matters of punishment.he argues that the district court command that he shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program is vague as to the frequency,duration,and allowable scope of the questioning.by failing to specify these details,york claims,the district court impermissibly assigned to the probation office the power to determine the nature and extent of his punishment.
the district court committed no error in allowing york probation officers to determine these details.federal courts are not prohibited from using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions,as long as th e judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.united states allen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,the district court left no significant penological decision to the discretion of the probation office the court itself determined that york is to participate in a treatment program for sex offenders and that york shall be required to submit to polygraph testing to confirm his compliance with his treatment regimen.this distinguishes york case from our recent decision in united states,cir.in,this court upheld a delegation challenge to a special condition of supervised release because the district court had authorized the defendant probation officer to determine not only the details of the defendant drug treatment,but also whether the defendant would be required to undergo such treatment.id.at see also peterson,at united states kent,cir.in this case,the district court made all such decisions itself.
further,contrary to york assertion,the district court did restrict the scope of permissible questioning the polygraph testing is a means to e nsure that york is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program.this is a permissibly narrow delegation of administrative details.see,at the question of which drug program a defendant must attend,and when he may be discharged,involves administrative details properly delegated to a probation officer allen,at.indeed,the delegation here is narrower than the one that this court upheld in allen as acceptable reliance on probation officers administrative expertise see at upholding a condition requiring the defendant to participate in mental health treatment as directed by the probation officer,until such time as the defendant is released from the program by the probation officer.york reliance on united states merric,cir,is misplaced.in merric,this court vacated the defendant sentence because the trial court impermissibly delegated to a probation officer the power to set the defendant fine payment schedule.see id.at.if a probation officer can not set a fine payment schedule,york argues,a schedule of polygraph sessions should be equally.the analogy is not persuasive.merric simply held that it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matt
