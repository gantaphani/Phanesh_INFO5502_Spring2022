appellant luis guadalupe pled guilty to charges involving drug distribution and firearm violations.he now challenges his sentence,contending that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether certain prior convictions on which the court based his sentence were actually part of the instant offense and the court erred in relying on his confidential juvenile record without disclosing the content of that record to him,in violation of federal rule of civil procedure.as to the former,we find no abuse of discretion as to the latter,the court error was harmless.consequently,we affirm guadalupe sentence.
on july,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging guadalupe and other individuals with various violations relating to a drug distribution network.the counts involving guadalupe alleged conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of controlled substances near a school or public housing project,in violation of,and count one conspiracy to use,carry or possess firearms in violation of c,o count two and possession of a firearm in a school zone,in violation of and q count three.
guadalupe pled guilty to counts one and two.as part of the plea agreement,the parties stipulated to the following underlying facts 
from on or about june,and continuing up to march,the defendant did agree with others to possess controlled substances at various drug distribution locations operating within the nemesio canales public housing project in particular,the defendant was a manager of a cocaine base crack drug point,a runner,and a shift supervisor at the nemesio canales public housing project.
from on or about september,continuing up to march,the defendant did knowingly,intentionally,and unlawfully conspire and agree with diverse other persons to possess,use,brandish,or carry a shotgun,a revolver,a mm pistol,and an assault rifle,in furtherance of the conspiracy mentioned above.
the plea agreement explicitly stated that there was no stipulation as to his criminal history category.with respect to the sentencing recommendation,the agreement explained that if guadalupe criminal history category was ii or less,the government would recommend a sentence of months imprisonment otherwise,the sentencing recommendation would be the lower end of the applicable sentencing guidelines range.
the presentence report psr stated that guadalupe prior convictions yielded eight criminal history points three points for a conviction involving weapons violations,violence against public authority,and aggravated battery two points for a conviction for weapons violations two points for a conviction for possession of marijuana and one point for a juvenile offense,the record of which the court received on condition of confidentiality the psr also added two criminal history points because guadalupe was on probation at the time he committed the instant offenses,see d,and two more points because he committed the instant offenses less than two years after release from imprisonment,see e.thus,guadalupe record yielded a total of twelve criminal history points,resulting in a criminal history category of based on this criminal history category and a total offense level of,the psr stated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range was to months imprisonment.
during a change of plea hearing in november,guadalupe objected to the dates of the firearms conspiracy alleged in the indictment,arguing that the conspiracy began earlier than september.he subsequently filed an objection to the psr,arguing that his two prior convictions for possession of weapons in and were a result of his involvement in the conspiracy.thus,he contended,those convictions should not count as separate offenses in his criminal history.he asked the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to obtain testimony from two cooperating government witnesses,edna diaz pastrana and leonor cuadrado figueroa,claiming that they would verify that the prior convictions were part of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.he attached copies of notes in spanish taken during law enforcement interviews with the witnesses,asserting that these notes supported his claim.
at the sentencing hearing on may,defense counsel renewed the objection to counting the weapons convictions in guadalupe criminal history and again alleged that the testimony of the two government witnesses would establish that the conspiracy began prior to the dates specified in the indictment.the court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing for such testimony,and counted the convictions toward the criminal history.also at the sentencing hearing,defense counsel objected to the court consideration of confidential information regarding guadalupe juvenile history,asserting that she should have access to the information if the court intended to rely on it.however,the court stated that i do think it would change anything,and included the juvenile history in its sentencing calculation.finally,guadalupe contended that the marijuana conviction was part of the instant conspiracy.the court accepted that contention.
with the marijuana conviction excluded,guadalupe criminal history category was reduced to iv yielding a sentencing guidelines range of to months imprisonment.the court then sentenced guadalupe to concurrent terms of imprisonment of months on each count.guadalupe appeals,contending that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing for the testimony of the government witnesses and the district court erred in considering confidential information from his juvenile record without disclosure of that information to him and his counsel 
evidentiary hearing 
the sentencing guidelines instruct courts to determine an offender criminal history category by adding a specified number of points for each prior sentence of imprisonment,the length of the prior sentence determines the number of points added.the sentencing guidelines further define a prior sentence as a sentence imposed prior to sentencing on the instant offense,other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.cmt.emphasis added.in light of this provision,guadalupe argues that the conduct leading to his and weapons convictions was part of the conduct comprising the instant conspiracy and should not have been included in his criminal history calculation.
guadalupe contends that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to consider the testimony of cooperating government witnesses diaz and cuadrado,who he claims would testify that his weapons violations in and were part of the instant conspiracy.the inclusion of the and weapons convictions made a substantial difference in the calculation of guadalupe criminal history.without those two offenses,guadalupe would have had only three criminal history points,rather than the eight that the district court included in its calculation.this would have resulted in a criminal history category of ii,and pursuant to the plea agreement,the government would have recommended a sentence of only months rather than the months that the court imposed.before the district court,guadalupe made this assertion in his objection to the psr and attached spanish language notes from law enforcement interviews with these witnesses.we review the district court decision to deny an evidentiary hearing at sentencing for abuse of discretion.see united states mcandrews,cir.
there may be circumstances in which a court should hear evidence regarding a prior conviction to determine whether the conduct underlying that conviction is part of the instant offense.however,under the circumstances present here,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to hear testimony from diaz and cuadrado.guadalupe offered no evidence to indicate that these witnesses would testify that his prior convictions were part of the instant conspiracy his motion objecting to the psr contained the bare allegation that these witnesses would testify that the conspiracy began before the date alleged in the indictment.at the sentencing hearing,guadalupe counsel argued t
