criminal defendants josu e alejandro montañez,julio severino batista,and eddie alejandro montañez defendants appeal from convictions and sentences related to a criminal conspiracy to import cocaine.defendants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment of acquittal erred in determining cocaine quantity at sentencing abused its discretion in fashioning their sentences violated their sixth amendment right to a public trial and erred in applying a sentencing enhancement for the foreseeable presence of a firearm.we reject each of defendants arguments.nevertheless,in light of newly promulgated amendment to the united states sentencing guidelines,we accept the parties joint request that we remand for reconsideration of the sentences.
background 
along with four other,defendants were indicted and convicted for a conspiracy that spanned from june to march.in considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a guilty verdict,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states adorno molina,cir.
a.the charged conspiracy 
in june,the drug enforcement agency dea paid a confidential informant ci to lure,puerto rican drug traffickers into a sham scheme.their target was ra ul feliciano l opez fora.
ci first met fora on june,at a restaurant in isla verde,puerto rico.ci proposed an ambitious deal to import kilograms of cocaine,via commercial air carrier,from colombia to puerto rico,and from puerto rico on to miami.fora responded that he could receive,store,and distribute drugs,as well as provide related services.on june,at a restaurant in puerto nueveo,fora introduced ci to a crooked cop named victor esquilin rosa,who could provide security.on august,again in puerto nueveo,fora introduced ci to an unidentified person who knew people who could transport the cocaine by sea.this august introduction was the last conspiratorial activity for a period,during which ci was in colombia.
on february,ci reinitiated contact with fora and esquilin,letting them know that he had returned to puerto rico.ci scaled back the shipment amount to kilograms.a series of recorded phone calls took place between ci,fora,and others,with at least one involving defendant julio severino.on february,ci,fora,esquilin,and severino met where ci and fora had first met at a restaurant in isla verde.ci stated that he now expected a kilogram cocaine shipment,and asked if he could count on them for everything including security and firearms.fora responded,yes.
on march,ci,fora,and severino met at another restaurant in isla verde to discuss particulars,specifically,where and how to receive the cocaine.the plan was to transport and receive the cocaine by sea rather than by a commercial air carrier,as originally discussed.the following day,the same three men met at a parking lot and then drove to a beach in the dorado area of puerto rico,scouting spots to unload the drugs.on march,they scouted locations near el corcho beach in humacao.the defendants alejandro brothers were supposed to join this second scouting expedition,but did not arrive in time.later that day,the alejandro brothers met ci and spoke about their roles in assisting the drug delivery.the brothers suggested a different beach on which to receive the drugs,and eddie gave ci his telephone number.
on march,ci called eddie to verify if everything was ready.the next day,fora called ci and said that josu e informed him that weather conditions were poor.on march,fora called ci and said that they were ready.on march,ci called fora and eddie,telling them that the drugs would be delivered later that night.
in the early morning on march,the drug deal took place at a pier in peñuelas.ci met fora,severino,and the alejandro brothers.ci told them that the current shipment would be kilograms of cocaine.ci observed eddie carrying a firearm.to receive the shipment,the conspirators brought in total four vehicles,including the alejandro brothers suv,which eddie drove.a vessel,manned by dea agents,pulled up to the pier with four sacks of sham cocaine.severino and josu e alejandro walked out to the pier to retrieve the sacks of sham cocaine.eddie alejandro waited by his suv.dea and puerto rico police then swooped in and made arrests.police seized a pistol from eddie person.police later searched the alejandro brothers suv,finding two handguns and a rifle.
trial and sentencing 
fora and esquilin pled guilty and were sentenced to and months,respectively.josu e alejandro,julio severino,and eddie alejandro went to trial and were found guilty.
the court sentenced severino first.in calculating severino sentencing guidelines range,the district court held him accountable for kilograms of cocaine,which,at that time,yielded a base offense level of.sentencing guidelines manual a.under united states sentencing guidelines section b,he was subject to a increase for the foreseeable presence of a firearm during the offense.his guidelines sentencing range was months.in crafting a month sentence,the district court noted severino lack of criminal history,the fact that he did not personally carry a weapon,and his age years.
the court then sentenced josu e and eddie alejandro.in applying the sentencing guidelines,the district court also held josu e and eddie alejandro accountable for kilograms of cocaine,which,at that time,yielded a base offense level of.id.c.at the same time,after observing that ci controlled the actual amount of ersatz drugs involved,the district court assigned them the base offense level applicable for to kilograms of cocaine.under united states sentencing guidelines section b,they were also subject to a increase for the foreseeable presence of a firearm during the offense.the resulting sentencing guidelines range for both brothers was months.the district court sentenced each to months in prison.
ii.analysis 
a.the sufficiency of the evidence 
defendants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment of acquittal.we review the denial of such motions de novo.united states rosado p erez,cir.all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the prosecution.id.if a reasonable jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense,we must affirm the conviction.id.testimony from even just one witness can support a conviction.united states de la paz rentas,cir see also united states torres galindo,cir noting that uncorroborated testimony of a cooperating accomplice may sustain a conviction so long as that testimony is not facially incredible.
here,defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to convict them of any conspiracy,and the sufficiency of the evidence to convict them of the indictment overarching conspiracy.after quickly disposing of their first challenge,we give some attention to their second before concluding,similarly,that the evidence was more than sufficient.
sufficiency of the evidence to convict defendants of any conspiracy.
to sustain a conspiracy conviction,the government must show that the defendant knowingly agreed with at least one other person to commit a crime,intending that the underlying offense be completed.united states ledee,cir.the agreement need not be express,and may consist of no more than a tacit understanding.united states dellosantos,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the record is replete with evidence that defendants knowingly agreed to import and distribute a shipment of cocaine that involved more than five kilograms,as charged in the indictment at trial,the government introduced recorded phone calls during which the defendants planned logistics.ci also recorded meetings with defendants,discussing cocaine amounts in the hundreds of kilograms.moreover,police arrested defendants while they were actually in the process of unloading four sacks of fake cocaine,in the middle of the night,with four cars,and multiple weapons.ci testified at trial and relayed all of this information to the jury.in short,the evidence virtually compelled a finding that defendants conspired to import and possess five kilograms or more of cocaine.
sufficiency of the evidence to convict defendants of the indictment overarching conspiracy.
we turn to the defendants argument,that the evidence was insufficient to convict them of the specific overarching june march conspiracy charged in the indictment.
defendants argue that the evidence at trial showed at least two conspiracies a june august conspiracy to import larger amounts of cocaine from colombia to miami,and a separate february march conspiracy to import smaller amounts of cocaine,with no miami distribution plans.defendants argue that the lull between the conspiratorial activities and the conspiratorial activities prevents a reasonable jury from finding them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged conspiracy.defendants joined the conspiracy after the lull and thus,their argument runs,they can not be convicted of a conspiracy including the events of june august.
whether the evidence evinces one or multiple conspiracies is a question of fact for the jury and is reviewed only for the sufficiency of the evidence.united states niemi,cir.with the jury properly instructed,as here on the need to determine whether the defendants were guilty of the charged conspiracy,the guilty verdict can be seen as an effective rejection of the multiple conspiracy theory.united states wihbey,cir citing united states sepulveda,cir.while there may be conflicting inferences,as long as the evidence is adequate to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find a single conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt,the jury finding will not be disturbed on appeal.united states mangual santiago,cir.
when evaluating whether the evidence can support the existence of a single conspiracy,we ultimately look to the totality of the evidence.id.we pay particular heed to factors such as the existence of a common goal,evidence of interdependence among the participants,and the degree to which their roles overlap.niemi,at quoting united states fenton,cir.
looking at the totality of the evidence,a reasonable jury,drawing inferences from the record,could find beyond a reasonable doubt the common goal,interdependence,and overlap factors satisfied here.specifically,the jury could find that the conspirators maintained the common goal of importing large quantities of cocaine from colombia into puerto rico for profit that each conspirator role was individually necessary for the success of the overall conspiracy and that fora was the conspiracy leader throughout its lifetime,satisfying the overlap factor,see united states portela,cir noting that t he overlap requirement can be satisfied by the pervasive involvement of a single core conspirator internal quotation marks omitted.
the common goal factor is given a wide breadth.united states sanchez badillo,cir see also portela,at finding common goal factor satisfied by each defendant interest in furthering the distribution of cocaine.here,defendants attempt to carve one conspiracy into two,based on differences between the and plans,plus the hiatus.in,the plan involved using a commercial air carrier to bring larger amounts of cocaine from colombia to puerto rico,and ultimately on to miami.in,the plan involved maritime transportation,a smaller cocaine quantity,and no miami distribution plans.that the plan changed does not prevent the jury from finding one conspiracy existed.here,too,the last meeting before the lull foreshadowed the move to a maritime conveyance.the conspirators maintained a broader unitary goal of importing cocaine across the and time frames.that constant objective satisfies the common goal factor.see portela,at.
interdependence among the conspirators requires determining whether the activities of one aspect of the scheme are necessary or advantageous to the success of another aspect of the scheme.id.internal quotation marks omitted.e vidence of another individual participant understanding of the interdependence of the activities is evidence often the best evidence of tacit agreement between the individual and his.id.here,defendants note that none of them was involved in.while true,that does not diminish the interdependence that ultimately existed between them and the other conspirators.each conspirator played a necessary role in the conspiracy.fora was the organizer who connected esquilin and defendants to ci.while defendants joined at the eleventh hour,their roles were no less important for it.defendants provided security,firearms,and vehicles necessary support to ensure safe transportation of the drugs.that defendants joined late and were not involved in the early planning stages does not prevent the jury from finding a single conspiracy on this record.see id.at the fact that every defendant did not participate in every transaction necessary to fulfill the aim of their agreement does not transform a continuing plan into multiple conspiracies.internal quotation marks omitted.it would be perfectly reasonable for a jury to find a single,continuing plan,starting in june and coming into fruition in march.the june preliminary planning meetings gave rise to the february march events.the evidence here was adequate to permit a reasonable trier of fact to have found a single conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.mangual santiago,at.as such,the jury finding will not be disturbed.id.
additionally,even accepting defendants contention that the evidence shows two separate conspiracies,it would make no difference to the outcome here.at worst,we would have a nonprejudicial variance between the charged crime and the evidence adduced at trial.see id.a variance is grounds for reversal only if it is prejudicial.
here,all of the drugs,indeed all sentencing factors,attributed to defendants arose from the latter part of the conspiracy.had they only been charged with that part,they would be in exactly the same position.and the overwhelming evidence against them eliminates any plausible concern that evidence pertinent only to the earlier stages of the conspiracy might have prejudicially distracted the defense effort or in any other way tipped the balance against defendants.
cocaine quantity instructions 
defendants argue that the district court committed error under alleyne united states,because the jury allegedly did not find the amount of cocaine attributable to each defendant an element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt the district court,however,specifically instructed the jurors for both the possession and importation counts that they needed to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the agreement specified in the indictment existed between at least two people to with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine and that the defendant willfully joined in that agreement.finally,the district court had jury verdict forms for each individual defendant on which the jurors specifically found that the amount of cocaine involved in the offense was more than five kilograms.
defendants also argue that the district court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included,lower amount offenses under b b,c.but they never asked for such an instruction,cite no authority for why it was nevertheless required,and,in any event,can not establish plain error prejudice given the overwhelming evidence of a quantity in excess of five kilograms.see united states dominguez benitez,plain error must have a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.
sentencing disparities 
defendants next argue that the disparity between defendants sentences and those of manifests an unreasonable application of a which requires the district court to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.they claim that the district court did not explain how the least culpable conspirators ended up with the harshest sentences.but the district court did supply a sufficient reason for the disparity between defendants and other conspirators namely,the other conspirators pled guilty before trial see united states vaszquez rivera,cir although a district court may consider disparities among in determining a sentence,we do not find a defendant sentence to be unr
