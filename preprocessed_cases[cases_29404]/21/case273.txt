after pleading guilty to robbery and brandishing a firearm during a robbery,cándido obed aponte vellón aponte received consecutive incarcerative sentences of months and months.on appeal,aponte contends that the district court improperly departed upward from the applicable guidelines sentencing range.because aponte in fact received a sentence that varied from the applicable guidelines ranges,rather than an upward departure under the guidelines,and because we discern no plain error in the variance,we affirm.
in,aponte pleaded guilty to both counts of an indictment charging him and a with robbery in violation of and count one and with knowingly carrying,using,and brandishing firearms during and in relation to the robbery in violation of and c a count two.
after a futile flurry of pro se motions in which aponte sought,inter alia,withdrawal of his guilty plea and appointment of new counsel,the case proceeded to sentencing in february following a presentence investigation report psr issued in december,the district court calculated an advisory guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment for count one and a consecutive statutory minimum sentence of months imprisonment for count two.ultimately,however,the court declined to follow the parties recommended month total sentence due to its concern over the lengthy record of arrests and pending charges set forth in aponte psr 
the court finds that the sentence to which the parties agree does not reflect the seriousness of the offense or promote respect for the law or protect the public from further crimes by aponte.
as part of a sentencing court inquiry,a sentencing judge may consider whether a defendant criminal history score substantially underrepresents the gravity of his past conduct.that is the case here.
aponte record of past arrests or dismissed charges,even though there is an absence of any conviction,indicates a pattern of unlawful behavior.
the district court proceeded to recite the psr list of pending or dismissed state criminal charges against aponte,including pending charges of murder,robbery,and firearm violations.in so doing,it recognized that some of the separately enumerated counts related to the same cases some of those cases are the same,i recognize that.
the district court imposed prison sentences of months on count one and months on count two,to be served consecutively for a total incarcerative term of months following imposition of sentence,aponte objected that the court had erred in depart ing upward from the guidelines,because t he presentence report did not identify any information that would warrant a departure.the district court responded,it not a departure.it a variance.aponte disagreed,and elaborated that the court needed to first go by the guidelines,determine if there are any grounds for departure.the district court reiterated,t his is a variance,and i do have to do that.this appeal followed.
on appeal,aponte raises four initial challenges to his sentence,each resting on the premise that his sentence represented an upward departure under the guidelines.specifically,aponte contends that the court failed to provide advance notice of its intent to depart from the guidelines range,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure h the court failed to determine the extent of the departure by using,as a reference,the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant,a the court failed to set forth in writing the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially the seriousness of the defendant criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes,id.c and the court improperly considered his prior arrest record for purposes of an upward departure,id.a.in the alternative,he further avers that his sentence was improper even if construed as a variance because the district court imposed the variant sentence without advance notice under rule h and the court failed to state adequate reasons for the variance and improperly relied upon his arrest record,rendering the sentence procedurally unreasonable.
aponte first four arguments fail for the simple reason that the district court imposed a variant sentence rather than an upward departure.a departure,as explained by the supreme court,is a term of art under the guidelines and refers only to sentences imposed under the framework set out in the guidelines.irizarry united states,d.variant sentences,by contrast,were enabled by the invalidation of the mandatory guidelines regime in united states booker,d,and result from a court consideration of the statutory sentencing factors enumerated in a.see irizarry,at united states vixamar,cir see also united states grams,cir.
although the district court explicitly described its sentence as a variance,aponte contends that this nomenclature is not dispositive and that the district court in fact relied on a classic ground for departure under the guidelines,to wit,reliable information indicat ing that the defendant criminal history category substantially the seriousness of the defendant criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes,a.
the district court did indeed echo a in finding that aponte guidelines criminal history score substantially underrepresent ed the gravity of his past conduct due to the pending and dismissed charges set forth in the psr.but the court later explained that it was quoting from our opinion in united states flores machicote,cir,in which we recognized that a s part of the a history and characteristics inquiry,a sentencing judge may consider whether a defendant criminal history score substantially underrepresents the gravity of his past conduct.moreover,the court only addressed aponte arrest record after stating that it had also considered the other sentencing factors set forth in a.indeed,it specifically found that the sentence to which the parties agree does not reflect the seriousness of the offense or promote respect for the law or protect the public from further crimes by aponte,factors properly considered under a a c.
in short,nothing in the sentencing record persuades us that the district court intended to or in fact applied an upward departure under a.even if the court sentencing rationale were ambiguous and we do not think that it is united states marsh,cir,teaches that any error in a departure is harmless where the district court would have imposed the same sentence as a variance in any event if we find an alleged guideline error would not have affected the district court sentence,we may affirm.that is the case here.even reading the court initial reference to aponte past arrests as invoking the application of a a upward departure,the court subsequent description of its sentence as a variance and its citation to flores machicote indicate that the court would have arrived at the same sentence even if a departure were unwarranted.
we therefore turn to aponte alternative assertions that his sentence was improper even as a variance.the first of these contentions that rule h requires advance notice even in the case of a variance warrants minimal scrutiny,as that precise argument was flatly rejected by the supreme court in irizarry.see at the fact that rule h remains in effect today does not justify extending its protections to variances see also united states fernández cabrera,cir t he supreme court,in the era,has refused to expand the notice requirement announced in burns united states,d codified as rule h beyond the narrow confines of a sentencing departure.citing irizarry,at.rule h therefore placed the district court under no obligation to provide advance notice of the variance.
aponte finally argues that his variant sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately weigh the a factors and relied on the incorrect premise of a pattern of unlawful behavior inferred from aponte arrest record.aponte did not raise any such objection below we accordingly review for plain error only.see united states dávila gonzález,cir.
