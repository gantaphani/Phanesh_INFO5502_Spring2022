gerardo martín appeals his conviction and sentence,following a bench trial,for the united states after deportation due to a manslaughter conviction,in violation of a.specifically,meléndez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction,the district court refusal to grant a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines based on his cultural assimilation into american society,and the absence of a fast track program in the district of maine to process immigration cases.after careful review,we affirm.
on august,mexican citizen who had lived in the united states from the age of three and who claims a maine ordered deported due to a manslaughter conviction in florida.he was flown to laredo,texas to consummate the deportation process on january,but was subsequently found in bucksport,maine more than a year later,on may.
on june,meléndez submitted to a bench trial,having waived his right to a jury trial,for the indictment of the united states after being deported subsequent to an aggravated felony.the parties stipulated,and the court accepted,that meléndez was an alien under a,that he was convicted of manslaughter in florida,that he was on board a justice prisoner alien transportation system jpats flight that arrived in laredo,texas on january,and that he was found in bucksport,maine on may.
during the trial,john remsen,a special agent of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement,testified that meléndez a file which records every contact an alien has with the immigration a form warrant of removal and deportation reflecting meléndez deportation.the file also contained a form,a deportation case checklist,showing that a form gives the reasons for the deportation and the number of years an alien must wait before returning to the country been given to meléndez,although such form could not found.remsen also testified that meléndez never applied for,nor received,permission to the united states.
the next testimony came from frances gonzález,a detention enforcement officer with the department of homeland security,immigration customs enforcement formerly the immigration and naturalization service.gonzález,who had worked at the laredo,texas port of entry for eight years and was on duty on january,recounted the agency routine deportation procedures.when a jpats plane arrives,the number to per individually released from leg irons,handcuffs,and belly chains and are boarded into government buses or vans under the supervision of united states marshals and immigration and customs officers.the prisoners are then transported to a secure area with barriers on all sides,placed into groups of five,and visually observed as they cross the border on foot.afterward,the officers complete individual forms,which record the name of the transporting officer,the means of arrival,the port,date,and manner of removal,the alien photograph and right index fingerprint,and the signature of the officer who witnessed the alien departure.gonzález testified that she had signed meléndez form on january,and that although she could not remember specific events of that day,she would not sign a form if she was not sure that person did exit the united states.tr.
on june,meléndez was found guilty and sentenced to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.in so holding,the court rejected meléndez argument that he never left the united states,because although no witness testified to actually seeing him leave the country,the practice of signing the relevant paperwork after seeing all of the people who are being deported go across without specifically looking for one is sufficient to document that they saw this individual being deported across the border.tr.the court also denied meléndez motion for a downward departure based on cultural assimilation,stating that meléndez case is not extraordinary,that meléndez assimilation in the criminal justice system perhaps weighs against this request,and that cultural assimilation is similar to family ties responsibility,which is a discouraged factor.tr.finally,the court rejected meléndez argument that the absence of a fast track program in the district of maine forms a basis for a downward departure,constitutional or otherwise.id.this appeal follows.
sufficiency of the evidence 
meléndez first argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for illegal after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction,in violation of a b and a f.we disagree.
we review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence following bench trials de novo,evaluating whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states grace,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,we draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict and resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable to the government.id.thus,and we now emphasize,t he evidence may be entirely circumstantial,and need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence that is,the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.united states,cir quoting united states,cir.
in the instant case,the convict meléndez of violating a and b must have necessarily found that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that meléndez was an alien,whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,and that he entered or attempted to enter or was later found in the united states,without the express consent of the attorney general for such entry,at citing.
meléndez sole sufficiency challenge is directed at the third element mainly,that the government offered no conclusive proof that meléndez actually left the country and was therefore not deported.see united states,cir holding that an alien can not be said to have been deported and to have when the alien never left the country at all.specifically,meléndez argues that gonzález inability to remember the specific events of january,the day of the week,the weather,her specific duties that day,where she was positioned,and the actual number of deportees,as well as her inability to recognize meléndez and whether she actually saw him cross the insufficient the government proof that meléndez actually left the country.the missing form also allegedly detracts from the sufficiency of the evidence regarding actual deportation.we disagree.
to the contrary,we find that the evidence adduced at trial amply supports meléndez deportation.the routine procedures the significant physical restraints on the deportees,the close monitoring by marshals and immigration and customs officers,the physical barriers to the port of entry,the close surveillance of deportees as they walk across the border in groups of five and the form checklist indicating that the officer witnessed the deportee cross the lead a rational trier of fact to conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that meléndez was actually deported.see grace,at.the absence of direct,the lack of testimony of any individual who personally witnessed meléndez depart the united states,or of any photograph or videotape showing the irrelevant.as we have repeatedly emphasized,circumstantial evidence,if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility,is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the fact finder deems it should be given.united states gamache,cir.in fact,t he evidence supporting the conviction may be entirely circumstantial,at.
meléndez nonetheless urges us to follow the ninth circuit holding in,at,which we find inapposite.there,the issue pertained to the propriety of a jury instruction,not the sufficiency of the evidence at a bench trial.id.at district court erroneously instructing the jury that a n alien who is subject to a lawful deportation order,but who never actually enters mexico because of his own guile or deceit,may be considered to have been deported.we find no inaccurate or misconceived perception of this element of deportation in the instant case.moreover,unlike the defendant in,meléndez presents no evidence that he actually escaped from the port of entry,but merely urges the court to speculate about such an escape.id.at.we refuse to do so now.
meléndez remaining inability to find the form in meléndez a file,as well as gonzález inability to recall seeing meléndez actually cross the falter because these are credibility issues for the to resolve we will not them on appeal.see grace,at.
for the reasons stated,we reject meléndez challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction.
sentencing 
meléndez further argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward from the sentencing guidelines based on his cultural assimilation into american society,and that the sentence imposed under the guidelines should be vacated in light of the supreme court intervening decision in united states booker,d.these arguments also fail.
it has long been established that a sentencing court discretionary refusal to depart is generally unreviewable.united states sanchez,cir see also united states woodward,cir united states teeter,cir united states morrison,cir united states pierro,cir.narrow exceptions do exist,such as when the sentencing court bases its decision on a view that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure,united states mejia,cir,or when the court base s its decision on an error of law,woodward,at.thus,we review de novo a district court determination of its authority to depart,but lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines.mejia,at emphasis added.
booker,however,has since made the sentencing guidelines advisory,giving district courts substantially more discretion in sentencing above or below the guideline range.booker.at.although booker excised the statutory provision of the sentencing reform act that provides the standard of review for sentences on appeal,e,it left intact the provision pertaining to appellate review of sentences,a.id.at.pursuant to a,this court therefore continues to possess the same jurisdiction to review guidelines sentences as before booker,and accordingly,also still lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court refusal to depart downward based on its belief that the defendant circumstances fail to warrant such departure.see united states kornegay,cir holding that if the defendant claim is only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise its discretion to grant a departure,we may not review it see also united states monteiro,cir declining to review a sentencing judge refusal to grant a downward departure where the judge did not evince an understanding that he was constrained from doing so.here,given that the sentencing judge believed that he had discretion for downward departure on th e cultural assimilation basis,but chose not to do so given the defendant circumstances,we find ourselves without jurisdiction to review that refusal 
we still review,however,whether a booker error has occurred.the booker error is that the defendant guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.united states antonakopoulos,cir.in reviewing such error,we examine whether the error was preserved below for example,whether the defendant below argued that a guideline application transgressed either apprendi new jersey,d,or blakely washington,d.united states martins,cir.here,given that meléndez argued,and the government agreed,to reduce meléndez criminal history category because of blakely,we will assume that the booker error is preserved.
in preserved error cases,the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant substantial rights.united states,cir internal citations omitted.under this extremely difficult,but not impossible,standard,id.at,we must be convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the guidelines been advisory,id.at.
in the instant case,the judge twice denied meléndez requests for downward finding that he had discretion to do the assimilation that this defendant has had over in the criminal justice system.the judge chided meléndez for the lack of respect you have for the united states laws as reflected both in your criminal record and your actions in this case.the judge further stated that v ery clearly you knew that you were deported and you figured if you came back and were captured you would serve a light sentence,the worse that happens is they would send you back again as many people have gone through.thus,although the judge said that i am not going to sentence you to the high end of the guideline range,that is reserved for people worse than you,he also chose not to sentence meléndez at the lower range,despite his discretion to do so.see united states mclean,cir denying booker remand and noting that since defendant was sentenced in the middle of the guideline range,rather than at the bottom,and so the district court could have given him a lower sentence under the old regime speaks volumes.given that we are convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the guidelines been advisory,at,we find no booker error.
fast track program 
finally,meléndez argues that the absence of a fast track program in the district of maine violated his equal protection rights.we are not convinced.
fast track were initially established in federal district courts along the southwestern united states to accommodate the large number of immigration defendants a sentence reduction,in the form of a downward departure or some other benefit,in exchange for the defendant waiver of certain procedural rights.see generally erin middleton,to disparity how federal sentencing policies along the southwest border are undermining the sentencing guidelines and violating equal protection,utah.section of the guidelines provides upon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.sentencing guidelines manual emphasis added see also.m b,stat.these by the sentencing commission pursuant to the protect act,stat.require,at a minimum,that the defendant agree to the factual basis and waive the rights to file pretrial motions,to appeal,and to seek collateral relief except for ineffective assistance of counsel.memorandum from attorney general john ashcroft,department principles for implementing an expedited disposition or prosecution program in a district july.moreover,these programs are authorized only when they are clearly warranted by local conditions within a particular district.memorandum from attorney general john ashcroft to all federal prosecutors,department policy concerning charging and prosecuting of criminal offenses.
in the instant case,meléndez argues that the absence of a fast track program in maine violated his equal protection rights because similarly situated defendants in fast track jurisdictions could avail themselves of a downward departure.however,given the absence of a suspect classification or the implication of fundamental rights,along with the existence of a rational basis underlying the program,we disagree.
it is well established that a challenged classification that does not involve a suspect class or impinge upon fundamental rights is accorded a strong presumption of validity.almon reno,cir citing heller doe,d.meléndez cites no case law holding that the distinction between aliens sentenced in versus jurisdictions constitutes a suspect classification,nor does he offer support that the resulting inequity involves fundamental rights.thus,s uch a classification must be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.id.citing heller,at.
here,the attorney general and the attorney for the district of maine are in the best position to evaluate whether the local conditions in maine warrant such a program.they could very well find that the low volume of crimes involving illegal aliens in maine,as compared to southwestern states,enable them to put their resources to better us
