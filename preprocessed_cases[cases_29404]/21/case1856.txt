background 
the united states and russia are parties to the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites or convention,opened for signature,a multilateral treaty designed to protect certain species of wild fauna and flora against through international trade,cites,at.see generally cites secretariat,list of parties,at http last modified,providing a list of cites members and their date of entry.cites establishes a regulatory system that monitors the trade of certain wildlife passing from one member country to another.protected wildlife are listed in one of three appendices according to the level of protection required.species in appendix ii can be traded only with an export permit from the country of origin.see cites art.iv,para,at.
because cites is not,congress implemented cites through the endangered species act of,see c,and directed the fish and wildlife service of the department of the interior to carry out the provisions of the convention,see,f.pursuant to this direction,the fish and wildlife service has issued regulations incorporating the specific terms of cites,see pt,and has also undertaken the responsibility of developing the united states policy position at the roughly biennial cites conference of the parties,see.
in december,the fish and wildlife service announced that the united states intended to a proposal by germany to amend appendix ii of cites to include all species of sturgeon not already protected by cites.see.after receiving comments from various parties,the fish and wildlife service continued as planned and submitted the proposal at the tenth conference of the parties held in zimbabwe in june.the members of cites approved of the proposal and the listing became effective on april.the fish and wildlife service subsequently amended its regulations to reflect the new listing,see,amending,which was widely and publicly announced 
after april,therefore,it was unlawful for any person to import sturgeon into the united states without first obtaining a cites permit from the country of origin.see a i.violators could be prosecuted under the federal statute,which makes it a crime to knowingly import goods contrary to law,and the lacey act,which makes it unlawful to transport wildlife in violation of federal,state,or foreign law.see united states mitchell,cir holding that reaches conduct contrary to fish and wildlife service regulations that have the force and effect of law.
by indictment returned on december,koczuk and rozbicki were charged with importing,between april,and november,approximately pounds of sturgeon roe into the united states from russia without the required cites permit.after a trial,a jury found koczuk guilty of one count of conspiring to smuggle sturgeon roe into the united states,in violation of one count of smuggling sturgeon roe,in violation of and four counts of unlawfully importing sturgeon roe,in violation of the lacey act.the jury found rozbicki guilty of one count of violating the lacey act for his participation in a smuggling scheme that occurred on october.
at koczuk sentencing,the district court applied a base offense level of six for offenses involving endangered fish,a increase for pecuniary gain,and a increase for the retail value of the smuggled caviar,which the district court found to be over million.see it applied another enhancement for koczuk leadership role,see id.a,and a enhancement for obstruction of justice,see id.koczuk total adjusted offense level was therefore,which yielded a sentencing range of to months because the district court determined that koczuk criminal history category was one,see id.
the district court,however,departed downward for three reasons.first,it found that the enhancement based on the retail value of the smuggled goods overstated the seriousness of the offense.section b a of the sentencing guidelines,which concerns offenses involving endangered fish,instructs a sentencing court to increase the offense level by the corresponding number of levels from the table in of the guidelines fraud and deceit if the market value of the fish exceeds.b a.the district court noted that the table in section,which is also used to enhance offense levels for crimes of fraud and deceit,is based on the economic loss resulting from those crimes.in the district court view,appellants conduct did not result in any discernable economic loss.as it explained,this does not appear to be a case where there is any demonstrative loss similar to what you would have in a prototypical fraud case.it was therefore trouble d that it had to use the prescribed table,but nonetheless felt compelled to do so.during a fatico hearing to establish the amount of loss,a fish and wildlife agent testified that the members of cites listed sturgeon in appendix ii in part to assist russia failing economy.this testimony led the district court to conclude that appellants crimes resulted in,at most,a loss to the russian government of some conceptual nature.because,in the district court view,appellants conduct did not lead to any actual economic loss,and any arguable loss to the russian government could not have been contemplated by the sentencing commission,the court held that the enhancement overstated the seriousness of the offense.
second,the district court found that the illegal importation of sturgeon roe fell outside the heartland of cases involving endangered species.see generally koon united states,d before a departure is permitted,certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the guideline.according to the district court,most statutes completely prohibit the importation of a class of wildlife,but the statutes at issue here merely regulate the importation of sturgeon.moreover,in the district court view,part of the reason for placing sturgeon under the protection of cites was to help russia economy.the district court held that these differences were sufficient to place koczuk offenses outside the heartland of cases that the sentencing commission could arguably have contemplated in adopting section of the guidelines.
third and finally,the district court noted that koczuk was suffering from uncontrolled diabetes,and that his wife was experiencing stress from koczuk legal troubles.although the district court explained that these conditions alone were insufficient to warrant a downward departure,it found that they were adequate to support such a decision when taken in combination with the other two bases for departure.accordingly,it departed downward and sentenced koczuk principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by years of supervised release.
the district court used similar reasoning in sentencing rozbicki it applied a base offense level of six for offenses involving endangered fish,a enhancement for pecuniary gain,and a enhancement for the million retail value of the smuggled caviar,see,as well as a enhancement for obstruction of justice,see id.however,it afforded rozbicki a reduction for his minimal participation in the smuggling scheme.see id.a.rozbicki adjusted offense level was therefore,which,in his criminal history category of one,yielded a sentencing range of to months.see id.the district court departed downward,however,because it determined that rozbicki participation in the conspiracy was minimal to a degree not contemplated by
