jesus appeals the conviction and sentence resulting from his participation in a conspiracy to commit airline piracy and his use of a semiautomatic firearm,contending that i the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the inculpatory statements he made to the police,and ii we must vacate the ensuing guidelines sentence and remand for resentencing under the new advisory guidelines regime prescribed in united states booker,d.we affirm.
background 
on december,and an associate hijacked a rented helicopter and forced the pilot,at gunpoint and on threat of death,to fly them to the state penitentiary in ponce,puerto rico,where five inmates were waiting on the penitentiary roof,one of whom was the defendant brother,jose.after the helicopter departed the penitentiary,it dropped all seven men in a rural area,where the defendants went into hiding.following a massive police hunt,the defendant,his brother,and one of the prison escapees were arrested on january.all three were in possession of firearms.the police advised defendant of his miranda rights,then transported him by police car to police headquarters.several hours into this detention,while police were asking routine booking questions,abruptly stated that he wanted to tell them about his participation in the hijacking.although the police reminded that he had the right to counsel and to remain silent,he proceeded to make a detailed inculpatory statement.
in due course,defendant and his associates were indicted on one count each of conspiring to commit aircraft piracy,a,armed aircraft piracy,and use of a semiautomatic weapon during or in relation to a crime of violence,c.defendant subsequently submitted a motion to determine his mental competency to stand trial.following a hearing and a review of the federal detention center fdc psychologist evaluation,the district court found the defendant competent to stand trial.
defendant also submitted a motion to suppress his statement in which he had admitted participation in the planning and hijacking of the helicopter.the motion stated that the government could not demonstrate that his waiver of his miranda rights had been knowing and voluntary,since the fdc psychologist concluded that the defendant had but a borderline intellectual capacity,hence could not have understood his legal rights or the consequences of their waiver.at an evidentiary hearing conducted on the suppression motion during the jury trial,orally and for the first time,raised another ground for the motion to suppress that the police had coerced his statements by depriving him of food for approximately eight hours following his arrest.the district court denied the suppression motion,then admitted the confession.
following a trial,the jury convicted the defendant on all three counts.the district court thereafter imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment under counts and,as well as a term of months on count,to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed under count and count.defendant now appeals from his conviction,challenging the denial of his suppression motion,and from his sentence,arguing that the intervening booker decision,which held that the guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory,requires a remand for resentencing.
discussiona.the motion to suppress 
the defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the incriminating statements made to the police following his arrest,in that the government failed to establish that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his miranda rights.specifically,he asserts that the record evidence demonstrates that he lacked an adequate level of intellectual functioning and comprehension,and that the police coercively withheld food from him for up to eight hours following his arrest.
the standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard.with respect to determinations on matters of law,including whether the totality of the attendant circumstances demonstrate that the defendant statement was knowing and voluntary,we review de novo,whereas subsidiary findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see united states marenghi,cir.
the alleged deprivation of food 
it is undisputed that the police administered the miranda the right to refrain from several occasions following january arrest,both verbally and in writing,and that told police that he understood the warnings.thus,the sole question on appeal is whether waived his miranda rights.
a waiver of miranda rights must be voluntary and knowing 
t he relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception t he waiver also must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.only if the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the miranda rights have been waived.
moran burbine,d citation omitted see miranda arizona,d.after assessing the totality of the circumstances attending a defendant confession,see,b we will affirm the denial of a motion to suppress provided the government proved,by a mere preponderance of the evidence,that there was a valid waiver.see colorado connelly,d lego twomey,d.
first,contends that the government failed to prove that his confession was voluntary,because the record evidence demonstrates that the police failed to provide him food for up to eight hours after his arrest.
among the totality of factors which may be material in determining the voluntariness of a confession is whether law enforcement officials subjected defendant to physically coercive punishment,such as an unreasonable deprivation of food or sleep.see schneckloth bustamonte,d united states gillaum,cir,cert.denied,d,sims georgia,d finding confession involuntary where,inter alia,defendant had been in custody for eight hours without food brooks florida,d same,statement obtained after suspect was deprived of adequate food and was detained naked in a small cell reck pate,d same,statement obtained after depriving suspect of adequate food,sleep,and contact with family taylor maddox,cir.same,statement by who was interrogated for three hours,and was given no food or water,cert.denied,d.plainly,one can envision circumstances in which such deprivations of basic physical necessities would undermine a defendant will and ability to resist coercive police interrogation.
in the instant case,however,we need not determine in what particular circumstances a deprivation of food would contribute to the coercion of a confession,since there is no clear error in the district court determination that the government established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that had been provided with food before his confession.see marenghi,at.the government adduced the eyewitness testimony of police agent richard rivera of the officers who interviewed the day he was had received food prior to volunteering his confession 
q y ou mentioned also food.
q did you saw sic with your own eyes anyone giving food to 
a yes,sir.yes,sir,i did.
q at what time 
a i believe it was four something,four forty five,something like that.
q so,the food was given to exactly before he was interviewed.that is your testimony.
moreover,agent cortes testified that,far from being overborne or distressed by hunger,consumed little of the food made available to him.united states gamez,cir noting that defendant was offered but declined a drink prior to each interrogation,and never asked for food rivera cortes unequivocal testimony was more than sufficient to satisfy the government burden of proof.see united states marshall,cir observing that we normally defer to the district court resolution of witness credibility issues arising in connection with a motion to suppress.as did not testify in support of the suppression motion,the record contains no direct evidence to contradict rivera cortes testimony that was provided with food 
cites other evidentiary snippets,none of which conclusively undermines rivera cortes unequivocal testimony for example,police agent javier requena mercado testified that he could not remember whether or not he saw rojas receive water.however,a witness lack of memory normally generates simply a credibility issue for the factfinder,rather than a negative inference,that received no food as a matter of law.see,bushkin,raytheon,cir.further,requena mercado was never asked whether received food.
fbi task force agent luis sosa,who participated in the questioning during which confessed,testified that he had not seen eating 
q can you tell me if you,at any time saw jesus eating any food in that afternoon,during that afternoon 
a no,i was guarding his brother.he indeed was eating.
q so,you saw jose rojas,gordy,eating,but you did see jesus rojas eating any food 
q do you remember more or less at what time did you arrive at the interview room to interview jesus 
a the exact,not the exact hour,it was in the afternoon,because we had to wait for them to eat.
q but the fact is that when you go sic to the interview room,you did see eat,nor you sic saw left overs sic there in the room 
the sosa testimony can not conclusively establish that received no food,however,given that i sosa conceded that he was not in constant surveillance of the defendant because he was charged with guarding his brother jose,and ii sosa might have arrived at the interview room only after had finished his meal.the lack of leftovers could suggest either that consumed the entire meal,or that any leftovers had been removed from the room before sosa arrival.
police agent borrero torres was asked d uring all that time before noon to you did saw sic eat any food torres replied food,during the time that i was there,no,water.the borrero torres testimony did not contradict rivera cortes testimony that he saw eating,however,since the record does not establish that agent borrero torres was constantly in attendance with during the relevant time interval,and it is unlikely that he would have guarded for five or six hours with no break.finally,borrero torres was asked whether any of the detainees received any food or water he replied yes,water,they were given water.as the question was phrased in the disjunctive,however,borrero torres answer would have been entirely accurate whether or not had received food as well.
since the government adduced uncontradicted evidence that received food before his confession,the district court factual determination that no actionable deprivation occurred can not have been clearly erroneous.therefore,this factor need be considered no further in assessing the totality of circumstances attending the confession.see,united states spruill,cir there is no evidence that defendant complained during the day about feeling ill or hungry and he was given food on several occasions.
borderline intellectual functionality 
as concerns the question whether the waiver of miranda rights was knowing,he primarily cites to the fdc mental evaluation,which states that he had a p oor range of intellectual functioning,rating in the,and percentile in intellectual functioning tests performed on him,and characterizes intellectual functioning as b orderline,quantified as an intelligence quotient of.the report further notes that understanding of the legal process should not be assumed,then recommends that be permitted regularly to consult with his attorney at trial,and be required to restate information in his own words to ensure an adequate level of understanding.
the waiver inquiry ultimately turns not upon any one factor,but upon all the attendant circumstances,see arizona fulminante,d,including both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,schneckloth,at.see united states faulkingham,cir,cert.denied,d.more particularly,the fact that has a relatively low,standing alone,is not dispositive of the waiver determination.a defendant mental state or condition,by itself and apart from its relationship to official coercion,is never dispositive of the inquiry into constitutional voluntariness.see connelly,at.united states palmer,cir.rather,t he voluntariness of a waiver of this privilege has always depended on the absence of police overreaching,not on free choice in any broader sense of the word.connelly,at.
for several reasons,the evidence cites from the fdc evaluation is insufficient to render his statements either unknowing or involuntary.the fdc evaluation contains other language which suggests that lack of mental acuity is far less dire.for instance,it concludes that he was free of any debilitating mental illness,and had sufficient comprehension to render him competent to stand trial.see united states,cir noting that,to be found competent to stand trial,a defendant must be able to understand the proceedings against him and have sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.emphasis deleted citation omitted.further,the fdc evaluation concluded that functioned within normal range in important areas which implicate the circumstances of confession,such as orientation,language comprehension,naming ability,memory,abstract reasoning and judgment.
law enforcement officers credibly testified that the confession was lucid and articulate,see united states solis,cir noting that observations as to defendant demeanor and articulateness during a confession are evidence relevant to whether confession was knowing and voluntary,and that he volunteered during the routine booking interview that he wanted to make the statements,even after the officers once again reminded him that he was entitled to remain silent request the presence of an attorney,see united states duarte,cir finding no coercion where defendant confessed during a routine,booking interview.more importantly,cites no other record evidence of police coercive his failed allegation that he was deprived of food,see might lead us to infer that the police intentionally preyed upon his alleged intellectual deficiencies.see connelly,at.
finally,as the district court aptly noted,was hardly a neophyte in the criminal justice system,but had an extensive prior record,criminal history category iii,including convictions for attempted armed robbery in and.thus,the district court reasonably believed that,whatever the deficiencies in his intellectual functioning,repeated earlier exposure to miranda warnings made it extremely unlikely that he failed to understand his rights at the time he made these incriminating statements.see palmer,at observing that sixteen prior arrests constituted competent evidence of adequate comprehension see also united states glover,cir united states pruden,cir taylor,at united states morris,cir correll thompson,cir.indeed,it is in this context that the fdc mental possessed normal capacities for memory and the most telling.
given these factors,we conclude that even assuming the medical evidence of intellectual,relatively low to be credited,those limitations did not result in a confession which was other than knowing in the constitutional sense.see,clark mitchell,cir the inquiry is not whether a criminal suspect know s and understand s every possible consequence of a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege.that defendant had borderline retardation in the words of kisin or low average intellect in the words of gelbort is not dispositive.our sister circuits have found several instances where defendants,despite their mental retardation or low,were found to have waived their rights knowingly and intelligently.citations omitted united states turner,cir holding that defendant borderline did not prevent a knowing and intelligent waiver rice cooper,cir holding that mildly retarded defendant gave a valid waiver because police had no reason to suspect that he did not understand the warnings correll,at finding confession by defendant with an of knowing and voluntary where he had received miranda warnings in the past winfrey wyrick,cir the primary facts suggesting coercion are defendant age and low iq.yet,in past cases this court considered facts similar to these and held that confessions were voluntary.
