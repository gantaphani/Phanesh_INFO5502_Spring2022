dan carlos marchena silvestre marchena silvestre appeals his month sentence following his guilty plea to a charge of unlawfully possessing automatic weapons.after careful review of the record,we conclude that the district court sentencing determination was infected by plain error.
background 
since marchena silvestre sentence followed a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psr,and the sentencing hearing transcript.see united states almonte nuñez,cir.we rehearse only the facts necessary to form a basis for our analysis.
a.the offense and indictment 
on october,puerto rico law enforcement agents searched marchena silvestre apartment pursuant to a search warrant.the agents discovered and seized the following arsenal of firearms and ammunition an ar assault rifle,unlawfully modified to fire in full automatic mode,equipped with an unlawful short barrel,and loaded with one round in the chamber and rounds in the magazine a glock pistol,unlawfully modified to fire in full automatic mode,loaded with one round in the chamber and twelve rounds in the magazine and an additional rounds of ammunition for the two firearms.
after waiving his miranda rights,marchena silvestre admitted that the firearms and ammunition belonged to him,that he purchased both firearms,and that he also purchased and installed a metal chip that enabled the glock pistol to fire in full automatic mode.the investigating agents also discovered that the glock pistol had been stolen from its registered owner.less than a week after the seizure,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging marchena silvestre with possessing a machine gun in violation of o and possessing a stolen firearm in violation of u.j.
b.the plea agreement 
pursuant to a written plea agreement the agreement with the government,marchena silvestre agreed to plead guilty to possessing the machine gun.in turn,the government agreed to dismiss the charge that he possessed a stolen firearm,so long as marchena silvestre complied with the agreement terms.
paragraph of the agreement,entitled applicability of united states sentencing guidelines,contained a chart of sentencing guidelines calculations for o that marchena silvestre and the government agreed to submit to the court.the chart included a base offense level of,see.a,a upward enhancement for a stolen firearm,see b a,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see,to arrive at a total adjusted offense level of.since the parties did not agree to a criminal history category,the chart then set out the applicable guideline sentencing ranges for criminal history categories i months through vi months.paragraph,entitled sentence recommendation,provided that the government reserves the right to request a term of imprisonment equal to the higher end of the applicable guidelines range and the defendant will request a term of imprisonment equal to the lower end of the applicable guidelines range,and that any recommendation by either party for a term of imprisonment above or below the stipulated sentence recommendation constitutes a material breach of the agreement.the stipulated sentencing recommendations did not bind the district court,and marchena silvestre only retained the right to appeal in the event that the district court did not sentence him within the stipulated guideline sentencing range.
c.the presentence investigation report 
the district court accepted marchena silvestre guilty plea at the plea colloquy,and instructed the probation department to submit a psr.the psr departed from the agreement by recommending a base offense level of rather than,due to the added consideration that the defendant unlawful use of controlled substances made him a prohibited person under the guidelines.see a b.the psr applied the same two base level adjustments as recommended by the agreement,resulting in a total offense level of rather than as calculated in the agreement.
the psr also detailed marchena silvestre criminal history in,he was convicted of carrying a firearm in violation of puerto rico weapons law a misdemeanor for which he was fined and in he was convicted of illegally occupying property owned by the puerto rico housing department,resulting in a fine.the two convictions resulted in a criminal history category of that category with the total offense level of,the psr recommended a guideline sentencing range of to months.see ch.pt.a sentencing table.in his sentencing memorandum,marchena silvestre stated that he had no objections to the psr.
d.the sentencing hearing 
the sentencing hearing began with the government informing the court that it would request a sentence at the high end range of the guideline sentence.the court proceeded to summarize the facts of the case based on the psr,noting the serious and illegal arsenal at the heart of the case.the court then moved to reviewing marchena silvestre criminal history,noting that a combination of prior offenses without serious penalties is what really strikes you when you see this kind of thing.the court noted what it thought were two prior firearms charges one a misdemeanor conviction for carrying a firearm without a license,the other an arrest for carrying what the court described as a nine millimeter nickel plated pistol.in fact,the second charge as described in the psr was for carrying a nickel magazine loaded with three rounds of caliber ammunition,a charge dropped for lack of probable cause.no one corrected the court misreading.
given a turn to speak again before the court calculated a guideline sentencing range,the prosecutor claimed that he stood by the terms of the agreement,yet he recommended a month sentence,equaling the high end of the psr recommended range rather than the month high end as specified in the agreement chart for a criminal history category of i.
during the ensuing discussion,the district court inexplicably announced that marchena silvestre has a base offense level of,which was both wrong and contrary to any information that was before the court.the court also neglected to calculate any total offense level.the court made clear that it did not regard the case as a guidelines heartland case,and that it felt a lengthier sentence was needed because of the high incidence of criminal violence in the commonwealth for which there was too little accountability.it recited the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence listed in a,and made clear that it felt that a variance is in order under the a factors.the court then announced its sentence by beginning with a guideline sentencing range,as follows 
range is to months.the fine range is to thousand,which means nothing in this case.plus supervised release of one to three years.statutory maximum,ten years.i think that this case,because of the kind of gun,ammunition involved,his prior experiences before the law with guns,requires a sentence of at least months is the sentence i imposing.
unfortunately,the announced guideline sentencing range corresponded to nothing in the psr nor,for that matter,to any offense level in the sentencing guidelines.see ch.pt.a sentencing table.had the court adopted the psr recommendation,the range should have been to months.even more unfortunately,no one in the courtroom including even defense counsel corrected the court.
piling error on top of errors,when the district court submitted its written statement of reasons,it wrote that the total offense level was,that the criminal history category was i,and that the guideline sentencing range was to months not to months as it had stated earlier,or to months as recommended by the psr.a guideline sentencing range of to months,however,applies to either a total offense level of with a criminal history category of i,or a total offense level of with a criminal history category of ii.see ch.pt.a sentencing table.and,of course,that guideline sentencing range includes a higher floor than the also incorrect range announced at the hearing 
ii.analysis 
on appeal,marchena silvestre says that he is entitled to resentencing for three reasons his sentencing hearing was procedurally flawed,his month imprisonment term is substantively unreasonable,and the government materially breached the plea agreement.because marchena silvestre did not raise these objections in the district court,we review only for plain error.see united states dávila gonzález,cir see also united states ruiz huertas,cir.the plain error standard of review places the burden on marchena silvestre to make four showings in order to justify reversal that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
failure to calculate the guideline sentencing range 
f ailing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range is a significant procedural error.united states tavares,cir alteration in original quoting gall united states,d.the court calculation failures in this case were obvious and several.it neglected to calculate a total offense level,misstated the base offense level,and settled on a guideline sentencing range extending four months longer than the upper end of the range recommended by the psr.
these errors and their obviousness easily satisfy the first two requirements for a successful plain error challenge.the closer question is whether marchena silvestre also satisfies the requirement that he show that the obvious errors affected his substantial rights.duarte,at.in the sentencing context,we construe this requirement as imposing a burden of showing a reasonable likelihood that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.united states ortiz,cir quoting united states turbides leonardo,cir.for the following reasons,we think that marchena silvestre has shown such a reasonable likelihood.
we begin with the role of the guidelines calculation itself.we need tread no new ground in pointing out what precedent already makes clear about the required nature of that calculation 
although the sentencing guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory,district courts are still required to begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range.gall,at.only after a court has correctly calculated the applicable guideline sentencing range and evaluated the factors set out in a can it properly exercise its discretion to sentence a defendant within or outside the applicable guidelines range.far from a meaningless exercise,the requirement that the district court begin by correctly calculating the guideline sentencing range serves an important function it provides a framework or starting point to guide the exercise of the court discretion.freeman united states,d.starting with such a framework gives the sentencing judge an idea of the sentences imposed on equivalent offenders elsewhere,which in turn promote s uniformity and fairness in sentencing.united states rodríguez,cir.thus,even though sentencing judges are free to impose sentences in appropriate cases,district courts must still give respectful consideration to the guidelines and their accompanying policy statements.pepper united states,d.
united states millán isaac,cir.
it is therefore fair to presume in the ordinary case that there is a reasonable likelihood that any variance added onto that starting point moves the end point beyond where it would have been but for the error in the starting point.see ortiz,at t here is every reason to believe that the court used the guideline sentencing range as an anchoring point from which to vary.rodríguez,at explaining that the sentencing judge must start out by calculating the proper guidelines range a step so critical that a calculation error will usually require resentencing.
this is not to say that every error in calculating the guideline sentencing range calls for reversal under plain error analysis,or even under harmless error analysis.see united states marsh,cir declining to resolve a dispute over whether the court erroneously applied an upward departure under the guidelines because the district court stated that it would have reached the same result in a setting united states gerhard,cir similar williams united states,d explaining that remand is required under harmless error analysis only if the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines internal quotation marks omitted.a sentencing court might,for example,make it clear that it was aware of a possible flaw in its calculation of a guideline sentencing range,and explain that its sentence would nevertheless be the same under an alternative analysis pressed by the party that ultimately appealed.see,tavares,at deeming district court error in not conclusively choosing between the parties proposed sentencing ranges harmless because the court indicated its understanding of the competing calculations and then stated it would elect a sentence above either range.here,though,there is no such explanation by the court.instead the government asks us to infer such a view,relying on the small number of months by which the court erred,the relatively much greater size of the variance,and the round year nature of the sentence,all on top of a fair description of the section a factors and a clear intent to issue a variant sentence.
while the case for such an inference is certainly plausible,we think it falls short of serving as an adequate substitute for a clear statement by the court that would be sufficient to diminish the potential of the guideline sentencing range to influence the sentence actually imposed.ortiz,at citing united states mcghee,cir.here,the district court attempted to calculate a guideline sentencing range,described this case by reference to its differences from the heartland of cases within that range,and,throughout the hearing,recited a litany of justifications under section a for varying upward from that range given the specific characteristics of the defendant and the crime.there is nothing wrong with this approach unless one starts at the wrong yard marker.
it is,of course,true that the district court declared before hearing any argument that this was not a guideline case.seizing on this declaration,the government argues that the incorrect calculation could not have materially affected the sentence.this argument directly conflicts with the government own assertions with which we agree that the court did consider the guidelines,and then exercised its discretion to vary upward.and we have already explained that the district court repeated references to the guidelines and the heartland of cases within those guidelines indicate to us that the guidelines served as a starting point from which the court imposed an upward variance.it follows that if the district court had correctly calculated a lower starting point,then there is at least a reasonable likelihood that it would have landed on a sentence shorter than months even if just a few months shorter.nothing in this record provides any indication clear enough to overbear the probative force of this logical presumption.see ortiz,at finding that since the record contain ed no suggestion that the court considered the dimensions of the guideline sentencing range to be irrelevant,an error in calculating defendant criminal history score caused plain error united states fagans,cir explaining that an incorrect calculation of the applicable guidelines range will taint not only a guidelines sentence,but also a sentence,which may have been explicitly selected with what was thought to be the applicable guidelines range as a frame of reference.
turning to the last prong of plain error review,we need not tarry.the district court repeated failures to calculate the guideline sentencing range correctly,or to explain its calculation,all in a fashion that created a higher range than was recommended by either the psr or the agreement,compromised the fairness and integrity of the proceeding.see olano,at.we therefore conclude that,under plain error review,we should exercise our discretion to vacate marchena silvestre sentence and afford him a new sentencing hearing.see united states gonzález castillo,cir 
alleged breach of the plea agreement 
our decision to remand for resentencing due to procedural error does not end our analysis,because the parties disagree concerning the meaning of the plea agreement that will still apply on resentencing,and we typically grant specific performance as a remedy where the government breach of a plea agreement leads to reversible error.see united states clark,cir.we therefore address the claimed breach,reviewing once again for plain error.in so doing,we construe the terms and conditions in plea agreements in accordance with traditional principles of contract law,see united states murphy cordero,cir interpreting a waiver of appeal clause,looking outside the document only as necessary to provide illuminating context or resolve ambiguities in the writing,see united states alegria,cir.
the parties appear to agree as do we that the existence of a breach turns on the meaning of the phrase applicable guidelines range in paragraph sentence recommendation of the agreement.in marchena silvestre view,the phrase refers to the range identified by the agreement itself,in the chart in paragraph applicability of united states sentencing guidelines,thereby requiring the government to recommend a sentence no greater than months.the words of the agreement strongly support this view.one naturally presumes that the undefined term applicable guidelines range would refer precisely to the guideline settlement ranges set forth in the immediately prior section of the agreement called applicability of united states sentencing guidelines.if this were not the intended,and one must look outside the agreement to figure out the applicable guideline sentencing range,one would be left to ask does it refer to the ranges specified in the psr,or to those found by the district court 
the government in its brief answers this question by insisting that the applicable guidelines range means the advisory guidelines range found applicable at the sentencing hearing.but the government itself adopted as its recommendation the range set forth in the psr before the district court found the applicable range.nor did the government revise its recommendation when it learned of the court different and higher calculation.given this sequence of events,the government argument is like the thirteenth chime of a clock you not only know it wrong,but it causes you to wonder about everything you heard before.
returning to the agreement itself,we observe that if the government were correct,the chart in paragraph,which occupies nearly an entire page of the agreement,would have no apparent purpose.conversely,under marchena silvestre reading,it serves the obvious purpose of setting out the applicable sentencing guidelines that limited the range of sentences the parties could recommend at the hearing.confronted with this observation at oral argument,the government offered that the chart purpose was transparency for the defendant.but if this construction of the chart as a gratuitous,unnecessary,and educational illustration were correct,we think the chart would only be capable of confusing the defendant and setting an expectation that could both go unmet by the government recommendation later on and provide possible cause for a withdrawal of the plea.
marchena silvestre reading also finds strong support in the repeated reference to a stipulation between the parties in paragraphs and.after paragraph chart sets out a guideline sentencing range for each of the six criminal history categories,all based on a total offense level of,paragraph states that t he parties do not stipulate as to any criminal history category for defendant.it would be entirely unnecessary to make such a declaration unless the parties did stipulate to the other variable in the chart calculations,the total offense level of.paragraph then goes on to state that t he parties agree that any recommendation below or above the stipulated sentence recommendation constitutes a material breach of the agreement.emphasis supplied.from this language one naturally concludes that,if the district court selected a criminal history category of i,the parties would be prohibited from arguing for a sentence outside the range provided in the corresponding section of paragraph chart.
we recently put the government on notice that its similar reading of an analogous plea agreement was anfractuous.almonte nuñez,at.in almonte nuñez,we were asked whether the defendant was foreclosed from appealing because he was sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentence recommendation provisions of the agreement,pursuant to the agreement waiver of appeal clause.id.at.paragraph sentencing guidelines calculations of that agreement included a chart that calculated the total offense level to be.id.at.paragraph sentence recommendation then provided that the defendant may argue for the lower end of the applicable guideline range and the government may argue for the higher end of the guideline range applicable to defendant criminal history category.we interpreted the agreement to mean that for the defendant to have been sentenced in accordance with the terms of the sentence recommendation provisions,he would have had to be sentenced within a guideline sentencing range derived from an offense level of.almonte nuñez,at.since the district court imposed a sentence thirteen months higher than the high end of the guideline sentencing range corresponding to a total offense level of and the highest possible criminal history category,i t follow ed,as night follows day,that the sentences were not in conformity with the agreement sentence recommendation provisions.id.at.
the government also argued in almonte nuñez,as it does here,that the defendant was sentenced in conformance with the sentence recommendation provisions because those provisions did not lock in a particular guideline sentencing range.id.at.we responded by stating that the agreement unambiguously set the offense level at and barred arguments in favor of further adjustments.id.at.we similarly rejected the notion that,since the district court retained ultimate sentencing discretion,the government could shift its recommendation based on what occurred at the hearing.id.at.and we noted that,w ith minimal effort,the government could have drafted a waiver clause having the effect that it unrealistically ascribes to the language actually used in the agreement.id.at citing united states isom,cir considering an appeal waiver provision that applied if the sentence imposed by the court is within the guideline range determined by the court or lower.emphasis supplied internal quotation mark omitted.
so,the agreement itself tilts heavily in favor of the interpretation that marchena silvestre urges we adopt.the problem is that his own counsel who presumably well understood the agreement failed to object when the government recommended a sentence outside the stipulated ranges.was this an unwitting forfeiture or was it instead extrinsic evidence that the agreement should be read as the government applied it in fact albeit not as the government claims on appeal this would seem to be an issue on which many of the points for each side are.
we are tempted to rely on the standard of review as the deciding factor,given the supreme court guidance that the second prong of review will often have some bite in cases.not all breaches will be clear or obvious.plea agreements are not always models of draftsmanship,so the scope of the government commitments will on occasion be open to doubt.puckett united states,d.but such a reliance offers little pragmatic sense in this case.we are remanding for a new sentencing anyhow,at which defense counsel this time will presumably insist on a recommendation consistent with the chart in paragraph of the agreement.of course,the prosecution has common sense,too.we can not imagine that it will continue to use this same form to document new plea agreements if it wants to argue for a sentence in a range not reflected in the form.we note,too,that in another case before us the prosecution appears not to have pressed for an interpretation of the agreement like that for which it advoca
