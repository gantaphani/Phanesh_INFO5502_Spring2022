jerome feldman,once a practicing psychiatrist,defrauded medicare by receiving funds he was not entitled to receive and then fled the country to live as a fugitive in the philippines.there,feldman created the website,fraudulently promising to provide critically ill patients liver or kidney transplants for to.after feldman was located in the philippines and deported to the united states,feldman was prosecuted for such conduct.feldman pleaded guilty to one count of health care fraud,see,and five counts of wire fraud,see,and was sentenced to months in prison and three years of supervised release.feldman appealed,arguing that the district court committed four procedural errors in calculating feldman offense level and imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.
this case raises two novel issues.first,the government argues that we should not consider the four procedural errors claimed by feldman because at sentencing the district court stated it would impose the same sentence even without some of the alleged errors.we reject this contention for the reasons expressed herein and we emphasize that such predictions are only rarely appropriate.second,feldman argues that his website was not pursuant to b a ii because he did not initiate contact with his victims they found his website publicly available online and emailed him at an address listed on the website.we reject feldman distinction.feldman committed fraud by using the internet to solicit a large number of persons to buy his organ transplant services.the enhancement applies even if feldman did not use the most active marketing method possible.
the facts relevant to this appeal are largely taken from the presentence report psr prepared by feldman supervising probation officer.because all but one of the psr factual findings were adopted by the district court for purposes of sentencing,and such findings are necessary to our review,the psr is hereby unsealed to the extent this opinion describes the information within it.
from to,feldman,a practicing psychiatrist,owned and operated the jerome feldman community mental health center jfc center in two locations in florida.feldman applied for federal certification of the jfc center as a community mental health center.with such certification,the jfc center would be eligible for medicare reimbursement of the reasonable costs of providing partial hospitalization services to medicare patients.see ff defining,inter alia,partial hospitalization services and community mental health center see also id.a specifying amount of reimbursement.in his application,feldman vouched that the jfc center provided all psychiatric services that medicare required community mental health centers to provide.see id.c listing services that community mental health centers must provide to patients.in march,the jfc center received a medicare provider number,allowing it to file medicare claims and be reimbursed for services provided at the center.feldman also retained his personal medicare and medicaid provider numbers he had received in.
by june,after operating the jfc center for two years,feldman had filed claims for,and had received,over a million dollars of medicare and medicaid funds.that month,state and federal officials began investigating whether the jfc center submitted fraudulent claims for reimbursement.investigators interviewed jfc center employees,who admitted numerous violations of medicare rules.one employee,hired by feldman in,told investigators that feldman,among other things,instructed employees to falsify patient progress notes for medicare reimbursement and charged medicare for group therapy services that he did not personally provide.
the medical records supported these admissions.investigators asked to review medical records for a sample of medicare patients who feldman claimed received partial hospitalization services at the jfc center.four of the records could not be located and the remaining records all lacked the required physician orders for partial hospitalization services and did not otherwise qualify for medicare reimbursement.
the physical premises also concerned the investigators.believing that the jfc center building was in extreme disrepair,unsafe,and unsanitary,investigators immediately contacted the orange county health department.the very same day,state officials condemned the building after discovering,among other violations,that the building lacked running water and fire safety equipment.
because the jfc center building had been condemned and feldman was suspected of filing fraudulent claims,feldman and the jfc center medicare provider numbers were terminated in june.a few months later,in september,feldman medicaid provider number was suspended.all medicare and medicaid payments to the jfc center were suspended.from august to june,feldman false and fraudulent claims caused a total medicare and medicaid loss of.
during an overlapping time period from to feldman owned and operated three hiv clinics in florida called second chance in life.because feldman was suspended from the medicare program and his medicare provider number had been terminated,feldman was prohibited from receiving medicare funds until he rebutted his suspension or applied for reinstatement of his provider number.despite this requirement,feldman instead hired doctors with their own provider numbers and then billed medicare under those doctors provider numbers,receiving over in medicare payments from one doctor and over from another.
on august,feldman entered into a plea agreement with the united states,admitting that he was guilty of committing health care fraud through his operation of the jfc center.thereafter,feldman failed to appear for an initial conference in the district court for the middle district of florida on october.as a result,the united states filed a criminal complaint against feldman the district court issued an arrest warrant for feldman and on november,feldman became a fugitive from justice.although not known by law enforcement officials at the time,feldman had fled the united states to live in the philippines as a fugitive.
after fleeing authorities,and with an arrest warrant outstanding,feldman hoped to capitalize on a philippine policy rescinded in allowing foreign visitors to obtain organ transplants from unrelated filipino living donors.in november,feldman registered the website using the alias alberto gomez.by may,the website was publicly available and offered live kidney transplants and live or cadaver liver transplants allegedly to be performed by qualified surgeons in a philippine hospital.the website claimed that the transplant program was run by the philippines ministry of health,and listed the following prices 
kidney transplant 
liver transplant 
the website listed several email addresses,including fastertransplant.com,at which persons interested in obtaining an organ transplant could request further information.mitchel michaelson and his associate alberto gomez both aliases of feldman promised to arrange a patient transplant surgery.
in addition to the website,feldman used various aliases to open bank accounts and ups mailboxes in the united states.feldman opened one bank account in dewitt,new york and a mailbox in fayetteville,new york,both near his wife residence in baldwinsville,new york.
during the course of his scheme,feldman attracted at least five patients.as described below,each patient or caretaker learned from the website of feldman offer to secure an organ transplant initiated contact with feldman using an email address listed on the website paid money to feldman to receive an organ transplant and learned,after traveling to the philippines,that feldman lacked the power,outside of the normal workings of the philippine medical system,to guarantee an organ transplant.in total,the five patients or their caretakers lost over.
in march,the first patient son emailed feldman at fastertransplant.com,the email address listed on feldman website.the son told feldman that his father was in dire need of a kidney and was desperately seeking a transplant.feldman,using the alias mitch michaelson,promised the son that he would arrange a transplant,in a legal manner,for.on may,the patient wired a initial payment to feldman dewitt bank account and shortly thereafter flew to manila,philippines.when feldman met the patient in the philippines,he demanded that the patient pay more money before the kidney transplant surgery would be performed.the patient then gave feldman in cash and wired an additional to feldman dewitt bank account.
after the payments,feldman informed the patient that,contrary to his earlier assurances,there was no kidney donor for the patient in manila.feldman then instructed the patient to travel to a hospital in davao city,where feldman promised a donor was available.again,however,no donor was available.desperate,the patient gave in cash to the secretary of a philippine surgeon at the davao city hospital,in an effort to quickly find a donor.unsuccessful,the patient returned to the united states without receiving a transplant.although the patient asked feldman to refund the the patient paid,feldman refused and instead told the patient that he could receive a transplant if he paid an additional.the patient never received a transplant or a refund from feldman,but the patient later received a kidney transplant in the united states.
in the fall of,the second patient saw the website and emailed feldman for more information.feldman told the patient that he worked in the philippines and could obtain a kidney transplant for the patient.after the patient spoke with feldman,and with a man who told the patient that feldman helped him obtain a kidney transplant in the philippines but who refused to provide his name,the patient agreed to pay feldman to obtain a kidney transplant.
in june,the patient wired an initial payment of to the alberto gomez bank account in dewitt.a few days later,the patient traveled to the philippines with his wife.after arriving,the patient received dialysis at a small,substandard office,at which he contracted an infection.a few days later,the patient met with a doctor at a philippine hospital in manila.the patient said it was obvious that feldman had never previously contacted this doctor,but simply paid the doctor clerk to arrange an immediate appointment.when the patient met with this doctor,the doctor said the kidney transplant would cost.feldman told the patient that he wanted to negotiate the price and shop around for a kidney transplant.nevertheless,the patient stayed at the manila hospital and continued to be treated by the philippine doctor.three weeks later,the philippine doctor found a donor match.the patient agreed to pay the doctor on top of what the patient had paid feldman and on july,the patient received a kidney transplant.although the patient asked feldman for a refund of the he paid,feldman refused.
after reading feldman website,the third patient emailed feldman.feldman assured the patient that he had an available kidney donor and surgeons available to perform the surgery in the philippines.on may,the patient agreed to pay feldman,wiring to the alberto gomez account in dewitt.about a month later,on june,the patient wired an additional to that account.
when the patient arrived in the philippines,the patient learned that feldman had located neither a kidney donor nor a surgeon.as feldman privately admitted at the time,i am doing what i can money wise.i will delay this man service to push him for more money while pressing the doctors to lower their charges.playing off one against the other.indeed,feldman forced the patient to wait in manila,stating that no kidney donor was available.there is no record,however,that the patient paid feldman additional money.after waiting in manila,feldman instructed the patient to travel to davao city,where the patient received a kidney transplant from a philippine doctor.the patient returned to the united states but died from complications from the surgery on august.after the patient death,the patient family received bills for the cost of hospitalization in the philippines,although feldman had assured the patient that he would use the payment he received to cover all of the patient medical expenses.feldman refused to refund the money.
after seeing feldman website,the wife of feldman fourth patient emailed feldman to discuss obtaining a liver transplant for her husband.the patient wife told feldman that her husband was seriously ill had bleeding esophageal varices veins in the lower esophagus,which were banded to prevent further bleeding and could leave his hospital only on a doctor pass.feldman promised to arrange the transplant,legally,in the philippines for,a price that he stated would cover medical expenses in the philippines.
concerned about the transaction,the patient wife asked that a lawyer be involved.feldman rejected this request,stating that time was critical.in addition,feldman assured the patient wife that if her husband did not receive a transplant,her money would be refunded.
in may,the patient wife sent feldman a down payment of,by wire transfer to his alberto gomez account in dewitt.feldman agreed that the patient wife could pay the remaining when her husband met and was satisfied with the treating surgeon in the philippines.
despite being advised not to travel by his doctors,the patient traveled to the philippines with a friend.after arriving,the patient received little assistance from feldman,and after several days had to enter a local hospital.more than two weeks after arriving in the philippines,the patient still had not met with a transplant surgeon,and had been visited only once,and briefly,by feldman.when the patient wife complained to feldman about the delay,feldman stated that the surgeon wanted the full and asked,should i tell him that you are no longer interested 
while the patient was waiting at the local hospital,doctors advised him that manila hospitals had a poor success rate for liver transplants and suggested that he instead travel to singapore or china for a transplant.when the patient wife asked feldman about this advice,feldman minimized the poor results in the philippines as anomalous and discouraged the patient from traveling elsewhere.feldman promised that all the doctors in the philippines needed to do was match the patient blood type.
as the days passed without progress,the patient wife continued to email feldman,asking him to keep his promise.in response,feldman blamed the supposed transplant doctor for the delay and warned the patient wife not to call the doctor because the doctor would sense fear for the patient and double his fee.feldman pressured the patient wife for the remaining,saying,how will you live with yourself if you fail your husband by being so cost conscious the patient wife begged feldman for time to reverse mortgage her home for additional money noting that they already had sen t you our life savings.a week later,the patient wife wired an additional to the alberto gomez account in dewitt.
at that point,independent of feldman,the manila hospital transferred the patient to another hospital.nevertheless,almost one month after arriving in the philippines,the patient had not received a transplant,and his health was rapidly deteriorating.the patient wife emailed feldman,complaining that her husband had a fever,was not receiving proper care,and was being asked by doctors for more money.two weeks later,the patient died of liver failure.feldman ceased all communication with the patient wife.as a final insult,the patient wife received in bills from the philippine hospitals where her husband stayed.despite his promise that those costs were covered,feldman refused to pay any of the bills and refused to refund any money.
lastly,the father of the fifth patient,after conducting research on the internet and finding feldman website,emailed feldman in september.less than a month later,the father wired feldman to the alberto gomez account in dewitt,as a partial payment for his son liver transplant.after feldman received the money,he told the patient father that the patient was third on the liver transplant list and offered to bump him up to first for an additional.the father refused to pay this sum but spoke with feldman five additional times before october,when the son died before traveling to the philippines.after his son death,the father asked feldman to refund the payment,but feldman refused and ceased all communication with the father.
on february,authorities located feldman in the philippines.on february,a grand jury in the northern district of new york indicted feldman with five counts of wire fraud,see,based on feldman scheme to defraud organ transplant patients.the five wire fraud counts were based on two wire transfers by the first organ transplant patient,two wire transfers by the fourth patient,and one wire transfer by the fifth patient,all to feldman alberto gomez bank account in dewitt.on march,the philippines deported feldman to guam,where he was arrested for wire fraud.feldman then consented to his removal to the northern district of new york.
on august,the government filed an information in the middle district of florida,charging feldman with one count of health care fraud,see,based on feldman use of medicare provider numbers while operating his second chance in life clinics.that same day,feldman waived indictment,entered into a plea agreement with the attorney for the middle district of florida,and consented to the transfer of the case to the northern district of new york,see.a,where the case was joined to the wire fraud case.on august,feldman pleaded guilty to the health care count and the five wire fraud counts.
on may,the district court sentenced feldman.the district court increased feldman base offense level by levels,after finding that feldman was responsible for in total losses,see b,given from the jfc center false claims fraud,from the second chance in life fraud,and from the organ transplant wire fraud.in addition,as relevant here,the district court increased feldman base offense level by two levels for committing wire fraud through using the website,see id.b a ii two levels because the wire fraud involved the conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury,see id.b a and two levels for obstructing justice by fleeing to the philippines and remaining a fugitive for nearly a decade,see id.
the district court considered the resulting guidelines range of to months and imposed a sentence of months in prison.the district court stated that the sentence was appropriate because of feldman egregious conduct,gross disregard for suffering,and indifference to the healthcare of seriously sick people.
feldman timely appealed,arguing that the district court committed a procedural error by erroneously imposing sentence enhancements for,loss amount,conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury,and obstruction of justice and b substantive error by sentencing feldman to months in prison.
as an initial matter,the government argues that we need not decide at all whether the district court correctly calculated the applicable guidelines range because the district court could not have been clearer that it would impose the same sentence if its guidelines determinations were inaccurate.at sentencing,the district court stated that even if some of my rulings regarding the enhancements or the grouping are inaccurate,there is no question that i still would give the same sentence i am about to give under a.given this statement,the government argues that this court should decline to consider feldman claims of procedural sentencing error.
as this court has recognized,an error in a district court guidelines calculation is harmless if it could not have supported any lesser sentence.united states parker,cir.in parker,for example,the alleged error in calculating the defendant criminal history category was necessarily harmless because,even absent the alleged error,the challenged sentence was dictated by statutory mandated minimums.id.at noting that the district court imposed the lowest term of incarceration permitted by law see also united states sharpley,cir finding alleged sentencing error harmless because sentence was set at mandatory minimum and therefore any reduction in the calculated guidelines range could not reduce defendant actual sentence.here,however,eliminating any of the four challenged enhancements would have supported a lesser sentence.the challenged aspect of each enhancement resulted in a increase in feldman guidelines offense level a total increase,resulting in a higher sentence.
the government does not argue that the challenged enhancements could not have supported any lesser sentence,as required by parker.instead,the government argues that the district court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of whether the enhancements were eliminated.that is,even if the district court was presented with a lower sentence,the district court would have imposed the same sentence.therefore,the government argues that this court should decline to consider feldman claims of procedural sentencing error.
the government principally relies on two cases for this argument.in the first,united states sanchez,cir,this court noted that the sentencing transcript leaves the strong impression that the district court believed erroneously that it lacked the authority to impose a sentence on the defendant.id.at.despite this apparent error,the court stated that it would not remand if the record indicated clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it had an accurate understanding of its authority.id.at.at sentencing,the district court had stated that in this particular case i am of the view that even if i could i would not impose a sentence less than i have determined.id.at emphasis omitted.however,this court found this statement ambiguous because the district court also stated that it felt constrained by the statute and might impose a lesser sentence if it could.id.because it was not unambiguously clear that the same sentence would be imposed absent the error,this court remanded the case to the district court for resentencing.id.
in the second case,united states jass,cir,this court found that the district court erroneously applied a sentence enhancement.id.at.the court then asked whether the error was harmless 
where we identify procedural error in a sentence,but the record indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event,the error may be deemed harmless,avoiding the need to vacate the sentence and to remand the case for resentencing.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in that case,the district court,r ecognizing that the applicability of the disputed enhancement to this case was by no means clear,and inviting appellate review and action on the unsettled question of law,unequivocally stated that it would impose the same sentence on the defendant however the issue of the disputed enhancement ultimately works out on appeal.id.because the district court was uncertain whether the disputed enhancement applied,and stated unambiguously that it would impose the same sentence if the guidelines calculation did not include such enhancement,this court found the error harmless.id.
sanchez and jass stand for the proposition that if a district court errs in calculating a defendant guidelines sentencing range,this court can not assume,without unambiguous indication to the contrary,that the sentence would be the same absent the error.this case law is relevant here because,unlike parker,the sentence would have been lower absent the alleged guidelines calculation errors.see jass,at considering first whether there was procedural error and only then determining whether the error was harmless.therefore,the question before us is whether the record is unambiguous that the district court would issue the same sentence even absent all four of the challenged enhancements.
during sentencing,the district court stated that even if some of my rulings regarding the enhancements or the grouping are inaccurate,there is no question that i still would give the same sentence i am about to give under a.contrary to the government assertion,this statement is not an unambiguous declaration that the district court would impose the same sentence even if its four challenged guidelines determinations were overturned.the district court referred,without specificity,to some of the enhancements,without stating which enhancement or which combinations of enhancements would not affect feldman sentence.for that reason,this case is unlike jass,which dealt with a single enhancement,specifically identified by the district court and identified as uncertain and imposed with the explicit and unambiguous declaration that the enhancement did not affect the ultimate sentence.see jass,at.indeed,this case is controlled by sanchez,where we found it ambiguous whether the claimed error affected the district court sentence.see sanchez,at.
moreover,because the correct guidelines range is the starting point and the initial benchmark for federal sentences,gall united states,d,we can not lightly assume that eliminating enhancements from the guidelines calculation would not affect the sentence.see also united states booker,d the federal sentencing statute requires judges to consider the guidelines sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant.internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.we are especially wary of making such an assumption here,where each alleged erroneous enhancement resulted in a increase,and if all of feldman claims were correct,his guidelines sentencing range of to months would have been cut by more than half,to to months.see united states malki,cir although the district court stated that a lesser sentence would be inappropriate,we can not be confident that it would have imposed the same sentence had it understood that the bottom of the correct guideline was months less than the bottom of the guideline it thought was applicable.similarly,because the sentencing transcript leaves doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the four enhancements or adjustments,we can not say that all four,together,were harmless.
lastly,we note that a district court generally should not try to answer the hypothetical question of whether or not it definitely would impose the same sentence on remand if this court found particular enhancements erroneous.although the district court answered the hypothetical question in jass,it did so because it recogniz ed that the enhancement applicability was by no means clear and it hoped that appellate review and action would resolve an unsettled question of law.jass,at.no such reasons were present here.nor do we believe that criminal sentences may or should be exempted from procedural review with the use of a simple incantation i would impose the same sentence regardless of any errors calculating the applicable guidelines range.
in sum,we reject the government argument that we should decline to consider the four procedural errors alleged by feldman.if a district court errs in calculating the defendant guidelines sentencing range,resulting in a higher sentence,this court can not assume,without unambiguous indication to the contrary,that the sentence would be the same absent the error.therefore,as we did in both sanchez and jass,we now consider whether the procedural errors alleged by the defendant are,in fact,errors.
we review criminal sentences for abuse of discretion,a standard that incorporates de novo review of questions of law including interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and review of questions of fact.united states bonilla,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a sentencing court commits procedural error by failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.gall,at.
feldman argues that the district court erred by applying a enhancement under b a ii.under that provision,a fraud offense is subject to a guidelines increase if the offense was committed through.id.the sentencing commission application note defines as 
a plan,program,promotion,or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone,mail,the internet,or other means to induce a large number of persons to i purchase goods or services ii participate in a contest or sweepstakes or iii invest for financial profit.
application note a see also united states walker,cir c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.quoting stinson united states,d.as an example,the note states that m includes a telemarketing campaign that solicits a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance policies,application note a.here,feldman conducted an internet campaign soliciting a large number of individuals to pay thousands of dollars to secure an organ transplant.such conduct is for purposes of the section.b a ii enhancement.
feldman argues that the enhancement does not apply for two principal reasons.first,feldman argues that his website was not solicitation because t he only way someone could have viewed his website was either by directly entering the internet address or through a search engine.we disagree.soliciting individuals to purchase organ transplants was the very reason the website existed as even the name makes clear.the section b a ii enhancement does not require that feldman use the most active marketing method possible.see united states deming,cir includes use of printed advertisements and brochures to solicit customers.feldman created a public website,available for viewing by anyone with an internet connection,and he did so to attract people desperate for organ transplants.feldman offer on a public website to provide organ transplants,with listed prices,and with contact information for interested purchasers,is among the types of contemplated by section b a ii.see united states hall,cir affirming enhancement where defendant operated a website devoted to the solicitation of investments in his fraudulent scheme.
second,feldman argues that the section.b a ii enhancement does not apply because the website was not intended to induce a large number of persons to purchase goods or services because only a very limited number of people would have any interest in an organ transplant.we disagree.as the sentencing commission understood,because a single public website on the internet can,and is designed to,reach a large number of people,use of such a website to induce people to enter into a fraud can vastly increase the scale of the fraud,making the defendant more culpable.see united states heckel,cir enhancement applies where method of solicitation exposes more consumers to the fraud than otherwise would have been possible.
here,feldman website was publicly available,soliciting anyone who could read it and write an email a large population,even if it reached only those who could read english.see united states christiansen,cir finding that defendant posting of an online advertisement that was open to the public shows that she designed her scheme to induce a large number of victims.although the enhancement defines in terms of a large number of persons,application note a,the website was available to all throughout the world,and we take judicial notice of the fact that the number of people throughout the world who need liver or kidney transplants is,unfortunately,not so limited.even limited to the united states,the department of health and human services reports that to people were waiting for a kidney or liver transplant in each of the years,and,during which feldman conducted his scheme.dep t health hum,chapter i trends in organ donation and transplantation in the united states,at,available at last visited july,reporting patients on active and inactive waiting status.moreover,feldman has provided no indication that the website was so limited in distribution that it was not able to reach a large number of persons.in sum,the district court did not err by applying a enhancement pursuant to section.b a ii.
feldman also challenges the enhancement for loss amount.see b.in fraud cases,the sentencing guidelines provide that specific offense characteristics,
