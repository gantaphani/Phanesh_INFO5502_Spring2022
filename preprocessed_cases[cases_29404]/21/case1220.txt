defendant seth murdock,who is scheduled to be released from federal prison on november,and thus to commence serving his term of supervised release on that date,see e,appeals pro se from an order of the united states district court for the district of vermont,william sessions,iii,judge,denying his motion for a modification of the conditions of his supervised release to require that supervised release be served in the eastern district of michigan,rather than in the district of vermont,where he was convicted and sentenced.the district court denied murdock motion,stating that it lacked authority to order such a transfer over the objection of the eastern district of michigan.on appeal,murdock argues principally that the district court misapprehended its authority to modify the conditions of his supervised release,and that his motion should have been granted in order to carry out the recommendation made by the district court in murdock sentencing he has moved in this court for an injunction pending appeal,requiring his release to the eastern district of michigan rather than to the district of vermont.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court has authority to entertain murdock motion for modification of his conditions under e and to grant that motion with the qualification specified by the eastern district of michigan in its conditional agreement to accept murdock for supervision.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand for expedited proceedings on murdock modification motion in accordance with.c.the motion for an injunction pending appeal is denied as moot.
background 
the facts essential to this appeal many of which are described in passages of the presentence report psr prepared in connection with murdock current conviction or in the government response to questions posed by this court in an order dated october,with respect to the present appeal appear to be undisputed.in,murdock was convicted,following his plea of guilty,of interstate transportation of stolen vehicles,in violation of.he was sentenced,in pertinent part,to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.
prior to this prosecution,murdock only connection with vermont was his acquisition in vermont of the vehicles that were the subject of his conviction.murdock,years of age at the time of this conviction,was born and raised in the detroit area,in the eastern district of michigan,where he lived until the early.he returned to that area in the early and remained there until his arrest in this case.murdock has three siblings and two living in detroit,and he is a of a family business a funeral home in detroit.in sentencing murdock,judge sessions stated that,consistent with a request by murdock,the court would recommend that once he has completed his period of imprisonment,that he be returned to the detroit,michigan area.sentencing transcript,october,at.the judgment of conviction included that recommendation.
murdock is scheduled to be released from prison on november,and to begin his term of supervised release on that date.in the spring of,the bureau of prisons or bop prepared to transfer murdock to the eastern district of michigan for service of his supervised release.murdock submitted to his bop case manager a plan that included his proposed residence with one of his sisters.the case manager sent murdock proposed release plan to the united states probation office in the eastern district of michigan michigan probation.in reviewing the plan,however,the michigan probation officials interviewed the wrong family member,one who indicated that she was not willing to have murdock reside with her,and they were thus unable to confirm murdock proposed residence.memorandum from vermont deputy chief probation officer ronald tetu to district judge sessions dated june,vermont probation memorandum,at see also undated sworn declaration of vermont deputy chief probation officer ronald tetu tetu decl.submitted to this court,confirming the truth and accuracy of the statements made in the vermont probation memorandum.michigan probation also expressed concern that murdock had previously been on supervised release in the eastern district of michigan and twice had had that status revoked for violations of the conditions imposed.see government memorandum in opposition to motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal and in support of motion for summary affirmance on the merits government mem.at.michigan probation rejected murdock plan to serve his supervised release in the eastern district of michigan.
in april,after murdock was informed of that rejection and was advised that he would therefore be required to serve his term in vermont,he moved in the district court for a modification of the conditions of his supervised release to require that,upon his release from prison,his supervised release be served in the eastern district of michigan.see defendant pro se motion to transfer jurisdiction of supervised release hereinafter murdock e motion although murdock motion cited c emphases added,we construe it as having been made under e,which deals with modifications of supervised release,and not under c,which deals with modifications of probation and has no subsections.murdock e motion was not decided until august.
in the meantime,officers of the united states probation office in the district of vermont vermont probation twice contacted michigan probation on murdock behalf to ask michigan probation to reconsider its refusal.in response to the first request for reconsideration,the michigan probation officials indicated that they would in fact accept murdock case for supervision provided he agreed to a modification of conditions to include six months in a residential reentry center rrc.vermont probation memorandum at.
murdock was informed that michigan probation would agree to accept him for supervised release on the condition that he agree to spend six months in an rrc,also known as a halfway house tetu decl.murdock refused to agree to that condition,explaining that he viewed it as an extension of his period of incarceration.
vermont probation made another attempt to get michigan probation to reconsider murdock release plan and explained that the michigan probation officers had interviewed the wrong murdock sister.vermont probation provided the correct contact information and asked that michigan probation contact the correct sister to confirm that murdock original release plan contained an acceptable proposed residence.michigan probation then visited the home of the correct murdock sister and responded that 
t he residence provides adequate housing,however,after careful consideration,relocation will only be granted if the offender signs a waiver to modify his conditions to include up to six months placement at a residential reentry center due to his history of noncompliance in this district.if he is not willing to sign the waiver,relocation is denied 
when asked to expand on the reasons why they believe murdock would benefit from an rrc placement,michigan probation responded as follows 
murdock is considered to be a high risk offender based on his previous supervision progress in our district and his prior record.he previously violated supervised release in this district by leaving our district on numerous occasions without approval and committing new fradulent sic crimes,among other violations.he also fled just before he was to appear before chief judge gerald rosen on a revocation hearing and a warrant had to be issued for his arrest.by placing him in rrc,we are hoping to decrease the risk he poses while implementing a controlling strategy.the rrc will provide a structured environment,allow him to find legitimate employment,and will control his activities again,to hopefully reduce the risk of recidivism.placement would also restrict the offender from traveling outside our district and committing new crimes.
vermont probation memorandum at emphasis ours.
in light of murdock refusal to accept the condition demanded by michigan probation,the government opposed murdock motion for the transfer of his supervised release to the eastern district of michigan,stating that t ransfer s of jurisdiction proceedings are well established and require the receiving court concurrence.it would be hard to imagine the court in the eastern district of michigan accepting jurisdiction of this case if murdock is not being actively supervised in that district.id.the government noted,however,that murdock ultimate goal,which is to return to his native detroit where he has family support,community ties and employment opportunities,and which would appear to be a much better option than returning to this district where he would be essentially homeless,is a goal that murdock would be able to achieve simply by agreeing to the condition that he spend up to six months in a halfway house.id.at.
in an order dated august,august order,the district court denied murdock motion,stating as follows the eastern district of michigan has refused to accept supervision of murdock,and this court has no authority to reverse that decision.
murdock filed a timely notice of appeal.he also filed a motion to expedite the appeal,which this court granted and,noting that he had filed his brief on this appeal,he moved for an injunction requiring the bop,pending the resolution of this appeal,to release him on november to the eastern district of michigan,and not to the district of vermont.this court thereafter,noting that the government had not filed a response to the motion for an injunction pending appeal,instructed the government to file an answer to murdock motion and to address several issues relating to this appeal,including whether the district court has authority to modify the terms and conditions of appellant supervised release to require that his supervision take place in the eastern district of michigan.order dated october.the government responded and addressed the specified issues in a memorandum that constitutes its opposition to the issuance of an injunction and its merits brief urging affirmance of the district court order denying transfer of murdock supervised release.government mem.at emphasis added.
ii.discussion 
on this appeal,murdock argues that the district court misapprehended the relief he requested,as he did not ask the district court to reverse a decision by the probation department.defendant amendment to his pro se brief for emergency hearing for the appeal in the subject case at.murdock argues that the eastern district of michigan refusal to accept the transfer of supervised release is irrelevant because the district court of vermont has broad and untethered authority to modify the conditions of murdock probation,requiring supervision in the eastern district of michigan id,and that that authority supercedes provisions and other imposed or requested probation conditions id.at.for the reasons that follow,we reject the contention that the district court has unlimited discretion to transfer jurisdiction of his supervised release to another district but we vacate the district court august order and remand to the court for expedited proceedings in order to determine,in the proper exercise of its discretion,and after hearing further from murdock,whether to modify the conditions to effect a transfer.
modification of conditions of supervised release 
several statutory provisions appear to have relevance to murdock request to serve his term in the eastern district of michigan,rather than in vermont where he was convicted.these provisions are not easily reconciled.
the general provisions governing the authority of the district court to require a convicted defendant to serve a term of supervised release and to comply with certain conditions during that term are set out in.subsection c provides that if a term of supervised release is to be included in the sentence,t he court,in determining the conditions of supervised release,shall consider the factors set forth in section a,a b,a c,a d,a,a,a,and a.c.subsection d,in addition to setting out a number of conditions that the sentencing court is required to impose none of which are at issue here provides,in pertinent part,that 
t he court may order,as a further condition of supervised release,to the extent that such condition 
is reasonably related to the factors set forth in section a,a b,a c,and a d 
involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section a b,a c,and a d and 
is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to a 
any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section b and any other condition it considers to be appropriate 
d emphases added.one of the discretionary conditions of probation in b is that t he court may provide that the defendant reside in a specific place or area b.
the sentence imposed on murdock did not specify where he should reside after his release from prison but merely recommended that he be returned to the eastern district of michigan.such a recommendation is not binding on the bureau of prisons.see generally d bop is to provide a person,upon his release from prison,with transportation to the place of the prisoner conviction,to the prisoner bona fide residence within the united states,or to such other place within the united states as may be authorized by the bop director emphasis added report of the senate committee on the judiciary,at,reprinted in,i n making th e d determination as to destination,the director will necessarily have to take cognizance of the terms and conditions of supervised release if such a term is imposed pursuant to section emphasis added.however,subsection e of provides in part that 
t he court may,after considering the factors set forth in section a,a b,a c,a d,a,a,a,and a 
modify or enlarge the conditions of supervised release,at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release,pursuant to the provisions of the federal rules of criminal procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of supervision 
e emphases added.
murdock contends that e gave the district court unfettered discretion to modify his conditions to provide that he should serve that term in the eastern district of michigan.while it is clear from the above provisions that the court discretion to modify conditions is not unfettered but must instead be exercised in light of the factors described in eight specified subsections of a,neither d dealing with the initial conditions nor e dealing with modification of those conditions at any time prior to the end of the term contains any indication that if one of the conditions is that the releasee is to reside in a district other than the district in which he is convicted,the consent of the other district is required.united states johnson,discussing remedies for an individual who,because of the reversal of some of his convictions,had served more prison time than authorized for his valid conviction,and stating that the trial court may modify an individual conditions of supervised release as it sees fit.
the government,however,contends that the district court postsentencing authority to transfer murdock to the eastern district of michigan for service of his term is restricted by a different provision,which provides in pertinent part as follows 
a court,after imposing a sentence,may transfer jurisdiction over a person on supervised release to the district court for any other district to which the person is required to proceed as a condition of his release,or is permitted to proceed,with the concurrence of such court.
emphasis added.on its face,this provision appears not to permit the court,after imposing sentence,to transfer supervised release to another district without the consent of the other district,and the section has been so construed.see,united states votta,fed.app x,cir affirming the district court denial of votta motion to transfer jurisdiction over his supervised release to a different district b ecause the statute requires the concurrence of the transferee court because the transferee court here indicated that it did not concur,the district court lacked the autho
