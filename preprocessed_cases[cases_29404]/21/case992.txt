in june,the district court held evidentiary hearings to determine the quantity of drugs marks possessed with intent to distribute.the government presented the testimony of seven of the defendants acquaintances,all of whom reported that they had received prescription drugs from the defendant or had witnessed him giving drugs to other people.collectively,these witnesses described a pattern of drug distribution that began at some point in,and continued at least through the summer of.during this time,marks dated a string of girls from the local alternative education high school,freely dispensing drugs to them and to their friends on lunch breaks,after school and on the weekends.one former girlfriend,carmen trice,testified that marks gave her fistfuls of pills on hundreds of occasions.trice recalled one instance in particular when she accompanied marks to more than one pharmacy in an effort to fill a prescription for morphine sulfate and that,when he was finally successful,he gave her five to ten of the pills.most of the witnesses reported taking a variety of pills,including valium,vicodin,percocet a form of oxycodone,and morphine sulfate,but typically could not recall specifics about what they took or when they received particular pills.
marks apartment was described as a local hangout where some of the witnesses spent time on a daily basis.prescription bottles were seen throughout the apartment.marks would sometimes leave his visitors alone in the apartment,and he did not discourage them from helping themselves to pills which some of the witnesses did on occasion.
few of marks acquaintances saw him take his own medicine.one of his former girlfriends,rhonda welch,testified that she had lived with him for several months at the end of and the beginning of,and that she saw him take pills very rarely,possibly twice a month.she also testified that,on approximately ten occasions,the defendant had gone to the emergency room to get a shot rather than take his medication and that,on these visits,his legs would shake w hile the doctors were in the room.most witnesses reported that the defendant did not appear to be limited physically,providing specific examples of the defendant walking up and down stairs regularly,moving his furniture in and out of his apartments,shoveling his driveway,and picking up his rottweiler dog.
marks told two of the witnesses,both young men,that he used the pills to get girls to sleep with him,telling one of them that if you slipped pills into a girl drink,you could have all the fun you wanted.this witness,eric welch the brother of rhonda welch,also described marks reaction when marks was visited at home by a maine state police detective.after being interviewed,marks went through the apartment,collecting pill bottles in a plastic bag.welch helped by holding the bag while marks pulled pill bottles from everywhere,including above the ceiling tiles and in a kitchen drawer.marks tried unsuccessfully to have a friend keep the bag which also contained photos of naked girls,a few videotapes and a video camera at her house.
in addition to marks acquaintances,the government presented the testimony of brian mccann,an emergency room physician who examined marks in may.he testified that the nurses who treated marks noticed that marks tremors and spasms diminished when he did not think he was being observed.in another emergency room visit in march,marks reported that he had been taking his medication but that it was not controlling his pain.mccann found marks presentations suspicious and ordered a drug test.the test revealed that marks had not been taking any of his prescribed medications.
the government also introduced the testimony of anthony amato,the chief of the neuromuscular division of brigham women hospital in boston.in march,amato examined marks at the request of his treating physician to determine whether marks had stiff person syndrome,an autoimmune disease causing muscle stiffness and spasms.amato found that marks arms and legs would jerk during the examination,except when marks was distracted.he concluded that marks was physically normal and recommended that he cease his prescription medication regimen.
marks took the stand during the evidentiary hearing.he acknowledged giving away some of his prescription medications but also maintained that he took his pills fairly regularly.he testified that he took his pills in the morning and at night when other people were not around and that he sometimes skipped his afternoon pills because he did not like taking any more medication than necessary.he admitted to giving away a few percocets but stated that he consumed the vast majority of these pills a total of pills obtained through a prescription in may and another in september.he could not recall giving away any morphine sulfate,the drug that was charged in the six dismissed counts of possession with intent to distribute.on cross examination,marks acknowledged that he had been told by his probation officer that the charges involving oxycodone and morphine sulfate carried a much higher sentence than the remaining possession with intent to distribute charges.he also stated that he could not recall whether he had denied giving away valium or vicodin in an august interview with an agent of the department of health and human services.on rebuttal,that agent testified that marks had in fact denied giving these drugs away and had claimed that his mother controlled his medications.
