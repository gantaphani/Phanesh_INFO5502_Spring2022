in this sentencing appeal,hainze elías díaz arroyo complains that his month sentence is substantively unreasonable and that a condition of supervised release fails to make clear that he is not prohibited from using the internet.after careful consideration,we affirm the sentence itself but remand for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to clarify the challenged supervised release condition.
background 
as this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states rivera gonzález,cir united states dávila gonzález,cir.in january of,a puerto rico police officer spied the defendant pulling a firearm from his waistband in the vicinity of a public housing project.the defendant attempted to flee on foot losing a black wig in the process but was eventually apprehended.he admitted that he had been wearing the wig to disguise himself as he knew there was an outstanding arrest warrant against him on homicide charges.during a search incident to his arrest,the police found a container of marijuana,a stolen caliber glock pistol loaded with rounds of ammunition,and a magazine loaded with rounds of caliber ammunition.
in due course,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment charging the defendant with being a felon in possession of a firearm.see g,a.this charge carries a maximum prison sentence of years.see id.a.
after some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,the defendant entered into a plea agreement with the government the agreement.see.c b.in the agreement,the defendant agreed to request a sentence no lower than the bottom of the applicable guideline sentencing range gsr while the government agreed to recommend a sentence no higher than the top of the range.withal,the agreement reached no consensus about the defendant criminal history category chc,although it did forecast a possible gsr based on a chc of ii.
after the district court accepted the defendant guilty plea,it directed the preparation of the psi report.the psi report adumbrated a series of guideline calculations.starting with a base offense level of,see ussg a,it suggested a upward adjustment because the firearm was stolen,see id.b a,and a downward adjustment for timely acceptance of responsibility,see id.a,b,yielding a total offense level of.the psi report then proposed a chc of ii because the defendant had previously been convicted of three counts of possession of a firearm without a license,and he was on probation for those crimes when he committed the instant offense.cumulatively,these computations produced a recommended gsr of to months.
the psi report went on to note that the defendant criminal past included two separate incidents for which he was not convicted and,thus,for which no criminal history points were assessed.in,he was arrested for possessing false documents and pointing a firearm at a law enforcement officer.these charges were eventually dismissed due to a reported lack of probable cause.in,the defendant was again arrested this time he was charged with causing the death of two men and attempting to murder a third with a firearm.these charges were also dismissed,but the psi report was silent as to the reason for the dismissal.
at the disposition hearing,the district court without objection adopted the guideline calculations limned in the psi report.defense counsel requested a sentence months.the prosecutor recommended a sentence months.as part of her statement to the court,the prosecutor explained that the murder and attempted murder charges were dropped only after the sole surviving witness to the incident a minor who was able positively to identify the defendant as the shooter was threatened and fled the jurisdiction.defense counsel did not strongly deny the prosecutor account,stating that the defendant maintained his innocence with respect to those charges,and adding,ambiguously,that the defendant had no relation to that.defense counsel went on to say that she understood that the charges had been dropped because the witness had been in witness protection and did not appear to testify.
the district court noted that it had considered all of the factors enumerated in a.it specifically acknowledged the agreement,the defendant criminal history including the dismissed charges,his age,his family and employment status,his history of drug abuse,and the circumstances surrounding the offense of conviction.the court then mentioned the high incidence of violent crime in puerto and decried the fact that t oo many young men on this island are carrying dangerous weapons without the proper training to use them and without the finances to purchase them.stressing,inter alia,the defendant prior weapons convictions and the dropped murder charges,the court concluded that an upwardly variant sentence was necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense,promote respect for the law,and protect the public from further crimes by the defendant.the court then sentenced the defendant to serve months in prison consecutive to any sentence imposed in the commonwealth probation revocation proceedings,followed by a term of supervised release.no objections were made either to the sentence or to the supervised release conditions.
in setting forth the conditions of supervised release,the court required the defendant,inter alia,to comply with electronic monitoring strictures.in so doing,the court stated i n addition to any telephone or cell phone that he may have,the defendant shall maintain a telephone at his residence without a modem,an answering machine or a cordless feature during the term of electronic monitoring.
this timely appeal ensued.
on appeal,the defendant raises three issues.we discuss those issues sequentially.
to begin,the defendant argues that the clause contained in the agreement does not pretermit his appeal.that argument,however,sets up a straw man.
in so many words,the clause hinges the defendant waiver on the subsequent imposition of a sentence in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentence recommendation provisions of the agreement.because the sentence imposed by the district court was beyond the bounds of the agreement sentence recommendation provisions,the clause does not apply.see,rivera gonzález,at.and the government,to its credit,has conceded the point all along.
the centerpiece of this appeal is the defendant contention that the sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable.since the defendant did not object below,the standard of review is open to question.we have recently explained that most courts have held that an objection in the district court is not necessary to preserve a claim that the length of a sentence is substantively unreasonable.see united states vargas garcía,cir,slip op.at united states ruiz huertas,cir,slip op.at.nevertheless,a pair of first circuit cases have expressed a contrary view albeit without any analysis of the issue.vargas garcía,at slip op.at citing ruiz huertas,at slip op.at.here,though,we can follow the same path that we took in both vargas garcía and ruiz huertas and leave the issue for another day.thus,we assume,favorably to the defendant,that the abuse of discretion rubric applies.
in appraising the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,we first ask whether the district court has offered a plausible rationale for the sentence and then ask whether the sentence embodies a defensible result.see united states flores machicote,cir united states martin,cir.variant sentences are subject to this inquiry.see united states santiago rivera,cir.throughout,we remain mindful that where as here a properly calculated gsr is in place,sentencing becomes a judgment call,and a variant sentence may be constructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described.martin,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in the case at hand,the defendant contests both parts of the inquiry.he begins by denigrating the district court rationale because in his view the court premis
