juan antonio reinoso reinoso or defendant appeals from a judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york schwartz,following a guilty plea.reinoso,a citizen of the dominican republic,pled guilty to illegally reentering the united states after having been deported subsequent to his conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b.the district court sentenced reinoso to a term of months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines which governs the offense level for illegal reentry,the district court found that reinoso conviction for armed robbery constituted a conviction for a crime of violence that mandated a enhancement to the base offense level,even though the conviction had later been vacated by a youthful offender adjudication.the court also denied a downward departure based on diminished capacity,finding that reinoso mental and emotional problems,caused by severe childhood abuse,had not contributed to his commission of the offense.we hold that the district court was correct to apply the enhancement,and that it did not misapprehend its authority to grant a downward departure based on extreme childhood abuse.we also reject defendant argument,raised for the first time in his reply brief,that the district court should have applied the version of the guidelines that was in effect at the time of the offense.
background 
reinoso initially moved to the united states from the dominican republic in,at the age of.he then accumulated a substantial criminal record,beginning in,when he was tried and convicted as an adult in the new york county supreme court for armed robbery.because he was only at the time of his conviction,he was later adjudicated a youthful offender under new york law,and his conviction was vacated.reinoso proceeded to commit multiple narcotics and firearms offenses and attempted burglary of a motor vehicle,and was deported to the dominican republic in november.he returned to the united states illegally in or,and was arrested on april.charged with illegally reentering the united states subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b,reinoso pled guilty in august.
at reinoso sentencing hearing in october,the government argued that,pursuant to b a ii,reinoso should receive a enhancement to the base offense level provided for illegal reentry in a,because he had been convicted of armed robbery,a felony crime of violence,prior to his illegal reentry.reinoso did not contest that the armed robbery conviction would constitute a crime of violence within the meaning of b a ii,but contended that because the conviction had later been vacated by the new york supreme court finding that he was a youthful offender,the court could not consider it in determining his offense level.he further argued that he was entitled to a downward departure for diminished capacity because,as a result of the severe abuse that he suffered as a child,he was psychologically constrained to return to the united states.the district court found that reinoso armed robbery conviction warranted the enhancement,resulting in a total offense level of,and denied the downward departure on the ground that there was no causal connection between reinoso mental state and his offense.the court therefore imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
discussion 
on appeal,reinoso raises a number of challenges to his sentence.he first argues that the district court should not have taken into account his armed robbery conviction in increasing his offense level by points pursuant to,because that conviction was later vacated by a youthful offender adjudication.he then contends that the district court committed plain error and violated the ex post facto clause of the constitution by sentencing him pursuant to the version of the guidelines,in effect at the time of his october sentencing,rather than the version,which was in effect when he committed the offense around april.finally,reinoso claims that the court misapprehended its authority to grant him a downward departure based on extraordinary childhood abuse.all of these contentions are without merit.
reinoso offense level under section 
reinoso argues that,because his armed robbery conviction had later been vacated by his youthful offender adjudication,the district court erred in applying a enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to.section b a ii provides that i f the defendant previously was deported after a a conviction for a felony that is ii a crime of violence,the base offense level of should be increased by levels.because armed robbery is included in the definition of a crime of violence,cmt.b ii ii,the district court found that reinoso armed robbery conviction mandated the enhancement.
reinoso contends,however,that his youthful offender adjudication precludes a finding that his armed robbery offense resulted in a conviction within the meaning of b a.new york law provides that an eligible youth between the ages of and who is tried as an adult may,subsequent to his or her conviction,be adjudicated a youthful offender,resulting in the vacating of the judgment of conviction.proc.mckinney.because a youthful offender adjudication is not a judgment of conviction for a crime,id,reinoso argues that it may not be considered in calculating his offense level pursuant to.
this argument is foreclosed by our holding in united states driskell,cir,that a youthful offender adjudication remains a conviction in substance,regardless of its characterization under new york law.in considering whether a conviction later vacated by a youthful offender adjudication could be used to calculate a defendant criminal history pursuant to and d,we examined new york treatment of youthful and juvenile offenders,and concluded that a youthful offender adjudication is intended not to absolve youthful offenders of criminal responsibility,but rather,to punish them for their crimes while aiding in their rehabilitation.id.at see also united states matthews,cir holding that an adjudication under new york youthful offender statute does not operate as an expungement of the defendant conviction,and the conviction may be considered in calculating criminal history.because an eligible youth is not deemed a youthful offender until after he has been convicted as an adult,and the court has,in its discretion,determined that the interest of justice would be served by relieving the eligible youth from the onus of a criminal record,we concluded that a youthful offender adjudication does not alter the substance of the defendant adult conviction.driskell,at internal quotation marks omitted.
driskell reasoning applies here.section requires only that the defendant have a conviction for a crime of violence in order to warrant the enhancement,as reinoso does.his subsequent youthful offender adjudication did not expunge his conviction,or otherwise absolve him of criminal responsibility for the armed robbery.the district court was therefore correct in using the conviction to calculate reinoso offense level.
reinoso argues,however,that driskell should not apply because new york characterization of his conviction should control the analysis under.he relies on united states davis,wl,at,in which the district court refused to apply driskell emphasis on the substance of a youthful offender adjudication in calculating the defendant offense level under,the guidelines provision that applies to possession of a firearm after a felony conviction.reinoso reliance on davis is unavailing,however.section,the guidelines provision at issue in davis,specifically defines an adult conviction as one that is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.cmt.section,in contrast,does not define the term conviction or provide any limitations on the types of adjudications that could constitute convictions,nor does it limit the definition of conviction by reference to its state law characterization as an adult conviction.see cmt.b ii.similarly,the guidelines provision at issue in driskel
