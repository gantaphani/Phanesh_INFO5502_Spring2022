rafael guzman appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york kram,convicting him of conspiracy to possess with intent to unlawfully use five or more fraudulently obtained identification documents and sentencing him principally to a term of imprisonment of months.in applying the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines,the district court granted an upward departure in the sentence on the ground that the absence of a loss resulting from the offense did not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense,and denied a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility due to guzman conduct.we affirm the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility but vacate the sentence and remand because of error in identifying the proper base offense level in computing the upward departure.
background 
in may of,a confidential informant advised government agents that he could obtain from guzman new york state drivers licenses and identification cards issued by the department of motor vehicles in false names.the informant later introduced a new york city detective,acting in an undercover capacity,to guzman.the detective sought help in purchasing false identification documents,and,in the spring and summer of,guzman agreed to process two fraudulent applications for identification cards in exchange for per card.on each occasion,as directed by guzman,the detective appeared at the department of motor vehicles office on worth street in manhattan.there,he completed an application for a identification card,signed and dated a control slip,and was photographed.he did not present these materials to a window clerk at the department office but rather delivered them to guzman apartment in the bronx.after each delivery,the transactions were processed by a window clerk at the worth street office,and a identification card with the false name and date of birth furnished by the undercover detective was issued.when guzman was arrested on september,at his apartment,agents recovered numerous documents pertaining to the scheme,including interim identification cards,final identification cards,blank department of motor vehicle application forms,counterfeit social security cards,and birth certificates.also recovered were one death certificate,two foreign passports,and in cash.
in statements,guzman admitted that he had trafficked in fraudulent department of motor vehicles documents since.he revealed that he had acted as a broker on behalf of people usually illegal aliens who sought false identification cards.he said that he was connected to some corrupt department employees who would process the documents.guzman charged each person approximately in cash for each phony document,retaining between and,and remitting the balance to the other participants in the scheme.he also referred some of his customers to another broker connected to corrupt employees.guzman identified a number of other participants in the scheme and agreed to introduce an undercover detective to the owner of a driving school who was selling fraudulent drivers education course completion certificates.
guzman entered into a written cooperation agreement with the government in december of.according to the cooperation agreement,guzman was to provide complete and truthful information to the authorities and to commit no further crimes.any assistance provided by guzman was to be pursuant to the instructions and control of the authorities.the government agreed to file a motion for a downward adjustment pursuant to section of the guidelines if it determine d that guzman ha d provided substantial assistance in an investigation or prosecution,and if he ha d fully complied with the understandings specified in this agreement.on february,pursuant to the cooperation agreement,guzman pleaded guilty in the district court to a information charging him with conspiracy to 
possess with intent to use unlawfully,and transfer unlawfully,five and more identification documents other than those issued lawfully for the use of the possessor and false identification documents,which were transported in the mail,to wit,fraudulently obtained new york state identification cards and new york state drivers licenses,in violation of title,united states code,section a.
in april of,a new york city detective saw guzman in the parking lot of a department of motor vehicles office in the bronx.thereafter,guzman was instructed not to go anywhere near a department office without explicit authorization from his case agents.despite this instruction,guzman was seen visiting in the vicinity of the worth street office on at least three occasions.none of these visits was authorized.on the first two occasions,a detective observed guzman speaking with groups of individuals while handling papers appearing to be application forms.on the third occasion,he was seen by a worth street office supervisor,who reported this observation to a detective involved in the conspiracy investigation.the detective and a united states probation officer went to the worth street office,where they found guzman outside the building conversing with two people and gesturing toward a number of application forms in his hand.the detective confiscated the forms and instructed guzman to leave.the government thereafter terminated the cooperation agreement.
the investigation report prepared in anticipation of guzman sentencing indicated an offense level of sixteen under the guidelines,computed as follows a base offense level of six for the offense of conviction,pursuant to section a an increase based on the amount of loss,pursuant to section b i and a increase because the offense involved more than minimal planning,pursuant to section b.sentencing guidelines manual the probation office recommended against any reduction for acceptance of responsibility because guzman continued to engage in criminal conduct after pleading guilty.with one criminal history point based on a prior conviction for conspiracy to defraud the postal service and a consequent criminal history category of i,the sentencing range calculated by the probation office was imprisonment for to months.the recommendation was for imprisonment for months.
guzman objected to the calculation of his sentence in two respects.he first claimed that he should receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to section b because he had timely pleaded guilty,attempted to cooperate with the government,and engaged in no further criminal conduct after his plea.with regard to his conduct,he argued that his visits to the offices of the department of motor vehicles were consistent with innocent behavior,and he asserted that,on one occasion,working as a gypsy cabdriver,he drove a passenger to a motor vehicles office.while parked outside the office,he says he was approached by people he knew through his past dealings in identification cards but merely spoke to them without engaging in any criminal activity.
as to his second claim,guzman argued against the increase for the amount of loss,contending that there was no actual loss to those who participated in the fraud,nor to the state,which received the actual fees required for the issuance of the identification documents.the government ultimately conceded that guzman offense had not resulted in intended or actual loss to any identifiable victim and that the enhancement therefore was not warranted.because the total offense level without the enhancement would only have been eight assuming no downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,with a consequent sentencing range of zero to six months,the government requested an upward departure.this request was grounded in the government contention that the lack of loss in this case did not reflect adequately the seriousness of guzman conduct.the government urged the district court to refer to an analogous guideline applicable to bribery offenses.
guzman appeared before the district court for sentencing on december.the court first addressed the issue of acceptance of responsibility as follows
