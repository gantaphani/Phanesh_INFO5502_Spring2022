this appeal raises,inter alia,the question of which statutory provision governs the district court imposition of a term of supervised release upon a drug offender.a statute pertaining to federal crimes in general provides that for class a and class b felonies,the maximum supervised release term is five years.b.another statute,however,making criminal the drug offenses under which this defendant was sentenced,provides for somewhat different terms of supervised release and,in the defendant circumstances,mandates a supervised release term of at least five years.b a.most of the courts of appeal considering the issue have held that the latter statute,rather than b,determines the limits of the supervised release terms a district court may impose upon drug offenders sentenced thereunder.these same courts have interpreted the at least terminology as implying that,in such cases,a term of supervised release longer than five years is statutorily authorized.
having pled guilty in the district court to a drug conspiracy charge involving,as the conspiracy object,substantive offenses under a,william was sentenced to imprisonment and a term of supervised release.he appeals from the latter,arguing on the basis of b that the maximum supervisory release term is five years.he also argues that the district court committed plain error by neglecting to give him advance notice that it was considering an upward departure to ten years from the five year supervised release term provided in the united states sentencing guidelines.see a.
we conclude that b controls,and that it confers statutory authority upon the district court to impose the term of supervised release that it chose.the district court erred,however,in overlooking the sentencing guidelines provision for a supervised release term of five years.the term was thus an upward departure requiring the court to give prior notice,see burns united states,d,and to state on the record the aggravating circumstances that warranted such a departure.since the district court observed neither requirement,we vacate and remand for of supervised release term.
background 
pursuant to a plea agreement,pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,one or more kilograms of heroin,and of marijuana,in violation of a.the plea agreement set forth the statutory penalties for offense including a term of imprisonment which may not be less than ten years or more than life and a term of supervised release of at least years.b a.while and the government agreed to a term of imprisonment of months,the parties did not stipulate to a specific supervised release term.as to the supervised release term,the plea agreement parroted the language of b stating that the defendant understands that he can be sentenced to a term of supervised release of at least five years.
neither the report,nor the district court colloquy at the change of plea hearing,stated a specific supervised release term.the report indicated that the court must impose a term of supervised release of at least five years and that the term of supervised release shall in no event be less than any statutorily required term.the report also stated that there was no basis for a departure from the guidelines.at the change of plea hearing,the judge informed of the sentence he could receive upon pleading guilty,including a supervised release term of not less than five years.
later,at the sentencing hearing,following a discussion concerning an error in the report regarding a prior conviction,the district court sentenced to months imprisonment and ten years of supervised release.did not object.
following sentencing,however,filed a motion to correct his sentence.believing the district court had relied upon a prior conviction to increase his term of supervised release from five years to ten years,stated in his motion that the district court had inadvertently imposed the supervised release term required by b for a defendant with a prior conviction.he argued that because the government had failed to file an information pursuant to,indicating its intent to seek a higher sentence based on a prior conviction,the maximum allowable supervised release term was five years.b.
the district court denied motion to correct his sentence.united states cortez claudio,d.the court stated that it had not relied upon a prior conviction in setting term of supervised release.while the court recognized that b provided for a maximum term of supervised release of five years for a class a felony it concluded that the supervised release provisions in b trumped the maximums provided in b.according to the court,the requirement in b of a minimum supervised release term of at least years permitted the court,in its discretion,to impose a supervised release term of up to life.id.at.the court stated that ten years was appropriate given the nature of offense.
according to the district court,in arriving at the supervised release term,it considered all the relevant evidence and circumstances as well as the factors set forth in a.id.at.the district court stated that both the terms of imprisonment and the supervised release term were within the sentencing guidelines and appropriate considering the nature of the offense.id.at.
ii.discussion 
statutory length of supervised release terms 
the first issue is whether the maximum provided in is applicable as a limitation upon the supervised release term of who was sentenced for drug offenses pursuant to b.
we begin with a close look at the language of the two statutes.see brady credit recovery,cir.defendants convicted of conspiracy to commit drug offenses pursuant to a and,are subject to the penalties described in b pursuant to b a,the district court was required to sentence to a term of imprisonment which could not be less than years or more than life and a term of supervised release of at least years.we have recently held that this language in b establishes a mandatory minimum term of supervised release,not a maximum.united states lopez,cir.our holding in lopez made clear that any apparent language to the contrary in previous cases is limited to the specific facts of those cases,and does not constitute precedent for the proposition that language in drug statutes,such as,referring to at least years or some other term sets out the maximum rather than a minimum only.united states barnes,cir united states barnes,cir suveges united states,cir.given the plain meaning of at least and our lopez holding,we do not regard barnes and its companion cases as stare decisis in regard to the present issue concerning the upper limit of a term of supervised release in a drug case.
we start,therefore,with the premise that the district court was plainly required by b to sentence to a minimum supervised release term of at least five years.in arguing that five years is also a maximum in respect to the permissible term of supervised relief,would have us borrow from a different statute,b,applying to federal crimes generally.section b specifies,
except as otherwise provided,the authorized terms of supervised release are 
for a class a or class b felony,not more than five years 
for a class c or class d felony,not more than three years and 
for a class e felony,or for misdemeanor other than a petty offense not more than one year.
b emphasis supplied.because was convicted of a class a felony,he argues that he is subject to a term of supervised release of not more than five years.
the issue presented is whether b,which contains sentences applicable to specific drug offenses and conspiracy to commit such offenses,under which was sentenced,takes precedence over the more general b in regard not only to the minimum term expressly set forth in b but also to the unspecified lengthier terms implied if not specifically set forth in the at least phraseology.we think it does.in so holding,we join the majority of circuits that have considered this issue and that have held that b does not limit the length of supervised release terms in cases under,united states,cir united states kurkowski,cir,cert.denied,d united states sanchez,cir en banc,cert.denied,d united states page,ci
