defendants appellants abdul kadir and russell defreitas appeal from the judgments of conviction and sentences of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york irizarry,judge.after a jury trial,defendants appellants were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out acts of terrorism against john kennedy international airport.in these appeals,we address various evidentiary rulings made during the trial of russell defreitas and abdul kadir collectively,defendants as well as the reasonableness of the district court sentences.we also dispose of the appeal of abdel nur and the motions relevant to that appeal.
background 
we assume the parties familiarity with the underlying facts of this case and recite only those details relevant to this appeal.
the conspiracy to blow up john kennedy international airport jfk airport began in or.in,steven francis,a confidential informant for the fbi,met with defreitas and was later recruited into the conspiracy.francis wore a recording device during many of his interactions with the conspirators,and the recordings of these conversations provided much of the evidence at trial.in addition to defreitas,the operative indictment included as defendants and nur,kadir,and kareem ibrahim.
francis and defreitas conducted surveillance of jfk airport four times in january and videotaped the bombing targets,including fuel tanks and pipelines that,according to defreitas,would destroy the whole of kennedy and part of queens when they exploded.defreitas app.at recording tr.the government presented evidence that nur was brought into the conspiracy at least in part to help them arrange a meeting with yasin abu bakr,the leader of a militant islamic group called jamaat al muslimeen jam located in trinidad.the conspirators wanted abu bakr to connect them with adnan shukrijumah,an al qaeda operative known for his abilities.
in february,defreitas and francis met kadir in guyana.kadir expressed interest in the plot and urged francis and defreitas to refer to the attack using code words to avoid detection.in late may,ibrahim was brought into the conspiracy in order to present the plot to his contacts in iran.between february and may,the conspirators met and discussed their plans by telephone and in person in guyana and trinidad.in one telephone conversation,defreitas twice described the planned attack as worse than the world trade center,referring to the september,attacks.id.at,recording tr.
kadir,defreitas,ibrahim,and nur were arrested in early june.after being informed of his miranda rights,defreitas admitted to his leadership role in the plot.on the same day,defreitas,kadir,nur,and ibrahim were charged by complaint with conspiracy to attack a public transportation system,in violation of a,b e,b a,and c conspiracy to destroy a building by fire or explosive,in violation of n conspiracy to attack aircraft and aircraft materials,in violation of a and conspiracy to attack a mass transportation facility,in violation of a and,c,and c.defreitas and kadir were also charged with surveillance of a mass transportation facility,in violation of u.a,c,c,and.on june,a grand jury indicted the defendants on the above charges,as well as a charge of conspiracy to destroy international airport facilities,in violation of a,b,and b.
prior to trial,the district court severed the case of ibrahim from the other defendants.just before the start of trial,nur pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of providing material support to terrorists and thereafter was sentenced to months imprisonment.
following a trial in july,a jury convicted defreitas on all six counts,and kadir on all but the surveillance count.at separate sentencing proceedings,the district court sentenced each defendant to life imprisonment.
discussion 
defreitas and kadir argue on appeal that the district court made various errors during trial and imposed sentences that were unreasonable.nur has also appealed,but he has advanced no arguments.his counsel has filed a motion to withdraw pursuant to anders california,d,and the government has moved to dismiss nur appeal.
defreitas and kadir 
anonymous jury 
before trial,the government moved to empanel an anonymous jury on three grounds the serious and violent nature of the crimes charged the intensity of the international media coverage of the trial and threats to the judicial system itself,including alleged threats by defreitas against his own attorney and potential trial witnesses.defreitas objected,arguing that an anonymous jury was inappropriate because he could not have carried out the plot and his were all outside the united states.
the district court granted the government motion,finding that the evidence of threats against witnesses,the seriousness of the allegations,and the extensive media coverage of the trial all supported the government motion.the district court also carefully employed mechanisms designed to ensure a fair jury,including an extensive juror questionnaire,a hearing to permit the government and the defendants to strike jurors for cause,two weeks of additional questioning,and a full opportunity to exercise peremptory challenges.
if a district court has taken reasonable precautions to protect a defendant fundamental rights,we review its decision to empanel an anonymous jury for abuse of discretion.united states thai,cir.w hen genuinely called for and when properly used,anonymous juries do not infringe a defendant constitutional rights.united states pica,cir quotation marks omitted.a district court may order the empaneling of an anonymous jury upon a concluding that there is strong reason to believe the jury needs protection,and b taking reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure that his fundamental rights are protected.id.quotation marks omitted.
if a district court determines that an anonymous jury is appropriate,the court must take reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure protection of his fundamental rights.thai,at.this can be done by giving the jurors a plausible and nonprejudicial reason for not disclosing their identities and the court conduct of a voir dire designed to uncover bias.id.here the district court specified in the questionnaire that the reason for the anonymous jury was that,given the media interest in the case,anonymity would protect the jurors rights of privacy and assist them in discharging their responsibility as jurors independently,fairly and impartially.defreitas app.at jury instructions.
we see no basis to fault the district court empanelment of an anonymous jury in this case.defreitas and his were charged with serious crimes of terrorism.their plot to blow up oil pipelines and jet fuel tanks at jfk airport had the potential to kill hundreds or thousands of people.the district court reasonably concluded that the jurors would be fearful if their identities were revealed to these defendants.our view,expressed in an earlier case,that the reasonable likelihood that the pervasive issue of terrorism would raise in the jurors minds a fear for their individual safety holds here and supports the district court decision.united states stewart,cir.this ruling is buttressed by the extensive media coverage of the case,an additional factor we have found significant in considering the decision to empanel an anonymous jury.see united states wong,cir.
the district court also relied on separate reports by two jailhouse informants that defreitas had threatened to harm potential witnesses.defreitas disputed their accounts and argues that the district court should not have relied on their testimony without conducting an evidentiary hearing.because t he district court has discretion to determine whether or not an evidentiary hearing is needed on the government allegations concerning a defendant interference with the case,united states aulicino,cir,and because there were sufficient independent grounds for empaneling an anonymous jury,we need not address this point.our confidence that the use of an anonymous jury was neither an abuse of discretion nor unfairly prejudicial is strengthened by the record of appropriate measures the district court took to ensure the jury impartiality,which was never seriously challenged.
admission of matthew levitt expert testimony 
before trial,the government moved in limine for the admission of terrorism expert matthew levitt testimony to describe al qaeda and hezbollah and their activities in south america and to define various terms related to terrorism.see united states defreitas,cr dli smg,wl,at.the government asserted that it was relevant because t he fact that the defendants wanted to present their plot to organizations and operatives with a history of participating in international terrorist activities demonstrates the seriousness of their intent to have their plot succeed.id.as relevant on appeal,the defendants opposed levitt testimony on the basis that the mention of terrorist organizations would be more prejudicial than probative and thus should be excluded under federal rule of evidence.
the district court granted the government motion,reasoning that aside from supporting the government allegation,the adverse effect was unclear.levitt testified at trial without further objection from the defendants.levitt testimony was dry and academic,devoid of vivid imagery that might excite the jury.see,kadir app.at levitt direct testimony.
a district court decision to admit expert testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states massino,cir per curiam.federal rule of evidence provides that the district court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury,among other concerns not relevant here.provided the district court has conscientiously balanced the proffered evidence probative value with the risk for prejudice,its conclusion will be disturbed only if it is arbitrary or irrational.united states al moayad,cir quotation marks omitted.to avoid acting arbitrarily,the district court must make a conscientious assessment of whether unfair prejudice substantially outweighs probative value.id.at quotation marks omitted.
admitting levitt testimony was not an abuse of discretion.as the district court noted,levitt testimony was probative of the intent element of the charged conspiracies because the government allegation is that defendants intended to obtain support from al qaeda and hezbollah,identified with their goals.defreitas,wl,at.the defendants wanted to exclude this testimony because it was detrimental to their case,but e vidence is unduly prejudicial only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.united states figueroa,cir emphasis added.it was not error for the district court to allow testimony about these groups because it supported the government allegations against the defendants and was not unfairly prejudicial.
kadir photographs 
as part of its case against kadir,the government introduced three photographs of kadir posing with multiple machine guns.during trial,kadir filed a motion in limine to exclude these photos,as well as photos depicting kadir children with guns,on the grounds that the photos were irrelevant,that he had not been charged with possession of a firearm,and that the photos constituted inadmissible character evidence.the government argued on the basis of united states khalil,cir,that the photos were admissible to rebut the defense portrayal of kadir as a peaceful,religious teacher seeking only to raise funds to build a mosque specifically,during his opening statement,kadir counsel described kadir as 
a man who lives in the country of guyana,was,children,grandchildren,working guy he a muslim shiite.he goes to iran and kadir had a dream to build a mosque,a shiite mosque,in guyana,and there nothing wrong with that.
gov t app.at trial tr.
after hearing argument,the district court admitted the photos of kadir,but not the photos of his children,noting that the admitted photos were 
relevant to rebut portrayals by the defense in this case of kadir as having no destructive objective and posing no real threat to the safety of human beings in general these photographs go towards rebutting that in the way that was permitted,in the court view,in the khalil case.
kadir app.at trial tr.the district court noted that khalil was not identical in part because kadir,unlike mezer in khalil,had not been charged with weapons possession.when the photographs were introduced to the jury,the district court gave a limiting instruction,noting t his evidence may be considered by you only to the extent it bears upon defendant kadir knowledge,intent or motive to commit the acts charged in the indictment.id.at trial tr.it is noteworthy that,as part of his defense,kadir himself later referred to all of the photos,including those excluded earlier by the district court.
the district court admission of the kadir photographs is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see marcic reinauer transp,cir.kadir argument that the photos were impermissible character evidence under federal rule of evidence is undermined by his gamesmanship,most notably his introduction of all of the photos as part of his defense 
in determining whether the district court properly admitted the photos as evidence of motive,opportunity,or intent,we consider whether the evidence was offered for a proper purpose it was relevant to a disputed trial issue its probative value is substantially outweighed by its possible prejudice and the trial court administered an appropriate limiting instruction.united states edwards,cir.the photos satisfy all four requirements they were offered to show that kadir intent was not confined to peaceful fundraising for a future mosque which was a disputed trial issue moreover,the photos probative value,in showing intent,was not substantially outweighed by the prejudice caused kadir and the trial court issued an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury more than once.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs.
declassification of october meeting memo 
in october,case agents met in barbados to discuss the ongoing investigation and development of the plot.the defendants were provided with a partially declassified report of that meeting during discovery and at trial moved unsuccessfully to have the rest declassified and turned over to them.they argue on appeal that the district court denial of their motion was error.
at the barbados meeting,there were at least three individuals present,including two case agents,robert addonizio and michael hanratty.louis napoli,francis primary handler,did not attend the meeting.the third participant,whose identity remains classified,authored the challenged report about the meeting the october report.during discovery,the government declassified the parts of the report that stated that government officers would reach out to francis and task him to increase pressure on the plotters to move ahead,and that after defreitas returned to the united states government officers plan ned to mount a full court press on defreitas with an eye towards building a case of material support to terrorism.defreitas app.at october report.
urging complete declassification of the report and its author identity at trial,defreitas argued that the document at least raises the possibility and the likelihood that there is a witness out there who has direct evidence of government pressure.id.at,trial tr.counsel for defreitas later argued that because of the classified issues,defreitas ability to present his defense is compromised.id.at trial tr.
in denying defreitas motion to have the document declassified,the district court ruled that defreitas could elicit testimony on the structure of the investigation through of the government witnesses.addonizio,napoli,and francis testified at trial,and hanratty was available to testify but was not called by either side.
we review an evidentiary ruling such as this for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if an erroneous ruling affected a party substantial rights.marcic,at.in general,a party is entitled to a new trial if the district court committ
