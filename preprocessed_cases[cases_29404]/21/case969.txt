after carlos pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,a,the district court sentenced him to serve a incarcerative term.now challenges his sentence on two grounds i that the district court explanation for fixing the sentence at a particular point in the guideline sentencing range gsr failed to satisfy the command of c and ii that the court indulged in impermissible double counting when deciding upon the sentence.
on appeal,our first task is to answer a question of first impression in this circuit concerning the appropriate standard of review.once that chore is completed,we filter the appellant contentions through that screen.when all is said and done,we affirm the sentence.
background 
the factual predicate for the offense of conviction is immaterial for purposes of this sentencing appeal.we are concerned here solely with the facts relevant to the imposition of sentence.those facts require only a lacedaemonian account.
following the return of the indictment,the appellant maintained his innocence for some time.on july,he entered into an agreement with the government that entailed,among other things,an admission of guilt on the conspiracy charge and the dismissal of a related forfeiture count.interstitially,the plea agreement contained stipulations that the charged conspiracy,insofar as it pertained to the appellant,involved at least three and but less than five kilograms of cocaine,ussg c that the appellant occupied a supervisory position in the drug ring,id.a and that a firearm was possessed during the commission of the offense,id.b.under the sentencing guidelines,this combination of factors yielded an adjusted offense level of.the appellant timely acceptance of responsibility,conceded by the government,reduced his total offense level tol to.see id.the plea agreement did not specify either the appellant criminal history score or criminal history category chc,but the parties nonetheless agreed to recommend a gsr of months to the sentencing court.
at the hearing,the court conducted an impeccable colloquy.in the course of that colloquy,it presented the appellant with the aforementioned stipulations and the appellant readily acknowledged them.the court thereupon accepted the change of plea and directed the preparation of a presentence investigation report the psi report.
the probation officer determined that when the appellant committed the underlying offense,he was on probation for state charges related to the illegal appropriation of sixteen pedigreed horses and a sum of money.see laws ann.tit,b,b.the psi report memorialized this finding and recommended that the appellant criminal history score be increased by one point due to the prior offense and two points due to the probation violation.see ussg c d.these additions placed the appellant solidly within chc ii and,combined with a tol of,yielded a gsr of months 
the district court convened the disposition hearing on november.the court inquired if the appellant had read the psi report and it received an affirmative response.the court then queried the appellant and his counsel about corrections to the psi report.they interposed none that are of consequence here.
during the proceedings that ensued,the appellant lawyer argued for a sentence at the bottom of the gsr,emphasizing that the appellant had admitted his guilt,exhibited remorse,and sought psychiatric care for depression.the prosecutor,without any developed argumentation,suggested a sentence at the high end of the gsr.the district court settled upon a midpoint in the range months.the court reasoned that s ince the defendant is a second offender,a sentence in the middle of the guideline range will serve the objectives of punishment and deterren ce.
following the pronouncement of sentence,the court asked if the parties had anything to add or to say.in reply,the appellant counsel made a series of requests,that his client be allowed to surrender voluntarily,to serve his sentence at a federal penitentiary in florida,and to enroll in a program while incarcerated.at no time was an objection interposed to the sufficiency of the court explanation as to why it chose a sentence.
in this venue,the principal thrust of the appellant argument is that the district court gave too cursory an explanation for choosing the sentence and,thus,committed reversible error.additionally,the appellant claims that the court reference to him as a second offender was confusing,unfair,and constituted double counting,as his criminal history score already had taken into account his status.
we begin our discussion by delineating the applicable standard of review.we then visit separately each of the appellant asseverations.
standard of review 
conventionally,appellate courts review the interpretation and application of statutes de novo,united states carroll,cir,and factual findings for clear error,united states cyr,cir.here,however,the appellant did not raise the issue of the district court ostensible noncompliance with section c at the time of sentencing.this omission presents a threshold issue that is of novel impression in this circuit.
the courts of appeals are divided on what effect a defendant silence at sentencing has on an appeal that seeks to contest the sentencing court failure to comply with section c.two of our sister circuits have characterized the failure to raise a section c objection in the trial court as a waiver.see united states mccabe,cir united states caicedo,cir.the ninth circuit has characterized that sort of default as a forfeiture.see united states vences,cir.two other courts of appeals,while not discussing the distinction between waiver and forfeiture,have reviewed unpreserved section c objections for plain error.see united states merlino,cir united states james,cir.that is tantamount to treating such defaults as forfeitures.see united states olano,d.
in united states rodriguez,cir,we delineated the taxonomy of waiver and forfeiture.a party waives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it,whereas he forfeits the right if he fails to make a timely assertion of it.id.at.for purposes of appellate review,the distinction is important.while a waived issue normally may not be resurrected on appeal,a forfeited issue may be reviewed for plain error.id.this case,therefore,requires us to take sides in the aforedescribed circuit split.
we think that the view espoused by the ninth circuit,and impliedly adopted by the third and the fifth circuits,better reflects the realities of this situation.for aught that appears,the appellant,at the time of sentencing,did not make a conscious,informed decision to forgo a section c challenge.rather,he simply let the opportunity slip whether by oversight,inadvertence,or ignorance is unimportant for this purpose.where,as here,an appellant merely neglects to raise a claim before the trial court,forfeiture more aptly captures the nature of the default.accordingly,we hold that,absent some basis for finding an express waiver,the failure to raise a section c objection in the trial court is a forfeiture.the appellant claim is,therefore,subject to review for plain error.
to some extent,that may be a pyrrhic victory.the jurisprudence of plain error is not.under that regime,an appellant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.we move next to the application of that standard.
adequacy of the explanation 
as said,the appellant principal plaint is that the sentencing court contemporaneous explanation for the length of his sentence was insufficient as a matter of law.in voicing this plaint,the appellant does not contest either the gsr itself or the components used to construct it.rather,he embraces the gsr,emphasizes the applicability of section c,and builds his argument around what that provision requires.
section c is part of a larger statutory scheme.pertinently,the scheme requires that,in federal criminal cases,the sentencing court shall state in open court the reasons fo
