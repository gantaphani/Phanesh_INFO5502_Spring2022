jowenky nuñez challenges the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine base crack cocaine.see a.he raises three discrete claims of error,implicating a sentencing enhancement for his leadership role in the offense,a sentencing enhancement for his possession of a firearm during and in furtherance of a crime,and the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.finding these claims of error unpersuasive,we affirm.
background 
as this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the plea agreement,the uncontested portions of the second revised presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states almonte nuñez,cir.
the appellant was arrested on february,and charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine base,as well as possession of a firearm in furtherance of a offense.these charges arose out of a long and thorough investigation,spearheaded by the drug enforcement administration,into activities in bangor,maine.the appellant originally maintained his innocence but on january,he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge 
at a disposition hearing spread over two separate days,the appellant identified three purported inaccuracies in the psi report.first,he contested the finding that he served as a manager of the enterprise and,consequently,he objected to the proposed aggravating role enhancement.second,he contested the finding that he carried a firearm with him to make drug deliveries and,consequently,objected to the proposed enhancement for possession of a firearm in the course of the crime of conviction.third,he contested the accuracy of the psi report calculation.
the district court acknowledged and discussed each objection.in rejecting the appellant first objection,the court reviewed testimony from several coconspirators and pointed specifically to uncontradicted testimony from dawlin cabrera the ringleader of the conspiracy to the effect that the appellant was the person who kept him updated on sales and receipts.
turning to the weapons enhancement,the court agreed with the appellant that the government had not sufficiently tied the gun mentioned in the psi report to the appellant and the crime of conviction.however,the court accepted the government proffer of the appellant own testimony during a coconspirator trial,indicating that he the appellant possessed a different gun while conducting the conspiracy business.this newly introduced evidence,the court concluded,justified the weapons enhancement.
the appellant enjoyed more success with his final plaint.the district court accepted his somewhat reduced calculation.
when all was said and done,the court set the appellant base offense level at,see ussg c applied the weapons enhancement,see id.b applied the enhancement,see id.b and subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility,see id.these findings yielded a total offense level of.the appellant past record placed him in criminal history category chc iii.as a result,the appellant guideline sentencing range gsr was to months.
taking into account the appellant substantial assistance to the government and the government corresponding recommendation of a month sentence,the court departed downward,see id,and imposed a month incarcerative sentence.in formulating this term of immurement,the court noted its consideration of the appellant criminal history,character,and the nature and circumstances of the conspiracy.the court also noted the appellant specific role in the offense,the need to protect the public,and its desire to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.see a.
this timely appeal ensued 
ii.analysis 
appellate review of federal criminal sentences is for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,united states martin,cir.the process is bifurcated.a reviewing court must first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally reasonable that is,free from procedural error and then must determine whether it is substantively reasonable.see gall,at.
it follows that t he touchstone of abuse of discretion review in federal sentencing is reasonableness.united states vargas dávila,cir.that review is characterized by a frank recognition of the substantial discretion vested in a sentencing court.united states flores machicote,cir.within this framework,we review a district court factual findings for clear error,and its interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo.see united states walker,cir.
reasonableness is itself an inherently fluid concept.united states bermúdez meléndez,cir.there is not a single reasonable sentence but,rather,a universe of reasonable sentencing outcomes.united states clogston,cir.
the federal sentencing guidelines are merely advisory.see united states booker.still,the gsr remains the conventional starting point for constructing a federal sentence.see martin,at.the sentencing court is obliged to calculate the gsr correctly,and a party may challenge an incorrect calculation even where,as here,the court levies a sentence below the bottom of the range.see united states gobbi,cir.
with these principles in mind,we turn first to the appellant claim that the sentencing court erred when it applied a enhancement for his leadership role in the conspiracy.see ussg b.such an enhancement requires dual findings.first,the court must find that the underlying criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.see id.second,the court must find that the defendant,when committing the offense,managed,superintended,or exercised hegemony over at least one other participant.see,united states voccola,cir.in this instance,the appellant does not contest that the conspiracy involved five or more participants instead,he claims that he simply followed orders and attacks the district court finding that he exercised managerial responsibilities with respect to other participants in the enterprise.
this attack is easily repulsed.it ignores the testimony of several coconspirators,which confirmed the appellant exercise of operating control over various individuals at different times during the life of the conspiracy.for example,cabrera testified to the effect that the appellant was responsible for keeping him updated on the financial aspects of the conspiracy alfarabick mally testified that the appellant was in charge when cabrera was not in bangor robert jordan testified that the appellant was known as the general and was the drug ring de facto head of operations and keith bo lewis testified that the appellant was in charge of the crew.
criminal cabals do not normally have formal organizational charts,and a finding of managerial control can supportably be premised on how the enterprise operated in practice.see united states cruz,cir.en banc.here,the record is replete with evidence that,either directly or by fair inference,solidly supports the district court conclusion that the appellant was not out on the street but,instead,was responsible for overseeing retail sellers and trusted by cabrera to exert control over other players in the enterprise.no more was exigible to ground the enhancement.see united states cruz rodríguez,cir.see also united states savoie,cir.recognizing that a defendant need not be the head of a conspiracy in order to warrant managerial enhancement.
next,the appellant argues that the district court committed clear error in imposing the weapons enhancement.the applicable sentencing guideline authorizes such an enhancement i f a dangerous weapon including a firearm was possessed during the course of a crime.ussg b.the government has the initial burden of establishing that the defendant possessed a weapon during the commission of the offense.see united states anderson,cir.once that burden has been satisfied,the enhancement attaches unless the defendant can show that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to the crime.see ussg,cmt.see also gobbi,at.
here,the appellant is aiming at the wrong target.his argument focuses on a firearm purchased around august of by a coc
