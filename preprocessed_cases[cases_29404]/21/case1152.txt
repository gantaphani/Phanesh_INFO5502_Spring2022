bradley pattee appeals from a judgment of conviction,entered in the united states district court for the western district of new york frank geraci,following his plea of guilty to one count of producing child pornography,in violation of a four counts of distributing child pornography,in violation of a a and eight counts of possessing child pornography,in violation of a b,and from his sentence principally to years imprisonment.he argues on appeal that his plea was invalid because in accepting his guilty plea the district court failed to adhere strictly to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and because there was insufficient factual basis for finding the interstate commerce element of the production of child pornography count satisfied,and that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we conclude that the failure to comply strictly with all aspects of rule was not plain error affecting pattee substantial rights,that there was sufficient factual basis for the plea,and that there was no procedural or substantive error in his sentence,and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in april,after using a file sharing program to retrieve images constituting child pornography from an ip address associated with pattee,law enforcement officers obtained a search warrant for pattee residence.during the ensuing search pattee admitted to an officer that he had downloaded and viewed child pornography.the authorities ultimately recovered over images and at least videos depicting child pornography from seven hard drives seized during the search.additionally,photographic evidence on the hard drives tended to show that pattee had sexually abused a child who lived in a neighboring apartment and had photographed the abuse.the victim later confirmed that pattee had abused her over a period of approximately two years,while she was six to seven or eight years old,and photographed his actions.
pattee was arrested on july,and appeared before a magistrate judge with retained counsel.the magistrate judge advised pattee of important rights in connection with the charges that are pending against you.first and most importantly,you have the right to the assistance of a lawyer.if you can not afford to hire a lawyer,you have the right to ask the court to appoint a lawyer for you.transcript of proceedings at docket 
an indictment followed,charging pattee with the various counts of producing,distributing,and possessing the child pornography described above.at pattee arraignment,the magistrate judge ordered a continuance and exclusion of time under the speedy trial act,so that pattee and his attorney would have sufficient time to prepare and file motions and to assure that pattee has the continued assistance of counsel throughout that process.transcript of proceedings at docket.
pattee moved through counsel to suppress his incriminating statements and the evidence recovered from his residence,and in due course the district court denied the motion.the government moved to set a trial date,and a conference for that purpose was held on december.
at the december hearing,pattee retained counsel advised the district court that because pattee did not have sufficient funds to retain him for trial or to hire a forensic expert necessary for his defense,pattee wished to apply for appointed counsel pursuant to the criminal justice act cja.the court directed pattee to file a financial affidavit in order to establish his financial eligibility for assigned counsel under the cja,and adjourned the matter until january.
on january,the district court reviewed the financial affidavit and questioned pattee regarding,among other things,gold coins found during the search of his residence and the possibility of obtaining information regarding pattee assets from pattee brother and longtime girlfriend.the court then adjourned the matter until january,for further inquiry,noting that the interest of justice and the defendant having counsel for this matter outweighs the interest of the public in a speedy trial.transcript of proceedings at docket.
at the hearing on january,pattee counsel advised the court that pattee wished to change his plea to guilty to all counts of the indictment.the district court scheduled the plea hearing for the next day,and instructed the government to file a statement pursuant to united states pimentel,cir,regarding the government expectations as to the guideline sentencing range.
on january,the district court held the plea hearing.the court specifically questioned whether pattee understood that it was the government burden to prove all elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt,that he had a right to proceed to trial,and that by pleading guilty he was giving up his right to a trial,to have the prosecution prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt,to allow his attorney to witnesses on his behalf,and to testify or produce evidence on his behalf,and received pattee affirmation that he did.the district court further assured that pattee understood that your plea of guilty is the same as if we had a bench trial or a jury trial and there was returned against you a verdict of guilty.id.at.pattee also affirmed that he had not been forced or coerced in any way to plead guilty.
the district court also discussed with pattee other matters not specifically required by rule.for example,the court asked whether pattee was satisfied with his retained counsel representation,to which pattee replied that he was,and whether he had any mental or physical condition which affected his ability to knowingly plead guilty,to which pattee replied that he did not.moreover,the court specifically inquired about an incident in the county jail,in which pattee apparently had attempted suicide,and asked whether that was in any way affecting his ability to understand anything that occurring.id.at.pattee replied that it was not.
regarding the child pornography production charge,pattee stated that he understood the elements of the crime,including that the visual depiction was produced using materials that had been mailed,shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.id.at.the court reviewed the factual basis for the plea,relying primarily on the government pimentel letter.regarding the production count,pattee admitted that he engaged in the prohibited conduct with a child,took photographs of the child engaged in the conduct,and stored the images on digital media that he possessed.id.at.pattee acknowledged that the digital media,including the desktop computer and the seven external hard drives,were produced outside the state of new york.id.at.
the district court reviewed the sentencing guidelines calculations contained in the pimentel statement,advised pattee of the statutory minimum and maximum sentences,and established that pattee understood that the ultimate sentence can be up to the court just as long as you understand it ca be below the years,but could be as high as the years.id.at.pattee then pled guilty to all counts of the indictment.the district court found that pattee plea was in all respects knowing and voluntary and accepted the plea.id.at.pattee counsel did not object to any deviation from the requirements of rule,nor did he seek or receive permission to reserve the right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion.
in preparation for sentencing,the probation office prepared a report pursuant to a,which concluded that the statutory sentencing range was,as the district court had advised pattee at the allocution proceeding,to years in prison.in its written sentencing statement,the government urged the district court to impose the maximum year sentence,because of pattee extended abuse of a child and the volume of pornographic images he had produced,distributed and possessed.pattee asked the court to impose the statutory minimum of years.
during the sentencing hearing,the district court commented on pattee healthy relationships with his adult girlfriend and family,his lack of substance abuse issues,and his lack of a criminal record.but the court described pattee actions as despicable conduct that was beyond comprehension.the court commented on the enormous harm to pattee victim,as well as the seriousness of the distribution and possession of child pornography,because the photographed children are victimized every time somebody looks at those photos.id.at.the court also noted the volume of child pornography in pattee possession,and his deliberate attempt to evade detection by the use of encryption.concluding that this is really an egregious case and an egregious situation that deserves a severe sentence,id.at,the court sentenced pattee to a total of years in prison year consecutive terms for each of the four distribution counts,a consecutive year sentence for the production count,plus year terms for the possession counts,to run concurrent to each other,but consecutive to the distribution and production sentences.
discussion 
pattee argues that his guilty plea was invalid due to the asserted defects of the plea proceedings and the lack of a factual basis for his plea to the production of child pornography count.he also argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we disagree.
i.the district court failure to adhere strictly to rule was not plain error.
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure explicitly requires a court,before accepting a plea of guilty,to inform the defendant of a number of specified matters.see.b a n.rule is designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant guilty plea is truly voluntary.united states maher,cir.
pattee correctly points out that the district court omitted five of the approximately fifteen rights of which a court is required to advise a defendant before accepting a guilty plea the right to persist in a not guilty plea rule b b the right to trial by jury rule b c the right to be represented by counsel,including appointed counsel if necessary rule b d and the rights to be protected from compelled and to compel the attendance of witnesses rule b e.
rule was originally both stricter and simpler.in its original form,rule was only three sentences long,and contained no harmless error provision.it provided,in full 
a defendant may plead not guilty,guilty or,with the consent of the court,nolo contendere.the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty,and shall not accept the plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.if a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear,the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.
see generally julian cook iii,federal guilty pleas under rule the unfulfilled promise of the post boykin era,notre dame.
the amendments to the rule increased significantly the procedures which must be undertaken when a defendant tenders a plea of guilty,advisory comm.note,and added what are now sections b b f to the rule,specifying particular information that must be provided to the defendant.since then,additional required topics have been added to the list,resulting in the present text of rule b a n.a harmless error provision was added in to avoid reversals for inadvertent deviat ions which a very literal reading of rule would appear to require.see fed.crim h.rule h was enacted to make clear that guilty pleas should not be overturned,even on direct appeal,when there has been a minor and technical violation of rule which amounts to harmless error.united states westcott,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the supreme court has held that when a defendant has failed to object in the district court to a violation of rule,reversal is appropriate only where the error is plain and affects the defendant substantial rights.united states vonn,d.
this court has stated time and again that w e have adopted a standard of strict adherence to rule.united states rodriguez,cir,quoting united states livorsi,cir.but since strict adherence is subject to harmless error and,in the absence of objection,plain error review,our scrutiny is strict only at the level of assessing compliance,and does not frequently require vacatur of a plea.in the absence of an objection which is the usual situation on appeal,since district courts will ordinarily correct any error that is pointed out to them,deviations from rule will not warrant appellate relief when the defendant substantial rights have not been affected.still,a district court failure to follow the basic requirements of rule requires that this court examine critically even slight procedural deficiencies to ensure that the defendant guilty plea was a voluntary and intelligent choice,and that none of the defendant substantial rights has been compromised.rodriguez,at,quoting livorsi,at.thus,district court judges are required to adhere strictly to rule requirements.
luckily,compliance with rule is not a difficult task.the decision to follow the rule is not a discretionary decision,nor a judgment call that a district court must make quickly and under pressure.technical errors can be avoided if a district or magistrate judge has a standard script for accepting guilty pleas,which covers all of the required information we have repeatedly so advised district courts in previous cases.as we noted in rodriguez,it should be a simple matter for district and magistrate judges to avoid any error by adhering literally to the script required by the rule,and for prosecutors and defense counsel to be aware of the rule requirements and point out to the court any failure to follow them.id.
yet failures to meet those requirements are a recurring issue.during,this court heard at least two appeals that could have been avoided had the district court adhered to the rule.see united states glass,app x,cir summary order vacating and remanding because the district court did not conduct the required voluntariness inquiry and e ven the government conceded that the court rule canvass of the defendant was facially deficient internal quotation marks omitted united states germosen,app x,cir summary order although the district court noted during the defendant plea allocution that in entering into the plea agreement he waived his right to appeal the sentence,the court failed to note,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure b n,that the appeals waiver also covered fines and the terms of supervised release.see also united states hightower,app x,cir summary order assuming without deciding that the district court should have explained the implications of violating supervised release,but finding that the error was harmless united states choudhury,app x,cir summary order both parties agree that,following the defendant guilty plea in front of the magistrate judge,the district court failed to formally accept the defendant plea.while the defendant is not challenging his conviction on this basis,we take this opportunity to remind district judges of their responsibility to accept guilty pleas prior to sentencing.
these failures are not attributable solely to judges.prosecutors and defense attorneys also have an obligation to make sure that the rule is followed.defense attorneys have an obligation to ensure that their clients are fully informed of their rights before entering a plea of guilty,and that a plea that is in the client interest is properly entered.it is therefore part of counsel responsibility,and is in the client interest,to object if all elements of rule are not covered.the government also has an interest in assuring that the plea proceeding is done correctly,both to protect the defendant rights in the interest of justice,and to protect the record and avoid appeals by defendants who subsequently suffer buyer remorse and wish they had not pled guilty.therefore,prosecutors too should alert the judge to any provisions that have been missed.
incanting rights and eliciting affirmative answers as required by the rule goes only so far in assuring that a defendant really understands what is at stake.and the issues that are relevant to each defendant in making the choice whether to plead may differ in ways not captured by the rule.because even strict adherence to rule may not cover every issue that may be relevant to assessing a particular defendant understanding,district and magistrate judges must be alert to ways to go beyond rote recitals,in order to make sure that the defendant waiver of rights is truly knowing and voluntary.the rule list of required elements of a guilty plea proceeding should serve as a baseline and a trigger to seek out additional issues relevant to the particular defendant nevertheless,rule,with its list of elements that the supreme court and congress have determined should be addressed with every defendant,constitutes a required minimum in assuring that a defendant understands the nature of the charges,the penalties he faces,and the rights that he is giving up by entering a plea.compliance with the rule requirements should be automatic.
while we are certain,as discussed below,that in this case the deficiencies in the rule colloquy did not affect pattee decision to plead guilty,it is nevertheless disturbing that district courts do not routinely follow the minimal procedures put in place to protect defendants rights.while the plain error standard typically addresses the situation of individual defendants,an element of plain error review is whether the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states youngs,cir internal quotation mark omitted,quoting united states flaharty,cir.a recurring pattern of failure by a district judge to comply with rule could undermine faith in the judiciary.
in the instant case,pattee made no objection to the district court compliance with rule.we therefore review pattee present claims of defective compliance under the plain error standard.see.b united states torrellas,cir.plain error review requires a defendant to demonstrate that there was error,the error was plain,the error prejudicially affected his substantial rights,and the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.youngs,at internal quotation mark omitted,quoting flaharty,at.
in order to establish that a rule violation affected substantial rights,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states vaval,cir,quoting united states dominguez benitez,d.if the misinformation in all likelihood would not have affected a defendant calculus,then the error would be harmless,and the guilty plea need not be vacated.united states harrington,cir.in short,pattee must show that the district court error had an effect on his decision to plead guilty.united states harrison,cir.
pattee asks this court to vacate his plea of guilty because the district court erred in not informing him of all of his rights under rule and alleges that but for this error,he would have pressed forward either to a trial,or at a minimum,sought to preserve certain issues for appeal.appellant br.pattee,however,offers no evidence other than this bare assertion that the errors in the plea allocution affected his decision to plead guilty 
at the plea hearing,the court conducted the following colloquy,as relevant to this issue 
the court do you understand if you went to trial on these charges,that it would be up to the government to prove all those elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
the defendant yes.
the court do you understand that you have a right to proceed to trial on these charges 
the defendant yes.
the court do you understand that when you plead guilty,you giving up that right 
the defendant yes.
the court do you understand that by pleading guilty,you giving up your right to have the prosecution prove these charges beyond a reasonable doubt 
the defendant yes.
the court that you giving up your right to allow your attorney to witnesses on your behalf 
the defendant yes.
the court that you giving up your right to testify or produce evidence on your behalf 
the defendant yes.
the court do you understand that your plea of guilty is the same as if we had either a bench trial or a jury trial and there was returned against you a verdict of guilty do you understand that 
the defendant yes.
as previously noted,however,the district court failed to specifically address the following rule requirements during the colloquy 
b the right to plead not guilty,or having already so pleaded,to persist in that plea 
c the right to a jury trial 
d the right to be represented by counsel and if necessary have the court appoint counsel at trial and at every other stage of the proceeding 
e the right at trial to be protected from compelled,and to compel the attendance of witnesses and 
although pattee argues that the sheer number of omissions should affect our review,he primarily emphasizes the omission of the advice that he had a right to counsel at every stage of the proceedings.he points to the appearances before the court in which his counsel informed the court that pattee could not afford to retain counsel for the trial as evidence that pattee may have been concerned that if he did not plead guilty,he would be forced to trial without the assistance of counsel.
in the context of the entire record,however,see vonn,at holding that a court should consult the entire record in conducting plain error review,the contention that pattee was not aware of his right to counsel is unpersuasive.pattee was represented by retained counsel throughout the proceedings.at his first appearance,the magistrate judge advised pattee that you have the right to the assistance of a lawyer.if you can not afford to hire a lawyer,you have the right to ask the court to appoint a lawyer for you.transcript of proceedings at docket.at pattee arraignment,the magistrate judge granted a continuance,in part to assure that pattee has the continued assistance of counsel throughout that process.transcript of proceedings at docket.the district court later granted an extension of time to file the financial affidavit,because the interest of justice and the defendant having counsel for this matter outweighs the interest of the public in a speedy trial.transcript of proceedings at docket.
most tellingly,the proceedings leading up to the plea hearing were focused on assessing pattee income for the purpose of appointing an attorney for him under the cja.the record thus makes clear that pattee knew that he had a right to counsel,and to appointed counsel if he was in fact unable to afford to retain an attorney to represent him.the omission of another reminder of that right during the plea colloquy itself thus could not have affected his decision to plead guilty.
pattee understandably makes little effort to argue that the other omissions affected his decision to plead guilty.having already entered a plea of not guilty,pattee obviously understood that right,and the right to persist in that plea of which he was not advised is effectively the converse of his right to proceed to trial of which he was advised.pattee does not pretend that he was unaware that the trial to which he had a right would be by jury,nor does he argue that he would have gone to trial had he been told of his right to remain silent at trial a right closely related to the government burden of proof,of which he was expressly advised,or his right to compulsory process a right closely associated with his right to present evidence,of which the district court advised him.we do not denigrate the importance of the district court compliance with the rule command that these rights be expressly discussed with the defendant before a plea of guilty we merely note that pattee does not contend that he would not have pled guilty had these rights been explained to him,which,as we held in vaval,is the touchstone for deciding whether the failure to comply with the rule affected substantial rights.that the district court omitted several of the required items of the colloquy is regrettable,but we have no basis for concluding that pattee decision to plead guilty was the result of these omissions,whether taken singly or together.
that is particularly so in light of the strength of the evidence against him.the trial court having denied the suppression motion,the evidence against pattee was overwhelming,based on the photographic evidence recovered in the search,his own incriminating admissions,and the confirmation by the victim of the criminal acts recorded in the photographic evidence.pattee was advised of the severe penalties he faced,understood the elements of the charges against him,and was aware of the strength of the evidence.he had been advised many times of his right to counsel,including appointed counsel if he was unable to afford a retained attorney,and had taken steps to invoke that right.under these circumstances,there is no rational basis to conclude that,had pattee only been advised one more time,or more explicitly,of the specific details of the rights associated with the trial that he was knowingly waiving,he would not have chosen to plead guilty and seek leniency by accepting responsibility.the fact that this strategy did not work out to his satisfaction does not render the plea involuntary.
pattee also argues that his mental health,in particular the fact that he had attempted suicide,affected his ability to make an intelligent and voluntary plea of guilty.at the plea hearing,after pattee indicated that he was not taking any medication or drugs and that he did not have any mental or physical condition affecting his ability to understand anything that was being said,the court further inquired into pattee mental health.
the court okay.now,we know you just had an incident at the steuben county jail is that right 
the defendant yes.
the court okay.and i aware of that and you were transferred to northern ohio.is that in any way affecting your ability to understand anything that occurring today 
the defendant no.
the obligation to ensure that a defendant who elects to plead guilty does so knowingly and voluntarily is at the heart of rule.as noted above,the original version of rule required only that the court determine that the plea was made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.that concern remains fundamental.see rule b detailing what the defendant must understand about the charges and the effect of the plea rule b requiring that court determine that the plea is voluntary.a defendant mental status is central to both inquiries a defendant impaired mental or emotional capacity can interfere with his ability to understand what he is being told and to exercise rational choice.however,neither rule nor common sense dictates any particular mode of inquiry for a district or magistrate judge in making this assessment.
the rule places great weight on the requirement that the district court must address the defendant personally in open court in making these determinations.b see also rule b same.the judge who can see and interact with the defendant is in the best position to decide whether the facts and circumstances of the case,or the defendant demeanor in the courtroom,suggest the need for a inquiry into the defendant mental condition.we discern no abuse of discretion in the court choices here.the court inquired of defendant as to his mental status and whether he was on medication,and inquired more specifically regarding an incident that might have shed additional light on pattee mental health.nothing more was required,and the questions and answers,as well as the overall record of the plea colloquy,amply support the district court ultimate conclusion that the plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily.
finally,pattee alleges that his retained counsel told him that he could plead guilty and still appeal the suppression motion that had been denied,and upon which his case depended.if pattee counsel did tell him that,the advice was incorrect,because the right to appeal the denial of an earlier suppression motion is waived by a guilty plea unless the right to appeal is specifically reserved and pattee counsel made no attempt during the plea hearing to reserve the right to appeal the district court denial of the motion.
this alleged error by retained counsel suggests a possible ineffective assistance of counsel claim,which pattee does not make here.nor could he on the present record,since pattee claim concerns what his attorney advised him in private,and possibly any negotiations that may have been had with the government concerning a possible conditional guilty plea,neither of which is part of the existing record.pattee may raise such claims by a motion pursuant to we intimate no view as to the merits of any such motion.the district court,however,was not required by rule to inform the defendant that a guilty plea waives his right to appeal defects in the proceedings before entry of the plea,including the denial of critical suppression motions we note that it would serve the interests of justice,and also the prudential purpose of creating a record that would either expose erroneous advice by counsel before a plea is entered or refute later false claims of such advice,if district and magistrate judges included advice about the effect of a guilty plea on appeal rights in their standard colloquy for guilty plea proceedings,particularly in cases in which the outcome of a suppression motion is largely determinative of the defendant prospects at trial.
in sum,although the district court did not strictly comply with rule,that deviation from proper procedure did not affect substantial rights because the full record demonstrates that pattee was aware of the essence of those rights of which he was not specifically advised at the time of his plea,such that the failure to repeat that advice could not reasonably have affected pattee decision to plead guilty.there was thus no plain error that would require us to vacate the plea.
ii.the record provides ample basis to support the court determination that there was a factual basis for the guilty plea for the production of child pornography count.
pattee next argues that there was not a sufficient factual basis for the child pornography production count,because he made no admission that the pornography was produced using equipment that had traveled in interstate commerce,as there was no mention of cameras or video equipment in the plea colloquy,appellant br,only an admission that the pornography was stored on hard drives that had traveled in interstate commerce.therefore,he argues that the colloquy does not support a finding of a factual basis for the commerce element of the charge of production of child pornography.we do not agree.
under federal rule of criminal procedure b,b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.see united states culbertson,cir.rule b requires the district court to assure itself simply that the conduct to which the defendant admits is in fact an offense under the statutory provision under which he is pleading guilty.maher,at discussing the predecessor to rule b,rule f.in making its determination,the court is not required to rely solely on the defendant own admissions,and indeed the district court may turn to statements of the defendant,of the attorneys for the government and the defense,or of the presentence report when one is available,quoting,advisory comm.note.even a reading of the indictment to the defendant coupled with his admission of the acts described in it may provide a sufficient factual basis for a guilty plea where the charge is uncomplicated,the indictment detailed and specific,and the admission unequivocal.united states garcia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
using a minor in the production of child pornography is a federal crime as defined by a under certain circumstances involving interstate commerce.a person commits this crime when the commerce element is satisfied if he employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct.a.in pattee case,the indictment charged and the government contends that the commerce element was satisfied because the visual depictions of the victim were produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.a.as before,because pattee failed to object on the basis of a rule violation,here
