steven madori appeals his conviction in the united states district court of the southern district of new york lynch,for extortionate extension and collection of credit and for conspiracy.see,and.he attacks his loansharking conviction principally on the ground that the government adduced insufficient proof that he was party to an understanding that force would be used to collect the loans.also,he contends that he should have been granted a new trial because the government withheld brady and giglio material relating to the cooperation of his codefendant,charles chiapetta,under circumstances that evidenced,or at least created the appearance of,the trial judge partiality.finally,madori challenges his the ground that his term of supervised release exceeded the statutory maximum.we affirm madori conviction,but remand for correction of this sentencing error.
background 
the evidence at trial established that in a businessman named norman meisenberg was experiencing serious financial difficulties and was unable to raise money through legitimate sources.he therefore decided to turn to loansharks and asked an acquaintance,jeffrey troncone,for assistance.troncone,who had used madori and chiapetta in the past,agreed to arrange an introduction but warned meisenberg that they are really not nice people,if you understand what i mean,they are the last people you would want to go borrow any money from,they are just not what you want to do.he also told meisenberg to be very careful because these were very bad people,very connected people.
subsequently,troncone introduced meisenberg to chiapetta,who agreed to arrange a loan.chiapetta explained the terms meisenberg would have to pay three points,in interest each week and none of the interest payments would reduce the outstanding principal,which would have to be repaid in a lump sum.chiapetta concluded the meeting by telling meisenberg that chiapetta had to speak to someone and would have to get back to meisenberg.at a second meeting,chiapetta gave meisenberg in cash and told meisenberg that if he did not make his weekly interest payments,he would have a big problem.
a few weeks after he received the,meisenberg requested an additional.this time chiapetta took meisenberg to meet madori in the back office of the diamond club,a topless bar in port chester,new york.madori asked meisenberg did you get your package when meisenberg said that he had not,madori told him charlie has it.madori then told meisenberg to do the right thing and dismissed him.chiapetta later gave meisenberg the additional.this loan raised the weekly interest payments to.
for over a year,meisenberg made timely payments,sometimes delivering the money to chiapetta,to madori,or to both.eventually meisenberg fell behind and sought to renegotiate the loan to have interest payments counted against the outstanding principal.these efforts failed and after meisenberg had paid madori and chiapetta over in interest,he still owed the principal.meisenberg then turned to the fbi.he agreed with the fbi to record future conversations with madori and chiapetta.fbi agents also observed and photographed meetings with madori,chiapetta and meisenberg.
at a july,meeting with chiapetta,meisenberg tendered a partial payment.he was four weeks behind on interest payments and chiapetta told meisenberg w hen i give this partial payment to somebody he not gon na like it one bit.meisenberg later testified that he understood the somebody to be madori.the following week meisenberg met with both madori and chiapetta about the loan.during the meeting,chiapetta deferred to madori when making a proposal about repayment,and chiapetta stated that what he proposed could be overruled by madori.chiapetta also warned meisenberg at the meeting that the alternative to payment was punishment.the fbi recorded and conducted surveillance of this meeting.
on september,meisenberg had his final meeting with madori and chiapetta.meisenberg had not made interest payments for several weeks.madori graphically expressed his frustration at this delay in words that would later be played to the jury,telling meisenberg you out of time,i hope you not just buying yourself two more weeks,norman,and y ou in the fucking red zone now.you got my nuts real twisted by jerking us off for five weeks.because it becomes a issue now it becomes a principle issue and that when you go into the danger zone,when it becomes principle instead of money.not surprisingly,at trial meisenberg testified that he understood these statements to be threats.
evidence that was not made public until after the trial indicated that during this period,chiapetta was under investigation by the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york for unrelated federal tax crimes,and was providing information to the fbi.subsequently,he was indicted in the eastern district.around may,chiapetta informed the fbi that madori had requested that chiapetta put some money on the street and he requested permission of the fbi to do so.the fbi then inquired whether chiapetta would agree to testify concerning the loansharking activity.chiapetta refused.the fbi informed him that in order to receive authorization to engage in any loansharking activity,he would have to agree to testify and since he had refused,he had no authority to engage in any such activities.in direct contravention of these instructions,to the in loansharking activities with madori.on appeal,madori maintains that this information constitutes brady and giglio material that should have been disclosed to him earlier.
ii.proceedings below 
in march,madori and chiapetta were indicted on various loansharking and conspiracy charges in the southern district of new york.in november,chiapetta filed a sealed severance motion contending that he was a confidential informant at the time of the conduct charged in the indictment.significantly,chiapetta acknowledged that while he had been cooperating with the government on unrelated matters,he did not have authorization from the government to engage in loansharking activities with madori.he contended that his relationship with madori was solidified during his cooperation and that it would have been discovered if he had refused to participate in the loansharking.the district court denied the motion and chiapetta subsequently pled guilty.
in january,the government moved ex parte for a protective order excusing it from revealing information about chiapetta prior cooperation with the government.see fed.pro.d.the motion was submitted under seal because the district court had previously ordered that certain information regarding chiapetta cooperation with the government be sealed while acknowledging its obligation to produce to madori brady and giglio material,the government argued that certain information in its possession regarding chiapetta cooperation in the eastern district should not be disclosed to madori because it lacked impeachment value and because its disclosure would endanger chiapetta.the government stressed that the information was not impeachment material because chiapetta had received no benefit from the government for his loansharking activities and consequently had no incentive to shade any testimony he might give in the government favor.
in response to this application,the district court,after what it termed an unusual ex parte hearing,denied the ex parte motion for a protective order.the court concluded that,at that point in the proceedings,the limited record was insufficient to order the government to turn over the material,even on the assumption that the court had the power to do so,stating t he critical issue in connection with potentially after the fact.united states madori,no.cr.gel,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,internal quotation marks omitted united states madori.the court emphasized that it was undisputed that chiapetta cooperation with the government did not encompass his involvement in loansharking activities with madori,and that consequently this relationship lacked impeachment value.the court then urged the government to its case with a view to minimizing evidence or arguments that would make chiapetta credibility a significant issue in the case.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the government proceeded to trial against madori in february.meisenberg testified about his dealings with madori and chiapetta.the jury also heard testimony by troncone about his own loans as well as his role in assisting meisenberg in obtaining loans from madori and chiapetta.meisenberg testified that troncone told him that madori and chiapetta were very bad people,very connected people.meisenberg was then permitted to testify that he understood connected to mean that they would be connected to the mafia,organized crime this testimony was accompanied by an appropriate limiting instruction.
vital to the government proof at trial were recordings it played for the jury of meisenberg conversations with madori and chiapetta concerning the loans and the possible consequences of meisenberg failure to repay them.the trial went on for four days,and on the fifth day the jury found madori guilty on all counts.in august,the court sentenced him principally to months incarceration and five years of supervised release.
chiapetta was sentenced after madori.at sentencing,chiapetta sought a downward departure on the ground that he had been importuned by madori and that he would not have been exposed to prosecution on the loansharking charge but for his cooperation with the fbi.chiapetta argued that when madori approached him about loansharking he reported the approach to the fbi and sought to cooperate,but could not reach an agreement with the government.
the court denied the request for this downward departure.the court noted that chiapetta threatened meisenberg,acted both as a loanshark and as a collector,and had not done so under duress.the court concluded that chiapetta was not entitled to a downward departure based on cooperation with the government 
r ather than providing assistance in investigating this crime by agreeing to cooperate and testify,chiapetta involved himself in the crime without either operating at the fbi agent direction or providing the fbi with any details of the offense that would have allowed law enforcement to frustrate the crime.instead,it undisputed that the agents never would have learned of this specific crime or of any particular loan activities by madori that were concrete and prosecutable if meisenberg had not reported his victimization.united states madori,at,dist.lexis,at.the court sentenced chiapetta principally to months in prison.
iii.motion for a new trial 
following his conviction,madori moved for a new trial,contending that the government evidence that he had participated in extortionate credit transactions was insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy to extortionately extend and extortionate extension of credit.by this time,chiapetta sentencing proceedings,detailing his cooperation with the fbi,had become public and madori argued that the information relating to chiapetta cooperation was brady and giglio material,the concealment of which had denied him a fair trial.see.specifically,madori argued that,had the information been disclosed,he would have pursued an alternate trial strategy that focused on the relationship between chiapetta and the government.for example,madori said that he would have attempted to show that chiapetta was an unreliable witness because his involvement with the government gave him an incentive to minimize his own involvement with the loans and to make madori appear to be the dominant player in the loansharking enterprise.in addition,madori contended that he could have argued to the jury that chiapetta somehow entrapped him.the government responded in a submission setting out what had transpired between it and chiapetta in the eastern district and explaining why,in its view,the documents concerning that relationship were not required to be disclosed.
the district court denied the motion for a new trial principally on the ground that the evidence at trial proved overwhelmingly that madori participated in the making and collection of an extortionate loan to meisenberg.united states madori,at,dist.lexis,at.the court pointed to the thinly veiled and recorded threats made by madori to meisenberg,and concluded that a reasonable jury could easily have found implicit threats in madori repeated questioning,id.at,dist.lexis,at,and in other comments made by madori.the court found that the information about chiapetta relationship with the government was not brady information because it was not material to madori conviction.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court further rejected madori assertion that,had he been aware of chiapetta prior cooperation,madori could have argued that chiapetta intentionally minimized his own criminality and highlighted madori when he was dealing with meisenberg.the court held that the record utterly refuted such a suggestion.the court similarly rejected madori contention that disclosure of the information would have enabled him to mount an entrapment defense,noting that there is nothing whatever in this record that provides any likelihood at all that an entrapment defense would succeed.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court rejected madori argument that no valid reputation was offered.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
madori attacks his conviction on the ground that the government did not adduce evidence sufficient to prove that he was party to an understanding that force would be used to collect the loans.additionally,madori argues that the district court erred in denying him a new trial after the information about chiapetta participation with the government was revealed.finally,he argues that there was a sentencing error,and his term of supervisory release should be reduced.we reject madori first two challenges,but remand to allow the district court to correct the sentencing error.
sufficiency of the evidence 
madori contends that the government presented insufficient evidence that he shared with meisenberg an understanding that force would be used to collect the loans in the event of.we review de novo a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence and affirm if the evidence,when viewed in its totality and in the light most favorable to the government,would permit any rational jury to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states geibel,cir.a defendant challenging a conviction based on a claim of insufficiency of the evidence thus bears a heavy burden.applying this standard,we see no basis for overturning madori conviction.
the government can prove that a loan is extortionate by proving that the loan is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time the extension of credit is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person,reputation,or property of any person.recognizing that it is frequently difficult directly to prove the understanding of the creditor,congress provided in b that the government has presented prima facie evidence that a loan is extortionate if it is shown that all the following factors were present in connection with the extension of credit in question those factors are the loan was unenforceable through civil judicial process,the extension of credit was made at an annual rate of interest in excess of percent per year,that at the time,the debtor reasonably believed that the creditor had used extortionate means in the past or had a reputation for the use of extortionate means and that the amount was greater than.b.section b creates a permissive inference or presumption,namely,one which does not trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which places no burden of any kind on the defendant.united states curcio,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
because the government must establish that the debtor understood at the inception of the loan that a threat of violence existed,see united states allen,cir,adequate proof of the debtor state of mind at the time of the loan is relevant and indeed essential.proving that both parties knew at the time that the loan was extortionate requires the government
