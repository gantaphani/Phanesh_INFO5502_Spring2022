kenneth eirby appeals from an order revoking his supervised release term and imposing an additional months of immurement.he contends that the district court erred in i failing to recognize that the sixth amendment,as interpreted in a line of recent supreme court decisions,applies to revocation proceedings and the consequent imposition of additional prison time ii mischaracterizing his underlying offense of conviction and iii misclassifying the conduct that comprised his supervised release violation.concluding,as a matter of first impression,that a conviction under the maine statute violated by the appellant,is a crime of violence and finding the appellant other claims of error equally unpersuasive,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
we assume the reader familiarity with our earlier opinion upholding the appellant original conviction and sentence on direct review.see united states eirby eirby i,cir.consequently,we rehearse here only those facts directly pertinent to this appeal.
in,the authorities caught the appellant as he tried to peddle drugs.a federal grand jury returned an indictment and,in due course,the appellant pleaded guilty to count of that indictment.that count,the text of which is reproduced in an appendix to our opinion in eirby i,id.at,charged the appellant with conspiring to distribute cocaine base crack cocaine in violation of a.
following the district court acceptance of the guilty plea,a dispute arose regarding the applicable sentencing provision.to understand that dispute,it is important to recall that b sets out a sentencing regime for violations of section a.the least onerous of these tiers,set out in section b c,prescribes the penalties that apply when only relatively small amounts of drugs are implicated or when no drug quantity is specified.that tier is not in issue here,and we make no further reference to it.
the remaining two tiers,set out in sections b a and b b,respectively,prescribe differing penalties depending upon drug type and quantity.on the one hand,section b a provides a sentencing span ranging from ten years to life imprisonment for covered offenses involving fifty or more grams of cocaine base.on the other hand,section b b establishes a sentencing span ranging from five to forty years for covered offenses involving five or more grams of cocaine base but less than fifty grams.
in the instant case,both the indictment and the written plea agreement referenced section b b.nevertheless,the district court realized,after reviewing the presentence investigation report psi report,that the quantity of drugs involved implicated section b a.recognizing that the indictment mentioned section b b,but not section b a,the court invited the appellant to withdraw his plea.after a period of contemplation,the appellant declined the invitation.
at the disposition hearing,the on the psi report and a the appellant responsible for one hundred grams of cocaine base the court then concluded,over objection,that this drug quantity placed the appellant under the aegis of section b a for sentencing purposes.after placing the appellant in criminal history category ii and granting a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,ussg,the court fixed the guideline sentencing range at months.it then acknowledged the applicability of a mandatory minimum sentence,b a departed downward for substantial assistance,ussg and imposed a month incarcerative sentence,to be followed by five years of supervised release.the court subjected the latter term to the standard supervised release conditions,including a prohibition against the commission of future crimes.see d.
on direct review,the appellant argued that the district court decision to sentence him under section b a,rather than section b b,usurped the grand jury institutional prerogatives.we rejected that argument,emphasizing that the indictment reference to section b b was intended to place the appellant on notice of the range of possible penalties and that the appellant had suffered no prejudice because the district court had afforded him an opportunity to withdraw his plea.eirby i,at.
at the same time,we rejected the appellant claim of apprendi error.see apprendi new jersey,d.we observed that while apprendi established that a finding of drug quantity which increases a defendant sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,eirby i,at,the sentence appealed from was well below section b b maximum.id.at.in that connection,we made short shrift of the appellant claim that the application of section b a subjected him to a higher potential sentence,noting that the apprendi doctrine is concerned with actual sentences as opposed to potential sentences.id.at emphasis in original.
having lost his appeal,the appellant proceeded to serve his sentence.we to december of point some seven months after his release from prison and the commencement of his term of supervised release.at that time,maine state authorities charged that he,then years of age,had unlawfully engaged in sex acts with a girl.a state grand jury followed up with a indictment.pertinently,count of that indictment charged the appellant with sexual abuse of a minor in violation of.
in due season,the appellant pleaded guilty to three of the state counts including count.the state court sentenced him to four years in prison.shortly thereafter,a federal probation officer petitioned the district court to revoke the appellant supervised release.
at the revocation hearing,the district court rejected the appellant demand for a jury trial.the court then found a violation of the criminal activity prohibition and revoked the appellant supervised release term.see ussg a.concluding that the underlying conspiracy conviction was for a class a felony,a,and that the state conviction constituted a grade a violation of supervised release because it was a crime of violence,ussg a,a a i,the court sentenced the appellant to an additional incarcerative term of months,consecutive to his state sentence.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
before us,the appellant advances three assignments of error.these embody the district court refusal to recognize the applicability of the sixth amendment in the revocation proceedings,its characterization of his underlying conspiracy conviction as a class a felony,and its classification of his state conviction as a grade a violation of supervised release.we address these contentions sequentially.
a.the sixth amendment.
the appellant first claim of error is premised on the notion that the district court violated his sixth amendment rights when it denied him a trial by jury with respect to the revocation proceeding.as we explain below,this claim is jejune.
it is settled law that once a court imposes a fixed sentence in a criminal case,subsequent proceedings in regard to that sentence are not subject to the full panoply of sixth amendment protections.see johnson united states,d supervised release morrissey brewer,d parole.mindful of these decisions,we held squarely in united states work,cir,that the sixth amendment right to trial by jury does not extend to supervised release revocation proceedings.see id.at.that ends the matter in a circuit,a newly constituted panel ordinarily is bound by prior panel decisions directly or closely on point.see,dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir united states guzm√°n,cir.
the appellant attempts to confess and avoid.even though he acknowledges that work is materially indistinguishable from the case at hand,he points out that there is a narrow exception to the law of the circuit rule in the event of supervening authority from,say,a higher court.see united states chhien,cir framing exception in terms of a controlling intervening event.based on this exception,he exhorts us to reconsider work in light of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d.that exhortation has little to commend it.
first and foremost,the appellant time line is muddled.booker does not work indeed,the work court explicitly rejected a claim that the district court had committed booker error in imposing sentence.see work,at.
at any rate,booker in no way undermines work legal foundation.booker did not presume to overturn the limited applicability of sixth amendment protections in proceedings.cases to that effect,of which johnson,at,and morrissey,at,are exemplars,remain good law.
to be sure,the appellant takes a contrary view.he insists that booker signaled a shift in the tectonic plates of federal sentencing jurisprudence,requiring that all factual findings that impact any aspect of a criminal defendant sentence must be made by a jury.that argument is neither original nor convincing,and we previously have rejected such an expansive interpretation of booker.see,united states lizardo,cir united states antonakopoulos,cir.we reaffirm those holdings today.
the short of it is that booker constrains judicial factfinding only in a mandatory guideline sentencing regime.see antonakopoulos,at.the guidelines governing the revocation of supervised release,ussg,have always been advisory.see united states,cir see also work,at.thus,no conceivable booker error transpired here.
class a felony.
the appellant next assignment of error challenges the sentencing court characterization of his underlying conspiracy conviction as a conviction for a class a felony.we review this quintessentially legal determination de novo.see united states robinson,cir.
we begin with a sketch of the pertinent legal landscape.the governing statute authorizes reincarceration for violations of supervised release conditions.see e.the statutory scheme also establishes ceilings on the lengths of new imprisonment terms.see id.these ceilings depend in part on the seriousness of the underlying offense of conviction.see united states,cir.the sentencing guidelines contain a similar calibration.see ussg.
the gravity of an underlying offense,for both statutory and guideline purposes,is measured through the lens of a,which establishes a classification regime.under this taxonomy,offenses carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment are categorized as class a felonies.id.a.those carrying maximum terms of years or more but less than life imprisonment are categorized as class b felonies id.a.supervised release violators who stand convicted of class a felonies can receive additional sentences of up to five years.id.e.those who stand convicted of class b felonies are subject to additional sentences of up to three years.id.
the district court determined that the appellant had committed a class a felony because he had been sentenced under b a,which provides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.in endeavoring to impeach this determination,the appellant resurrects a claim advanced in his earlier appeal that he was entitled to be sentenced under section b b,not section b a.building on that foundation,he argues that since a life sentence was never authorized under the appropriate penalty provision,he should have been treated as having committed a class b felony 
the appellant attempt to pin his hopes on section b b failed in his earlier appeal,and his arguments are no more robust the second time around.in eirby i,we rejected this claim and affirmed the underlying conviction and sentence under section b a.see eirby i,at.the appellant can not employ his present appeal as a vehicle for mounting a collateral attack on that holding.see,united states,cir united states moran,cir.
in all events,the appellant effort to countermand our earlier opinion rests on an insupportable premise the misguided notion that eirby i held that the appellant could not have been sentenced above the ceiling imposed by section b b.we made no such holding in eirby the appellant argument to the contrary entails a gross misreading of that decision.
there,we emphasized that an apprendi error can not occur unless the sentence actually imposed is greater than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.see eirby i,at.since the sentence actually imposed by the district court fell below the maximum authorized by either section b a or section b b,no apprendi error occurred.id.at.we expressed no opinion about the constitutionality vel non of imposing a sentence above section b b ceiling.
moreover,our decision never even section b b was the correct sentencing provision.the opposite is true we repeatedly characterized the indictment reference to section b b as mistaken.id.at.
although it may be frosting on the cake,we add that there could have been no apprendi error in the original sentence.the record makes manifest that the sentence actually imposed was anchored in the appellant own admission before being sentenced on the conspiracy charge,he stipulated that he was responsible for between fifty and one hundred fifty grams of cocaine base.thus,the factual finding that the appellant was responsible for a quantity of cocaine base sufficient to trigger section b a was within the contemplation of the facts to which the appellant admitted.factfinding premised on a defendant admissions is not a practice invalidated by apprendi see united states buonocore,cir united states shelton,cir see also booker,at.
crime of violence.
the appellant last assignment of error concerns the classification of his sex crime count of the state court indictment as a crime of violence and,thus,a grade a violation of his supervised release.in order to gain perspective,we repair to the applicable sentencing guidelines.
beyond the class of the original offense of conviction,the lawful ambit of a supervised release revocation sentence depends on the grade of the crime comprising the supervised release violation.see ussg.pertinently,a grade a violation includes a federal,state,or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that is a crime of violence.id.a a i.the guidelines define a crime of violence in part as an offense embodying conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.id.a.
we review classification disputes,like this one,de novo.see united states richards,cir.in doing so,we employ a categorical approach to determine whether a given offense constitutes a crime of violence.see taylor united states,d united states sherwood,cir 
the categorical approach entails a pavane.first,an inquiring court must examine the text of the statute of conviction to ascertain whether a violation of that statute necessarily involves every element of a violent crime.see taylor,at.sherwood,at.if the answer is unambiguously yes or no,the inquiry ends.if,however,the statute language is broad enough to encompass both acts that constitute violent crimes and acts that do not,the court must take a second step and determine whether the record of conviction reveals all the elements of a violent crime.see shepard united states,d taylor,at.
against this backdrop,we turn to count of the state court indictment.in connection with that count,the appellant pleaded guilty to violating a statute that makes it a crime for a person to engage in a sexual act with another person,not the actor spouse,who is either or years of age and the actor is at least years older than the other person.maine law defines a sexual act in relevant part as any act between persons involving direct physical contact between the genitals of one and the mouth or anus of the other,or direct physical contact between the genitals of one and the genitals of the other.id.c.
in our view,the conduct criminalized by section categorically poses a serious risk of physical injury.several factors lead us to this conclusion.
for one thing,there is a significant risk that force will be used to perpetrate the crime.after all,crimes typically occur in close quarters,and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller,weaker,and less experienced,but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.sherwood,at citing united states,cir.
for another thing,precedent militates strongly in favor of this outcome.we consistently have held comparable offenses to pose a serious risk of physical injury.for example,in sherwood we answered affirmatively the question of whether a statute that criminalized sexual contact with a person under the age of thirteen constituted a crime
