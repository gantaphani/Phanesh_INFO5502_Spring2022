defendant appellant desmond kerr is a canadian citizen who was arrested by united states customs authorities after they searched his vehicle at the border and discovered thousands of pills containing,methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma,a schedule i controlled substance.kerr was charged with one count of knowingly and intentionally possessing mdma with intent to distribute,in violation of a and b c.a turbulent pretrial period ensued,during which kerr ceased communicating with and then effectively fired his first two appointed attorneys,insisted on pressing several theories of defense to the exclusion of all others,and underwent a competency examination that ultimately found him competent to stand trial.kerr elected to represent himself at trial but,with the assistance of a newly appointed attorney,pled guilty midway through.after entering his plea,kerr resumed his prior behavior he again refused to communicate with counsel and filed numerous pro se motions in which he sought to withdraw his plea,press his theories of defense,and obtain the assistance of new counsel.at sentencing,kerr attorney expressed concern about kerr mental stability and represented that kerr had been unable to help him prepare for sentencing the district court also commented on kerr belligerent and counterproductive behavior.ultimately,the district court sentenced him principally to months imprisonment,rejecting his several sentencing arguments.
through new counsel,kerr argues on appeal that his erratic and irrational behavior following the entry of his plea required the district court to hold a competency hearing before imposing sentence and that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to counsel by the denial of his multiple requests for an attorney to help him withdraw his plea.he also challenges several aspects of the sentence imposed.in a separate pro se brief,kerr contends that the district court erroneously denied his pro se motion to withdraw his plea and challenges several aspects of his prosecution and trial.we affirm.
background 
in february,customs and border protection officers searched kerr vehicle as he attempted to enter the united states from canada at the alexandria bay,new york port of entry.in the course of the search,the officers discovered approximately seven thousand pills containing mdma.the officers found the pills in two locations four thousand were concealed in black packages between the vehicle front seats,while the remaining three thousand were stowed within the vehicle rear interior paneling.together,the seven thousand pills weighed grams.kerr was arrested and charged with one count of possession with attempt to distribute mdma.
pretrial proceedings 
between his february arraignment and his april trial,kerr cycled through a succession of attorneys and inundated the district court with numerous pro se requests for its assistance with his several theories of defense.first,in september,kerr moved to replace the federal public defender initially assigned to his case.the district court granted the motion and,after kerr expressed dissatisfaction with a second attorney,appointed jeffery deroberts as new counsel.several weeks later,deroberts informed the court that kerr was unhappy with his representation and had requested that the court appoint a different attorney known to kerr.the district court denied this request,explaining that kerr was not entitled to choose assigned counsel.at a subsequent conference and suppression hearing held in october,kerr alleged that the government had improperly destroyed a number of the recovered mdma pills,that the assigned assistant united states attorney ausa had committed perjury,and that his various attorneys had refused to file motions addressing these issues when kerr continued to interject and press these pro se arguments,the district court halted the proceedings to inquire whether he understood the charge against him,the potential penalties he faced,and the importance of his attorney.kerr confirmed that he was charged with possession with intent to distribute,stated that he understood the penalties,and acknowledged that his lawyer had knowledge of the law and court procedure he did not possess.
on december,some five days before the scheduled trial date,the district court held a final pretrial conference during which kerr represented that deroberts was ineffective and in dereliction of duty.kerr repeatedly stated that he did not want deroberts to speak on his behalf or appear at trial,and that he wished to represent himself.the court acknowledged kerr right to and stated that deroberts would be available at trial as standby counsel.kerr objected to this proposal,informing the court that he wanted to call deroberts as a defense witness to testify about the government perjury as to the existence of certain surveillance videotapes of the border crossing.kerr also requested that the court subpoena several other witnesses,including the judge of the northern district of new york and the united states attorney for the northern district of new york.kerr refused to explain his reasons for subpoenaing these last witnesses,stating only that the court would find out on the date of trial.
expressing concern with kerr wilder and wilder requests and decisions,the district court adjourned the trial and ordered him,pursuant to a,to undergo a mental competency examination.after examining kerr,psychologists at the federal medical center fmc found him competent to stand trial and presented those results in a forensic medical report dated march.the report described kerr as an obstinate,and opinionated individual whose dissatisfaction with his attorneys stemmed not from psychotic symptoms,but rather from his belief that his attorneys ha d not done sufficient work to mount an adequate defense.the report also explained that kerr defensive strategy of accusing the ausa of perjury,while possibly imprudent,was not evidence of incompetence.in sum,the report concluded that kerr was able to assist his attorney in preparing a defense if he so chose,and that there was no objective evidence that he suffered from a mental disorder which would impair his ability to understand the nature and consequences of the court proceedings against him.
the district court reconvened on march.on that date,kerr did not permit deroberts to sit with him at counsel table.he adamantly expressed his desire to represent himself with the assistance only of standby counsel,insisting that the results of the competency evaluation proved his ability to do so.the court granted deroberts resulting motion to withdraw on the ground that there had been a complete breakdown in communication.in his stead,the court appointed robert wells as standby counsel and directed kerr to consult with him.at the close of the conference,the court scheduled trial to begin on april,and explained to kerr that it would ask him a series of questions at the beginning of trial to ensure he fully understood the implications of.
ii.trial and guilty plea 
on the scheduled trial date,kerr appeared with wells as standby counsel.before jury selection,the district court stated that it had previously advised kerr of the disadvantages of representing himself and inquired of kerr whether that remained his intention.kerr confirmed that it was.the court cautioned him that was very difficult and that,despite his pro se status and lack of legal training,he was required to follow the court instructions and comply with the rules of evidence and procedure.when kerr renewed his request to subpoena three witnesses his former attorney,the former interim united states attorney,and the chief judge of the northern district the court stated that it would issue the subpoenas only if kerr explained how their testimony was relevant to the pending criminal charge.kerr demurred,claiming that he should not be required to disclose his theory of defense.again,the court flagged kerr lack of legal training,explaining,inter alia,that any testimony of these witnesses would certainly be hearsay and the fact that his former attorney represented kerr in the matter did not make the attorney a witness with any relevant testimony to offer in this case.the court later urged kerr to consult with wells concerning issues of jury selection.
on april,the case proceeded to trial at which kerr selected a jury in consultation with wells gave an opening statement premised on his theories that the ausa committed perjury,the government destroyed evidence,and he was prevented from calling his chosen witnesses extensively government witnesses and made relevant objections.upon the close of the government evidence on april,however,kerr informed the court that he intended to plead guilty to the charge.the following exchange took place 
the court now,have you agreed to allow wells to represent you in this matter,for this 
the defendant yes,your honor.
the court in this capacity because there are questions that i going to need to ask him and he needs to advise you and hopefully he talked to you about the sentencing guidelines 
the defendant yes.
appellant app x at.following this colloquy,the district court informed kerr that it was going to at this point accept the fact that wells is your attorney.
the court conducted a change of plea hearing that same day kerr testified that he was not under the care of a doctor or psychiatrist and that his ability to understand the proceeding was not impaired.attorney wells also stated that he was satisfied that kerr plea was given freely and voluntarily.based upon these representations and kerr other responses during its rule inquiry,the court determined that he was competent and capable of entering an informed plea.as to the factual basis for the plea,the government explained that its proof at trial had shown that the customs and border protection officers discovered pills containing mdma in two locations of kerr vehicle and that,in total,the recovered pills weighed grams.kerr confirmed this assessment of the evidence,further explaining that he had entered into an agreement with an unidentified individual whereby the individual would place something in his parked vehicle and then,in exchange for,kerr would drive the vehicle from canada to new york.after accepting the plea,the district court told kerr that the probation department would interview him in connection with his presentence report and that wells can be there with you if you like,that up to you and him.
iii.post plea proceedings sentencing 
several days after pleading guilty,kerr filed a pro se motion to withdraw his pleathe first in a succession of pro se motions he filed in the,phase of the case.kerr asserted in the motion that he wanted to take back his plea to permit the the jury to find him guilty or not guilty.the district court denied his request on april,concluding that kerr plea allocution satisfied the requirements of federal rule of criminal procedure b,he had not shown a fair and just reason for withdrawing the plea,and he had not accounted for the prejudice that would inure to the government and the court if his request were granted.
on may,kerr requested the appointment of counsel to assist him with,inter alia,a motion to withdraw his guilty plea the following day,he again moved to withdraw his plea,asserting,without providing specifics,that the ausa and government witnesses had perjured themselves,he had received ineffective assistance of counsel,there were valid grounds for withdrawing his guilty plea,and he had a claim of innocence.kerr reiterated his request for new counsel in a june letter and in a july pro se motion to dismiss the charges due to the government alleged perjury and destruction of evidence.in his june letter,kerr claimed,for the first time,that standby counsel provided ineffective assistance by instructing him to plea d guilty.the court denied all pending motions by order entered on july,ruling that both kerr request for new counsel and his renewed motion to withdraw his plea were unsupported by a showing of cause,and noting that in april it had denied kerr first motion to withdraw his guilty plea 
while these events unfolded,the probation department submitted a presentence report in which it held kerr accountable for the entire quantity of mdma pills found in the vehicle.based on a total offense level of and kerr criminal history category of i,the probation department calculated kerr advisory sentencing range under the united states sentencing guidelines as to months imprisonment.it also noted that kerr had refused to meet with the probation officer tasked with preparing the report.in a pro se letter sent shortly before sentencing,kerr explained that although he had wanted to meet with the probation officer,he did not wish to do so with wells present because wells had lied to him during trial.
for his part,wells explained in a sentencing memorandum submitted on kerr behalf that kerr had refused to meet with him to prepare for sentencing he also expressed his concern with kerr mental stability.wells took issue with the fmc psychologists competency determination,representing that although he had no training in mental health diagnosis,kerr actions over the course of the prosecution were not that of a rational and undisturbed mind and he had been unable to help wells prepare for sentencing.wells further advised the court that he could not ethically help kerr with the motion to withdraw the plea because his affirmation at the change of plea hearing that kerr pled guilty voluntarily created a classic and irremediable conflict with respect to that motion.he therefore urged the court to appoint new counsel for purposes of that motion.finally,wells argued that kerr should be held accountable only for the four thousand mdma pills found between the front seats of his vehicle because there was no evidence he knew about the pills hidden within the rear interior paneling.
the court imposed sentence on august.although wells appeared at the hearing,he informed the court that kerr had instructed him not to speak.in his statement to the court,kerr again expounded at length upon his theories that the government improperly destroyed a number of the mdma pills,the ausa committed perjury,and the court improperly deprived him of the opportunity to call his chosen witnesses at trial.the court interjected,stating that kerr was hung up on insignificant details irrelevant to sentencing.it went on i can not figure you out,sir,which is why i had a mental exam done.they tell me you competent and capable but you are the most belligerent individual i have ever met in my life,and i ca figure out why.the court further asserted that kerr refusal to accept the advice of an attorney had made his situation so much worse.after obtaining kerr permission to speak,wells again expressed his concerns about kerr mental state and reiterated his disagreement with the fmc psychologists competency determination.he also argued that the court should recognize kerr minor role as a courier or drug mule.
after hearing from the government,the court adopted the facts contained in the presentence report and found,consistent with the calculations of the probation department,that kerr guidelines range of imprisonment was to months.the court sentenced kerr to months imprisonment,explaining that it found the sentence fair,just,and sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the goals of sentencing set forth in a.the court emphasized that,had kerr been more cooperative with counsel and the probation department,it may have been presented with a fuller record justifying the imposition of a lesser sentence,especially given his lack of criminal history.once again,the court remarked that it could not understand kerr intransigent behavior.kerr timely appealed the court august,judgment.approximately one week later,he submitted a letter reiterating that wells was standby counsel only and did not speak on his behalf.
discussion 
kerr competency 
due process prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.united states quintieri,cir quoting medina california.a defendant is not competent,and the criminal proceeding against him may not progress,when his mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,to consult with counsel,and to assist in preparing his defense.drope missouri.this constitutional right is safeguarded by,which requires the district court,upon its own motion if necessary,to hold a competency hearing if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.a see also united states zhou,cir noting that the standards under due process and are essentially equivalent citing nicks united states,cir.
the existence of reasonable cause is a highly particularized assessment that varies in each case.zhou,at quoting united states nichols,cir.we have identified several factors upon which the district court may rely when making the reasonable cause determination,including psychiatric reports assessing the defendant competence,see zhou,at,and the court own observations of the defendant demeanor during the proceeding,quintieri,at.see also drope,at explaining that there are no fixed or immutable signs which invariably indicate the need for further inquiry to determine the defendant fitness to proceed.the right not to be prosecuted while incompetent spans the duration of a criminal proceeding.united states arenburg,cir.a district court must therefore always be alert to circumstances suggesting a change that would render the accused unable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial,id.at quoting drope,at emphasis in original,an obligation that takes on increased significance where,as here,a criminal defendant elects to proceed pro se,id.at.we review a district court decision not to order a competency hearing for abuse of discretion.id.
here,the district court acted well within its discretion when it declined to order a competency hearing before accepting kerr april,guilty plea.although the court was obviously troubled by kerr pretrial behavior,it was entitled to rely on the march,forensic report that found him competent to understand the proceedings and capable of working with his attorney if he so chose.zhou,at.in addition,the district court had the benefit of observing kerr during the march pretrial conference and the april trial.the transcripts of those proceedings show that although he was unfamiliar with the law and court procedure,kerr vocally advocated on his own behalf,made relevant objections during the government direct examination of witnesses,and consulted with standby counsel when necessary.during the hearing,kerr also responded cogently to the district court inquiries and displayed his understanding of the charge.in short,we discern no unusual circumstances that should have given the district court pause before accepting kerr plea.see quintieri,at see also wojtowicz united states,cir where a defendant has been found competent following a evaluation,a district court generally is not required to hold a competency hearing before accepting a plea saddler united states,cir district court under no obligation to question a defendant competency when his answers to the court rule inquiries,his demeanor and his testimony all appeared to be rational and coherent 
having concluded that the district court was not required to hold a competency hearing before kerr april plea,we must now assess whether the record reflects any circumstances suggesting a change that would render kerr unable to meet the standards of competence by the time of his august sentencing.arenburg,at internal quotation marks omitted.in his counseled brief,kerr contends there were two such circumstances his erratic and irrational behavior,and wells representations that the fmc psychologists missed something and that kerr was unable to help him prepare for sentencing.
we first hold that,upon consideration of the whole record,kerr behavior was not so erratic that it should have given the district court reason to doubt his competency.indeed,the record reflects that kerr obstinate,belligerent,and obsessive behavior remained a constant throughout the entire proceedings.the district court ordered the pretrial competency evaluation after it became increasingly disturbed by kerr obsession with his pro se theories of defense to the exclusion of other issues,his refusal to cooperate or communicate with his attorneys,and his insistence on subpoenaing irrelevant witnesses.this is precisely the same behavior kerr flags as erratic in the phase of the case,when he cut off communication with wells and repeatedly attempted to press his theories of defense despite having pled guilty.although the obligation to be vigilant for reasonable cause to question the defendant competency does not disappear upon a pretrial finding that the defendant is competent to stand trial,arenburg,at internal quotation marks omitted,under the circumstances of this case we will not fault the district court which observed kerr over the entirety of the proceedings below for not twice questioning the same behavior.kerr situation is therefore distinguishable from those cases in which we have found it necessary for courts to revisit their initial reasonable cause determinations.see id.at district court erred by suggesting that a magistrate judge pretrial competency determination was dispositive of the defendant competence at trial and was required to revisit the reasonable cause determination where,at trial,the assigned ausa questioned the defendant mental stability and the defendant,who had a history of mental illness,made numerous incoherent statements vojtowicz,at remanding to the district court for an evidentiary hearing where defendant,who was assessed as competent before the entry of his plea,submitted a affirmation stating that he had attempted to commit suicide on the morning of sentencing.
kerr obsession with his defensive theories,his distrust of his attorneys,and his belligerent attitude were also not so bizarre as to require the district court to question his competency for a second time.compare arenburg,at reasonable cause to reconsider defendant competency where he made repeated references to radio waves,microwave channels,and a conspiracy involving mgm studios and the government with the object of publicly broadcasting his thoughts,and united states auen,cir finding reasonable cause for a competency hearing and remanding for the district court to conduct such a hearing where defendant,inter alia,compared the agent investigating his case with a cat he had put down,complained that he had been the victim of psychopolitical terrorism by the internal revenue service,and threatened the government attorneys,with zhou,at no reasonable cause to question defendant competency where the district court had observed the defendant over a substantial period of time and the defendant was found competent in a medical report that described him as defensive,stubborn,and evasive regarding the details of his case.disputes between criminal defendants and their attorneys are not at all uncommon,see united states white,cir,and many defendants assert that their rights have been denied at every turn,demonstrate that they do not understand how the legal system handles witnesses,and forget or choose to ignore what judges said earlier,timberlake davis,cir.in sum,although kerr demonstrated that he can be rude,unreasonable,and myopic in his approach to this case,that is not the same as incompetence and is not the type of conduct that implies the kind of mental shortcomings required to oblige a district court to sua sponte order a competency examination.united states alden,cir.
against a different backdrop,we may well have greater cause for alarm when confronted with such statements by defense counsel as wells that his client was acting irrationally and could not assist with preparing a defense.united states kirsh,cir noting that defense counsel failure to indicate the defendant could not assist in her defense or understand proceedings was substantial evidence of competency.here,however,the district court had substantially longer experience with kerr over the course of the proceedings than did wells,who did not become standby counsel until immediately before trial.in addition,wells freely acknowledged that,in making these representations,he had no training in mental health diagnosis.appellant app x at.finally,it is apparent that wells declaration that kerr could not help him prepare for sentencing was based on kerr refusal to meet with him,which,as we have noted,was consistent with kerr pretrial behavior toward his former attorneys.given all of the above,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not revisiting the issue of kerr competency before imposing sentence.
ii.sixth amendment right to counsel during post plea proceedings 
as an initial matter,although kerr suggests that it appears he never entered a constitutionally sufficient waiver of his right to counsel because the district court neglected to engage in the appropriate waiver of counsel inquiry before allowing him to proceed pro se,he expressly forgoes a separate sixth amendment claim premised on this supposed deficiency.see appellant br.at.we therefore decline to address the propriety of the district court pretrial ruling permitting kerr to represent himself.see norton sam club,cir issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.see also united states greer,cir same 
with respect to the sixth amendment arguments he does raise,kerr first asserts in his counseled brief that it is unclear from the record whether,at the change of plea hearing,the district court appointed wells as counsel for the remainder of the proceedings,or only for the entry of the plea.appellant br.given this opacity,kerr advances two alternative arguments regarding right to counsel.first,he contends that if the district court elevated wells from standby counsel to full counsel only for purposes of the plea,then it deprived him of his right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceeding when it denied his request for counsel assistance with his motion to withdraw the plea.appellant br.at.alternatively,he argues that if the court upped wells to full counsel for the remainder of the proceeding,then it should have appointed new counsel to assist kerr with his motion to withdraw his plea because of wells actual conflict with respect to that motion.see id.at.
we note that the district court did not state explicitly that wells returned to standby status following the entry of the plea.despite any possible confusion,several reasons support our conclusion that the district court elevated wells to full counsel only for purposes of the plea,and that kerr thereafter resumed his.
although the district court told kerr at the plea hearing that it was going to at this point accept the fact that wells is your attorney,appellant app x at,it implied after accepting the plea that participation in an relationship was optional,informing kerr that the probation department would interview him and that wells can be there if you like,that up to you and him,id.at emphasis added.the district court observation that wells was entitled to opt out of accompanying kerr for such an interview,rather than having an obligation to attend,was a clear indication that the court viewed wells,subsequent to the entry of kerr guilty plea,as having completed his service as counsel and returned to the status of standby counsel.see,gonzalez united states,cir noting,among the ways in which gonzales attorney performance was deficient with regard to sentencing,that counsel did not accompany gonzalez when gonzalez was interviewed by the probation department.in addition,there is no indication that kerr waived his right to during the period because during that time he made numerous pro se filings,refused to allow wells to speak on his behalf at sentencing,and submitted a letter reiterating that wells was standby counsel.united states barnes,cir noting that even after the right to proceed pro se has been clearly and unequivocally asserted,the right may be waived through conduct indicating that one is vacillating on the issue or has abandoned one request altogether internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also made clear its view that kerr continued to represent himself by accepting and ruling on his numerous pro se submissions.tellingly,some of these filings requested the assignment of new counsel,which the court denied without stating or otherwise indicating that wells remained kerr attorney.finally,although wells submitted a sentencing memorandum and appeared with kerr at sentencing,it is routine,and certainly not unusual,for standby counsel to perform such essential tasks.see,united states schmidt,cir standby counsel not elevated to full counsel when he examined and witness,and gave the defense summation.we therefore conclude that kerr continued representing himself after the entry of his plea and address only the first of kerr alternative sixth amendment arguments that the district court deprived him of his right to counsel when it did not appoint an attorney to assist him with his second motion to withdraw his plea.
this inquiry is complicated by the fact that kerr request for counsel came after he waived his right to counsel before trial.while it is undisputed that the sixth amendment protects a criminal defendant right to the assistance of counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,marshall rodgers,quoting iowa.tovar,it is also well settled that a defendant has the right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so,marshall.at quoting faretta,at see also forbes united states,cir a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is a critical stage of a criminal proceeding see generally united states.davis,cir a defendant who wishes to withdraw his plea of guilty may waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se.to resolve the tension that can exist between these two principles when a defendant who elected to proceed pro se later demands an attorney,there is broad consensus that,once waived,the right to counsel is no longer unqualified.see united states thompson,cir united states leveto,cir united states proctor,st cir united states reddeck,cir united states taylor,cir united states west,cir united states solina,cir see also united states brasch,cir table unpublished decision.
although we have not definitively spoken on this precise issue,we have held that a defendant right to represent himself in the first place is not absolute.see barnes,at.among other qualifications placed on the exercise of that right,we have required that the request to proceed pro se be unambiguous and unequivocal so as to inhibit any deliberate plot to manipulate the court by alternatively requesting,then waiving counsel.id.at quoting williams bartlett,cir.in addition,the request may be denied if the district court finds it to be obstructionist or manipulative or abusive in some other way.id.internal quotation marks omitted.these concerns are equally applicable to a situation in which a defendant,having invoked his right to proceed pro se,later seeks the reappointment of counsel.accordingly,we hold,in agreement with our sister circuits that have considered the issue,that once a defendant voluntarily and intelligently waives his right to counsel and elects to proceed pro se,the decision whether to grant or deny his request for counsel is well within the discretion of the district court.leveto,at citing cases.
given the critical role that access to professional legal representation plays in our criminal justice system,a district court discretion to deny requests for counsel is necessarily circumscribed.thus,it is manifestly improper for a court to deny such a request on purely punitive grounds.see menefield borg,cir we are certainly unwilling to deny counsel because of some conception that the defendant initial decision to exercise his faretta right and represent himself at trial is a choice cast in stone.see also taylor,at defendant must ordinarily be allowed to change his mind about whether he will represent himself.in addition,a district court denial of such a request made after trial or before any meaningful trial proceedings have beg
