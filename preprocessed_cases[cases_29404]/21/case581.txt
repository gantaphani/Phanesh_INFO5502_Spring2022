appellant luis gonzález appeals the sentence he received after pleading guilty to conspiring to distribute a controlled substance.appellant roberto de de león appeals a sentence he received for the same charge.we have jurisdiction under a,and dismiss the appeals of both appellants,because each signed a valid and enforceable waiver of appeal in his respective plea agreement.
factual and procedural background 
from approximately february until their indictment on december,gonzález and de león participated in a conspiracy with ten others to distribute cocaine base crack in guayama,puerto rico.the two entered into plea agreements with the government and on september,gonzález pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least,but less than,grams of cocaine base in violation of a,b b,and.on the same date,de león pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least,but less than,grams of cocaine base in violation of a.
the terms of gonzález plea agreement provided for a total offense level of.the parties did not stipulate to any criminal history category,but presumed a category of iii,yielding a guideline range of months imprisonment.under a section titled sentencing agreement,the agreement stated,the parties agree to recommend a term of imprisonment of one hundred eight months or the lower end of the applicable guideline range,whichever is greater.
in calculating the applicable criminal history category,the presentence investigation report psi for gonzález noted that on july,gonzález had been sentenced by the superior court in puerto rico to three consecutive terms of imprisonment for drug arrests dating from november,august,and january.the commonwealth court had suspended the sentences and placed gonzález on probation.concluding that gonzález was therefore on probation for a prior sentence at the time he committed the instant offense,the psi added two points to gonzález criminal history score pursuant to d,resulting in a criminal history category of ii.
at his sentencing hearing,gonzález challenged the psi recommendation of a criminal history category of ii,arguing that because the two specific drug transactions named in the plea agreement occurred on march and april,they predated the state court imposition of probation on july,and thus two points should not have been added under d.the court denied the motion.
the court then noted that with a criminal history category of ii,and a total offense level of the guidelines recommended a range of to months.at that point,gonzález counsel stated that the plea agreement called for a sentence of months or the upper end of the applicable guideline.in fact,the sentencing agreement called for months or the lower end of the applicable guideline,whichever was months minimum.neither party noted or objected to the misstatement,and the district court sentenced gonzález to months.
as for de león,the terms of his plea agreement yielded a total offense level of.the parties agreed to neither a criminal history category nor a particular guideline sentence,agreeing only to argue for a sentence within the applicable guideline range.
the psi calculated a criminal history category of i,leading to a guideline range of to months.the district court sentenced de león to months imprisonment.
both plea agreements,for gonzález and for de león,contained a waiver of the right to appeal the judgment and sentence,providing,the defendant hereby agrees that if this honorable court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.
gonzález nonetheless appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court sentenced him on the basis of faulty memory and under an incorrect calculation of his criminal history category.de león also appeals,arguing that the district court impermissibly participated in plea bargain discussions.
ii.discussion 
we must first determine whether gonzález appellate waiver is valid and enforceable.concluding that it is,we decline to reach the merits of his appeal.
in united states teeter,cir,we established the standard for reviewing appellate waivers,and held that such waivers are binding and enforceable so long as the written plea agreement clearly delineates the scope of the waiver the district court specifically inquired at the plea hearing about the waiver,and the questioning of the defendant suffices to show that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and the denial of the right to appeal would not constitute a miscarriage of justice.id.at.we must also be satisfied that the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver.see united states,cir.
the first teeter factor is easily met.the language of the waiver,quoted above,has been upheld in nearly identical iterations,and gonzález effectively concedes this point.see united states castro,cir.
on the second teeter factor,gonzález argues that the district court failed to describe or discuss the waiver in any way.the record belies this assertion.the district court twice queried gonzález about the waiver at the hearing,and used clear language in doing so do you understand that by pleading guilty,you will be held accountable to the waiver of appeal clause that appears in your respective plea agreements.it also asked about the waiver again at the sentencing hearing,and used no misleading or contradictory language at any time.accordingly,the second teeter factor is satisfied.see united states,cir castro,at.
on the third teeter factor,gonzález claims that enforcing the waiver would amount to a miscarriage of justice,because the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category gonzález argues that two points should not have been added to his criminal history score pursuant to d for committing the instant offense while on probation for a prior sentence,because the federal conspiracy indictment encompassed all the transactions at issue in the july,commonwealth court proceeding.therefore,his thesis runs,the commonwealth court sentence was not a prior sentence under and the probation resulting from it may not be counted under d.
in reviewing gonzález argument,we note that the miscarriage of justice exception should be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.teeter,at.relevant factors include the clarity of the alleged error,its character and gravity,its impact on the defendant,any possible prejudice to the government,and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result,at citing teeter,at.
several of those factors militate against invoking the exception in this case.
first,gonzález failed to raise this issue before the district court,despite having ample opportunity to detail the reach and scope of the state conviction we are wary of invoking the exception when the defendant could have raised an argument below but did not.see united states,cir see also united states edelen,cir if the mere fact that a defendant has arguments he could potentially invoke on appeal were allowed to invalidate a waiver,then appellate waivers would become meaningless.
second,gonzález seeks to anchor his new claim to proceedings in commonwealth court that postdate the sentencing in this,a recent state court probation revocation hearing that concluded the commonwealth and federal charges were the same.however,maneuvers ordinarily can not be used as devices,and thus this court strongly disfavors granting relief on the basis of a record not before the district court.see united states mateo,cir.
third,it is not a different calculation of gonzález criminal history category would have affected the final sentence.because gonzález failed to raise this argument below,the plain error standard is incorporated into our assessment of the element.thus gonzález must show not merely that the error could have changed the outcome,but rather that the error must have done so.united states albanese,cir quoting united states sposito,cir applying plain error standard to alleged miscalculation of criminal history category.
in this case,the sentencing agreement called for a minimum of months of the final c
