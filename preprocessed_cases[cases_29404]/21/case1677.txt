we hold that the district court did not err in predicating jones career offender status on his two youthful offender adjudications.accordingly,we affirm the district court legal interpretation of and remand for consideration of whether to resentence pursuant to united states crosby,cir.
background 
this is a direct appeal of a district court sentencing determination prior to the supreme court decision in booker and this court decision in crosby.
on september,jones pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute less than five grams of crack in violation of section.subsequent to the plea,the government and jones agreed that the quantity of crack at issue was of one gram.at sentencing,operating under the guidelines regime,judge munson determined that jones,who was over eighteen at the time he committed the instant controlled substance offense,was a career offender pursuant to career offender guideline.relevant to this appeal,the career offender finding was based on judge munson determination that jones two prior youthful offender adjudications in a new york state court constituted felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.see a emphasis added.
the career offender determination did not affect jones criminal history category of vi but did have a significant effect on jones base offense level and guidelines range.without a career offender finding,jones base offense level would have been,see c.applying the base offense level of to jones criminal history category of vi,jones applicable guidelines range would have been to months imprisonment.because of the career offender finding,however,the district court applied a base offense level of.jones offense level increased from to because the career offender guideline required the district court to change jones base offense level in accordance with a table,see b,which sets a defendant base offense level at the maximum sentence associated with the offense level of conviction applying jones base was reduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility,b to his criminal history category of vi yielded a guidelines range of to months.see sentencing table,ch,pt.
jones moved for downward departure based on extreme childhood abuse.the government,acknowledging jones extremely abusive childhood,agreed that the district court should downwardly depart on this basis,and recommended a sentence of months imprisonment.during the sentencing hearing,judge munson stated that he was quite appalled by jones horrendous upbringing.granting jones motion for a downward departure,the district court ruled that extreme childhood abuse caused mental and emotional conditions that contributed to the commission of this offense.see,see also united states rivera,cir stating that downward departure for extreme childhood abuse is available in extraordinary circumstances.
although jones had agreed to withdraw his other downward departure motions,the district court sua sponte granted jones a downward departure under b.judge munson,noting that jones guidelines range would have been to months if he was not considered a career offender,determined that the criminal history category of vi the seriousness of jones criminal history and likelihood of recidivism.see b.based on these determinations,the district court granted a downward departure and sentenced jones principally to months imprisonment.
on appeal,jones argues that the district court improperly considered his two youthful offender adjudications as convictions when determining that he was a career offender under the guidelines and that booker and crosby require that his case be remanded for resentencing 
discussion 
implications of booker and crosby 
although judicial factfinding that jones had prior convictions and sentences imposed is not sixth amendment error,see booker.at the booker court clarified that a sentencing judge commits procedural error by mandatorily applying the guidelines.see crosby,at.in crosby,we ruled that,in a direct appeal involving a sentence,a remand for determination of whether to resentence is generally necessary in order to undertake the proper application of the plain error doctrine id.at.
at oral argument,jones counsel informed this panel that his client sought a remand pursuant to crosby.because we find no reason to deprive jones of a remand,we will remand for consideration of whether to resentence in light of crosby.the plain error test will be satisfied if the district court determines that a nontrivially different sentence would have been imposed.id.at.we do not express an opinion with respect to this determination.see id.at.regardless of judge munson determination on remand,however,he is required to consider the guidelines along with the factors set out in section a.id.at.accordingly,we write this opinion solely to assist the district court by declaring the proper legal interpretation of the career offender guideline.see united states fagans,cir i f the guideline calculation issue is not difficult,it might often be preferable to adjudicate the calculation issue promptly so that subsequent sentencing proceedings will occur in light of a correct calculation.see also united states rubenstein,cir.following booker and crosby,we continue to review a district court legal interpretations of the guidelines de novo.see rubenstein,at.
ii.new york youthful offender adjudications and the career offender guideline 
under new york law,a sixteen,seventeen,or eighteen youth,who meets certain conditions and is convicted as an adult,may be adjudicated a youthful offender,thereby vacating and replacing his conviction with a youthful offender finding.proc.law.a youthful offender adjudication comprises a youthful offender finding and the subsequent imposition of a youthful offender sentence.id.youthful offender status carries with it certain benefits,such as privacy protections.see id.united states driskell,cir describing benefits and stating that youthful offender statute addresses defendant potential for rehabilitation.when a youthful offender adjudication is based on an underlying felony conviction,the defendant is committed to the custody of new york department of correctional services along with adult felony offenders.see united states cuello,cir citing penal law,e.
here,the state court of conviction deemed jones two felony convictions youthful offender adjudications.jones received and served sentences of over one year in adult prison for each of these adjudications.the relevant inquiry for this court is whether or not these new york state youthful offender adjudications constitute prior felony convictions for the purposes of the career offender guideline.
a defendant will be considered a career offender under the guidelines if the following three prongs are satisfied 
the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
a.jones contends that the third prong of the analysis is not satisfied because his two prior youthful offender adjudications do not constitute prior felony convictions for purposes of the career offender guideline a prior felony conviction is defined as a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,comment.emphasis added.a
