we write today about the curious case of robert george,a.our story which we narrate in the light most favorable to the government,see united states acosta colón,cir starts in a massachusetts town,sometime in early.standing in line to buy coffee at a donuts,george bumped into ronald dardinski.the two went back a ways.george had represented dardinski in a couple of criminal proceedings.and dardinski had wanted george to represent him in another criminal matter too,a larceny scheme where he had sold some repossessed cars that were not his to sell,pocketing from buyers without giving them the autos.dardinski had told george everything about the repo scam but hired another lawyer instead and eventually did four years in prison after pleading guilty to charges.money has long been a sore spot between the men,with dardinski convinced that george had overcharged him in the other cases.indeed,as recorded on tapes from prison,dardinski had told his girlfriend that if george did not pay up,then when i get out,i going to go smash his head in.anyway,reunited at donuts,george asked dardinski,oh,what did you ever do with all that money little did george know about dardinski threat,apparently.i still have a bunch of it hidden,dardinski said.well,george shot back,i can get rid of it for you.as he was leaving,dardinski promised to call george once he figured out what was what.and he later would but not before telling dea special agent joseph tamuleviz about his with george and agreeing to become a paid informant against his erstwhile attorney dardinski,by the way,did not pull agent tamuleviz name out of a hat he called him because he had worked as an informant for him before.
spanning nearly two years,the ensuing investigation involved the usual investigative techniques,like conversations and police surveillance.to give the reader a glimpse of how george scheme played out,we thumbnail it this way,adding further facts later as we discuss specific issues.
during a meeting,george told dardinski that he had a mortgage broker who could clean the money or so a jury under the circumstances could easily conclude.i f this guy is alright,you can hold me responsible,dardinski taped george saying.dardinski said that he had to hide some coke money too.george announced at their next conclave held in george lexus that the broker had agreed to do the rest,an apparent allusion to the coke money.and he explained the plot particulars dardinski would give the broker,who would then cut him an check from east coast mortgage account and pocket the rest as a fee.
thanks to george,dardinski eventually hooked up with the broker,michael hansen.how many times do you think you need it hansen asked dardinski when they met in person,referring to his laundry services.probably ten,dardinski said.that a boy an excited hansen shouted.two times dardinski handed hansen.and two times hansen gave dardinski a check for made out to crane industries,a fake company set up by the dea.agents then contacted hansen,who agreed to cooperate with the government.george had told dardinski that he was not getting a cent on the deals.but that was a big lie,george told hansen.and hansen ended up paying george for helping to make the transactions happen.
while this laundering was going on,george also told dardinski that he would pay him a fee for client referrals.so dardinski introduced him to angel,a supposed friend of his who was really undercover officer pedro nieves.the coke money he had laundered through hansen had come from drug sales involving this dealer,dardinski told george.angel later gave george a cash retainer.that same day,george deposited in cash into an account at a bank of america branch located in needham,massachusetts.twelve minutes later,he deposited in cash into that account at a different bank of america branch located a half mile away.two weeks later,george gave dardinski a check payable to crane industries.written on the same account into which george had deposited the,this check represented dardinski cut of the retainer.the check had office disposal on the memo line,even though dardinski had not done a lick of work for george.
all this,and more,led to george arrest,indictment,and jury conviction for conspiracy count aiding and abetting money laundering counts money laundering counts and structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting them count following the verdict,the judge sentenced george to months in prison.the judge also ordered him to forfeit his lexus.
george now appeals his convictions,his sentence,and the forfeiture judgment,challenging several of the judge rulings along the way.though passionately presented,his arguments do not persuade.so at the end of the day,we affirm the judge in all respects.
sufficiency issues 
george had asked for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.the judge orally denied the request without prejudice to his reconsidering the motion after the jury verdict.george later moved for a judgment of acquittal or new trial.but the judge denied that motion in a margin order.
a disappointed george claims the judge got the sufficiency ruling all wrong.as he tells it,the government never proved four things first,that he and hansen had conspired to launder money,as count alleged,money derived from specified unlawful activity,to use some legal lingo second,that he had aided and abetted the transactions,as counts alleged third,that the specified unlawful activity underlying counts was wire fraud and fourth,that the george used to cover his check to dardinski came from the angel had given him,as count alleged.tackling these preserved claims,we review the evidence direct and circumstantial afresh and in a light,making all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the government favor.see,acosta colón,at.ultimately,george must show that after viewing the evidence this way,no sensible jury could have convicted him.see id.at.and of course,it matters not whether his conduct looks squeakyclean when seen in splendid isolation nor need the government evidence rule out every hypothesis consistent with his innocence,provided the record supports a finding.see united states polanco,cir.no surprise,then,that a sufficiency challenge is a tough sell,id.at,and for reasons described below,we decline to buy what george is selling.
conspiracy 
kicking things off,george challenges his count conviction under h.that section criminalizes conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of or.section a b i,in turn,criminalizes the conduct of any person who carries out a financial transaction knowing both that the funds involved arose from some form of unlawful activity and that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.and a criminalizes knowingly engaging in a monetary transaction in property of a value greater than that is also derived from specified unlawful activity.for both statutes,specified unlawful activity includes wire fraud and felony drug offenses.see c a referencing,f emphasizing that specified unlawful activity for purposes has the meaning given in noting that a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime,see united states tum,cir discussing conspiracy essentials,george wants us to conclude that prosecutors failed to prove that he and hansen ever agreed to launder money that they believed came from wire fraud or drug trafficking.but this we can not do.just consider the following evidence,sketched in the light most pleasing to the government,with all credibility issues resolved in its favor 
george knew every dirty detail behind dardinski repo caper,having gotten them straight from dardinski mouth when dardinski was looking for a lawyer to help deal with the fallout from that caper.so a rational jury could easily conclude that when george asked dardinski what he had done with all that money and then said that i can get rid of it for you,george was referring to the loot dardinski had made from that illegal activity.
on the heels of his i can get rid of it for you comment,george told dardinski over the course of two different recorded conversations,one of which took place in george lexus that he had a guy who would take dardinski hundred grand and cut dardinski a check from his company,east coast mortgage,for.george at one point also said that he would tell the broker who of course turned out to be hansen that we all set to go.based on this evidence,a sensible jury could find that george and hansen had reached an understanding at some point about how to launder dardinski money.
i got ta hide some coke money too,dardinski confessed to george during the first of their recorded.and george clued him in at their next meeting that the broker had agreed to do the rest.dardinski complained that the fee he was about to pay for the laundering was too high.explaining why the fee was what it was,george said that the broker had said,i doing a huge favor i do even know dardinski.from this evidence,a levelheaded jury could also deduce that george and hansen had agreed to launder dardinski funds.
to help the two get together,george gave dardinski hansen number.and when dardinski and hansen finally met,dardinski made clear in yet another recorded meeting that he had a ton of money stashed here,there,and everywhere and suggested that they do a hundred grand first and more later once they get comfortable with each other.was it worth it an interested hansen asked dardinski,with the first it referring to dardinski stint in prison for the larceny crime.i did four years,dardinski replied to which hansen said,yeah.fuck it.it worth it.dardinski twice gave hansen all deasupplied money.the first time he told hansen that we do this one and then i do a bunch more,adding that he had all that money from the coke too.alright,said hansen.the second time dardinski warned hansen not to ride around with the money because t here probably fuckin coke on it.oh jeez was hansen response.and each time hansen gave dardinski an check payable to crane industries,the fictitious company.and speaking of payouts,george had told dardinski that he was making any money on these deals.but t hat something i made up,george admitted to hansen.ultimately,hansen gave george,saying the deal half,and i want the slate even.the net effect of all this is that a grounded jury could again infer that george and hansen had settled on a plan to clean dardinski dirty money.
desperate for a way to show that he never agreed to launder gains,george points to evidence suggesting that dardinski had lots and lots of legitimate money from his repossession business that he wanted to hide from the government.and he invites us to infer that all his deal discussions with dardinski focused on money dardinski had earned honestly and so find that the evidence did not in his words,with his emphasis constitute sufficient evidence that george agreed to launder criminally derived money.his argument has at least two problems,however.one,caselaw compels us to draw all reasonable inferences in the government favor,not his.tum,at.two,even if we assume for argument sake that this is a plausible theory of innocence,george gains nothing,because the issue is not whether a jury rationally could have acquitted but whether it rationally could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states seng tan,cir.and again,the recorded conversations viewed in the proper light gave the jury plenty of reasons to conclude that the conspirators were laundering dardinski dirty money,not simply hiding his clean money.
the bottom line is that this phase of george sufficiency challenge fails.so we soldier on.
aiding and abetting 
george next complains about the adequacy of the evidence on counts and,which charged him with aiding and abetting the two deals.for those not in the know,an aider and abetter is broadly speaking someone who knowingly assisted a crime commission,wanting it to succeed.see,united states davis,cir polanco,at.george stresses that he had told dardinski before the first transaction that he wanted nothing to do with any deal.and he insists that for long stretches he did nothing to further any deal.so parroting the definition,he contends that the evidence does not adequately show that he participated in the transactions,or sought by his actions to make them succeed.color us unpersuaded.
eyeing the record from the prosecution perspective as we now must,see polanco,at,we remind the reader that after talking the talk about how he could get rid of dardinski money,george then walked the walk getting hansen involved,giving dardinski hansen contact info,explaining to dardinski how hansen would clean the cash.here are snippets from recorded conversations between george and dardinski to help make our point separated by asterisks,the first is from a chat that occurred shortly after their and the second is from one that occurred a few weeks after that 
dardinski you sure this guy alright,right 
george oh my good god.well,i tell you what i will tell you what if this guy is alright,you can hold me responsible for anything.
dardinski you know,it a hundred grand.it a hundred grand.
george well i need to tell ya you do have a worry in the world with this guy.
dardinski alright.and i not gon na have to pay no taxes nothing it never gon na come back to me 
george nope.it his responsibility.what he sic gon na do is give you the check that you need.now you got ta give me ah,you know i ca do it i have to have it.i call him up.i tell him we all set to go.
george i tell you one thing,though.i just talked to the guy a second ago.umm,he sitting in his office,and,and if i do call him y ou know this is the way he with me now.i do call him,i do call him,it all done 
dardinski alright 
george you,you paying a guy two,you know,you paying a guy two points on a hundred dol to,to,cut a,to cut you a check for dol i not doing anything wrong because i not benefitting from it.
dardinski okay.
george okay,so you telling me i got ta tell this guy what time 
dardinski i do know.that the thing.it traffic and the weather,and my boss,um 
george just so you know about this guy,okay 
dardinski i call you back and by five i call you.
george can i just tell you something about this guy we do do this,we done with him.
dardinski okay.
obviously,then,the evidence is quite sufficient to support the convictions.
scrambling for a way around the problem,george writes that he can not be an aider and abetter because he clearly told dardinski in a recorded conversation nine days before the first transaction went down that he wanted nothing to do with any deal with hansen.true,some transcripts of the recorded confab reveal george telling dardinski that i not involved and that you can tell hansen what i said.but other things george said cut the other way for example,when dardinski said that hansen wanted to make the deal first check out to george,george responded,you tell him unless he calls and discusses it with me,not to make checks out,not to make any check out to me.a jury taking the view most helpful to the government could find that a cautious george did not want an check made payable to him unless he and hansen were on the same page.and a logical jury could also conclude that george did not like talking shop over the phone and so sprinkled in words suggesting his unwillingness to do anything illegal just in case the police were listening in we offer this vignette to show how george wanted to avoid like the plague any discussions of what he called money laundering deals.it is a conversation between george and hansen four months after the second deal remember,ronnie is dardinski 
george he says to me,he calls me.i was just happy you were doing the deal because i said to myself,that damn fucking hansen knows i was full of shit and he knows i did take the deal somewhere else.
hansen yeah.
george but,he says hans e n wants you,or hans e n asked me to ask you,he will cut the check to you and then you put it in your account,and then you cash the check or cut me a check.in other words,a,money laundering.and i said,he said it on the fucking telephone,right now at this point i saying,should i call hans e n up who wo take my call and just tell him not to talk to this guy on the phone i do know what going on here,you know.and i said,ronnie,what the fuck would i run a check through my account that i not making any money on in other words,that was even the right answer.
emphasis added.
george also insists that he did not talk to dardinski in the four months leading up to the first deal,that the only recorded conversations between him and hansen occurred after both deals had gone down,that there was no evidence that he had done a single thing to further any transaction during certain periods,and that some recordings showed he had no idea the transactions occurred,much less know their structure.but what does him in here is that a culpable aider and abetter need not perform the substantive offense,be present when it is performed,or be aware of the details of its execution.davis,at quoting united states garcia rosa,cir,vacated on other grounds by rivera feliciano united states.so the fact that he did not personally participate in the deals and may not have known every tidbit about them in no way undermines the evidentiary sufficiency of the finding which again required proof that he knowingly helped another commit a crime,wanting the venture to pan out.
wire fraud 
a moment ago,we said count of the indictment charged george with conspiracy to commit money laundering and counts charged him with aiding and abetting money laundering with the money coming from wire fraud or felony drug crimes.the wire fraud arose from dardinski repo scam,the government insisted and insists still.george argues here as he did below that the wires had no role or part in furthering dardinski repo scheme,meaning at least in his mind that there was no wire fraud to underpin counts.but his theory is dead wrong,given the following evidence again arrayed in the light most flattering to the government 
from to,dardinski ran a franchise of american lenders service american,for short in massachusetts.based in texas,american is a repossession clearinghouse,to quote dardinski trial testimony.a bank looking to,say,repossess a car would call american,dardinski explained,and american would then farm the work out to franchisees like him.the way it worked here was american would fax dardinski a repossession order from its texas office,and he would repossess the car.unfortunately,he put some of those cars on a lot and told interested persons that they were for sale.buyers then handed him cash or wrote him checks for cars they would never get.and these facts helped lead to the charges against him.
turning back to george argument that the wires did not further dardinski repo ruse,our caselaw holds that the wires use need only be incident to an essential step in the scheme.see,united states woodward,cir.and contrary to what george suggests,the evidence satisfies that standard because without the info in the faxes which are interstate wire communications,to be sure dardinski would have lost part of his supply of decoy cars.in other words,the interstate faxes helped advance dardinski scheme,even if only in an incidental way.so this sufficiency attack,like his first,goes nowhere.
george also grumbles about the sufficiency of the evidence on count,a count under a b involving the client referral check that he gave dardinski.but he is all wet on this one too.
first,a quick fact refresher.after angel played by undercover officer nieves handed him the cash retainer,george put the dough into his account through two separate deposits minutes apart,one for,the other for.he later wrote dardinski a check from this account as payment for the referral penning office disposal on the check memo line,even though dardinski had not done a smidgen of work for george.
with all that in mind,george essentially makes the following argument.step one before he made the two deposits,his account had a balance.that same day,a check payable to the massachusetts department of revenue cleared his account,leaving him a balance the previous balance the cash deposits the department of revenue check.of that amount,only came from the two deposits the balance before the in cash deposits.step two subsection a b criminalizes financial transactions involving property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.step three the word involving means that prosecutors had to prove that every penny used to fund the check came from the cash retainer,which they failed to do,given his account balance.step four ergo,we must toss his count conviction.
an interesting theory,but one that can not survive close inspection.consider united states mcgauley,cir.there we rejected an argument like the one presented here in the context of a prosecution under a,a provision virtually identical to a b subsection a deals with property involved in a financial transaction represent ing the proceeds from some form of unlawful activity subsection a b deals with a financial transaction involving property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.emphasis added.anyhow,the mcgauley defendant deposited of gains into a bank account,later closed that account,divided that account contents into two cashier checks,deposited those checks into two new accounts at a different bank,and then withdrew large sums of money from those accounts.at.fighting her moneylaundering conviction on appeal,she insisted that prosecutors had to but did not prove that the full amount of the two checks came from an illegal source.id.at.nonsense,we ruled.see id.to accept that argument would eviscerate,we said,permitting one to avoid its reach simply by commingling proceeds of unlawful activity with legitimate funds.id.and she did not provide any cases to back up her suggestion that there is a de minimis exception to that removes from the money laundering prohibition transactions in which legitimate funds greatly outweigh illegitimate ones.id.we see no meaningful difference between the mcgauley defendant argument and george.and applying mcgauley teachings to this case which makes sense,given the subsections similar wording kiboshes george last sufficiency challenge 
evidentiary issues 
next,george claims that the judge committed evidentiary error by admitting hansen statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule not striking agent tamuleviz testimony about a check from hansen made out to george law office excluding hansen plea colloquy and cooperation agreement admitting certain recorded conversations involving angel and letting dardinski and agent tamuleviz explain what they thought george meant when george said during the meeting in the lexus that he already agreed to do the rest.none of his gripes requires us to reverse,however.
hansen statements 
george lead argument is that the judge bungled matters by admitting hansen recorded statements as statements of a coconspirator see.d e.that exception applies if the judge finds it is more likely than not that the defendant was a coconspirator of the speaker,that the conspiracy existed at the time the statements were made,and that they were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.see,united states petrozziello,cir.how this works is that a judge conditionally admits the alleged coconspirator statements,subject to a later finding by the judge,supported by extrinsic evidence other than the statements themselves,sufficient to show the conspiracy and the speaker involvement in it.united states sepúlveda hernández,cir.the judge here followed that model.but an unhappy george protests that he had quit the conspiracy before the recordings were made and so nothing hansen said qualified as coconspirator statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy.if properly preserved,that issue gets review if unpreserved,it gets review.see united states mehanna,cir.the parties spar over whether george did enough to preserve the issue.but we need not say who is right,because even giving him the benefit of the doubt on the preservation point,george withdrawal theory is not a winner.
withdrawal is a difficult defense,typically requiring evidence that the accused confessed his involvement in the conspiracy to the government or announced his withdrawal to his coconspirators.see,id.at united states ciresi,cir united states potter,cir.george did neither,though he thinks he did broadcast his withdrawal twice.
the first time,he says,happened during the meeting in his lexus with dardinski,before dardinski had even met hansen.there,george reminds us,he told dardinski,if i do phone the guy then it all done.that,obviously,was not a confession to the authorities.george does not argue otherwise.but neither does he explain how these statements which could suggest that he was champing at the bit to get a deal done constituted a clear communication to coconspirator hansen that he was withdrawing.and far from disavowing the conspiracy,george spent a lot of time at that meeting walking dardinski through how the deals would work.he also later gave him hansen number.all of that devastates this line of argument.
which takes us to the second time george supposedly withdrew.as we noted earlier in rejecting sufficiency challenge number,george repeatedly told dardinski days before the first deal that i not involved and that you can tell hansen what i said.with that he became an.or so he argues.but other things he said during that same conversation pour cold water on this theory.one example that springs immediately to mind is his telling dardinski to tell hansen that unless he calls and discusses it with me,not to make checks out to me.and do not forget that he later accepted from hansen for his role in the scheme a cash grab that showed that he had been part of the conspiracy all along.
ever persistent,george points to periods before and after the deals where he largely would not answer or return dardinski calls.largely is his word,not ours.and,he writes,his not speak ing to or engag ing dardinski proves that he had quit the conspiracy.but mere cessation of activity on behalf of the conspiracy is not enough to show withdrawal.see united states piper,cir see also mehanna,at holding that a voiding contact with one coconspirators,without more,is not in any way,shape,or form tantamount to abandoning the conspiracy.and skipping meetings and refusing to answer calls from cooperating witnesses and coconspirators constitute inaction rather than affirmative steps to distance himself from his prior involvement.united states guevara,cir.so this leg of his argument does not support his position either.
the short of it is that the judge did not clearly err in admitting hansens statements made after george alleged withdrawal.enough said about that.
agent tamuleviz check related testimony 
during the trial,prosecutors showed agent tamuleviz what was supposedly an check from hansen to george law office.the date on it suggested that someone had written it while the conspiracy was going on.the defense objected.agent tamuleviz only knew about the check what it was,where it came from,as a result of debriefing hansen after the conspiracy,george lawyer argued.what prosecutors are trying to do,he added,is to get hansen declaration that he had penned the check during the conspiracy in through tamuleviz for the truth of the matter asserted,but they not calling michael hansen,so it hearsay.objection overruled,the judge said.agent tamuleviz then identified the check and confirmed that he had gotten it from hansen.the defense energetically the agent,getting him to agree that hansen had handed him the check after turning on george and that george had neither signed nor cashed the check.
that night,the defense filed a written motion to strike the check and related testimony,arguing that their admission was improper hearsay that violated george confrontation rights under crawford washington,the government opposed.but the judge was partially receptive to george argument,ultimately ruling that he would strike the check from the evidence,but not agent tamuleviz related testimony.and the judge later told the jury that he had struck the check from the record,adding that evidence that the c ourt orders stricken is no longer evidence in the case and must not be considered by you once you commence your deliberations.
still smarting from the judge ruling,george argues that the admission of agent tamuleviz testimony offended his confrontation rights under crawford.but we need not debate whether he is right,because even if an error occurred something we do not decide,that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states earle,cir stressing that i f a constitutional error has occurred,we must order a new trial unless the government has shown that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.we explain.
harmlessness turns on things like the importance of the testimony to the case,the cumulativeness of the testimony,the presence or absence of other evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony,the extent of permitted crossexamination,and the overall strength of the government case.id.at.here agent tamuleviz check testimony concerned a peripheral issue and was cumulative of other evidence that came out at trial the jury,remember,heard others say how hansen had suggested that he cut george a check,and that george then use the funds derived from that check to cut dardinski a check.plus the judge had instructed the jury not to consider the check for any purpose.and we have no reason to think that the jury failed to follow the judge command.see generally acosta colón,at noting that w e presume that juries follow instructions.also,defense counsel scored some points on crossexamination,getting agent tamuleviz to confirm that hansen had coughed up the check after flipping on george and that george had neither signed nor negotiated the check.last but by no means least even without the offending testimony,the damning evidence highlighted above underscores how strong the government case against george was.so taking everything into account,any error if there was one in admitting agent tamuleviz testimony was harmless.
hansen plea colloquy and cooperation agreement 
george slams the judge for not admitting hansen plea colloquy and cooperation agreement into evidence.by way of background,george tells us that hansen pled guilty to failing to file an irs form required for cash transactions exceeding.hansen never pled guilty to conspiracy or aiding and abetting,george adds,and the government version of the facts at hansen plea colloquy never mentioned any agreement to launder money either.to george way of thinking,these documents were admissible as admissions by the government a,george implies that hansen was not guilty of conspiracy or aiding and abetting.see.d explaining that admissions by a are not hearsay.and if hansen was not guilty,then neither is george.or so george suggests.the judge deemed the documents irrelevant to the crimes charged against george and thought they would only confuse the jury.
even assuming for argument sake that the contested papers qualified as under rule d and we intimate no view on the question the judge ruling was within the proper exercise of his discretion.see,polanco,at explaining that review applies in situations like this.had the judge admitted the documents,a prosecutor probably would have taken the stand to explain the government reasons for plea bargaining with hansen reasons that may have had nothing to do with his guilt,like getting him to cooperate against george,for instance.and the reasons given could have been highly incriminating to george.also,the judge could have ended up with a about a side issue hansen innocence of charges not made that might have confused the jury.given all this,the judge abused no discretion in keeping the disputed documents out.see,e,united states bingham,cir collecting cases holding that a judge may exclude documents like these on.grounds.
hoping against hope,george argues that the judge decision impaired his right to present a complete defense.but his rights were violated only if the judge abused his discretion in barring the evidence.see,united states brandon,cir.and as we have concluded,the judge did not.consequently,this argument is a.
angel conversations 
over defense objections,the judge admitted into evidence with redactions recordings of conversations involving george,dardinski,and angel,the supposed drug dealer looking to hire george who was really undercover officer nieves.george is okay with the parts that touched on whether angel paid his retainer with dirty money.his beef is with the other parts that,he says,smeared him as unprofessional stuff he considers inadmissible as forbidden character evidence that was more prejudicial than probative.see.b.his opening example involves a snippet of conversation discussing bail jumping.a ll he referring to angel cares about is getting his guys out on bail,dardinski explained.i done it a million times,george shot back.because if they in,there more of a chance that they gon na roll,dardinski said,adding that i f they out,they go home.he pays them.what kind of money are we looking at right now george asked.big money,dardinski replied.i making a lot here,dardinski stressed,after having earlier told george that he had gotten his money from this coke guy.so,george said,he just got money,money,money.reviewing solely for abuse of discretion,see,united states doe,cir,we see no reason to reverse the judge action.
evidence of a defendant other bad acts is not admissible to prove his propensity to behave in a particular way.see.b.but evidence may be admitted for other purposes.see id.b.and the recordings served an important purpose they helped paint a picture of george and angel relationship,bringing into bold relief george understanding that angel had made his money in the drug trade.see doe,at finding no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence of defendant past drug dealings because it painted a picture of the relationship between the defendant and the undercover officer,thereby providing the jury with context surrounding the drug sale.
of course,even if admissible under rule b,evidence may stay out under rule if it is substantially more prejudicial than probative.see,united states sebaggala,cir.such an inquiry involving the balancing of intangibles calls on the judge to exercise judgment,naturally.see,united states williams,cir.and the judge was equal to the task,concluding that the balance favored admitting some parts of the recordings but excluding others.as a further safeguard,the judge told counsel that he would consider any limiting instruction offered by the defense,and later gave george requested instruction,telling the jury that george did not engage in any unlawful behavior by simply accepting the undercover agent as a new client or by accepting the in cash as a legal fee.only in extreme cases will we the judge judgment.id.this is not that case.
dardinski and agent tamuleviz testimony concerning george agreed to do the rest comment 
and that leaves one remaining evidentiary issue.over defense objections,the judge let dardinski explain what he thought george meant when george said during the meeting in the lexus that he already agreed to do the rest dardinski understood that statement to mean that george and the mortgage broker who later turned out to be hansen had discussed the proceeds from the drug money and all that,and that where all the money was coming from.also over defense objections,the judge let agent tamuleviz explain what he thought george he already agreed to do the rest statement meant the rest of the money at that time,agent tamuleviz testified,would be from the money dardinski made from the repossession and also from the cocaine.george argues that the judge rulings violated.a rule that allows a lay witness to offer an opinion if it is rationally premised on his perception,helps the jury better understand either his testimony or some fact in issue,and is not based on scientific or specialized knowledge within the scope of rule governing expert opinion.we review for abuse of discretion,see united states muñoz franco,cir,and find none.
as for dardinski,he was personally involved in this conversation with george,clearly.and he based his lay conclusion not on knowledge but on an earlier chat he had had with george you know,the one where he told george that he had coke money to launder.also,the judge could reasonably conclude that this testimony would help the jury.see united states lizardo,cir finding no abuse of discretion in allowing a to testify about the meaning of statements that were either deliberately ambiguous or of uncertain meaning.
and as for agent tamuleviz,he had been intimately involved in the investigation from start to finish,setting dardinski up with recording equipment,surveilling every meeting,reviewing every recording.so he knew that dardinski had told george that he had coke money in need of cleaning on top of the money from the repo scam before george reported back at their next meeting that his guy had agreed to do the rest.time and again we have stated that rule lets in testimony based on the lay expertise a witness personally acquires through experience,often on the job.united states santiago,cir quoting united states maher,cir.exactly so here.and given these circumstances we spot no abuse of discretion in the judge course of action.see united states albertelli,cir okaying the admission of an agent testimony about the meaning of recorded conversations,because while not the most traditional lay opinion,the agent testimony formally meets the requirements of rule,being rationally based on his perception of the conversations helpful in the rule sense broadly understood and yet not based on expert knowledge within the meaning of rule internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied.
with that and at long last,we have exhausted george evidentiary challenges.but there is still some work to do.
new trial issue 
alleging,as he did below,that the interests of justice call for a new trial,george separately argues that the judge abused his discretion in denying his motion.but george argument simply replays the arguments that we just outright rejected.consequently,we see no hint of abused discretion here.see maldonado,at.
cumulative error issue 
george invokes the doctrine in the hopes of landing a new trial.we have spied one assumed error concerning agent tamuleviz testimony that was harmless to boot.consequently,the doctrine helps him not at all.see united states desimone,cir holding that t he cumulative error doctrine is of no use to the defendant because the only identified error was harmless.
sentencing enhancement issue 
when calculating george sentence the judge imposed a enhancement under.b b i of the federal sentencing guidelines that section requires the enhancement if the defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of,or were intended to promote,an offense involving the manufacture,importation,or distribution of a controlled substance or a listed chemical.george questions the factual basis for the enhancement,claiming that prosecutors never proved that he knew or believed that any of the laundered money was drug money.precisely the opposite is true,however.do forget prosecutors played a recording of dardinski telling george that he had to hide some coke money and another recording of george telling dardinski that hansen had agreed to clean the rest,with the rest being an apparent allusion to the drug money.so we spy no reversible error with the judge enhancement ruling.see united states matthews,cir explaining that when it comes to enhancement decisions,we review the district court legal rulings anew,its factfinding for clear error,and its application of the guidelines to the case on a sliding scale with the scrutiny cranked up the more lawdriven the court decision is quoting united states zehrung,cir.
not so fast,george argues.the judge found the facts by a preponderance of the evidence,not a jury using a standard,which he argues violates apprendi new jersey,and alleyne united states.but because the enhancement did not increase a statutory maximum or minimum sentence,the judge did nothing wrong here.see united states ramírez negrón,cir.
as a fallback,george argues that the judge should have applied a standard of proof.our caselaw clearly holds that the preponderance standard applies in circumstances like this case.see,id.so george strikes out on this theory too.
