nicholas mcdonald was a heroin dealer in the bangor area of maine,obtaining his heroin on trips to worcester,massachusetts.eventually,when caught with grams of heroin,he was charged both for the heroin and a gun in his possession.mcdonald pleaded guilty in february to one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of a and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g subject to appealing the denial of his motion to suppress.the district court quite correctly denied his motion to suppress and,at sentencing,correctly found that he had tried to obstruct justice by trying to swallow a small bag of heroin.
a separate question on appeal has to do with the increase in his base offense level from to,which was based not on the drugs he actually possessed but on relevant conduct concerning drugs he purportedly sold.that relevant conduct was based on untested accounts by a confidential informant ci who purportedly had accompanied him on his buying trips south and had been with him on several occasions as he sold drugs.that is,the presentence investigation report psr contained information from the ci,which came in the form of the ci grand jury testimony and a statement made to the government.no law enforcement or other witness saw those sales.the ci did not testify,and so mcdonald never had an opportunity to her.
still,we can not say there was clear error in the district court finding that this information met the requirements for relevant conduct and was sufficiently reliable to attribute to mcdonald an additional quantity of drugs.there was no clear error in the court finding that between and grams of heroin were involved,which supported a sentence of months imprisonment on the drug count.
we point out that mcdonald received a concurrent sentence of months imprisonment on the firearm charge and will serve months anyway,whatever the merits of the method used by the government to get an increased sentence on the drug charge.
as to the motion to suppress,we recite the relevant facts as found by the district court,consistent with record support.united states arnott,cir.as to the facts relevant to the sentencing appeal,we take the facts as set forth in the unchallenged portions of the psr and the sentencing hearing.united states innarelli,cir.
