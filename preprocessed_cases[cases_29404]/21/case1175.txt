statement of the case 
summary of the facts 
viewed in the light most favorable to the government,united states vitale,cir,the evidence established the following 
pierce,colon,and meregildo were members of a violent street gang,dubbed the courtlandt avenue crew cac by the government,that engaged in the trafficking of crack cocaine,heroin,and marijuana in and around the melrose public housing developments and the andrew jackson houses the melrose jackson houses in the melrose section of the bronx.cac was formed in by terry harrison,who recruited young men around the melrose jackson houses to sell drugs,many of meregildo and colon were already members of another gang,known as god favorite children,or gfc.
harrison was shot and killed in by an individual working for the rival organization.after harrison murder,meregildo assumed a leadership role in cac,providing crack cocaine to the street dealers until he was arrested in january.after meregildo was arrested,colon took over some of the narcotics operations,supplying crack cocaine to members of cac as well as to its customers.colon was arrested on the current charges in september.in addition to their involvement in the extensive narcotics sales,pierce,meregildo,and colon also actively participated in violence perpetrated against rival gangs and suspected law enforcement informants on behalf of cac.
b.the proceedings below 
pierce,colon,and meregildo were charged along with more than a dozen other alleged members and associates of cac,in an indictment filed june.the trial commenced on october.
as part of its,the government called forty witnesses,including six cooperating witnesses.five of the cooperating witnesses were former members of cac who testified about the participation of pierce,meregildo,and colon in the narcotics trafficking and violence.the government also offered physical evidence,including seized drugs,drug paraphernalia,and firearms used in the commission of the murders.
additionally,the government introduced into evidence social media posts by members of cac,which alluded to the narcotics sales and violent acts,including a rap video from colon facebook page and photographs of his tattoos.
the district court charged the jury on november.the district court delivered an uncalled witness instruction,without making the modifications meregildo had requested in the charge conference.the jury began its deliberations.the next day,november,the jury sent the court a note asking a s related to count fifteen is the conspiracy limited to the courtlandt avenue c rew or working together or in concert with the courtlandt avenue crew trial transcript tr.after hearing from both parties on the appropriate response,the district court instructed the jury over defense objections that count fifteen does not allege that membership in the narcotics conspiracy requires membership in the courtlandt avenue crew.id.

discussion 
defendants present the following issues on appeal a the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to certain counts as to meregildo and colon b the admissibility of video and tattoo evidence as to colon c the constitutionality of the sca as applied to colon d the propriety of certain of the district court jury instructions as to all three defendants and e the calculation of pierce sentence.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review challenges to the sufficiency of evidence de novo.united states harvey,cir per curiam.a defendant bears a heavy burden because we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all inferences in the government favor and deferring to the jury assessments of the witnesses credibility.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we will sustain the jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,emphasis in original.
meregildo challenges the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to whether cac was an enterprise as contemplated by rico he was a part of the alleged narcotics conspiracy he was involved in the murder of carrel ogarro and ogarro murder was in furtherance of the rico enterprise or for pecuniary gain.
the thrust of meregildo principal argument is that the evidence at trial established merely random acts of violence in the vicinity of the melrose jackson houses,rather than the organization,continuity,structure or intent of an enterprise as intended under rico.meregildo brief br.specifically,he argues that the government failed to prove that cac had the requisite hierarchy to satisfy the enterprise element of rico cac lacked sufficient longevity to pursue the enterprise purpose and the government failed to establish the separate existence of an enterprise as something distinct from the predicate acts.these arguments fail,both legally and factually.
first,as a matter of law,the requirements for proving a racketeering enterprise are not so rigid as meregildo contends.as the supreme court noted in boyle united states,an enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.such a group need not have a hierarchical structure or a chain of command.moreover,there is no time period for satisfaction of the longevity prong.continuity is both a closed and concept,referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition nw.bell,internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the evidence used to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the evidence establishing an enterprise may in particular cases coalesce.boyle,at quoting united states turkette.
second,as a factual matter,the evidence was sufficient to establish that cac was an enterprise.a cooperating witness testified that the crew had guns t o protect us from our beefs,our problems with other neighborhoods and other crews.tr.related testimony established that the crew had a base of operations on courtlandt avenue near the melrose jackson houses,members had tattoos and signs that signified their membership,and numerous crimes were committed by cac members in furtherance of the enterprise,including the murders of jason correa,carrel ogarro,and delquan alston.the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational juror to infer that harrison and the other members of the crew joined in the shared purpose of selling drugs and promoting such sales.united states burden,cir.hence,the government evidence established that cac was a continuing unit that functioned with a common purpose the illicit sale of narcotics in and around the melrose jackson houses.
we conclude further that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to show that meregildo was a participant in the alleged narcotics conspiracy.four cooperating witnesses,for example,testified that they had purchased marijuana from meregildo,and two of them testified that they observed meregildo receiving marijuana from harrison.one of the cooperating witnesses testified that meregildo supplied him,as well as other gfc members,with crack cocaine to sell,and that meregildo assumed a leadership role in the narcotics conspiracy after harrison murder.another cooperating witness testified that meregildo gave him bags of crack cocaine for distribution on multiple occasions.and a third cooperating witness testified that after harrison death he observed meregildo breaking up pieces of crack cocaine and packaging it in small baggies.the trial testimony of these primary cooperating witnesses was sufficient to establish that meregildo knew of the existence of the scheme alleged in the indictment and knowingly joined and participated in it.united states rahman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,meregildo contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he murdered and conspired to murder carrel ogarro or that he did so in aid of the enterprise or for pecuniary gain.meregildo points to evidence that ogarro was in fact murdered by the cooperating witness devin parsons,possibly because of a personal problem ogarro was having with walter aponte.parsons,however,testified that meregildo shot ogarro at harrison direction,due to harrison suspicion that ogarro was snitching with regards to cac activities.tr.parsons described how,in july,he,meregildo,and aponte waited for ogarro near the melrose jackson houses basketball court,and how he and meregildo both fired their guns at ogarro,hitting him repeatedly.he also testified that harrison promised meregildo and parsons to kill ogarro.
meregildo argues that parsons testimony was contradicted by forensic evidence and other testimony.but the jury could have reasonably rejected meregildo contentions and accepted the government proof,and apparently it did so.thus,the evidence was sufficient to permit the inference that meregildo was a member of the alleged narcotics conspiracy and that he participated in the murder of ogarro in aid of the cac enterprise.
colon argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for the jury to find him guilty of murdering delquan alston while engaged in the narcotics conspiracy,in violation of e a,though colon does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his committing the underlying murder.
we have held that section e a liability does not require active involvement in drug distribution.united states santos,cir that the defendant did not participate in the narcotics conspiracy in some way other than carrying out the murders does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence that he was a.t he government need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one motive for the killing was related to the drug conspiracy.united states desinor,cir emphasis in original.
parsons testified that on august,he and colon shot and killed alston.parsons was at a restaurant in the bronx with harrison and colon when harrison told colon that alston was selling fake crack cocaine to cac customers,and that alston was rumored to be a law enforcement informant.harrison asked colon and parsons to kill alston,promising to pay them.on the night of the murder,colon,parsons,and alston sat on a bench and talked near a courtlandt avenue apartment building.parsons asked alston to go buy some rolling paper for marijuana.parsons and colon followed him as he walked to the store.on the way,alston stopped to urinate against the wall of a building.when he turned back around,colon shot him in the head with a caliber pistol that parsons had given to him.
though colon does not dispute that he murdered alston,he points to testimony by a government witness that he told someone he met in pretrial detention that he killed alston not as part of a contract murder,but because alston threatened to kill one of colon friends.colon also contends that he could not have been a part of the narcotics conspiracy because he was released from juvenile detention only a month before harrison death,and that he was selling drugs independently from cac,and often in direct competition with cac.at trial,however,the government presented contrary evidence,including the evidence described above that colon killed alston at harrison request because alston actions were threatening cac narcotics activity.hence,the jury could have rationally inferred that colon had the requisite intent to commit the murder in aid of the drug trafficking conspiracy.see santos,at.
b.the video and tattoo evidence 
colon contends that his first amendment rights were violated when the district court permitted the government to present as evidence a rap video and images of his tattoos,some of which he had posted to his facebook page.though we ordinarily review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,because colon failed to raise these objections at trial we review the admission of this evidence for plain error.see united states fell,cir.
the district court admitted into evidence a video that was made in december in the melrose jackson houses and depicted colon,a cooperating witness aubrey pemberton,and a number of gfc members.in the video,colon is seen rapping yg to og somebody make somebody nose bleed i og shoot the ruger i a shooter.tr.at trial,pemberton served as a guide through the lyrics,testifying that the young gunnaz crew,or yg,was feuding with the og formerly the gfc.the video helped establish colon association with members of the enterprise and his motive to participate in the charged conduct against members of the young gunnaz.
the district court also allowed the government to offer photographs of colon tattoos,some of which he had posted on his facebook page.one of the photographs was a of colon hand,showing his tattoo,which stands for young gunnaz killer.in some of the photographs colon is pointing a gun at his tattoo,indicating,according to the government,his desire to harm members of the young gunnaz.other tattoos depicted in the photographs introduced at trial included one on his right arm that read courtlandt tattoos on his left arm that referenced meregildo nicknames young and killa and one stating m.mac in peace t money,referring to harrison,the former leader of cac.
colon argues that the admission of the rap video and tattoo images violated his first amendment rights because courts should not sustain a conviction that may have rested on a form of expression,however distasteful,which the constitution tolerates and protects.street new york.this challenge is meritless,however,because here the speech is not itself the proscribed conduct.united states caronia,cir.the speech was not the basis for the prosecution,but instead it was used to establish the existence of,and colon participation in,the alleged rico enterprise.see wisconsin mitchell,the first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.united states salameh,cir per curiam.
colon also argues that the rap lyrics were merely fictional artistic expressions and perverse puffery that should not have been admitted against him.indeed,in state skinner,the new jersey supreme court recently overturned a conviction where the state case at trial relied heavily on violent rap lyrics,as the court observed that o ne would not presume that bob marley,who wrote the song i shot the sheriff,actually shot a sheriff.rap lyrics and tattoos are properly admitted,however,where they are relevant and their probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.see united states moore,cir affirming admission of profane and violent rap recordings over.challenge where lyrics were probative of defendant participation in narcotics conspiracy united states belfast,cir holding that rap lyrics were relevant and their probative value not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice in case where lyrics were used to show that defendant was associated with his father charles taylor anti terrorism unit,which tortured sierra leoneans in liberia.
the government proffered the rap video to show colon animosity toward the young gunnaz,as well as his association with cac.the government similarly offered the tattoo evidence to help establish his motive for violence against the young gunnaz,and to show his loyalty to harrison and meregildo indeed other members of cac had similar tattoos.hence,the rap video and tattoos were relevant,their probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,and colon first amendment rights were not implicated when the district court admitted the evidence from his social media account.
c.the stored communications act 
colon submits that,as applied to him,the sca is unconstitutional because it provides a mechanism for the government to obtain stored content,without a comparable mechanism for criminal defendants to do so.see.colon claims that the sca prohibited him from subpoenaing facebook for page content,thereby denying him his fifth amendment due process right to present evidence and his sixth amendment right to confront adverse witnesses.
we review a constitutional challenge to a statute de novo.united states pettus,cir.section c of the sca provides 
a governmental entity may require a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service not including the contents of communications 
c.the government may obtain this information through,inter alia,a warrant,consent of the subscriber or customer,or through a court order in circumstances where the government offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.id.c d.the sca does not,on its face,permit a defendant to obtain such content 
the instant challenge stems from the government receipt of posts from the facebook account of devin parsons the parsons account.although parsons was incarcerated at the time,he was relaying messages to a friend who would post them to facebook for him,and later began to post messages himself from a contraband cell phone.in one post,parsons stated that he was tellin on certain individuals from the bx but not tellin on nobody from harlem.appendix app.on september,before trial commenced,colon sent a subpoena to facebook seeking the contents of the parsons account.on september,facebook moved to quash the subpoena on the grounds that the sca does not allow private parties to obtain content from service providers,and that the appropriate method for obtaining such content was to subpoena a user directly.on october,the district court granted facebook motion to quash.
on october,counsel for colon notified the district court and the government that he had received the contents of the parsons account through the work of a private investigator.colon counsel made use of the parsons account at trial,parsons about the substance of the postings,and introducing a portion of the parsons account into evidence.finally,in a letter dated february,colon disputed that he had the complete parsons account because he had no way of knowing whether or not the facebook records that he had for parsons were complete.app.
we have not previously addressed the question of the constitutionality of the sca,and we need not do so now.colon possessed the very contents he claims the sca prevented him from obtaining,and his suggestion that there could have been additional relevant exculpatory material in the parsons account is purely speculative.he has made no showing as to what else the parsons account might have contained,or how it might have been helpful to him.moreover,he failed to subpoena parsons and the individual who created the account in his name,the two direct potential sources for the contents of the account.colon,therefore,has not shown any injury from the statute.we reject this claim.
d.the jury instructions 
two aspects of the district court instructions to the jury are challenged the uncalled witness charge,and the supplemental instruction regarding the narcotics conspiracy.
the uncalled witness charge 
meregildo contends that his right to present a defense was infringed when the district court instructed the jury not to draw inferences against either party with respect to uncalled witnesses.
on the ninth day of trial,the government stated in open court but outside the presence of the jury that it planned to call cooperating witness walter aponte the next day as part of its.the next day of trial,however,again in open court but outside the presence of the jury,the government stated that it would not,in fact,be calling aponte.neither the government nor any of the defendants called aponte to testify at trial.
judge pauley proposed to give his standard uncalled witnesses charge to the jury 
you may have heard the names of certain people during the course of the trial who did not testify.i instruct you that each party had an equal opportunity,or lack of opportunity,to call any of these witnesses.
therefore,you should not draw any inferences or reach any conclusions as to what they would have testified had they been called.their absence should not affect your judgment in any way.i remind you that the law does not impose on a defendant the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.
app.meregildo objected,initially on the grounds that he did not have an equal opportunity to call aponte.tr.judge pauley overruled meregildo objection,finding that aponte was equally available to both parties because meregildo could have issued a subpoena,and aponte was detained right across the street.id.
the next day of trial,meregildo counsel conceded that he had an equal opportunity to call aponte,but objected to the proposed language of the uncalled witness charge on the grounds that the jury should at least be permitted if not required to draw an adverse inference against the government based on its sudden failure to call aponte at trial.judge pauley reiterated that meregildo could make arguments regarding aponte absence to the jury,and in summation meregildo counsel did in fact argue that aponte had been the one responsible for ogarro murder but that we never know because a cooperating witness,walter aponte,was never here.tr.over meregildo objections,judge pauley ultimately delivered the uncalled witness charge as proposed.
meregildo contends that,instead of giving an uncalled witness charge,which permits no inferences,the district court should have given a missing witness charge,which invites the jury to draw an adverse inference against a party that fails to call a witness whose production is peculiarly within that party power.united states gaskin,cir internal quotation marks omitted compare leonard sand,et,modern federal jury instructions,at missing witness not equally available to defendant,with id.at uncalled witness equally available.we review a district court refusal to provide a requested missing witness instruction for abuse of discretion and actual prejudice.united states ebbers,cir see also united states torres,cir whether a missing witness charge should be given lies in the sound discretion of the trial court.
in this case,the dis
