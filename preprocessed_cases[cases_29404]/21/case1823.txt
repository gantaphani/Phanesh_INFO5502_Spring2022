the defendant,ehab coriaty,appeals from a judgment upon his conviction by a jury of one count of conspiracy,and eight counts of wire fraud.the united states district court for the southern district of new york nicholas tsoucalas,sentenced him principally to months imprisonment and three years supervised release,and ordered restitution in the amount of.coriaty asserts that six aspects of the district court judgment were erroneous its failure to dismiss coriaty conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud its determination of the loss amount for sentencing purposes its finding of a restitution amount allegedly in excess of the actual loss suffered by the victim its sentencing enhancement for coriaty more than minimal planning role its denial of a motion for a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances and its failure to find that allegedly inflammatory comments by the prosecutor during the course of his summation denied coriaty a fair trial.we conclude that none of the alleged errors warrants disturbing the district court judgment and therefore affirm part of the judgment and dismiss the appeal with respect to the remainder of coriaty claims.
background 
coriaty was convicted of a complex scheme to defraud his employer,nicole durr,of funds she invested through advest,a securities brokerage firm and bank.we set forth only the facts relevant to this appeal.
on october,durr invested million in an advest account.coriaty,as and chief executive officer of durr company,dur music,possessed the authority to wire money from this account to cover operational expenses and to pay employee salaries.presentence investigation report psr at.on february,durr withdrew from the advest account.apparently as a partial result of trading on the account,rather than the net result of the million durr placed in the advest account less the she withdrew,remained in the account at the beginning of the following month,march.at about the same time,durr also authorized coriaty to manage the investment of an additional of her money.these funds were eventually placed in an account at a firm now known as ffp securities.coriaty had discretion with respect to the management of the investment of funds in the ffp account,but durr hired a professional financial consultant named donald warner to invest the funds in the advest account.
on march,without durr knowledge or consent,coriaty instructed warner to liquidate the advest account and to transfer the resulting to durr ffp account.the transfer was completed by may.meanwhile,between march and april,coriaty transferred a total of from the ffp account to a third account held at wall street discount brokers under the name of roman capital,a company jointly owned by coriaty and one howard rosen,coriaty.
of the transferred to the roman capital account,coriaty sent to accounts of his own rosen moved into rosen own accounts.the remaining in the roman capital account was lost through what the government terms wildly unsuccessful stock market investments.appellee br.at.in june and september,coriaty returned a total of to durr from his personal funds,apparently as part of his attempt to hide the other transactions from durr.
of the transferred from the advest account,approximately remained in the ffp account mingled with the that durr had originally entrusted to coriaty in the ffp account.while the fraud was being perpetrated,the ffp account suffered a loss of more than as a consequence of further wildly unsuccessful securities trading.during the course of the fraud,coriaty was managing trading on the funds in the ffp account.trades on this account during the perpetration of the fraud resulted in losses of more than.in other words,the amount lost from the ffp account due to trading exceeded the that remained in the ffp account from the funds improperly transferred from the advest account after accounting for the transfers to the roman capital account.at the fraud conclusion,therefore,durr had nothing in her advest account and,in her ffp account,an amount that was significantly less than the that she had initially placed there 
coriaty was indicted on,inter alia,a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud.as the objects of the conspiracy,the government alleged both violations of the securities laws and wire fraud.among the overt acts charged was the transfer of the from the advest account to the ffp account effectively controlled by coriaty the indictment also included one securities fraud count and sixteen counts of wire fraud.
proceedings in the district court 
after a trial that began on march,and concluded on march,a jury convicted coriaty on the conspiracy charge,the securities fraud charge,and eight counts of wire fraud involving the transfers from the roman capital account to his personal accounts.on a special verdict form,the jury found coriaty guilty of both of the conspiracy objects securities fraud and wire fraud.
in july,coriaty made a motion for a new trial pursuant to,which the district court construed as a motion for acquittal pursuant to.c.the court thereupon dismissed the securities fraud conviction because of the absence of evidence of any misrepresentation involving the nature or value of a security.united states coriaty,wl,at july.the district court nevertheless found sufficient evidence to sustain the charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.id.at.
on august,the district court sentenced coriaty to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,a fine of,and a special mandatory assessment of.the court also ordered the defendant to pay in restitution.this appeal followed.

standards of review 
we review questions of law de novo.united states grant,cir.on sentencing issues,we accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous,and will not overturn the court application of the united states sentencing guidelines to the facts before it unless we conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion.united states deming,cir per curiam internal citation and punctuation marks omitted see also e permitting appellate courts to vacate a sentencing finding that is,inter alia,in violation of law,imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines,or outside the applicable guideline range,and unreasonable.a district court factual findings on loss are similarly reviewed for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.united states carboni,cir.finally,a sentencing court order of restitution is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states berardini,cir.
ii.the conspiracy charge 
coriaty first argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss his conspiracy conviction after it vacated his securities fraud conviction for insufficient evidence.coriaty,wl at.coriaty was indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud,but was convicted only of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.while the indictment used the conjunctive,the jury charge described the conspiracy as one to commit wire fraud or securities fraud.coriaty contends that either the indictment was constructively amended or he was convicted of a crime not alleged in the indictment in violation of the fifth amendment.we disagree.
to be sure,after an indictment has been returned its charges may not be broadened through amendment except by the grand jury itself.stirone united states,d.nevertheless,the right to a grand jury is not normally violated by the fact that the indictment alleges more crimes or other means of committing the same crime provided that each offense whose elements are fully set out in an indictment can independently sustain a conviction.united states miller,d.hence,the lack of sufficient evidence to support one of the objects of a conspiracy does not vitiate the conspiracy conviction,where there was sufficient evidence to support the other object.united states pascarella,cir see also griffin united states,d affirming a conviction under circumstances similar to those of the case at bar miller,at.noting that a part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored internal quotation marks omitted.
we have upheld convictions for conspiracies charged in the conjunctive even when there was insufficient evidence to support one of the objects of the conspiracy.the general rule is that when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive,the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.turner united states,d see also united states berger,cir a s a matter of law the government needed only to prove agreement on one of the objectives charged in the indictment in order to establish that a conspiracy existed.the rule that a jury guilty verdict on a conjunctively worded indictment stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any of the acts charged,obviously extends to a trial court jury instructions in the disjunctive in the context of a conjunctively worded indictment.united states rioux,cir quoting united states cusumano,cir.
coriaty does not contend that the first count of the indictment did not include a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,or that he lacked notice that he was being prosecuted for this crime.his argument is therefore without merit.see united states delano,cir noting that where a defendant is given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,a variance is not reversible error internal punctuation omitted.only where there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment is dismissal warranted.id.at quoting united states mollica,cir.the wire fraud conspiracy was not other than the conspiracy charged in coriaty indictment,but was a component thereof.coriaty thus was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.miller,at.
iii.the loss calculation 
coriaty next contends that the district court erred in calculating loss for sentencing purposes by including funds that were never transferred out of durr ffp account.
according to the commentary for united states sentencing guideline,under which coriaty was sentenced,loss is the value of the money,property,or services unlawfully taken,cmt.a district court need not establish loss with precision but need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.id,cmt.accord carboni,at.it is also accepted that loss may consist of probable or intended loss.united states jacobs,cir.i f an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss,cmt.
ample evidence supported the district court finding that coriaty intended to deprive durr of.a defendant is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts.jacobs,at.coriaty repeatedly attempted to obtain control over the in durr advest account through requests to manage the entire amount before the fraud occurred he also systematically deceived her about the status and location of that amount after the perpetration of the fraud.evidence of those efforts warrants the district court conclusion that coriaty intended to misappropriate the entire amount in the advest account.
it is well established,moreover,that loss in fraud cases includes the amount of property taken,even if all or part has been returned.united states carrozzella,cir collecting cases.here,coriaty removed from durr agent,and assumed improper control over,the entire.the district court,basing its decision on the psr,correctly calculated the loss on the basis of the funds placed under the defendant control.jacobs,at see also carboni,at noting that a loss amount includes loss from all acts and omissions comprising the same course of conduct.
the district court conclusion that coriaty intended to defraud durr of the entire was thus correct and,perforce,not clearly erroneous.
iv.the restitution calculation 
coriaty next challenges the district court calculation of the restitution amount.the amount of the restitution order should be reduced,he argues,to the amount that he transferred from the roman capital account to his own account.in the alternative,he asserts that it should be limited to the in fact transferred from durr accounts into the roman capital account,less the returned to durr.the district court took a different view,calculating the restitution amount by beginning with the amount moved from the advest account to the ffp account,and subtracting from it only the amount coriaty returned to durr,yielding a net restitution amount of.
coriaty argument rests in part on the fact that approximately of the money transferred from the advest account to the ffp account was not moved to the roman capital account and therefore never left durr control.this money,he reasons,was never a loss for durr.his argument also implicitly rests on the premise that it is impossible to determine how to allocate the loss that occurred in the ffp account resulting from trading activity under the defendant management.for this reason,the loss can not be conclusively traced to either the funds originating in the advest account or those initially placed in the ffp account.united states banco cafetero panama,cir noting that the credit balance of an account is the cumulative result of all transactions affecting the account,not a specific res that can be identified and disaggregated.
in the district court,however,coriaty objected only to the loss calculation,and made no mention of restitution.raising the loss amount did not properly present the restitution issue to the district court.whether an error is adequately raised at trial is considered under.united states vasquez,cir,cert.denied,d.rule requires that both the matter to which the party objects and th e ground of the objection be aired.here,as coriaty counsel candidly conceded in a letter invited by the court,coriaty made no mention in the district court of the matter to which he now objects,the restitution amount.id.the alleged error in restitution was thus not properly raised.a sentencing issue not raised in the district court will be deemed forfeited on appeal and addressed only upon a showing that the court committed plain error.united states miller,cir.for plain error there must be an error,that is plain,that affect s substantial rights,and that seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
we conclude that the district court was correct and that there was therefore no error here,plain or otherwise.t he victim and witness protection act of governs a sentencing court authority to determine and impose a restitution penalty on a criminal defendant.united states silkowski,cir citing.for a fraud offense under title,such as the one for which coriaty was convicted,governs restitution.c a ii.according to,where property taken from a victim can not be returned,a defendant must pay to the victim an amount equal to the greater of the value of the property on the date of damage or the value of the property on the date of the sentencing,less the value of any part of the property that is returned.id.b b.victims include those directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.id.a.unlike loss calculations,a court power to order restitution is limited to actual loss.carboni,at.
for three reasons,we conclude that the district court correctly decided that restitution should be less the amount actually paid by coriaty to durr out of his own funds after the fraud began.
first,the value of durr property on the date of the damage was amount fraudulently taken from durr advest account and deposited in the ffp account.see b b i.coriaty is therefore responsible for the amount taken,less what he returned,irrespective of the fact that w
