defendant anthony praddy appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york following a jury trial before frederic block,judge,convicting him of conducting or participating in the conduct of the affairs of a racketeering enterprise,in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c count one conspiring to do so,in violation of d count two conspiring to possess and distribute kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of count four four counts of distributing marijuana,in violation of a counts five,six,seven,and eight and possession of a firearm in connection with the narcotics conspiracy offense,in violation of c count fourteen.praddy was sentenced to,inter alia,months imprisonment on the racketeering and narcotics charges,to be followed by a months term of imprisonment on the firearm charge.on appeal,he principally challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions on counts one,two,and four,and contends that his conviction on count fourteen should be reversed because there was no evidence that he possessed a firearm within the period.praddy also challenges his sentence on the rico and narcotics counts,contending principally that the district court gave inappropriate weight to various aspects of his conduct.we find merit only in praddy challenge to his conviction on the firearm count.as to that count we reverse and we remand for resentencing de novo on the affirmed counts.
background 
the present prosecution grew out of state and federal investigations of narcotics trafficking in the east flatbush area of brooklyn,new york,in the and.a group that sold marijuana in that area,principally on raleigh place and on church avenue between raleigh place and fairview place,called the raleigh place crew or the crew,was led by raymond edgar dowdie.at trial,the government evidence against praddy,who was also called birdman or bird,chiefly included the testimonies of dowdie and of hayden mcquilkin,one of praddy marijuana customers,along with audio and recordings of praddy selling marijuana to mcquilkin on several occasions.
dowdie testified that he had begun selling marijuana with others in the raleigh place area also referred to as the block in the.see trial transcript tr,at.in the mid a person with whom he had been selling passed away dowdie testified,on the day he passed away i just took over the block and appointed certain individuals to work with me.id.at.dowdie identified about a dozen persons who worked with him in selling marijuana,including praddy codefendant kiond jones kiond,someone named joe,praddy cousin lindsey breeden lindsey,and bird for a period of time.id.
dowdie described the raleigh place operation as one run by a group that was not rigidly hierarchical.there were some who were simply considered workers but all of the other crew members were considered to be bosses.tr.kiond and joe served as dowdie lieutenants see id.at,and were bosses see id.at.in general,the members of the raleigh place crew were persons who lived or had grown up on the block,and most of them were considered bosses.see id.as bosses,the crew members had discretion to choose the sources for the marijuana they sold they were not required to buy from dowdie.see id.at.
dowdie organized the crew members into teams to work in three shifts,usually manned by two persons,although sometimes a crew member would work alone.see tr.the first shift was roughly from to noon,the second was in the afternoon,and the third ran from the evening until late at night.see id.shanell james,one of the crew customers who lived on raleigh place,testified that the crew generally did not sell from about to see id.at,because a lot of kids were getting out of school around then and more patrols of cops were in the area id.at.
for the periods when crew shifts were selling,the crew was protective of its control over the raleigh place area.dowdie testified,we consider ed it was our block w e all controlled the block.tr.although people who lived on the block were allowed to sell marijuana there even if they were not members of the raleigh place crew see,id.at,and others,interlopers were allowed to sell there during the crew off hours see,id.at,crew members exchanged information as to who was selling on the block see id.at,and interlopers were run off the block id.at see id.at.some interlopers who attempted to sell on the block during the crew selling hours were dealt with more harshly.dowdie testified,for example,that he,with the assistance of joe and others,had kidnaped such an interloper,and dowdie him as punishment for selling on the block.see id.at.mcquilkin testified that he heard praddy and lindsey tell an interloper named kevon simon,who was called belize,to stop selling on the block and that shortly thereafter mcquilkin saw lindsey summon belize out of a store to the sidewalk and saw praddy shoot belize.see id.at.
dowdie testified that from the mid until mid,he and the others working with him who included praddy,as described in greater detail in part ii below sold thousands of pounds of marijuana.id.at.
praddy admitted at trial that he had sold marijuana from when he was years old until he was arrested in june see tr,and that he had made the marijuana sales to mcquilkin that were captured on audiotape and videotape see id.at.praddy testified,however,that he was only an occasional seller,responding to calls he received from wouldbe buyers.see,id.at.he testified that he bought marijuana from dowdie some five or six times,and never more than three or four ounces at a time see id.at that he bought marijuana from his codefendant kiond jones m aybe once or twice id.at that he had bought marijuana from joe see id.at and that he bought from other suppliers beyond the raleigh place area see id.at.praddy testified that his marijuana sales over the years totaled no more than some five or six pounds.see id.at.he testified that he worked alone and did not sell marijuana with anyone.see id.at.praddy also essentially denied that he had shot belize.see id.at.
ii.the narcotics and rico convictions 
as indicated above,the jury found praddy guilty not only of distributing marijuana but also of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana count four,and of conducting or participating in the conduct of a rico drug distribution enterprise,and of conspiring to do so counts one and two,respectively.praddy challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support those convictions.
the standard of review with respect to sufficiency challenges is well established.the defendant bears the heavy burden of show ing that no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states caracappa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor.see id.c hoices between competing inferences and a ssessments of witness credibility lie solely within the province of the jury.united states payne,cir.the jury is free to believe part,and to disbelieve part,of any given witness testimony.see,united states gleason,cir jury is entitled to believe a witness in whole or in part,cert.denied.w here there are conflicts in the testimony,we must defer to the jury resolution of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.united states miller,cir,cert.denied.we must affirm so long as the jury,drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence,may fairly and logically have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states.buck,cir internal quotation marks omitted.these principles apply whether the evidence being reviewed is direct or circumstantial.see glasser united states,overruled on other grounds by bourjaily united states.
praddy membership in the marijuana distribution conspiracy 
it is unlawful to conspire to,inter alia,distribute controlled substances such as marijuana.see.the essence of the crime of conspiracy,of course,is the agreement to commit one or more unlawful acts.united states jones,cir quoting braverman united states,emphasis ours,cert.denied.the coconspirators need not have agreed on the details of the conspiracy,so long as they agreed on the essential nature of the plan.united states berger,cir quoting united states maldonado rivera,cir,cert.denied.nor need the goals of all the participants be congruent for a single conspiracy to exist,so long as the participants agree on the essential nature of the enterprise and their goals are not at cross purposes.united states beech nut nutrition,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,see,united states heinemann,cir,cert.denied.
in challenging his conviction on count four,conspiracy to distribute marijuana,praddy does not contend that the government failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy to distribute marijuana in the raleigh place area.rather,he contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly became a member of that conspiracy.although praddy testified that he sold marijuana only occasionally tr,in response to telephone calls asking if he had any to sell see id.at,and that he did not work with anyone not with dowdie,or joe,or lindsey,or kiond see id.at,there was ample evidence to the contrary.
dowdie testified that he and praddy among others worked together.id.at.praddy whose grandmother lived on raleigh place,and with whom praddy sometimes stayed was regarded as living on raleigh place or having grown up on the block,and was thus allowed to sell on the block.see id.at.dowdie sold marijuana to praddy from time to time,sometimes supplying it to him on consignment.see id.at.praddy and his cousin lindsey informed dowdie about interlopers who were poaching on the crew territory.see id.at.
dowdie testified that praddy sold marijuana in front of the barbershop on church avenue,and that praddy chose that location in order to minimize the possibility that his grandparents would see him selling drugs.see tr.dowdie testified that praddy and lindsey worked together selling marijuana on church avenue o n a daily basis.id.at.
dowdie,kiond,and joe all worked together.shanell james testified that he saw them conducting transactions and giving orders and,you know,collecting money and passing packages back and forth id.at mcquilkin,who peddled bootleg dvds on the block for hours at a time see id.at,testified that he observed dowdie giving marijuana to other people,including joe and kiond,to sell.praddy,who testified that he had bought marijuana from dowdie some five or six times see id.at,also listed joe and kiond among the four or five persons from whom he bought marijuana see,id.at.
mcquilkin,in,observed that the crew worked in shifts,and he testified that praddy was sometimes a member of a shift team from six in the morning till,right,dre will work.after he finished,then you have it could be lindsey and birdman come on that day,it could be kiond and d,devon come on that day.it could be josh and somebody else or it could be one of them by himself.id.at.
mcquilkin himself bought marijuana from praddy he saw other people buying marijuana from praddy he saw praddy selling marijuana four to five times a week on raleigh place,rather than on church avenue.see tr.he also saw praddy with dowdie,kiond,joe,and numerous others id.at most of whom dowdie had identified as members of the crew see,id.at.mcquilkin testified that he saw praddy and kiond together selling marijuana l ike four,five times a week id.at,e very week id,selling marijuana hundreds of times id.at.h undreds,he said,was not an exaggeration.id.
praddy contends that the testimony of mcquilkin should be entirely disregarded.he bases this contention on the facts that count eleven of the superseding indictment charged that praddy had murdered belize,that mcquilkin testified that he saw praddy shoot belize,and that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on count eleven,and on the further fact that when praddy was thereafter retried for that alleged murder he was acquitted.the contention that mcquilkin testimony should be disregarded is factually and legally meritless.first,the superseding indictment alleged the fact that praddy killed belize intentionally.the shooting occurred at about on a public street in front of an open store see id.at,in plain view of those present or passing by see,id.at.at trial,dowdie testified that he had quizzed praddy about the shooting of belize,and praddy told him that belize had tried to grab praddy gun and had been shot accidentally.see id.at.thus,in light of all the evidence,the jury plainly did not need to reject mcquilkin testimony that he saw praddy shoot belize in order to find itself unable to determine whether in fact that shooting was intentional.second,as a matter of law,as discussed above,a jury is entitled to believe parts and disbelieve other parts of a given witness testimony.thus,even if the jury did not credit mcquilkin testimony about witnessing praddy shoot belize,it was entitled to credit mcquilkin testimony as to praddy activities.
in sum,the evidence at trial included testimony that praddy and dowdie worked together,with dowdie selling or consigning marijuana to praddy,and praddy informing dowdie of interlopers on the block that praddy also bought marijuana from dowdie lieutenants that praddy and lindsey sold marijuana on church avenue on a daily basis that praddy also sold marijuana four or five times a week on raleigh place and that praddy and one of dowdie lieutenants worked together selling marijuana hundreds of times.the evidence was plainly sufficient to permit a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that praddy was a knowing member of the raleigh place crew conspiracy to distribute marijuana.
praddy participation in the conduct of the rico enterprise 
on the rico counts,counts one and two,praddy was convicted of violating c and d.those subsections provide in pertinent part as follows 
c it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity 
d it shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection c of this section.
c,d emphases added.rico defines enterprise to include any union or group of individuals associated in fact,id.it defines racketeering activity,to include federal drug trafficking felonies,id.when read in conjunction with the language of c,rico conspiracy provision d proscribes an agreement to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.united states viola,cir,abrogated on other grounds by salinas united states.
in reves ernst young,the supreme court interpreted subsection c as follows 
in order to participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs,in violation of c,one must have some part in directing those affairs.of course,the word participate makes clear that rico liability is not limited to those with primary responsibility for the enterprise affairs,just as the phrase directly or indirectly makes clear that rico liability is not limited to those with a formal position in the enterprise,but some part in directing the enterprise affairs is required.
reves,at footnote omitted second some emphasized in original other emphases added.thus,to be convicted of violating c,the government must prove that the defendant participate d in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.reves,at emphasis added.
the indictments in the present case charged that the raleigh place crew was a rico enterprise,that is,a group of individuals associated in fact,functioning as a continuing unit,for the purpose of selling drugs in the raleigh place area.in challenging his convictions on counts one and two,praddy does not contend that the government failed to prove that the crew constituted such an enterprise.rather,he contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he played some part in the operation or management of the enterprise praddy brief on appeal at internal quotation marks omitted or that he knowingly entered into an agreement to participate in the conduct of the enterprise.we reject these contentions as well.
the evidence discussed above in part,which sufficed to prove that praddy was a member of the conspiracy to distribute marijuana in the raleigh place area,likewise sufficed to prove that he was a member of the rico enterprise.in addition,there was sufficient evidence to show that praddy was not merely a member of the enterprise,a worker who simply followed the orders of others,but was instead one who participated in,and conspired to participate in,the operation of the enterprise.dowdie testified that most members of the raleigh place crew were bosses all collaborating on controlling the block and excluding interlopers who would sell during the crew selling hours tr,all having the authority to give orders to those crew members who were workers see id.at and all having discretion to choose their own marijuana suppliers see id.at.dowdie testified that praddy did not work for dowdie id.at,but rather worked with him id.at,and that praddy was one of the bosses see,id.at.praddy,in selling the marijuana he had purchased,was selling independently,with dowdie awareness of praddy selling activities.see id.
praddy himself testified that he had suppliers other than dowdie and dowdie lieutenants,and that praddy alone decided where and from whom to purchase the marijuana he would resell.tr.we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that praddy was a member of the marijuana distribution conspiracy,that he had discretion with respect to his choice of suppliers and his selling locations,and that he agreed to,and did,participate in the operation of the rico marijuana distribution enterprise.we thus affirm praddy convictions on counts one and two.
iii.the firearm conviction 
on count fourteen,praddy was convicted of possessing a firearm during and in relation to his participation in the raleigh place marijuana trafficking conspiracy,in violation of c a,a conviction that subjected him to a term of imprisonment that was required to be served consecutively to his prison term on the other counts,see id.c a i.although there was clear evidence that praddy possessed a gun during and in relation to his marijuana selling activity in see tr.police officer testifying that when he arrested praddy,who was carrying a backpack,the officer found in the backpack a gun and ziplock bags of marijuana,praddy contends that his prosecution on count fourteen was barred by the statute of limitations.we agree.
the statute of limitations on a c offense is five years.see a.in connection with the present case,praddy was first arrested in june and was first charged with possession of a firearm in the superseding indictment filed in july.at trial,praddy and the government stipulated that he had been arrested in april,had pleaded guilty to a new york state gun possession charge,and spent a year in prison for that conviction.the government presented no evidence as to praddy possession of a gun after his arrest in.
despite proffering no evidence that praddy possessed a gun within five years prior to the july filing of the superseding indictment charging praddy with the c offense,the government contends that the charge was timely.pointing out that the statute of limitations on a given offense does not begin to run until the offense is complete,the government argues that conspiracy is a continuing offense and that this court ruled in united states payne,cir payne,that possession of a gun during and in relation to a narcotics conspiracy is therefore itself a continuing offense that does not end until the conspiracy ends.see government brief on appeal at.
neither payne nor reason supports the government position in its case against praddy.in payne,the jury had found that payne used or carried a gun within the period prior to the commencement of the prosecution.see at.payne invoked the statute of limitations with regard to sentencing,arguing that he should not have been subject to an enhanced sentence for discharging the gun,see c a iii requiring the imposition in addition to the punishment provided for the underlying crime of a year term of imprisonment if the firearm was discharged,because there was no evidence that,within the five years prior to prosecution,while he carried the gun,the gun had been discharged,see at.we rejected payne challenge,stating as follows 
conspiracy is a continuing offense a continuing offense is,in general,one that involves a prolonged course of conduct its commission is not complete until the conduct has run its course.when a defendant is convicted of violating c a for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime that is a continuing offense,the c crime itself is a continuing offense in our view,c does not define a offense when a firearm is used during and in relation to a continuing crime of violence.
because the narcotics distribution conspiracy that was a predicate of payne firearms offense was a continuing crime,payne firearms offense was likewise a continuing offense,rather than a offense.and because brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors to be found by the judge,not offense elements to be found by the jury,harris united states,the district court could properly consider,in determining payne appropriate sentence,whether payne discharged a firearm at any point during the continuation of his c a offense.
payne,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases added.we also noted that in sentencing a defendant,a district court may properly rely on acts performed outside the period as relevant conduct in calculating the defendant term of imprisonment under the guidelines.see,united states silkowski,cir.
in payne,unlike the case with respect to praddy,there had been no termination of the defendant gun possession by reason of a prior arrest and seizure of the gun.thus,it was within the realm of reason to characterize payne firearm offense as one that continued through the life of the conspiracy.
in the present case,the gun on which the government relies for praddy c conviction was the gun he possessed in.when praddy was arrested in,that gun was taken from him by state law enforcement officers.the government made no effort to prove at trial that praddy possessed any gun thereafter.apparently,it had no such evidence.see government letter to the district court dated january,at the government does not contend that praddy carried a gun continually throughout the entire conspiracy,and in fact the specific instances in which praddy personally possessed a gun occurred,to the government knowledge,in or before.emphasis added.rather,the government contends that simply because praddy possessed the gun in connection with his membership in the raleigh place marijuana conspiracy,his possession of the gun must be deemed to have continued even after the gun was seized from him by the reflected in the presentation by the assistant united states attorney ausa at the oral argument of this appeal oral argument 
judge kearse what the evidence of praddy gun possession within five years prior to the filing of the indictment in this case 
ausa your honor,i submit that the government did not have to prove that he actually possessed a gun within five years of.
judge kearse does that mean that there is no evidence of gun possession during that period 
ausa we did not put forth evidence that he possessed a gun after,when he was apprehended,your honor.
judge kearse you resting the gun possession charge on the gun he possessed earlier,for which he was arrested prior to this five year period 
ausa yes,your honor.
judge kearse and presumably when they arrested him on the gun charge,they took the gun 
ausa yes,your honor.
judge kearse what the sense of imputing to him gun possession after he has been arrested and had the gun seized 
ausa your honor,because he was convicted of a continuing offense.the marijuana distribution conspiracy that was the predicate for the c charge was a continuing crime,and that what this court said in united states payn
