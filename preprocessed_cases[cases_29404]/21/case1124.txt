john scungio was convicted on a plea of guilty to making false statements in violation of.he appeals from his sentence,arguing that the district court erred by sentencing him under the obstruction of justice guideline instead of under the fraud and deceit guideline,see,cmt.and by applying a increase in his offense level on the basis of his special skill of lawyering,see.agreeing that the district court erred,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
at sentencing,the parties stipulated to the factual statement set forth in the presentence report psr because this appeal involves sentencing issues following a guilty plea,we take the background facts from the presentence report that followed defendant conviction.united states brady,cir.
during,the defendant,john scungio,an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of rhode island and florida,represented gail and paul calenda in connection with an appeal to the providence board of tax assessment review btar.the purpose of the appeal was to lower the assessed value,and therefore the taxes,of three properties owned by the calendas in the city of providence.
the chairman of the btar was joseph pannone.pannone recommended the defendant to gail calenda for the purpose of facilitating her appeal.on may,scungio appeared before the btar and made a presentation for a tax reduction on behalf of the calendas.the btar approved a reduction from about to the annual net tax savings was approximately per tax year.
prior to the may,hearing,gail calenda had met with joseph pannone and the of the btar,david ead.the three discussed the upcoming hearing and the resulting reduction.indeed,ead provided the figures for calenda to complete her appeal form and it was those figures which were submitted to the btar.
between the may,hearing and july,pannone told scungio that pannone,ead,and deputy tax assessor rosemary glancy would be splitting a bribe from the calendas in exchange for the reduction.on or about july,gail calenda delivered a check in the amount of to john scungio as a fee for services rendered.at the same time,she delivered an envelope with in cash to the d efendant,john scungio,for delivery to pannone.
scungio delivered the envelope to pannone.pannone told scungio that he would split the money with ead and glancy.pannone then asked for more from scungio which would be pooled with each from ead and pannone.the resulting would be given to rosemary glancy.at first scungio balked at paying the but then relented and gave pannone cash for glancy.
on may,scungio was interviewed by fbi agents beverly bartzer and william rose in the interview,scungio falsely denied that the chairman of the btar,joseph pannone,had received any money for his assistance in the reduction of the calendas taxes,when,in fact,john scungio had delivered a sum of cash,more or less,to pannone from his client to be distributed among pannone,ead,and glancy.
also on may,scungio denied knowing how calenda had learned about and came to hire him when in fact,scungio knew that calenda had been sent to him by the then chairman of the btar.
in addition to the above offense facts,scungio admitted paying pannone in or around for pannone help and referral to scungio of the owner of east side copy who had a tangible tax problem with the city of providence.scungio represented east side copy in front of the btar and in negotiations with city tax assessor,tom rossi 
scungio also admitted paying joseph pannone around for anthony annarino.annarino,the then city tax collector,would waive interest due on overdue tax bills for a cash payment.annarino waived interest due on property owned by scungio.
in or about,scungio paid pannone to give to former tax assessor ted little,for little help obtaining an abatement on property that scungio owned in providence.finally,scungio acknowledged purchasing approximately in friends of cianci campaign tickets from pannone during and.scungio paid cash for the tickets 
at the sentencing hearing,the district court made the two decisions favorable to the government that are the subject of this appeal.the first decision concerned the construction of application note of the fraud and deceit guideline,the guideline that governs the sentence for the offense of making false statements,to which scungio pled guilty.note concludes as follows 
where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction or a stipulation as described in a establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline,apply that guideline rather than.otherwise,in such cases,is to be applied,but a departure from the guidelines may be considered.
cmt.defendant contended that there was no other guideline that more aptly covered his offense of making false statements,and therefore that he should be sentenced under the fraud and deceit guideline.the government argued to the contrary,contending that the facts of record to which defendant had agreed,in addition to constituting the crime of making false statements,establish a violation of the omnibus clause of,which prohibits,in relevant part,corruptly endeavor ing to influence,obstruct,or impede the due administration of justice.as that offense is listed under the obstruction of justice guideline,cmt.statutory provisions,the government argued that the obstruction of justice guideline more aptly cover s scungio offense and he should be sentenced thereunder.
the district court second challenged decision was to apply a enhancement for scungio alleged special skill of lawyering.see directing that if the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,increase offense level by two levels.the psr recommended that this enhancement was appropriate as scungio special skill of lawyering exacerbated his crime.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court agreed with the government on both issues.it sentenced scungio under the guideline relevant to obstruction of justice and it imposed the enhancement,both over defendant objections.after departing downward,the court ordered defendant to serve three years of probation,the first six months to be served in home confinement,and a fine.in considering scungio appeal from both decisions,we review the district court interpretation of the legal meaning and scope of the sentencing guidelines de novo,and the district court factual findings for clear error.see united states santos batista,cir.see also united states henry,cir reviewing de novo the district court determination pursuant to note of that the fraud and deceit guideline more aptly covered defendant offenses than the guideline concerning environmental crimes.
applying the guideline that more aptly cover s defendant offense 
as he did below,scungio now contends that the facts to which he pled guilty and on which the district court relied at sentencing can not,as a matter of law,establish a violation of or any of the other offenses to which the obstruction of justice guideline pertains.see.the obstruction of justice guideline,therefore,can not and does not more aptly cover his offense.the district court did not disagree with scungio contention that the facts to which he pled guilty did not establish the offense of obstructing justice as that is defined by.the court nonetheless determined that defendant crime is more aptly covered by the obstruction of justice guideline because th e phrase obstruction of justice is given a broader meaning in the guidelines than in the statutes.defendant contends that this construction of the guideline was legal error.we agree.
the district court explained its reasoning as follows 
i t seems to me that under the guidelines the most appropriate guideline is the one entitled,obstruction of justice.now that phrase is given a broader meaning in the guidelines than in the statutes.the obstruction of justice statutes prescribe that there shall be penalties for certain types of conduct,and some of it very serious conduct,such as intimidating witnesses and the like.but under the guidelines it has a much broader meaning.for example,it can be an obstructi
