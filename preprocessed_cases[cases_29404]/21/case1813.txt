john doe appeals from an order of conviction and sentence entered on july,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sterling johnson,judge following his guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to import cocaine into the united states in violation of.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,which doe is currently serving,as well as five years of supervised release and a special assessment.on appeal,doe challenges whether the government acted in bad faith in deciding not to file a section motion pursuant to its plea agreement with doe whether judge johnson erred in denying doe motion for a downward departure and whether the district court erroneously determined doe sentence based on drug quantities not specified in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.while the court has addressed the first two issues in a summary order filed separately from this opinion,it gives the third issue more thorough consideration here.although we find that doe indictment failed to charge drug quantity,we do not correct the error because we do not believe the error affected doe substantial rights.we vacate and remand doe sentence,however,finding the sentence to be plain error requiring correction.in this case,the imposition of a sentence above the statutory maximum for an offense involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs based on drug quantities not found beyond a reasonable doubt requires correction to avoid unfairness and damage to the integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings.
on july,john doe was arrested by the united states customs service for his involvement in a conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine into the united states.a confidential informant revealed to government agents that doe had provided to an acquaintance who worked as a customs inspector at jfk international airport in queens,ny,in order to facilitate importation of drugs.doe was indicted under a two count indictment,count one of which provided 
on or about and between july,and july,both dates being approximate and inclusive,within the eastern district of new york and elsewhere,the defendants,together with others,did knowingly and intentionally conspire to import into the united states from a place outside thereof cocaine,a schedule ii narcotic drug controlled substance,in violation of title,united states code,section a.
title,united states code,sections,a and b b ii title,united states code,sections et.
while the indictment did not specify a drug quantity in the text of the first count,one of the code sections listed parenthetically following the text designated the punishment for importation of five kilograms or more of cocaine 
between august and november,the government held a series of proffer sessions with doe.during those sessions,doe revealed his involvement in a scheme to import cocaine,and eventually implicated albert camancho,an acquaintance from the masonic lodge and a customs inspector at jfk international airport,in the plan.these proffer sessions led to the creation of a cooperation agreement between doe and the government on february.under the terms of the agreement,doe agreed to plead guilty to count one of the indictment and acknowledged that the count as charged carried certain statutory penalties including 
maximum term of imprisonment life 
minimum term of imprisonment years 
minimum supervised release term years,maximum supervised release term life 
maximum fine 
doe agreed to the terms of the cooperation agreement including these specified penalties and promised to provide truthful information to the government in exchange for the government promise to drop the indictment remaining counts,not to oppose a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,and to file a motion if doe complied fully with the agreement.
doe appeared before magistrate judge joan azrack on march,for formal plea proceedings.during the plea discussions,doe counsel affirmed that he had informed doe of the minimum and maximum penalties to which doe would be subject under the agreement.doe acknowledged that he had a right to trial and surrendered his trial rights.judge azrack then reviewed the mandatory minimum and potential maximum sentences for count one with doe and accepted doe allocution as to his role in the importation,insuring that the cocaine could get through customs.satisfied that doe was acting voluntarily with a complete understanding of his rights,judge azrack entered a recommendation that the guilty plea be accepted.at no time was the quantity of drugs involved discussed by either party.
doe acted as a witness for the government during the subsequent trial of his albert camancho.although the value of his testimony was subsequently debated at length in relation to the government refusal to enter a motion following the camancho trial,that issue is addressed in a separate summary order and will not be considered here.
the probation department prepared a report for doe on july,recommending that the court find doe accountable for the importation of kilograms of cocaine,generating a total offense level of and a guideline range of to months in june of,after doe had testified at the camancho trial,the government submitted a letter requesting,inter alia,that the quantity of drugs considered for sentencing purposes be increased to over kilograms of cocaine and kilograms of heroin creating a base offense level of based on information doe provided through his testimony at camancho trial,information doe provided to government agents,and testimony of other witnesses at the camancho trial.a july,addendum to the psr incorporated the higher drug quantities and revised the base level recommendation to.this alteration created a total offense level of and a sentencing range of months 
the parties appeared for sentencing before the honorable sterling johnson,on june.after a statement from doe expressing his regret for his crime,judge johnson,apparently adhering to the recommendation of the amended psr,sentenced doe to months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a special assessment.no mention of,or challenge to,the drug quantities supporting the sentence was made during the sentencing hearing.
resolution of doe claim that he was sentenced on drug quantities not alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury as required by apprendi new jersey,d,and united states thomas,cir in banc,requires this court to examine both the indictment supporting doe conviction and the sentence imposed following his guilty plea.
standard of review 
in thomas,this court,in banc,concluded that the failure either to charge drug type and quantity in the indictment or to submit the question of drug type and quantity to the jury is subject to plain error review pursuant to.b when the defendant raised no objection before the district court.at see also united states cotton,d applying plain error review to failure to charge drug quantity in indictment.because doe did not object to the inclusion of the drug quantities at sentencing,or,apparently,in response to the government efforts to amend the psr,this court will apply plain error review to doe arguments raised for the first time on appeal to establish plain error,the court must find an error,that is plain,that affects substantial rights.see johnson united states,d.if an error meets these initial tests,the court engages in a fourth consideration whether or not to exercise its discretion to correct the error.id.at.the plain error should be corrected only if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting united states olano,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.with these standards in mind,we consider individually doe claims regarding the failure to include in the indictment or prove to a jury the drug quantities used to compute his sentence.
b.the indictment 
in apprendi,the supreme court announced that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.in thomas,this court applied apprendi to the federal narcotics law,finding that a fter apprendi,drug type and quantity are elements of the offense under that must be charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury for its finding beyond a reasonable doubt when they raise a potential penalty above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.at see cotton.at addressing omission of drug quantity from indictment as apprendi error.to decide whether the combined rulings of apprendi and thomas make reference to drug quantity only through a parenthetical citation to the penalty provision of b b ii an error,this court must consider whether thomas ruling on drug quantity applies beyond the confines of,and whether parenthetical reference to the statute under which doe was sentenced charged drug quantity in the indictment.to answer these questions,we examine first the similarity of to and then commence our plain error review.
thomas applies to 
this court has applied its in banc ruling in thomas primarily to claims,like the claim in thomas,arising under b.see,united states outen,cir united states mclean,cir united states yu,cir united states white,cir see also cotton.at reviewing for plain error failure to charge drug quantity in indictment.the structure of,however,mirrors that of so as to make application of thomas to charges under only logical.both and operate through two distinct initial declaration of unlawful acts and a subsequent outline of appropriate penalties.section a declares unlawful conduct related to the manufacture distribution of drugs 
a unlawful acts 
except as authorized by this subchapter,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally 
to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance or 
to create,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to distribute or dispense,a counterfeit substance.
section a similarly outlines unlawful acts regarding drug importation 
a unlawful acts 
any person who 
contrary to section,or of this title,knowingly or intentionally imports or exports a controlled substance,
contrary to section of this title,knowingly or intentionally brings or possesses on board a vessel,aircraft,or vehicle a controlled substance,or 
contrary to section of this title,manufactures,possesses with intent to distribute,or distributes a controlled substance,
shall be punished as provided in subsection b of this section.
while the substantive crimes vary between the two provisions,the provisions have parallel structures.more importantly,the penalty provisions that follow in each statute subsection b adhere to practically identical,punishment schedules.b a,for instance,punishes any violation of subsection a involving kilograms or more of cocaine with years to life in prison and a fine of up to likewise,b b punishes a violation of its subsection a involving kilograms or more of cocaine with an identical years to life imprisonment and a fine of up to.the parallel punishment scheme continues at the level of grams of cocaine,punishing violation of either statute subsection a with a prison term of between and years and a fine of up to,see b b ii ii b b ii,and continues even where quantity is undetermined,punishing a violation of the statute substantive subsection a for an unquantified amount of drugs with a prison sentence of up to years and a fine up to,see b c b although the statutes employ slightly different numbering systems,the structure of the two statutes,both in their division of substantive prohibitions from penalty provisions and in the allotment of penalties by quantity of narcotics involved,are entirely parallel in light of the nature of the two provisions,we find it appropriate to extend thomas ruling under,that drug quantity relevant to assigning punishment under subsection b greater than the statutory maximum for unquantified offenses is an element of the offense under apprendi that must be charged in the indictment and proven to the jury beyond reasonable doubt,to.we hold that thomas applies to consideration of a sentence imposed under the provisions of b as well as under the provisions of.
was charged in the indictment 
as previously described,doe indictment alleged in the text of count one a knowing and intentional conspiracy to import cocaine into the united states in violation of a.the indictment followed this initial charge with a parenthetical noting the provisions under which doe could face,a,and b b ii and the statutory guidelines for imposition of that sentence as to imprisonment,supervised release,and et.the only statute described and cited in the text,a,provides that i t shall be unlawful to import into the united states from any place outside thereof,any controlled substance in schedule i or ii.beyond exempting certain small quantities of otherwise controlled substances as deemed necessary for medical,scientific,or other legitimate purposes,a,the statute makes no reference to drug quantity.thus,no provision appears in the text of the indictment.in the attached parenthetical,only b b ii,uses quantity to determine the fate of the party convicted for conspiracy to import narcotics that section provides that the penalty for a violation of a in an offense involving or more kilograms of a substance containing cocaine shall be not less than years and not more than life.by contrast,under subsection b of,a person convicted of conspiracy to import drugs under a for whose crime no drug quantity is established faces a maximum sentence of years and no minimum sentence.b.thus,if the parenthetical notation in doe indictment did not properly charge doe with a particular drug quantity,doe should have been subject to a sentence of not more than years rather than facing a minimum of years and a maximum of life.doe final sentence,months,exceeds the statutory maximum for an unquantified drug offense under b by almost two years creating a potential violation of apprendi and thomas if the parenthetical reference to b b ii did not properly charge drug quantity.
inclusion of drug quantity only through a parenthetical reference to b b ii was error.
the indictment at issue in thomas alleged only that thomas and others did knowingly,willfully and unlawfully combine,conspire,confederate and agree among themselves and with others,to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute a quantity of cocaine,a schedule ii controlled substance and a quantity of cocaine base,also known as crack cocaine,a schedule ii controlled substance,in violation of united states code,a.in violation of title,united states code.thomas,at.the text of the indictment did not include a specific drug quantity,nor did either of the referenced statutory provisions impose penalties based on findings of specific amounts of drugs.see a.in doe case,the indictment,albeit in a parenthetical,specifically referred to the provision punishing importation of kilograms or more of cocaine b b ii.while slightly more instructive than the indictment in thomas,we conclude that under the law of this circuit,doe indictment nevertheless fails to charge drug quantity.
this circuit has long held that citation to a statutory section alone is not sufficient to cure a defective indictment that fails to allege all the elements of an offense,united states hernandez,cir citing united states berlin,cir see also united states wright,cir per curiam finding reference to statute alone likely insufficient to allege substantial bodily harm to victim in carjacking indictment where the supreme court had ruled that resulting in bodily harm comprised an offense separate from that of simple united states,cir considering reference to statute insufficient to cure failure to include arrest in indictment for illegal reentry chiu united states,fb,wl,at april,treating,without discussion,a similar parenthetical notation as a failure to include the quantity in the indictment for thomas purposes.this circuit has allowed a lone statutory citation to charge an element of a crime only when,despite the omission of the element itself from the indictment text,a reading of the indictment in its entirety allowed inference of the final element.see hernandez,at.in hernandez,however,the citation to the statutory provision which included the omitted element,intent to distribute,appeared in the text of the indictment.id.furthermore,the language of the indictment,charging knowing and intentional possession of a large amount of heroin,described conduct comprising the offense under the same statutory provision from which the element was omitted.id.doe indictment,however,did not omit some aspect of cocaine importation in violation of,the charge discussed and cited in the text.the offense of importation of controlled substances under,unlike the possession offense in hernandez,was complete as charged in the text of doe indictment.instead,doe indictment confined to a parenthetical string citation the sole suggestion of the quantity of drugs involved in the offense,an amount that did not alter the physical act of importation with which doe was charged,but did affect the penalty to which he would be subject for that act.as neither the omitted quantity element of doe intended charge,nor the fact that an element was omitted,could be inferred from the text of the of either required consideration of the subsequent parenthetical and outside find this case distinguishable from hernandez.
we recognize that the seventh circuit has allowed a statutory reference to charge the drug quantity element of an offense where it believed that,despite the failure to charge quantity in the text of the indictment,the defendant could not understand th e allegation of a year of distribution activity in a large area to involve only minute amounts of cocaine.see united states westmoreland,cir.as doe indictment specified activity only between july,and july,however,we find that unlike the westmoreland defendant,doe had little reason to assume that the quantity of drugs involved in his offense would be of any certain magnitude or that the indeterminate quantity provisions of b would not apply to his case thus,we find westmoreland justification for its inference regarding the missing indictment element inapplicable to this case.
we also note that a few cases have found,on habeas review under,that where a statutory reference served only to alert a party to a drug penalty provision,rather than to describe the substantive conduct supporting the elements of the crime charged,such a reference satisfies thomas.see grajales united states,no.cv rr,wl,at march,herrera united states,d.we believe,however,that in light of this circuit refusal to allow an element of an offense to be charged by statutory citation alone,especially where,as here,neither the omission of an element,nor the nature of that element can be inferred with certainty from the text of the indictment,failure to include drug quantity in the indictment other than in a parenthetical string citation was error.
our conclusion that doe indictment did not properly charge drug quantity reflects the reasoning supporting apprendi and thomas.apprendi and thomas made drug quantity an element of an offense where it extends a defendant sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.apprendi,at.thomas,at.neither case suggested that this newly identified element could be charged less explicitly than other,traditional offense elements.as we do not read thomas to have created a new class of offense elements,but rather to have identified drug quantity as an element of the offense in cases in which the quantity will raise punishment beyond the otherwise prescribed statutory maximum,we will not treat drug quantity differently than other elements of a charged offense.in this case,where drug quantity was implicated only by a parenthetical reference to the applicable penalty provision,we find the indictment in error.
b.the error was plain.
having found error in the indictment failure to charge drug quantity under the law of this circuit,we find that error plain.as this court noted in thomas,an error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.thomas,at quoting johnson united states,d.as thomas established,drug quantity is an element of an offense under and,for the reasons discussed above,under the parallel provisions of that,when it raises the penalty above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum,must be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury for proof beyond reasonable doubt.id.at.the omission of a clear charge on drug quantity in the indictment,viewed from today perspective,is plain error.
c.the error did not violate doe substantive rights.
although we find the inclusion of drug quantity only through a parenthetical citation was plain error,we do not believe that the error substantially affected doe substantive rights.although,as discussed in the previous section,we find parenthetical citation to a quantity provision insufficient to charge drug quantity in light of thomas,we must look to the actual impact of this indictment flaw on this defendant to decide whether the error violated doe substantial rights.
indictments are governed by federal rule of criminal procedure c.rule c provides that an indictment shall be a plain,concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.c.this court has interpreted rule c to find sufficient an indictment that,read liberally,informs the defendant of the charges against him.see united states de la pava,cir united states pirro,cir.by informing the defendant of the charges he faces,the indictment protects the defendant from double jeopardy and allows the defendant to prepare his defense.see united states dhinsa,cir pirro,at.
in this case,despite the indictment insufficiency under apprendi and,doe clearly had notice of the penalty provisions to which he was subject.doe cooperation agreement with the government identified in an extended format the levels of punishment that would apply to doe if he pled guilty or was convicted under the indictment.alongside its designations of the maximum and minimum prison terms,term of supervised release,and potential fine,the agreement explicitly referenced b b ii.doe was advised again of these terms,all dependant on application of the provisions of b b ii,in his plea hearing before the magistrate judge.furthermore,doe expressly acknowledged months as the estimated sentencing guideline range,a range clearly permitting sentencing above the maximum for unquantified,b offenses.these statements in the cooperation agreement and at the plea hearing,even absent a proper charge in the indictment,assured that prior to entry of his guilty plea,doe understood that his punishment was not governed by the provision for undetermined quantities of cocaine,but by the more stringent,standard noted parenthetically in his indictment.although at the time of doe plea,this court had not designated drug quantity as an element of the offense where it raised the penalty beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum,doe was that proof of drug quantity at least above five kilograms would have a significant impact on his penalty if convicted.as doe was alerted to these distinctions repeatedly before entering his guilty plea,we find that the purposes of the indictment,notice and protection from double jeopardy,were served,preventing the plain error in his indictment from affecting doe substantial rights 
discretion 
even if doe substantial rights were violated by the error in the indictment,we would decline to exercise our discretion to remedy the error.because doe his cooperation agreement,at his plea hearing,and at awareness of the potential sentencing implications of his guilty plea,we do not believe that the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings were affected by the indictment error in this case.
proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
the second aspect of doe challenge to his sentence arises from the requirement that drug quantity,when raising punishment beyond the statutory maximum for an offense involving an indeterminate amount of drugs,must be submitted to a jury for a finding beyond a reasonable doubt 
failure to properly establish drug quantity was an error.
because doe plead guilty to the crimes charged in his indictment,drug quantity was not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury.furthermore,as doe indictment did not properly charge drug quantity,the fact of his plea alone can not be construed to convey an admission of drug quantity.any findings regarding drug quantity at sentencing would have been made under the preponderance of the evidence standard normally governing sentencing considerations thus,the judge sentencing decisions can not be construed as findings beyond a reasonable doubt and in any event were not findings by a jury based on these observations,it appears that doe sentence was not imposed after a finding on drug quantity by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,creating error under the standard.this court has recently found,however,that in a guilty plea setting,error may be avoided even absent a beyond a reasonable doubt conclusion as to drug quantity if the defendant has given an allocution that settles the issue of drug quantity.united states yu,cir.
in yu,this court considered a challenge under apprendi to a sentence from a defendant who,while pleading guilty to an indictment that properly alleged drug quantities,refused to allocute as to quantity at his plea hearing.id.without a plea agreement or any stipulation as to drug quantity,yu pleaded guilty to a three count indictment for conspiring to distribute and possessing with intent to distribute heroin.at his plea allocution,yu was advised of the mandatory minimum sentences he could face on each count as determined by the drug quantities involved in his crimes and his prior felony conviction.id.at.although yu pleaded guilty,he refused to allocute as to the quantities of drugs involved,explaining that while he was willing to admit his role in the distribution conspiracy,he preferred to have the weight of the drugs determined at sentencing.id.yu received a sentence of months,the mandatory minimum level established in b a based on the quantity of drugs involved in yu crime and his prior felony conviction.
after the supreme court issued its decision in apprendi,yu appealed his sentence challenging the use of the mandatory minimum sentence absent a beyond a reasonable doubt finding on drug quantity.in vacating and remanding yu sentence,this court held that a ny sentence under the penalty provisions of b must be based either on an allocution that settles the issue of drug quantity or on a finding as to that issue by a applying a standard.id.at.although the court concluded that no beyond a reasonable doubt finding had been made,it refused to simply order the district court to resentence yu under b c,the penalty provision for undetermined drug quantities,because the indictment to which yu had plead had specifically identified drug quantities.id.at yu is not entitled to plead guilty to an indictment charging a violation of sections b a and b and then be sentenced under section b c,as he would have been if a jury had decided the drug quantity issue in his favor.instead,the court vacated and remanded the sentence,leaving to the district court the determinations of,inter alia,whether yu should be allowed to withdraw his plea,whether the government would acquiesce to a sentence under the unquantified provisions of b c,or whether yu would seek a jury trial on the quantity issue.id.
in light of the yu decision,we examine doe plea allocution to determine whether doe allocution settle d the issue of drug quantity so as to avoid a finding of error on appeal 
a.the plea allocution 
in his cooperation agreement,doe agreed to plead guilty to count one as follows in relevant part 
the defendant will plead guilty to count one of the indictment charging him with conspiring to import cocaine into the united states,in violation of.the count carries the following statutory penalties 
maximum term of imprisonment life 
minimum term of imprisonment years 
minimum supervised release term years,maximum supervised release term life 
maximum fine 
during the plea hearing,doe acknowledged in response to the judge questions the terms of imprisonment potentially attached to his arising from the provisions of b b ii.doe did not,however,admit to or otherwise specifically address drug quantities in his plea allocution.despite his acknowledgment of the punishments assigned by b b ii to importation of kilograms or more of cocaine,doe did not make any statements on drug quantity related to his own indicted crime.without discussion of quantity relating specifically to doe,doe allocution simply did not settle the issue of drug quantity as yu requires.yu,at.even though doe,unlike yu,did not attempt to reserve the drug quantity issue for debate before the sentencing judge,this court finds that the absence of direct reference to drug quantity in doe allocution prevents the allocution from settl ing the issue of drug quantity for doe plea.since doe plea allocution did not settle drug quantity,and since,as we concluded above,drug quantity was not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury,his sentence under b b ii is in error.
the error is plain.
having concluded that the district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to b b ii in excess of the statutory maximum for unquantified drug offenses without a stipulation,allocution,or determination of drug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt,we find the error plain in light of our recent decisions in thomas and yu.yu,at thomas,at.
the error affects substantial rights.
as we have discussed above,apprendi and thomas have established doe constitutional right to have the drug quantity which would invoke a sentence under b b ii determined by a jury under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.doe could,of course,waive that right by entry of a guilty plea during which he stipulated or allocuted to drug quantity.however,at the time of the plea in this case,neither apprendi nor thomas had been decided and the courts had universally treated the graduated penalty provisions of as sentencing provisions rather than as elements of the crime.nothing in the plea allocution or the sentencing in this case suggests that doe was aware of and waived his right to beyond a reasonable doubt proof as to drug quantity.it is possible that he acknowledged the applicability of a ten sentence believing that the government only had to prove quantity to the judge by a preponderance of the evidence which was done and not contested by doe.the result,however,was an increase in the sentence of imprisonment of almost two years.we conclude that under the circumstances,doe substantial rights have been affected.
discretion 
unlike the error in doe indictment,we find that the error in doe sentence should be noticed and corrected at this stage because failure to correct it would seriously affect the fairness and public reputation of judicial proceedings.apprendi and its progeny place a new burden on the government to treat as elements of a crime anything that may extend a defendant sentence beyond a statutory maximum sentence.to allow a sentence even months beyond the statutory maximum to remain in place in face of apprendi and this court applications of apprendi in thomas and yu would demonstrate a disregard for the protections given to a defendant by apprendi and thomas,undermining the fairness of the proceedings.after apprendi and thomas,a defendant has a constitutional right to have drug quantity that will raise his sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum established by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
a.in the absence of overwhelming evidence of drug quantity,we will correct the error.
after this court heard oral argument in this case,the supreme court issued a decision in united states cotton applying plain error review to the appeal of defendants sentenced under b quantity based provisions,rather than under c for unquantified offenses,despite the omission of drug quantity from their indictment.at.in reversing the fourth circuit conclusion that the failure to charge drug quantity in the indictment deprived the court of jurisdiction to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum for offenses involving an indeterminate amount of drugs,the court found the evidence of drug quantity that had been
