josé padilla was charged with one count of possession with intent to distribute grams of cocaine base,or crack,in violation of a,b b iii.pursuant to a plea agreement,padilla pled guilty and waived his right to appeal.at sentencing the district court determined that padilla did not qualify for the safety valve provision,f,and thus was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.on appeal,padilla argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not meet the requirements of the safety valve,and that,despite the waiver,the plea agreement does not bar his appeal.applying the test established in united states teeter,cir,we find that the waiver of appeal is invalid.however,because the district court did not err in denying padilla the benefit of the safety valve,we affirm the sentence.
where an appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.united states mercedes mercedes,cir.in this case we also rely on the signed statement of facts accompanying the appellant plea agreement.see united states,cir.
after receiving a telephone call from a source claiming that padilla was armed and stored weapons for another individual,puerto rico police surveilled his property on january and.on both occasions,they observed padilla carrying a weapon in his waistband on the second occasion,they saw him holding a bag from which the barrel of a rifle was protruding.he was also observed getting into and out of his car,a white suzuki vitara.on february,police executed a search warrant for padilla home and car.while searching the vehicle,officers discovered a gym bag containing vials of crack and rounds of caliber ammunition.
on may,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against padilla,charging him with possession with intent to distribute several controlled substances.at arraignment,padilla pled not guilty and then moved to suppress the evidence recovered in the search of his car.after the district court denied the motion,padilla and the government executed a plea agreement on november.under its terms,the government promised to move to dismiss the indictment.padilla would then plead guilty to an information charging him with one count of possession with intent to distribute grams of crack.padilla also agreed not to appeal his sentence,as long as the district court accept ed the plea agreement and sentence d him according to its terms and conditions.
based on the quantity and kind of drugs recovered,the plea agreement calculated padilla base offense level under the sentencing guidelines as,but identified reductions for acceptance of responsibility and compliance with the safety valve,resulting in an adjusted base offense level of.the agreement then stated,
a total base offense level of and a criminal history category i results in a guideline sentencing range of months.in the event the defendant fails to comply with all of the provisions of the safety valve,the adjusted base offense level remains at which has a corresponding imprisonment range of months.as the parties are aware,however,for possession of five grams or more of cocaine base the statutory penalty is not less than five years imprisonment.
shortly thereafter,the agreement specified the safety valve requirements and noted,should defendant meet all the requirements of the safety valve provisions,defendant base offense level shall be reduced by two levels.
a hearing was held on november.at the hearing,the magistrate judge inquired into padilla understanding of the sentencing recommendation.at the magistrate request,an assistant united states attorney explained the sentencing guidelines calculation and the maximum penalties possible for the offense,including the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.he discussed the safety valve reduction,explaining,
should padilla comply with all of the provisions of the safety valve,he is also looking at an additional two point reduction the defendant understands that should he fail to meet safety valve,then of course he is looking at a base offense level of all of that notwithstanding judge,there is a five years sic mandatory minimum 
the magistrate judge confirmed that padilla understood the explanation,asking,
do you understand that in order to be entitled to the two level reduction under the safet sic valve,you shall comply with five requirements,as stated in paragraph nine of your plea agreement,including the requirement that you must have provided truthful information to the government prior to sentencing 
padilla answered affirmatively.
the magistrate judge inquired into padilla understanding of his waiver of appellate rights.after identifying the waiver and reading its terms to padilla,she asked,are you aware that depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence it eventually imposes,both you and the government may appeal the sentence in this case subject to that waver sic padilla said he was so aware,and then entered his guilty plea.the magistrate judge found that padilla knew the terms of the plea agreement and had entered it in an intelligent and voluntary manner.see.b.she filed her report and recommendation on december,recommending that the district court accept padilla guilty plea.on december,the district court accepted the plea.
in april,two dea agents and an assistant united states attorney interviewed padilla as part of the safety valve process.during the interview,padilla told the agents that he did not own the gym bag seized from his car in the february,search.he had stolen it the night before,he said,from the trunk of an abandoned car,where it had been stored by local drug dealers who owed him money.padilla had previously observed the dealers place drugs and money in a bag and hide the bag in the car trunk.believing that the bag would contain money,he retrieved it from the trunk instead,it contained only drugs and ammunition.padilla did not know what to do with the contraband,and the next morning it was seized by police.before the interview ended,the assistant united states attorney expressed some skepticism to padilla about his story.
in a sealed motion filed with the district court soon after,the government indicated that it found padilla testimony not totally truthful.several of padilla claims,prosecutors said,lacked credibility that he stole the gym bag from drug dealers,that he had never possessed it before being arrested by puerto rico police,and that he had never sold drugs or possessed a weapon.the claims conflicted with the sworn affidavit of a puerto rico police officer,agent héctor agent figueroa,who had surveilled padilla in january.because padilla had not been totally truthful,the government said,he did not qualify for the safety valve reduction.in his response,padilla emphasized that he had provided extensive detail to the government agents about how he knew where the bag was,what it might contain,and who owned it.he pointed out that his story was consistent with other facts in the record and was corroborated in part by the dea agents present at the safety valve interview.in contrast,padilla claimed,the government had produced no evidence proving that he had been untruthful.prosecutors simply found his story hard to believe.
on june,the district court issued a sealed order finding padilla ineligible for safety valve benefits.the court observed that padilla had had trouble with his version of the facts since his interview with the probation officer,one month before the safety valve debriefing.padilla had changed several parts of his story in response to questions raised by the probation officer.padilla repeated the changed story to the dea agents and the assistant united states attorney during his safety valve interview.moreover,the story contradicted the sworn affidavit of agent figueroa.
at his sentencing hearing on august,padilla moved the district court to reconsider its order denying him the benefit of the safety valve.in response to the court concern that padilla story contradicted the sworn testimony of a police officer,padilla emphasized that he had long maintained that agent figueroa lied in the affidavit,having moved on those grounds to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his car.moreover,padilla insisted that he had only clarified his story in response to doubts from the probation officer,not changed it.as early as february,after he was arrested,and may,in his preliminary hearing,padilla had stated that he stole the bag containing the same testimony he provided in the safety valve interview.finding nothing new in padilla request,the court denied the motion.
before sentencing padilla,the court returned to his waiver of appeal.it noted,
padilla,although you pled guilty and pursuant to the terms of your plea agreement you waived your right to appeal the judgment and the sentence imposed in this case,the court advises you that you can appeal your conviction if you believe that your plea of guilty was unlawful or involuntary,or if there is some other fundamental defect in the proceedings that was not waived by your plea agreement.
the court then sentenced padilla to the statutory mandatory minimum of five years imprisonment.see b b iii.
padilla appeals his sentence.recognizing the potential obstacle posed by the waiver of appeal in his plea agreement,he asks that we not honor it because his claim falls outside its scope and the waiver is invalid.as a substantive matter,he argues that the district court erred in denying him the benefits of the safety valve.the government contests both claims.because padilla right to seek relief from his sentence in this court turns on the validity of the waiver of appeal,we determine the waiver effect before considering the substantive claim.see united states edelen,cir.
waiver of appeal 
we enforce a waiver of appeal if it is valid and the defendant claim lies within its scope.see united states,cir united states mccoy,cir even a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.in this case,because we find that the waiver is invalid,we need not reach the question of whether the defendant appeal falls within its scope.
a waiver of appellate rights is valid if the defendant entered into it knowingly and voluntarily.united states,cir.we determine whether a waiver was knowing and voluntary by applying the test announced in teeter,at.under this test,an appellate waiver is valid as long as the written plea agreement contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope at the plea hearing the district court inquired specifically about any waiver of appellate rights,and its interrogation of the defendant sufficed to ensure that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and the denial of the right to appeal would not constitute a miscarriage of justice.see teeter,at.
the written plea agreement satisfies the first prong of the teeter test.the language of the waiver itself elucidates the right being waived by the defendant,namely,the right to appeal the judgment and sentence.the scope of the waiver is limited to this case and to any sentence consistent with the plea agreement terms and conditions.we have previously held that the same language satisfied the first teeter prong,at united states castro,cir.padilla does not contend otherwise.
the second prong of teeter requires us to examine the transcript of the colloquy between the court and the defendant at the hearing.teeter,at.our focus in doing so is to ascertain whether the court interrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and intelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming sentence.see also castro,at.as federal rule of criminal procedure b n requires,the colloquy must include a specific inquiry into any waiver of appellate rights.teeter,at.in explaining the extent of the waiver and what right of appeal remains,if any,the court should be especially careful in its choice of words,taking pains to explain to the defendant that her right to appeal is circumscribed by her preexisting waiver.teeter,at.context is also important in determining whether a statement is sufficiently misleading to nullify a waiver.see united states,cir the context in which such a statement is made is important to our determination castro,at context is important teeter,at.
padilla argues that statements by the court during his and sentencing hearings were so misleading that they abrogated his waiver of appeal.during the hearing,the magistrate judge asked padilla whether he understood that depending on the facts the court finds and the sentence it eventually imposes,both you and the government may appeal the sentence in this case subject to that waver sic padilla points out that the court posed this question shortly after explaining that the guidelines sentencing range would depend on his satisfaction of the requirements,including the interview.in this context,he says,his affirmative answer to the judge question meant that he understood that he would retain the right to appeal if the district court found that he was ineligible for the safety valve.padilla suggests that his misunderstanding was subsequently compounded by the district court at sentencing,when it stated that padilla could appeal if he believed his guilty plea was unlawful or involuntary,or there was some other fundamental defect in the proceedings that was not waived by the plea agreement.
we agree that,taken in context,the court statement at the hearing was so misleading that it nullified padilla waiver of appeal.the court choice of padilla could appeal depending on the facts this court finds reasonably suggested to padilla that he retained a right to appeal adverse factual findings.the context of the statement reinforced this view.because the statement closely followed the court explanation of the,the phrase the facts this court finds could reasonably have been understood by padilla to refer to eligibility,and,in particular,to a finding that he had failed to provide truthful information to the government.in such a context,the magistrate judge statement that padilla could appeal depending on the facts this court finds suggested that he retained a right to appeal an adverse determination of his eligibility for relief.
this suggestion by the court,rather than illuminating the meaning of the written waiver of appeal,contradicted its terms,which are not similarly limited in language or effect.by its terms,padilla waiver covers appeals of his judgment and sentence,and applies as long as the district court sentences him according to the terms and conditions of the plea agreement.the terms of the plea agreement do not guarantee padilla that he will be found eligible for relief.thus,padilla waived his right to appeal his sentence regardless of whether the court found him eligible for the safety valve.see,at discussing the terms of a similar waiver.by suggesting that padilla retained appellate rights in the event of an adverse finding of eligibility,the plea colloquy was so misleading that we can not regard padilla waiver as knowing and voluntary 
we therefore decline to enforce padilla waiver of appeal.because there is no need to reach the third prong of teeter,we now turn to the substantive claim on appeal.

general principles 
the standard of review applicable in appeals varies according to the foundation upon which the determination is based.united states matos,cir.we review de novo determinations to the extent they rest on conclusions of law.id.we review for clear error determinations to the extent they depend on findings of fact.id.the clear error standard is extremely deferential.united states bermúdez,cir citing united states marquez,cir.under it,an appellate court ought not to disturb either findings of fact or conclusions drawn from the record unless the whole of the record compels a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.bermúdez,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.evaluation of witness testimony is reviewed for clear error,since it involves judgments and credibility calls.matos,at.
the safety valve provision exempts certain drug offenders from mandatory minimum sentences.see f.congress purpose in enacting the provision was to mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory minimum sentences on,offenders in drug trafficking schemes.united states,cir to qualify for relief under the safety valve,a defendant must meet five requirements.see f.only the last requirement is at issue here under it,the defendant must truthfully provide to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.see f.n othing short of truthful and complete disclosure will suffice.united states,cir quoting matos,at.the defendant bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he has satisfied this requirement.see,at discussing all five requirements under f.we now turn to the specific claims of error,both of law and fact,raised by padilla.
legal claims 
burden of proof 
padilla argues that the defendant burden of proof does not arise until the government has made some preliminary showing,based on something more than opinion or disbelief,that the proffer is incomplete or untruthful.here,padilla says,the government simply asserted to the district court that it found padilla story implausible.taken alone,he argues,such an assertion is insufficient to support a finding that padilla was untruthful.
there is no support in our law for the proposition that the government must make a preliminary showing before the defendant burden of proof arises.the cases cited by the defendant establish only that when the record,taken as a whole,will not support a finding that the defendant has failed to provide a truthful and complete proffer,the government lack of confidence in the proffer is insufficient,in and of itself,to justify a denial of access to the safety valve.marquez,at see united states white,cir,at.where the record does provide some support,a sentencing court may reject a safety valve proffer based on its reasoned assessment of the defendant credibility in light of the facts.marquez,at citing white,at.it need not base its determination on independent rebuttal evidence introduced by the government.id.
within this framework,a defendant insistence that he has provided truthful and complete information does not necessarily overcome an unfriendly record.see id.at observing that otherwise,district courts would be bound to accept even the most arrant nonsense from a defendant mouth so long as the government could not directly contradict it by independent proof,in effect turn ing the burden of persuasion inside out.rather,when faced with a defendant who insists that he proffered truthful information,the sentencing court may make its own reasoned determination,in light of the facts on record,whether to credit the defendant assertion.see united states bravo,cir upholding rejection of admittedly consistent story in light of agent testimony that it was illogical,at upholding denial of safety valve where district court did not credit defendant,who simply den ied the charges against him,in light of his contradiction by record evidence marquez,at.in the present case,the sentencing court followed precisely this method,identifying in its order specific facts on the record,see supra section i,in light of which the court refused to credit padilla assertion that he provided truthful information.
proper basis for determination 
padilla argues that the sentencing court erred in basing its determination on information other than the proffer itself,namely,an earlier interview conducted by the case probation officer.that interview,he says,was conducted only for acceptance of responsibility purposes.as such,it was more limited than the interview and should not be considered.
once again padilla fails to adduce any legal authorities in support of his position.in fact,sentencing courts assessing eligibility for the safety valve routinely rely on a variety of record materials in determining whether a defendant has provided truthful and complete information.see bermúdez,at upholding determination based on comparison between proffer and testimony at trial of marquez,at noting internal inconsistencies between the proffer and other statements that the defendant himself had made matos,at upholding district court determination in light of other evidence that can be gleaned from the record.there is no sensible reason to limit the assessment of truthfulness to the proffer itself.inconsistencies between statements made during the proffer and statements made to the authorities on other occasions are not necessarily disqualifying.but the court may legitimately consider such inconsistencies in deciding on the truthfulness of the proffer.
factual claims 
padilla argues that the district court committed clear error in finding that his proffer had not been truthful.he makes several discrete challenges.
a.the change in padilla story 
padilla argues that the district court clearly erred in concluding that he had changed his account of the offense.we disagree.even assuming,arguendo,that the two interviews differed in purpose,as padilla argues,that difference can not account for the material alterations padilla made to his story on retelling.according to padilla initial account,he stole the bag containing the contraband when he was visiting a friend and observed a man hiding a gym bag in the trunk of a vehicle.he stole it thinking that maybe it was full of cash.after the probation officer expressed concern that padilla had not provided her with complete,accurate and truthful information,padilla told a different story.he stated that he knew the owners of the bag,that they owed him,and that they had failed to pay him back.during his interview,he also stated that he had previously purchased drugs from the owners of the bag and that he expected the bag to contain drugs when he stole it.even if the rough outlines of the two stories are consistent,the details and their implications differ markedly,and it can not be clear error for a sentencing court to take note of such differences and find in those differences a lack of truthfulness.
agent figueroa affidavit 
padilla argues that the sentencing court committed clear error by crediting agent figueroa affidavit.again,we disagree.to be sure,padilla has long insisted that agent figueroa falsified his affidavit.on the basis of this allegation and the required preliminary showing,padilla obtained a hearing under franks delaware,d,to determine the validity of the february,search warrant,which was based on the affidavit.in her report and recommendation,the magistrate judge who presided over the franks hearing identified several reasons to question the veracity of agent figueroa affidavit.yet the magistrate judge also credited agent figueroa testimony during the hearing,noting that he was forthright in demeanor and that some evidence corroborated figueroa version of events.she ultimately upheld the validity of the search warrant,and submitted proposed findings of fact based on agent figueroa testimony.in light of this outcome and the substance of the magistrate judge report,we can not conclude that the district court committed clear error in giving the affidavit the weight that it did.see matos,at w hen more than one sensible interpretation can supportably be drawn,a sentencing court decision to credit one alternative and reject another can not be deemed clearly erroneous.taking the measure of a sworn statement in view of its attempted impeachment is typical,and the record simply does not compel a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.see bermúdez,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
lastly,padilla argues that the sentencing court committed clear error by determining that the bag seized from his car during the february,search was the same bag agent figueroa observed padilla using to carry a rifle on january.it is true that the bag described in agent figueroa affidavit was blue and grey,while the bag discovered in the search of padilla automobile is described as being simply blue.however,the colors and features of the bags are not so dissimilar that it amounts to clear error to conclude that they were the same.the court might have discounted agent figueroa testimony t
