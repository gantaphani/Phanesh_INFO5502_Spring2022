defendants fawaz habbas and mohamed rahman appeal from judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson.rahman pled guilty to obstructing a federal grand jury investigation.c,j.habbas pled guilty to a similar charge of obstructing a federal grand jury investigation,and also to conspiracy to make false statements to government officials,and making false statements to a government official.a.the charges were based on defendants participation in a conspiracy to frame another person,falsely accusing him of an assault that the defendants and their had in fact staged.we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
defendants rahman and habbas conspired to frame mohamed.the victim,had earlier testified against rahman in an unrelated proceeding.to retaliate against,the defendants organized an elaborate conspiratorial plan,involving a number of and a simulated assault on nadia zeid,who later pled guilty and admitted her role in the plot.
zeid had recently testified in a murder trial against one mohamed khalil.the conspirators devised a plan to make it appear that assaulted zeid to punish her for testifying against khalil.zeid lay in the street,bleeding.a angelo gordon,pretending to be an unrelated passerby,called and flagged down a passing police car to report having witnessed an assault on zeid,and gave a description of as the assailant.rahman and habbas had previously conducted surveillance of daily routines,and planned the simulated assault to occur near where would be found.as planned by the conspirators,the police arrested based on gordon report and description.both gordon and zeid identified as the assailant,and zeid stated that he did it to punish her for testifying against a fellow egyptian.based on the identification by gordon and zeid,was arrested,charged with a crime carrying a life sentence,and held in custody for seven weeks pending his trial.eventually,he was released when habbas informed authorities that the crime was bogus and that had been framed.
habbas and rahman both pled guilty after providing detailed accounts of their crimes.habbas was sentenced to a prison term of months,two years of supervised release and a special assessment of.rahman was sentenced to a prison term of eight years,a three year term of supervised release,and a assessment.
rahman raises three issues on appeal.he contends,first,that the government breached his plea agreement by supporting a higher guidelines level than the government had estimated in his plea agreement second,that his counsel failure to object to a upward adjustment of his guidelines range constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and third,that his sentence of eight years imprisonment was unreasonable.
habbas raises four issues.he contends that the district court erred in,first,imposing a increase for substantial interference with justice second,refusing to adjust his guidelines level downwards by reason of a minor role third,not granting a downward departure and,fourth,imposing a sentence which violated a because it was greater than necessary to achieve the objectives of sentencing.
discussion 
rahmani.breach of plea agreement 
rahman argues that once the government,following our suggestion in united states pimentel,provided an estimate of the sentencing guidelines range in his plea agreement,it was not at liberty to argue in support of a more onerous guidelines analysis than it had estimated,at least absent new information not in the government possession at the time of the estimate.
in pimentel,in the early days of sentencing under the united states sentencing guidelines,we noted that we were troubled by the escalating number of appeals from convictions based on guilty pleas in which the appellant claim ed that he was unfairly surprised by the severity of the sentence imposed under the guidelines.in particular,we note d the distressingly large number of appeals involving defendants indicted for drug offenses who,at the time of tendering their pleas,were apparently unaware of the quantity of drugs that could be included in calculating their base offense levels.id.at.we expressed sympathy with the recurring claims that defendants did not fully appreciate the consequences of their pleas.id.we therefore urged the government in making plea agreements to provide estimates to defendants of their likely guidelines range to help ensure that guilty pleas indeed represent intelligent choices by defendants.id.at.we recognized that the government had no legal obligation to provide this information.id.
the government in this case followed our suggestion in pimentel and set forth in rahman plea agreement its estimate of the likely adjusted offense level of,resulting in a guidelines range of to months.in so doing,the government however included language clearly indicating its intention and reservation of right to seek a sentence higher than the guidelines range.it clearly stated that its estimate is not binding on the united states attorney office,the probation department or the court.the agreement went on to say that the government reserves the right to argue for a sentence beyond that called for by the guidelines based on the factors set forth in a.it specified that the defendant could not withdraw his plea,even if the guidelines level advocated by the united states attorney office,or determined by the probation department or the court is different from the estimate.and it specified further that defendant could not appeal so long as the sentence did not exceed months,which was far in excess of the government estimated range.
when the presentence report psr was prepared by the court probation office after rahman guilty plea,it recommended a upward adjustment under a by reason of the defendant leadership role in criminal activity that involved five or more participants.in its pimentel estimate set forth in the plea agreement,the government had not included this adjustment.the sentence range recommendation in the psr was therefore higher than the range that had been estimated by the government in the plea agreement.at the sentencing hearing,the government supported the increase recommended by the psr,and maintained that its own failure to include this upward adjustment in the earlier pimentel estimate had been a mistake.the district court determined that the adjustment under a was appropriate,and calculated the proper guidelines level as,providing a guidelines range of to months.in considering the mandatory sentencing factors detailed in a,however,the court concluded that rahman crime was outside the heartland,was an absolutely outrageous manipulation,distortion of the processes of this justice system,and called for a considerably more severe sentence than the month maximum under the guidelines range.the court thus imposed a sentence of eight years imprisonment.
rahman contends that the government support of the increase recommended by the psr was a breach of the plea agreement.we disagree.upon full consideration of the particular facts of this case,we reject rahman argument that the government violated his rights under the plea agreement by advocating a higher guidelines level than it had estimated in the plea agreement.our conclusion is supported by a number of factors.these include that the plea agreement clearly stated that the range set forth was merely a estimate,and warned in several different ways that the government was likely to advocate for a higher sentence.further,there is no suggestion that the government acted in bad faith,either by intentionally its initial estimate,intending to increase it subsequently,or in its subsequent advocacy of a higher range.finally,it appears that rahman was not harmed by the government change of position.
we recognize that notwithstanding recitations of liberty to seek a higher sentence and even a declaration of intention to do so,in certain circumstances government deviation from its prior estimate could conceivably produce serious unfairness.this might be so,for example,where the change of position involved bad faith or where the government change of position without new justifying facts changed the de
