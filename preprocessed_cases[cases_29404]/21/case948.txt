the district court,presiding over a complex,capital case,issued a pretrial order calling for the empanelment of two separate juries one to determine guilt and the other,totally different in composition,to determine whether to impose the death penalty.before us,the government asserts that the federal death penalty act fdpa forbids this binary course of action.we conclude that the district court unprecedented order presents a basic,previously undecided question of substantial public importance and,accordingly,entertain the government petition for advisory mandamus.exercising that jurisdiction,we proceed to correct and countermand the district court erroneous interpretation of the fdpa.
background 
in,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of massachusetts charged five men in a superseding indictment.the golconda of charges included racketeering,c racketeering conspiracy,id.d murder in aid of racketeering,id.a and conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,id.a.four of the five green,branden morris,jonathan hart,and edward parties to this proceeding.we focus exclusively on them.
the indictment alleged that the foursome were all members of the esmond street posse,variously described as a boston street gang or criminal enterprise,which was engaged in peddling marijuana and crack cocaine.count sixteen of the indictment charged green and morris,but not hart or washington,with the murder of one terrell gethers in aid of racketeering.under the controlling statute,a,that was a capital charge,carrying a potential penalty of death for the two affected defendants.
in response to a flurry of severance motions,see,the district court ruled that the capital defendants should not be tried together.united states green,d,green i.relatedly,the court decreed that hart would be tried with green and that washington would be tried with morris.id.at.these rulings brought to the fore a concern previously voiced by the defendants,hart and washington,who had posited that it would be unfair to force them to trial before a jury.
we pause to place this concern into proper perspective.the supreme court has held that,in a capital case,the government may exclude from jury service those individuals whose personal opposition to the death penalty is such that it would prevent or substantially interfere with their ability to apply the law.wainwright witt,d.the process of winnowing out such conscientious objectors in jury selection is known as.
a capital case potentially involves two separate trial phases.in the first phase,the jury determines whether the capital defendant is guilty of the crime s charged.if the defendant is convicted of a capital offense,a second proceeding ensues to determine whether that offense,under the circumstances of the case,warrants the death sentence.as a single jury normally hears both the guilt and penalty phases,occurs as part of the original jury empanelment.
the defendants in this case insist that the process of selecting a single jury to consider both the guilt and penalty phases has the correlative effect of putting a jury in the box that will be more prone to convict.to support this notion,the defendants proffered below statistical evidence purporting to indicate that were significantly underrepresented in the local jury venire and that would further reduce the possibility that any group more likely to oppose the death penalty than be able to serve on the jury.the defendants also tendered statistical evidence indicating a similar,though less pronounced,effect as to potential female jurors.the defendants then submitted studies purporting to show that jurors are significantly more likely to convict than jurors.hart and washington argued that these perceived consequences of were particularly unfair as applied to defendants who were not themselves facing the death penalty.
in responding to these plaints,the district court conceded that the defendants including the defendants had no constitutional entitlement to a jury.see green i,d at citing buchanan kentucky,d.the court,however,did not stop there it viewed the defendants importunings as raising a case management issue within the realm of trial court discretion.id.
noting the concerns enumerated by the defendants along with the potential strain on judicial resources that would accompany a further proliferation of the number of trials needed,the court devised two potential solutions and invited briefing on them.one entailed selecting a single jury including the maximum number of alternates for each trial,but deferring until after the guilt phase had concluded.if a capital conviction ensued,the court would then attempt to the jury before the penalty phase began and,if the number of remaining jurors and alternates fell below the requisite twelve,would discharge that jury and empanel a new,jury exclusively for the penalty phase.id.at.the second proposal contemplated selecting two distinct juries at the outset,one to hear the guilt phase and the other to hear the penalty phase.id.
in the briefing that followed,the government denigrated both options and the defendants lobbied for the second.on november,the district court ordered two juries empaneled for each of the scheduled trials one to adjudicate guilt and the second,if needed,to fix the nature of the penalty.united states green,d,green ii.the court determined that the applicable provision of the federal death penalty act,b,did not require a unitary jury.id.even if it did,the court held,the defendants were entitled to waive the requirement.id.
the government appealed this order and filed a protective petition for a writ of mandamus under the all writs act,a.we turn first to the jurisdictional question and then to the merits of the lower court order.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
the government roadmap to review traces several possible avenues through which our jurisdiction may attach.we can entertain an interlocutory appeal,the government says,because the order appealed from is a collateral order,that is,an order that conclusively determines an important legal question,which is completely separate from the merits of the underlying action and is effectively unreviewable by means of a archetypical appeal.see,rhode island epa,cir noting circumstances in which interlocutory orders are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine in re nineteen appeals arising out of san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir similar see also cohen beneficial indus.loan.
we view the use of the collateral order doctrine as problematic in the circumstances of this case.this court has been wary of creating running room for attempts to evade the longstanding rule that appeals by the government in criminal cases must be specifically authorized by statute.see united states watson,cir united states kane,cir.this wariness arises,in part,because of a realization that criminal matters are special concerns counsel against permitting government appeals in criminal cases under the collateral order doctrine.see united states horn,cir.among them are speedy trial and double jeopardy concerns.id.at see also united states mcveigh,cir per curiam citing horn and noting that the principal prudential bases are the avoidance of undue delay,and the avoidance of harassment citations omitted.
at a bare minimum,then,allowing a government appeal to go forward by way of the collateral order doctrine in a criminal case requires both that the conditions of the collateral order doctrine are satisfied,and that the prudential concerns that traditionally militate against allowing the government to appeal in a criminal case favor,or are at least neutral in respect to,the availability of a government appeal.horn,at.this court has found such concerns overcome only on rare occasions,such as where,prior to the entry of the order appealed from,guilt has been determined,sentence imposed,and no prospect of piecemeal litigation endures.id.at.because it is arguable how these prudential concerns cut in this case,we question whether an appeal from a dual jury order in a criminal case comes within the narrow purview of the collateral order doctrine.this doubt is all the more profound because of our uncertainty about whether an order affecting sentencing procedure can be considered completely separate from the merits of the underlying action.see sell united states,d permitting collateral appeal in criminal case when issue was wholly distinct from questions concerning trial procedures mcveigh,at,holding order barring witnesses from observing guilt phase of capital trial not sufficiently separate from merits of case united states patterson,cir holding that the sentencing process is an integral aspect of a criminal case and is not in any sense independent of the main course of the prosecution citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in the final analysis,we need not definitively resolve the appealability question.review is available,in our discretion,by way of mandamus.we explain briefly.
broadly stated,there are two types of mandamus.the more common is supervisory mandamus.see,in re atlantic pipe,cir horn,at.that strain of mandamus generally is limited to situations in which the party seeking the writ has a clear entitlement to relief,yet is threatened with irreparable harm should that relief be delayed or deferred.see,in re,cir in re cargill,cir.the defendants argue that neither requirement is met they are probably correct with respect to the second requirement.
the government suggests that it shares an interest with the public at large in seeing that the courts properly apply the interest that would be irreparably harmed if the district court proceeded with dual juries despite a contrary statutory command.this suggestion lacks force.if a blow to the public interest caused by a court erroneous interpretation of a statutory provision were to constitute irreparable injury,the bar would be set so low as to render the requirement superfluous.as justice rehnquist wrote,to issue a writ of mandamus under such circumstances would undermine the settled limitations upon the power of an appellate court to review interlocutory orders.will calvert fire ins,d plurality op.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the second type of as advisory more apt in the circumstances at hand.mandamus,in any form,is an extraordinary remedy,but advisory mandamus is available only in a tiny subset of cases.such cases are those that present novel questions of great significance which,if not immediately addressed,are likely to recur and to evade effective review.horn,at.the aim of advisory mandamus,then,is to settle substantial questions of law in circumstances that would assist other jurists,parties,and lawyers.id.at.to obtain relief under this species of mandamus,the petitioner does not need to show irreparable harm.see atlantic pipe,at.
this case lends itself to an application of the advisory mandamus doctrine.the district court interpretation of section b is unprecedented,and it hardly needs explaining why proper death penalty procedure is of great importance to the administration of justice.if the propriety of the district court interpretation is not evaluated here and now,it would very likely evade review.on the one hand,if successive juries convict and then impose the death penalty,the government will not be able to appeal this favorable verdict,see united states moran,cir,and the defendants,having urged the district court to abandon a unitary jury in favor of dual juries,could not be heard to complain about this procedural innovation,see united states angiulo,cir holding that a criminal defendant can not complain of invited error.on the other hand,if the first jury acquits or the second jury declines to impose capital punishment,the defendants will have no incentive to appeal and double jeopardy principles will prevent the government from doing so.see watson,at see also sattazahn pennsylvania,d noting that the double jeopardy clause applies to proceedings where the prosecution must prove certain statutorily defined facts beyond a reasonable doubt to support a sentence of death 
to cinch matters,the question will almost certainly recur.there is a longstanding belief in certain quarters,shared by the defendants in this case,that an accused guilt or innocence is likely to be judged less harshly by a jury.indeed,a federal district court in texas already has relied on the procedural innovation implemented in this case as precedent for issuing a similar order in a different capital case.see united states williams,cir per curiam vacating district court order.consequently,we deem this case an appropriate candidate for the exercise of our advisory mandamus authority.
iii.analysis 
the district court primary justification for its dual jury order rests with its interpretation of the relevant section of the fdpa.the court concluded that b permits a court to decide,before trial commences,that good cause exists to discharge the original jury once it has adjudicated the defendant guilt and then empanel a new jury for the penalty phase.green ii,d at green i,d at.as a secondary ground,the court held that if the statute does require a unitary jury to be empaneled at the outset of the trial,the defendant may unilaterally waive that requirement.see green ii,d at green i,d at.
b provides that if a defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to a capital offense,there shall be a separate sentencing hearing.id.the statute further provides that t he hearing shall be conducted before the jury that determined the defendant guilt.id.b.the statute proceeds to carve out a series of exceptions.these contemplate that the penalty phase may be conducted before a jury empaneled for that purpose alone only of four circumstances obtains 
a the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty 
b the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury 
c the jury that determined the defendant guilt was discharged for good cause or 
d after initial imposition of a sentence under this section,reconsideration of the sentence under this section is necessary 
id.b.finally,the statute provides that the penalty phase may be tried before the court alone,upon the motion of the defendant and with the approval of the attorney for the government.id.b.
the question before us concerns the proper interpretation of section b c.the government argues that this is a narrow provision that only comes into play if,after a finding of guilt,good cause to discharge the original jury arises.the defendants argue that this is a broader,more malleable provision,one that should be construed against the backdrop of a trial court extensive case management powers.on this basis,the defendants exhort us to hold that section b c requires only that the discharge of the guilt phase jury must occur before a new penalty phase jury is empaneled.as a necessary corollary of this interpretation,the defendants reason that the district court may decide at any in advance of it will discharge the guilt phase jury for what it deems to be good cause and empanel a new jury for the penalty phase.
in mulling the validity of these competing claims,we start with the text of the statute.see sepulveda united states,cir.section b c says that a new penalty phase jury will hear the case if the jury that determined the defendant guilt was discharged for good cause.that phrasing tells us a great deal about congress intent.the use of the word determined,in the past tense,makes clear that the phrase discharged for good cause refers to discharge for events arising after the guilt phase has been concluded.see jones united states,d ginsburg,dissenting opining that d ischarge for good cause under b c is most reasonably read to cover juror disqualification due to,exposure to prejudicial extrinsic information or illness see also id.at.majority op.expressing agreement with dissent interpretation of the phrase good cause williams,at.this makes perfect sense jurors who originally were qualified to sit may,by some untoward exposure or affliction,become incapacitated after the guilt phase ends but before the penalty phase ends so that a properly empaneled jury that has determined guilt will not be able to continue to serve.
the structure of a statute often informs its text.see plumley container,cir united techs,cir.here,the struc
