defendant appellant mamdouh mahmud salim appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york deborah batts,judge resentencing him for attacking a correctional officer while an inmate at the metropolitan correctional center the mcc.on appeal,salim argues primarily that his resentencing by videoconference constituted a violation of his right to be physically present.we agree with salim that the government has not satisfied its burden of proving that he waived his right to be present and that the district court erred in finding a valid waiver.but this error is subject to plain error review and,in these circumstances,salim was not prejudiced.we also reject salim arguments that his resentence was unreasonable.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the facts of this case are fully set forth in this court prior opinion in united states salim,cir.for present purposes,they may be summarized as follows 
on november,salim was incarcerated at the mcc awaiting trial upon the indictment in united states usama bin laden,et,cr.lbs,in which numerous alleged al qaeda members were charged with a conspiracy to kill americans.on that day,salim and his cellmate and in the terrorism case kholfan khamis mohamed planned to take a guard keys so that salim could attack his lawyers in an meeting room.their goal was to force salim attorneys to withdraw their representation so that district judge sand,who was presiding over the terrorism case and previously had denied salim repeated requests for new lawyers,would have to grant substitute counsel.
salim began to put the plan into effect when,while meeting with his lawyers in one of the meeting rooms,he asked to go back to his cell to retrieve certain materials.as corrections officer louis pepe escorted him to his cell,salim began singing a prearranged signal to mohamed,who was waiting in the cell.when salim and officer pepe arrived at the cell,mohamed grabbed officer pepe and salim knocked officer pepe down,sprayed hot sauce in his eyes,and stabbed him in the left eye with the end of a sharpened plastic comb.having taken officer pepe keys,salim and mohamed locked officer pepe in the cell and salim headed back towards the meeting room where his lawyers waited.he was subdued by other guards en route.
officer pepe was severely injured.he lost his left eye,incurred reduced vision in his right eye,and suffered brain damage that left his right side partially paralyzed and interfered with other normal functions,including his ability to speak and write.
ii.procedural background 
salim attack on officer pepe resulted in numerous additional charges,which were indicted separately from the terrorism case and assigned to district judge batts.on april,those charges were resolved when salim pled guilty to conspiracy to murder,and attempted murder of,a federal official,see,pursuant to a plea agreement without any sentencing guidelines understanding.
after a fatico hearing and briefing,the district court issued an opinion containing findings of fact and legal conclusions.see united states salim,d.among other rulings,the district court rejected the government argument for a terrorism enhancement.the government believed this enhancement was warranted because salim had attempted to coerce judge sand into appointing substitute counsel.the district court,however,concluded that the terrorism enhancement applied only to transnational conduct whereas the prison assault was purely domestic.see id.at.in a subsequent order,the district court agreed with the government that an obstruction of justice enhancement was warranted based on salim repeated denials at the fatico hearing that the motive for his attack was to force judge sand to appoint new counsel.
the initial sentencing took place on may.although the guidelines range was to months,the district court departed upward and imposed a month sentence due to factors including the unusually cruel,brutal and gratuitous infliction of injury,appendix app,that the attack was part of a broader scheme to attack salim attorneys,and that salim had secured mohamed help through religious and psychological coercion.
salim appealed his sentence.while that appeal was pending,the supreme court decided united states booker,which rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory rather than mandatory,and our court thereafter decided united states crosby,cir,which,in light of booker,provided for remand to permit the sentencing judge to determine whether to resentence,and if so,to resentence,id.at emphasis omitted.we remanded salim case to the district court pursuant to crosby.on remand,the district court declined to resentence salim after concluding that it would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.
salim again appealed,arguing that the district court had erroneously imposed various enhancements,including the obstruction enhancement.the government from the district court decision not to impose a terrorism enhancement.we rejected salim arguments but agreed with the government that the terrorism enhancement does not require transnational conduct and thus should apply in this case.salim,at.we vacated the sentence and again remanded.id.at.
on remand,salim counsel argued that,for various reasons,salim sentence either should be reduced or should stay the same.the government argued for a life sentence,which was the sentence in light of the terrorism enhancement.in an opinion issued before resentencing,the district court rejected salim arguments and concluded that a life sentence was appropriate.specifically,the district court stated that its reasons for departing upward in the original sentence most prominently,the severity and purpose of the crime prevented it from departing below the guidelines on resentencing.it also noted that its prior determination not to impose a life sentence was based on its erroneous legal analysis regarding the terrorism enhancement and had nothing to do with the nature and circumstances of the offense or the history and characteristics of the defendant.special appendix quoting a.
prior to resentencing,salim lawyer sent the district court a letter that stated that he had recently spoken with his client and that salim did not wish to be present in court for the resentencing.on salim behalf,counsel request ed that salim be permitted to waive his presence at re sentencing pursuant to rule c b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,or,alternatively,that the re sentencing proceed via videoconferencing.app.the district court endorsed the letter and ordered that salim presence in person was waived for in that a video hook up shall be arranged by the government.id.
at the resentencing on august,salim counsel was present and salim attended by videoconference at the outset,the district court had the following colloquy with salim 
the court salim is not present in person in the courtroom today.
salim,i wish to confirm that it is your wish to waive your appearance in this courtroom pursuant to rule c b of the federal rules of criminal procedure.is that correct 
the defendant your honor,do you want me to answer this question 
the court yes.
the defendant your honor,when they brought me in and they moved me from one prison to another,there are guards.and the officer spit on me and beat me,and that why i refuse to come over.
the court so you do not wish to waive your presence and you would prefer to be here 
the defendant no,your honor.i do want to come to the court.so i not going to be subjected to being beaten up and to be spit on.
the court so then you waive your presence here this afternoon 
the defendant therefore,your honor,i am waiving my right to appear before you.
the court thank you,salim.
after hearing statements from officer pepe,from salim and his lawyer,and from the government,the district court imposed a life sentence as recommended by the guidelines.salim appeals.
discussion 
i.the right to be present at resentencing 
salim argues,inter alia,that his attendance at resentencing by videoconference violated his right to be physically present and that his waiver of physical presence was not voluntary because it was premised on his fear of abuse by correctional officers.
applicable law 
under both the constitution and federal rule of criminal procedure a,a criminal defendant has the right to be present during sentencing.this right extends to resentencing.united states arrous,cir w here the district court a sentence which has been vacated or set aside by the court of appeals,a defendant has a constitutional right to be present,because technically a new sentence is being imposed in place of the vacated sentence.
although it is an issue of first impression in this circuit,every federal appellate court to have considered the question has held that a defendant right to be present requires physical presence and is not satisfied by participation through videoconference.see united states williams,cir united states torres palma,cir united states lawrence,cir united states navarro,cir,cert.denied.but see navarro,at politz,dissenting opining that the defendant sentencing by videoconference did not violate his right to be present.because both parties argue from this premise,we assume without deciding that presence requires physical presence and is not satisfied by videoconference.
in a case,a defendant may waive his right to be present as long as that waiver is knowing and voluntary.see.c b united states mera,cir per curiam.the government bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant waived his constitutional rights.united states lynch,cir.we have held that the erroneous denial of a defendant right to be present during resentencing is grounds for reversal only if the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of the deprivation.see united states demott,cir arrous,at united states pagan,cir.but see torres palma,at holding that a violation of the right to be present at sentencing is per se prejudicial.
we therefore turn to whether the government has proven,as the district court found,that salim knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be present for resentencing.
salim purported waiver of presence 
salim contends that his waiver of presence was not voluntary because it was premised on his fear of physical abuse by correctional officers.the government makes two arguments in response first,that salim lawyer properly waived salim presence through counsel letter to the district court before resentencing and second,that salim reiterated and confirmed his waiver directly to the district court at the outset of the resentencing proceedings.
defense counsel purported waiver by letter 
although it is certainly preferable that the waiver of presence come from the defendant directly,there is no constitutional requirement to that effect.polizzi united states,cir.a defendant lawyer may waive presence on the defendant behalf.but a defendant waiver through counsel,like all waivers of constitutional rights,still must be knowing and voluntary on the part of the defendant.see id.at describing a procedure wherein the district court inquired of defense counsel whether,inter alia,the defendant understood his right to be present and whether he was voluntarily and knowingly waiving that right,affirmatively requesting that the trial proceed in his absence and giving up any claim of prejudice.
the government has not satisfied its burden of proving that salim,through his lawyer letter,knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be present at resentencing.the letter stated only that counsel had recently spoken to salim and requested,on salim behalf,that salim be allowed to waive his presence at re sentencing or,alternatively,that the re sentencing proceed via videoconferencing.app.these words,without more,do not speak to knowledge or voluntariness,and the government can not prove and the district court could not have found an adequate waiver by relying on them.
salim purported waiver over videoconference 
as resentencing commenced,the district court appropriately stated to salim over the videoconference link that it wish ed to confirm that it was salim wish to waive his appearance in th e courtroom,id.at.see united states tureseo,cir to establish waiver,the district court must conduct a record inquiry to determine whether the defendant absence was knowing and voluntary.salim responded that he did indeed waive his presence,but that he did so because at least one correctional officer allegedly had spit on and beat en him the last time salim had been moved.app.he claimed that he did not want to come to the court because he did not want to be subjected to being beaten up and spit on again.id.the district court accepted this waiver and proceeded with resentencing.
here again,the government has not satisfied its burden of proving that salim waiver was voluntary.to be voluntary,a waiver of a constitutional right must be the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.berghuis thompkins,internal quotation marks omitted.salim waiver allegedly resulted from fears of intimidation and physical abuse.the government has not established that salim was lying about the abuse,that the fear he expressed was not reasonably grounded,or that he would not have attended resentencing even if his safety could be reasonably assured.
nor did the district court undertake to assess the reasonableness of salim alleged fears or determine whether assurances could have been made that would assuage those fears.in comparable situations,we and the supreme court have held that a careful judicial inquiry is required before a court may accept an waiver of constitutional procedural rights.see faretta california,right to counsel and the correlative right to dispense with a lawyer help internal quotation marks omitted boykin alabama,rights against,to trial,and to confront one accusers,which may be waived by entering a guilty plea united states curcio,cir right to counsel.the government urges that the district court,which observed salim during this colloquy,implicitly rejected salim claimed fears of abuse as incredible.it is true that the district court was in a position to assess salim credibility and,if appropriate,reject his explanation for his waiver.but the district court made no findings to that effect.the government argument therefore is speculative and we can not uphold the district court acceptance of salim waiver on this basis.
prejudice analysis 
our analysis does not end with our determination that the government has not met its burden of proving that salim knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to be physically present at resentencing.the district court error in finding a valid waiver warrants reversal and remand only if salim suffered prejudice as a result.see demott,at arrous,at pagan,at.
when a criminal defendant does not preserve an issue below by objecting,we apply a plain error standard instead of a harmless error one.see,united states garcia,cir confrontation clause context united states vaval,cir rule context.we therefore review the district court acceptance of salim waiver of presence at resentencing for plain error.see,united states jones,cir united states henderson,cir united states holman,app x,cir united states williams,app x,cir united states terrazas,app x,cir united states rhodes,cir.
as explained recently by the supreme court,when reviewing for plain error,
an appellate court may,in its discretion,correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
united states marcus,brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant bears the burden of establishing entitlement to relief for plain error.united states dominguez benitez.
even assuming that salim has satisfied the first two prongs of plain error review by showing that there was an error and that it was clear or obvious he has not met the third or fourth.sali
