we affirm the judgment of conviction but vacate the sentence and remand the cause for the various reasons stated below.
background 
on july,a grand jury returned an indictment charging cadet with counts of aiding and assisting the preparation of false income tax returns,in violation of the indictment alleged that cadet knowingly and willfully prepared false tax returns on behalf of ten clients between approximately april,and april.the indictment further alleged that cadet obtained unwarranted tax refunds for his clients by inserting false or inflated deductions on the schedules a itemized deduction schedule,c profit or loss from business schedule,and e supplemental income or loss statement attached to clients individual income tax returns forms.the overstated or falsified deductions included deductions for mortgage interest,job expenses,and losses associated with rental properties.
prior to trial,the government moved in limine to introduce evidence in its of interactions between cadet and an undercover internal revenue service irs agent,justin green,in which cadet proposed to use creative financing to prepare a form for green that would generate a fraudulent refund of over in exchange for a higher fee.in a memorandum order dated september,the district court held that the evidence was admissible pursuant to federal rule of evidence b rule b for several purposes,such as demonstrating motive,intent,and corroboration and absence of mistake,noting that cadet was contesting the willfulness of his conduct by arguing that,in preparing his clients returns,he either relied on inaccurate information provided by the clients or made mistakes.the district court also declined to exclude,under federal rule of evidence the evidence of cadet interactions with agent green,finding the evidence highly probative of a number of disputed issues and the risk of unfair prejudice to be quite small.
on september,the first day of trial,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss of the counts of the indictment.the remaining counts arose from tax returns that cadet had prepared and filed on behalf of five of the ten to whom the indictment referred.
the government evidence at trial consisted principally of testimony from the five and agent green.all of the taxpayers testified that they gave cadet truthful financial information and had no idea that the returns he prepared for them were inaccurate that cadet always carefully reviewed with them the financial information they provided to him and that they always paid cadet a modest,fixed fee regardless of whether the return claimed a tax refund or produced a tax deficiency.
agent green testified that,on april,he had visited cadet office pretending to be a construction worker in need of tax preparation services.green testified that he gave cadet several financial documents,including a w form,a form showing mortgage interest,and documents indicating a total of in charitable deductions.cadet did not ask a single question about any other financial variables that could affect green tax liability,deductible job expenses,charitable contributions beyond the indicated in his paperwork,professional expenses,or additional mortgage interest beyond the stated on his form.instead,cadet entered the financial information on a computer and told agent green that he would owe more than in federal taxes.
when agent green indicated that he could not afford such a payment,cadet offered to recalculate the taxes using creative financing in exchange for a higher fee.cadet then produced a revised form for green that included deductions for in mortgage interest payments,in gifts to charity,in cumulative job expenses,in investment fees,and in attorney and accounting fees,generating a tax refund of.
in addition to agent green testimony,a secret recording of his visit to cadet was played for the jury.
the district court instructed the jury that they may rely on the evidence of the alleged similar acts as a basis for corroborating the government witnesses,if you believe these witnesses in the first place,but also instructed the jury that they may not consider evidence of similar acts for any other purpose and may not use this evidence to conclude that because the defendant committed the acts to which agent green testified,he must have committed the acts charged in the indictment.
following the jury trial,cadet was convicted of counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false federal income tax returns.the presentence report psr determined cadet total offense level to be and placed him in criminal history category i,yielding a guidelines range of imprisonment of to months.pursuant to,the maximum term of imprisonment that may be imposed for a violation of that statute is three years incarceration months,and the maximum period of supervised release that may be imposed on each count of conviction is one year.a,b.
the district court sentenced cadet to months imprisonment on each count of conviction,to run concurrently,as well as three years of supervised release.the district court further ordered restitution in the amount of the restitution figure was calculated to encompass losses caused by the specific conduct underlying the counts of conviction,including losses suffered by the state and the city of new york as a result of cadet preparation and filing of the federal income tax returns that gave rise to his conviction the restitution amount also included a loss amount of stemming from a tax return that cadet had prepared and filed on behalf of a client,which was not the basis of any of the counts on which he was convicted.
the district court further ordered that any amount that the five had resolved through settlement with or payment to the irs would be excluded from the final restitution amount.despite the fact that some of the made payments to the irs in settlement of outstanding tax assessments,the district court did not reduce the restitution order to reflect those payments.
on appeal,cadet contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of cadet uncharged crimes,wrongs,or acts involving cadet interactions with agent green imposing a term of imprisonment and a term of supervised release that exceed the statutory maximum and including in the restitution order amounts that exceed those arising from the offenses of conviction and those for which payment had already been made,as well as losses incurred by the state and the city of new york as a result of the false tax returns underlying the counts of conviction.
discussion 
evidence from undercover irs agent 
cadet argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting,pursuant to rule b,evidence of cadet preparation of a tax return for undercover irs agent justin green.
it is settled law that we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see,united states mercado,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when,for example,its evidentiary rulings are arbitrary,irrational,or simply erroneous as a matter of law.see,united states paulino,cir sims blot,cir explaining the term of art abuse of discretion as including errors of law.in general,erroneous evidentiary rulings entitle a defendant to a new trial,unless the error was harmless.see.a any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.united states abreu,cir w e will not order a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling if we conclude that the error was harmless.an erroneous ruling on the admissibility of evidence is harmless if the appellate court can conclude with fair assurance that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury.united states jackson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
