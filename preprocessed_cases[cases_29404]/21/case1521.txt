emmanuel abiodun and atairu akuetiemehe appeal from judgments of conviction and the resulting sentences imposed upon them by the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge after they pleaded guilty to fraud in connection with identification documents,see fraud in connection with possession of a credit access device,see and conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud,see.akuetiemehe was sentenced on october,principally to a term of months incarceration.abiodun was sentenced on december,principally to a term of months incarceration.
akuetiemehe challenges the district court determination that the loss amount attributable to his criminal activity was to million.abiodun challenges the district court determinations that his criminal activity involved more than victims a enhancement to his offense calculated under the united states sentencing appropriate based on his role in the offense and the overlap of the guidelines enhancements triggered by his offenses of conviction warranted a downward departure of only six levels.abiodun also claims that the district court failed to include,in the written order of judgment and conviction,a statement of the reasons for its imposition of an sentence.
we affirm the district court application of a upward adjustment based on abiodun role in the offense and the district court decision to grant a downward departure based on the overlap of the guidelines enhancements triggered by abiodun offenses of conviction.we conclude,however,that the district court incorrectly calculated the number of victims affected by defendants conduct,an error which also affected the calculation of the loss attributable to the defendants.accordingly,we vacate the sentences of both akuetiemehe and abiodun,and we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
defendants were part of a loosely connected group of some thirty individuals who,over the course of five or six years,engaged in a scheme to commit credit card and access device fraud through the use of stolen credit information.united states abiodun,d.one of the organizers of the scheme,linus baptiste,estimated that the members of the conspiracy illegally downloaded more than credit reports.id.at.typically,four out of ten credit reports would be useful,and a useful credit report would yield approximately two usable credit cards or credit lines.a typical usable credit card would have an average of in available credit.id.at.put another way,the members of the conspiracy obtained an average of approximately per credit report.id.at.
defendant akuetiemehe was involved in the scheme from to,purchasing a total of some to reports from baptiste.id.at.in addition,a t some point akuetiemehe was obtaining credit reports from a source other than baptiste and selling them to others.id.when he was apprehended in december,he had more than credit reports as well as other financial and bank documents,including documents bearing the name and photograph of a fraud victim and list ing as an address the building in which akuetiemehe lived at the time.id.at.
defendant abiodun was involved in the scheme from late to early.he purchased approximately to credit reports,making him one of baptiste biggest customers.id.at record citations omitted.abiodun provided another member of the a credit card and drove olusola from new york to lancaster,pennsylvania,where olusola attempted to obtain a cash advance on a credit card in the name of one of the victims of the fraud using a false driver license.id.abiodun also gave olusola approximately ten credit reports and promise d to help olusola call the banks from which olusola hoped to obtain credit.id.record citations omitted.finally,abiodun helped a second member of the or more fraudulent credit cards,which were then used to get cash advances and to buy merchandise.id.record citations omitted.
defendants were sentenced under the theft and fraud provisions of the sentencing guidelines,which instruct a sentencing court to increase the offense level based on the amount of loss involved.see.after defendants pleaded guilty to the charges in the indictment,the district court held an evidentiary hearing pursuant to united states fatico,cir,to resolve the parties disputes about,inter alia,the amount of loss attributable to each defendant the government,in support of its position,presented the district court with spreadsheets indicating that the total losses arising from the scheme were over million 
to determine the loss amount attributable to each defendant,the district court used the spreadsheets submitted by the government and the testimony offered by cooperating witnesses to calculat e the average loss sustained per credit report.abiodun,d at.the district court then multiplied this sum by the number of reports purchased by each defendant.id.using this methodology,the district court concluded that akuetiemehe was responsible for losses of to million based on his purchase of to reports and abiodun was responsible for losses of to million based on his purchase of to reports.id.at.in light of these loss calculations,the court increased the offense levels of both defendants by levels pursuant to b i.id.at.
the district court sentenced akuetiemehe to a term of months,the bottom of his range of to months.
turning to abiodun,the court applied a enhancement to the offense level based on the number of victims it found to have been affected by his conduct.having concluded that lost time could constitute actual loss within the meaning of,the district court found that the victims affected by abiodun crimes included individuals who had spent an appreciable amount of time securing reimbursement for their financial losses from their banks or credit card companies.taking these individuals together with the dozens of corporate victims and the small percentage of individuals who actually did lose money,the district court determined that it was more likely than not that abiodun crimes affected victims,that is,victims who suffered some harm that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money.app.
the district court also determined that abiodun offense level should be adjusted upward by two levels,pursuant to c,upon finding that abiodun was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in criminal activity involving at least two other participants.abiodun,d at.the district court based this finding on,inter alia,record evidence concerning the role that abiodun had played in the offenses of owolabi and olusola by providing them with credit information,credit access devices,and other types of assistance.id.
in arriving at abiodun sentencing range,the district court determined that several of the guideline enhancements triggered by abiodun conduct overlapped to some extent the district court therefore decided to depart downward by six levels,leaving abiodun with a total offense level of and a resulting guideline range of to months.
after considering the seriousness of abiodun offense,the number of victims affected,and the fact that abiodun played a more significant role than virtually all of the other individuals involved in the scheme,the district court decided to impose a sentence of months imprisonment.app.this sentence was above abiodun range of months imprisonment but well below the to months imprisonment that abiodun would have faced had the district court not granted him a downward departure.
