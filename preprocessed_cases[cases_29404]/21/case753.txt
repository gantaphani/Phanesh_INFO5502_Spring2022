under b a,an individual who fails to appear in court as required by the terms of his release from custody is subject to punishment.as dictated by the statute,the severity of the punishment for that failure to appear depends on the severity of the maximum sentence available for the offense in connection with which the individual was released.that much is clear.now,however,we decide a surprisingly controversial question if the failure to appear relates to a supervised release revocation hearing,is the relevant punishment under the statute the period of incarceration available for the supervised release violation,or the period of incarceration available for the underlying offense which led to the imposition of the supervised release condition we conclude that the plain language of requires us to reach the latter conclusion.the district court reached the same conclusion,and we affirm its sentence.
the facts relevant to the appeal are undisputed.appellant frederick smith was convicted in vermont of conspiracy to distribute heroin.on november,he was sentenced to time days three years of supervised release.subsequently,on november,jurisdiction over smith conviction was transferred from vermont to maine so that the united states probation office in maine could supervise the conditions of his release.
smith failed to report to his probation officer in maine,in violation of a condition of his supervised release.on may,the government filed a petition to revoke his supervised release.smith was arrested on may pursuant to a warrant issued in connection with the petition.at a preliminary hearing the following day,the magistrate judge found probable cause to support the violation but ordered smith release conditioned on a bond and an agreement to appear at all proceedings as required and to surrender for service of any sentence imposed.despite this agreement,smith failed to appear at his final supervised release revocation hearing on july.
on october,in an information,the government charged smith under with failure to appear at the july hearing.after waiving indictment,smith pled guilty to that charge,and,at a separate hearing on the same day,also admitted to violating the conditions of his supervised release.
the district court held a joint sentencing hearing on the two violations.it determined that smith sentencing exposure for his failure to appear conviction should be based on b a i,which prescribes punishment for failing to appear after release in connection with an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of fifteen years or more.the court explained that the offense in question was smith conviction for conspiracy to distribute heroin,rather than his subsequent violation of the conditions of his supervised release.
applying the relevant provision of the sentencing guidelines,the court increased smith base offense level of six by nine levels.see b a.the court then applied a reduction for smith acceptance of responsibility.see a.the final offense level of thirteen,in combination with smith criminal history category of ii,subjected him to a sentencing range of eighteen to months.however,concluding that smith history and circumstances did not justify a sentence within that range,the court imposed a sentence of twelve months and one day.it also imposed a four month sentence for smith violation of the conditions of his supervised release,to be served consecutively with the term on the failure to appear charge.
on appeal,smith protests that the court erred in sentencing him for his failure to appear based on his prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute heroin.he contends that the relevant charge was that of violating a supervised release condition,which was punishable by two years of imprisonment,and thus his sentencing exposure should have been based on b a iii.then,under the sentencing guidelines,his base offense level of six should have been increased by only three levels rather than nine.see b c.after applying the reduction for acceptance of responsibility,his final offense level would then be seven,which would translate to a sentencing range of only four to ten months.
smith challenge to his sentence presents a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see,united states leahy,cir.our analysis must begin with the statute itself.section provides for punishment for a failure to appear as follows 
b punishment.
the punishment for an offense under this section is 
a if the person was released in connection with a charge of,or while awaiting sentence,surrender for service of sentence,or appeal or certiorari after conviction for 
i an offense punishable by death,life imprisonment,or imprisonment for a term of years or more,a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than ten years,or both 
ii an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more,a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than five years,or both 
iii any other felony,a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than two years,or both 
iv a misdemeanor,a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than one year,or both 
emphasis added.the government contends that the district court correctly held that smith was released in connection with a charge of conspiracy to distribute heroin,which is an offense punishable by a term of incarceration of years or more.consequently,his punishment falls under b a i,exposing him to a maximum sentence of ten years for the failure to appear.smith,however,contends that he was released in connection with a charge of violating a condition of supervised release.asserting that his exposure under that charge was only nineteen months he argues that the violation of a condition of supervised release is most closely analogous to the any other felony described in b a iii,thereby exposing him to a maximum sentence of two years for the failure to appear.
in asserting this construction of the statute,smith first notes that congress has structured the ladder of penalties for failure to appear in such a way as to be proportionate to the sentencing exposure applicable to the matter in connection with which the defendant was released.if the matter in connection with which a defendant fails to appear is punishable by death,life imprisonment,or imprisonment for a term of fifteen years or more under b a i,the sentencing guidelines prescribe an upward adjustment of nine levels under b a.if the matter in connection with which the defendant fails to appear is punishable by imprisonment for a term of five to fifteen years under b a ii,the upward adjustment is six levels under b b.and,if the matter in connection with which the defendant fails to appear is punishable by imprisonment less than five years under b a iii or iv,the upward adjustment is three levels under b c.
smith then emphasizes that the charge in connection with which he failed to appear was the supervised release violation,not the previous heroin conspiracy charge.he explains that supervised release is not explicitly mentioned in b a,which applies literally to points in time procedurally which are all associated with prosecution of the original charge,not with a subsequent term of supervised release.similarly,the commentary to section of the sentencing guidelines explains in its background provision that applies to a failure to appear by a defendant who was released pending trial,sentencing,appeal,or surrender for service of sentence.again,none of these events is associated with supervised release.consequently,smith contends that the heroin charge is no longer relevant.in his view,does not contemplate that a failure to appear at a hearing on a petition for revocation of supervised petition filed after the underlying prison sentence already has been be associated with the original charge for which the supervised release was imposed.rather,he argues,the supervised release violation is the relevant violation because it is the immediate matter in connection with which he failed to appear.
the fundamental problem with smith argument is its incompatibility with the language of b a i through iv.subsections i and ii refer to an offense subsection iii refers to any other felony and subsection iv refers to a misdemeanor.id.the use of the phrase any other felony in subsection iii indicates that the offenses described in subsections i and ii also must be felonies.similarly,the structure of the statute reveals that the any other felony in subsection iii,and the misdemeanor in subsection iv,must be offenses.thus,to fall within the language of b a i through iv,a violation of a condition of supervised release must,at a minimum,be an offense that qualifies as either a felony or a misdemeanor.
smith argues that a felony is classically defined as an offense punishable by one year or more,while a misdemeanor is punishable by less than a year.see a.thus,he contends,we should interpret the words any other felony to mean any matter for which there is sentencing exposure of one year or more.because the maximum sentencing exposure associated with his supervised release violation was two years,he asks us to hold that it qualifies as any other felony within the meaning of b a iii.the government,for its part,asks us to rely on the black law dictionary definition of felony.it argues that violation of supervised release is not a felony within that definition.
both parties have failed to point out that congress has provided statutory definitions for the relevant terms.a provides definitions for.the term felony is defined as an offense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year.id.a.and the term offense is defined as any criminal offense,other than certain military offenses,which is in violation of an act of congress and is triable in any court established by an act of congress.id.a.accordingly,the real issue is whether a violation of a supervised release condition is a criminal offense that violates an act of congress and is triable in federal court.
we resolve that issue against smith.first,there is no support for the proposition that a supervised release violation is a criminal offense.see johnson united states,d although supervised release violations often lead to reimprisonment,the violative conduct need not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard,not by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.united states marvin,cir an individual violation of the conditions of his supervised release is not a crime,but the violative conduct can constitute criminal behavior if it satisfies the elements of a particular offense.united states green,cir a violation of parole is not,in itself,a criminal offense.as noted in these precedents,the procedural mechanisms relating to a supervised release revocation hearing demonstrate that the alleged violation at issue in such a hearing is not a crime.importantly,the standard of proof in a supervised release revocation hearing is a preponderance standard,e,rather than the reasonable doubt standard common to all criminal proceedings,and the rules of evidence do not apply.d.
also,in providing for the revocation of supervised release,e indicates that a court should follow the applicable federal rules of criminal procedure.these rules emphasize that a proceeding to revoke supervised release is not a trial.rule b provides for a hearing rather than a trial,and rule,which provides the procedures for such a hearing,states that these procedures apply at trial and at other proceedings,including a rule hearing,see.g.from the notion that the supervised release revocation proceeding is a hearing rather than a trial,it follows logically that a supervised release violation is not triable in federal court.relatedly,federal rule of criminal procedure a explains that the magistrate judge may release or detain the person under a pending further proceedings.section a governs release pending sentence,while a different provision release pending trial.this distinction also reinforces the notion that a supervised release violation is not a triable offense,but,rather,a violation that may result in an increase in a sentence 
finally,the violation of a supervised release condition is not a violation of an act of congress.in smith case,the condition that he report to his probation officer was incorporated in an order from a federal judge,and thus his failure to do so did not violate a congressional act.of course,federal judges are statutorily required to order certain conditions in conjunction with supervised release.see d.however,the violation of such a mandatory condition would still constitute a violation of the federal judge order,rather than a violation of the statute itself.
in light of the foregoing analysis,we conclude that the violation of a supervised release condition is not a criminal offense in violation of an act of congress that is triable in federal court.thus,it can not qualify as a felony within the meaning of b a iii.consequently,we can not accept smith contention that congress intended us to analogize his violation to that described in subsection iii based on the equivalent maximum sentencing exposure.to so hold would be to ignore congress explicit use of the term felony in b a iii 
the dissent does not argue that our reading of the statute would produce an absurd result.instead,it contends that our interpretation disregards congress clear statutory intent,to which we owe deference if the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.griffin oceanic contractors,d.this argument illustrates the danger of ignoring the plain language of a statute in favor of an attributed legislative intent divined by the court.
the dissent contends that congress intent was plainly to create a hierarchy of penalties geared to the magnitude of the sentence that was at stake in connection with the proceeding for which the defendant failed to appear.this statement of congressional intent is based on language that does not appear in the statute.the statutory language correlates the severity of the penalty with the seriousness of the charge in connection with which the individual was released.the statute does not correlate the severity of the penalty with the sentence at stake in the particular proceeding for which the defendant failed to appear.the language that congress chose if the person was released in connection with a charge of,by its plain terms,applies to an individual on supervised release in connection with the charge underlying the supervised release.on the theory that congress means what it says,congress intent was to link the potential severity of punishment for the failure to appear at a supervised release revocation hearing to the seriousness of the offense that originally led to the supervised release indeed,congress might easily have determined that a defendant whose supervised release stems from a more serious underlying offense should be subject to a more severe penalty when he fails to appear at a hearing regarding the revocation of that supervised release.
the dissent cites the perverse outcomes that result from relying on the plain language of.in making this argument,the dissent focuses exclusively on the proverbial worst case scenario that someone like smith,who faced a maximum sentence of nineteen months for revocation of his supervised release term,could face ten years imprisonment for the failure to appear at his supervised release revocation hearing even though he was only sentenced to time served days for the underlying drug offense.this approach overlooks the fact that,in the next case,smith could be an individual with a long criminal record who was on supervised release after serving most of a lengthy sentence for a crime of violence.for such an individual any violation of a supervised release would be a matter of grave concern,and so too would be the failure to appear at the supervised release revocation hearing.under these circumstances,it would hardly be a perverse outcome to determine the sentencing consequences of this failure to appear on the basis of the sentencing exposure for the underlying offense rather than the sentencing exposure for the violation of supervised release.
ultimately,as with any other sentence imposed pursuant to a st
