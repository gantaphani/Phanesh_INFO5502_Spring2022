this appeal requires us to examine the safety valve,f a device through which a court may sentence a defendant without regard to an statutory mandatory minimum,provided that the defendant meets certain criteria.after perscrutation of the parties briefs and the record,we conclude that the sentencing court refusal to apply the safety valve was neither clearly erroneous nor based upon a mistaken view of the law.consequently,we affirm the sentence imposed below.
background 
we derive the facts from the rule colloquy and the undisputed portions of the presentence investigation report.see,united states dietz,cir.
reinard devarie headed a ring that distributed heroin in southbridge,massachusetts.during a period of nearly four months beginning in december,devarie organization supplied a local drug dealer,eddie santiago,with to bundles of heroin per week.each delivery comprised anywhere between to grams of heroin having a street value in excess of.devarie recruited nelson marquez,a individual who had fallen on hard times,to assist in the operation.in that capacity,the appellant made three of the weekly deliveries to santiago.
on march,agents of the drug enforcement administration dea arrested santiago.he agreed to cooperate with the dea,informed the agents of devarie role,and arranged a meeting between devarie and an undercover officer whom devarie believed to be santiago accomplice.the meeting took place on march.at that time,dea agents observed devarie seated in a parked car as the appellant stood nearby,looking in all directions.the undercover officer met with the two men,and devarie told him to remember the appellant face because,if any heroin were to be returned,it should be delivered to the appellant.return of the heroin proved to be unnecessary because the undercover officer eventually persuaded devarie to permit him to continue selling drugs to santiago clientele.the officer then paid devarie on account,declaring that the money was derived from heroin sales.the appellant remained in attendance throughout the discussion although he later professed not to have heard much of the conversation.
the appellant was arrested on april,and a federal grand jury thereafter charged him with conspiracy to distribute heroin,and distribution of heroin,id.a.after some initial skirmishing not relevant here,the appellant pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment at the disposition hearing,the district court determined that the appellant was accountable for grams of heroin and set his base offense level at.see ussg c.the court gave the appellant a full credit for acceptance of responsibility,ussg,thus reducing his offense level to.the court also ascertained that the appellant belonged in criminal history category based on these determinations,the court concluded that the appellant guideline sentencing range gsr was to months.
the gsr proved to be illusory because the appellant was responsible for more than grams of heroin,he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum term of immurement.see b b i.defense counsel beseeched the court to ameliorate the harshness of this prospective sentence by applying the safety valve provision.if this were done,the appellant would not only avoid the mandatory minimum but also qualify for a downward adjustment pursuant to ussg b in which event his gsr would be to months.the district court refused this entreaty,holding that the appellant did not qualify for the safety valve provision.the court thereupon sentenced the appellant to a incarcerative term,a supervised release term of four years,and a special assessment.this appeal ensued.
standard of review 
the battleground on appeal centers on the district court ruling that the appellant did not qualify for the safety valve.to the extent that such a ruling depends on differential factfinding,we review it for clear error.see united states,cir.to the extent,however,that the ruling hinges on an interpretation of the safety valve provision itself,our review is plenary.see id.
we divide our analysis into several segments.first,we place the safety valve provision into perspective.second,we describe the appellant proffer,the government reaction,and the lower court decision.we then discuss the appellant attack on the decision.
the safety valve 
as we explained in,congress enacted the safety valve provision,f,in order to mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory minimum sentences on certain first offenders who played supporting roles in schemes.at.following congress lead,the sentencing commission incorporated the statutory text verbatim into the sentencing guidelines.see ussg.under this regime,the safety value applies if 
the defendant does not have more than criminal history point 
the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon or induce another participant to do so in connection with the offense 
the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person 
the defendant was not an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of others in the offense and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise and 
not later than the time of the sentencing hearing,the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan 
in this instance,the sentencing court the government the appellant satisfied the first four of these criteria he has no prior criminal record he did not carry a firearm,threaten violence,engage in activity that was shown to involve death or serious bodily harm to others,or occupy a leadership role in the criminal enterprise.the question,then,is whether the appellant was sufficiently forthcoming in his discussions with the authorities to satisfy the fifth criterion.
the proffer and its sequelae 
prior to sentencing,the government afforded the appellant an opportunity to make a proffer for safety valve purposes.the proffer occurred in a meeting held on may.it purported to cover the appellant relationship with devarie,what he knew concerning devarie line of work and when he knew it,the services that the appellant rendered,and the terms and conditions of his employment.after the proffer session,the government identified various statements that it claimed were untrue or incomplete.these included 
the appellant protestation that he did not realize that devarie was involved in until devarie offered him a job.
the appellant insistence that he did not know the type of drug or approximate quantity of drugs that he had delivered to santiago.
the appellant claim that he had been paid only per delivery.
the appellant denial that he had served as a lookout for devarie at the march meeting.
the appellant denial that he had used the alias tito in his dealings with santiago.
at the disposition hearing,the district court found that the appellant had not been truthful in these respects,and that these dissemblings,taken together,indicated that the appellant deliberately obfuscated the facts.on this basis,the court rejected the appellant claim for relief under the safety value provision 
the assignments of error 
the appellant asserts that the lower court erred in finding that he did not truthfully and completely provide all the information that he possessed concerning the offenses of conviction and,therefore,that the court erred in declining to accord him the benefit of the safety valve provision.he grounds this assertion on three main stanchions.first,he claims that to undermine a defendant safety valve proffer,the government may not rely on an assessment simpliciter of the plausibility of the proffer,but,rather,must affirmatively produce rebuttal evidence an obligation that it did not fulfill here.second,he asserts that a defendant only has to provide material information to obtain access to the safety valve and that any attributable to him were immaterial.third,he asserts that,in all events,the district court finding was clearly erroneous.all three assertions lack force.
the need for rebuttal evidence.full disclosure is the price that congress has attached to rel
