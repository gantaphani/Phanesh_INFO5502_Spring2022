defendant appellant dáz bermúdez díaz brings two challenges to the month sentence entered by the district court after he pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we derive the facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psr,and the sentencing hearing transcript.united states.ocasio cancel,cir.the resolution of this appeal does not require a detailed recitation of the facts.it will suffice to say that police officers found two handguns one of which was fully loaded with a round in the chamber,three magazines,ammunition rounds,more than small bags of crack cocaine,small bags of powder cocaine,and drug paraphernalia in a vehicle in which díaz was the sole passenger.shortly after his arrest,díaz admitted to police officers that the drugs and some of the paraphernalia belonged to him.later,in his plea agreement,he also admitted that he knowingly and intentionally possessed the discovered firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.
díaz was indicted for the firearm offense,c a,as well as one count of possession with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of powder cocaine,a,b c,and one count of possession with intent to distribute grams or more of crack cocaine,id.a,b b.díaz pleaded guilty to the firearm count pursuant to a written plea agreement.in return,the government agreed to recommend the mandatory minimum and guidelines sentence of months in prison for the firearm count and to ask the court to dismiss the two drug distribution counts.see c a i b.at sentencing,the district court agreed to dismiss the drug counts,but it rejected the recommended month sentence for the firearm count and instead imposed a month prison sentence.díaz timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
plea withdrawal 
díaz first argues that,under.c,he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea after the district court rejected the month sentence recommended by both parties in the plea agreement this argument rests on a faulty premise.rule c does not apply to the recommended sentence in díaz plea agreement,which was a sentencing recommendation under rule c b the plea withdrawal opportunity in rule c applies only to plea agreement provisions under rule c a charge dismissals and rule c c binding,stipulated sentences this conclusion should come as no surprise to díaz.the plea agreement and the transcript of the colloquy make it abundantly clear that díaz knew that the district court was free to reject the month recommended sentence and that he would not have an opportunity to withdraw his plea if the court did so.
díaz tries to rescue his argument by pointing out that his plea agreement was a hybrid rule c a rule c b agreement.this is addition to the month recommended sentence under rule c b,díaz plea agreement required the government to move to dismiss the two drug distribution counts under rule c a.and whereas a rule c b sentencing recommendation does not bind the court,the district court may only accept or reject the rule c a charge dismissal provisions of a plea agreement.c a.but here the district court did accept the rule c a provision of díaz plea agreement by granting the government motion to dismiss the two drug counts.see united states schiradelly,cir.the district court therefore committed no error by not giving díaz an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea,and certainly no plain error,as díaz concedes he failed to object below.see united states medina villegas,cir.
sentencing challenge 
díaz next challenges the reasonableness of his month sentence.we normally review the reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion,united states del valle rodríguez,cir,but díaz failed to raise below any of his current objections.we therefore review for plain error.medina villegas,at.this requires díaz to show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.id.quoting united states mangual garcia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence,we first look for procedural errors,including failing to consider appropriate sentencing factors,predicating a sentence on clearly erroneous facts,or neglecting to explain the rationale for a variant sentence adequately.del valle rodríguez,at.our review then shifts to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.id.
procedural reasonableness 
díaz claimed procedural error is that the district court failed to consider the a sentencing factors,and instead imposed the month sentence based solely on its doubt about a statement he made in the psr that his involvement in the gun crime was the product of ignorance.we disagree.
first,the district court did not plainly fail to consider the section a factors.the court section a analysis was admittedly brief,and an easy resolution of this issue is thwarted somewhat by a garbled sentencing transcript.after the court found that the psr adequately applied the guidelines,the transcript shows that the sentencing judge said t he court has considered the other sentencing factors in e and unintelligible.it seems fair to infer from context and the reference to other sentencing factors that the district court expressly cited section a but that its statement was.the district court statement that it considered the section a factors is entitled to some weight.united states vega salgado,cir quoting united states clogston,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the district court review of díaz criminal history and the facts of his court at one point corrected defense counsel on the location of the first gun showed that it was familiar with the nature of the offense as well as díaz characteristics and background.see medina villegas,at.and,t o cinch the matter,díaz has not identified any factors that make it likely that he would receive a different sentence on remand.id.at.
second,the district court was permitted to consider the sincerity of díaz explanation for his conduct,that he did it out of ignorance.díaz himself placed his sincerity at issue.in his sentencing memorandum and at the hearing,díaz argued for a month sentence based in part on his acceptance of responsibility and recognition of the consequences of his actions.in doing so,he specifically cited his statement in the psr that he did it out of ignorance.furthermore,whether díaz was sincere in accepting responsibility was relevant for considering whether a sentence afford s adequate deterrence and protect s the public from further crimes of the defendant.a b c see also united states jiménez beltre,cir en banc a court reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.nor was the district court disbelief of díaz sincerity clearly erroneous.díaz prior encounters with law enforcement and his admission that the drugs belonged to him provided ample support for the district court doubt about his professed ignorance.
substantive reasonableness 
finding no procedural error,we turn to díaz contention that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.he claims that the district court did not sufficiently justify a sentence months above the guidelines sentence of months in prison.b c a i see del valle rodríguez,at where a court imposes a sentence above the gsr,it must justify the upward variance.the hallmarks of a substantively reasonable sentence are a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states martin,cir.
the primary reason the court gave for its sentence was díaz lack of sincerity in attributing his involvement in the offense to ignorance.the sincerity of díaz explanation for the offense was relevant to assessing the need for deterrence and his capacity for rehabilitation.see a b d martin,at the potential for rehabilitation also may comprise grist for the sentencing court mill.this reason alone may not have sufficed as a plausible rationale for such a steep variance,but the
