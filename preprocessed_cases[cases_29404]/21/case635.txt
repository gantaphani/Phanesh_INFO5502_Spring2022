in this appeal from a criminal conviction following a jury trial,appellant richard rodrigue asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a state search warrant.his sole argument on appeal is that the affidavit submitted by law enforcement in support of the requested search warrant failed to establish probable cause.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
the relevant background facts,gleaned from the affidavit of deputy guy dow of the piscataquis county maine sheriff department the sheriff department,are undisputed.on may,agent jon richards of the maine drug enforcement agency notified the sheriff department that he had seen a large rental truck on a back logging road.the next day,sheriff deputy george mccormick investigated the report and followed tire tracks to a large quantity of brand potting soil deposited at the end of the road.two days later,agent richards informed deputy mccormick of another large deposit of potting soil nearby,and two days after that,while surveying the area from an airplane,deputy mccormick spotted a large marijuana cultivation site.also visible from the air was a red car parked at the end of a road near the site.later the same day,while surveying the logging road from the ground,deputy mccormick observed a similar red car bearing a maine license plate emerging from the area.according to the maine department of motor vehicles dmv records,the license plate was listed to a white chevrolet caprice,and it had expired in.
the following day,may,deputy mccormick and a colleague returned to the logging road to photograph the potting soil,which had not been disturbed.they then proceeded to the cultivation site,where they observed a roughly growing area with potting soil distributed across it,and approximately marijuana plants still in containers.also present at the cultivation site was an unregistered white polaris vehicle atv.a path suitable for the atv led from the cultivation site to the location on the logging road where the original deposit of potting soil had been discovered.
on june,deputy mccormick located a maroon subaru station wagon approximately five miles from the cultivation and deposit sites that bore the same maine license plate number as the red car he spotted on the logging road three days earlier.deputy dow could see loose potting soil,which he identified as,in the rear of the car.he also observed that both front tires of the car were flat.
two days later,on june,deputy mccormick and a colleague returned to the cultivation site and observed that the marijuana plants had not yet been transplanted from their containers,but that the atv had been moved.the following day,deputy mccormick inspected the subaru and saw that the license plate had been removed.he also observed a red gasoline can and two spare tires in the rear of the station wagon.
on june,deputy mccormick and a colleague again visited the subaru and the soil deposit site on the logging road.the subaru tires had been replaced and the license plate was still missing,and the amount of potting soil on the logging road was significantly reduced.as the officers left the deposit site,they passed a small black volkswagen truck driving towards the deposit site bearing a license plate registered to rodrigue.a short time later,the truck exited the area loaded with potting soil the officers attempted to follow the truck but soon lost it.they checked the cultivation site and observed that while the marijuana plants were still not transplanted,the atv was no longer parked at the site.
the next day,deputy mccormick and two of his colleagues decided to confiscate the marijuana plants.upon arriving at the cultivation site,they observed that the marijuana had been removed from the containers and planted in the soil.they dug up and confiscated plants and some of the from the site.the lot numbers from this matched the lot numbers from the observed earlier at the deposit site.
that same day,a black volkswagen truck and a white polaris atv were reported parked at a campsite at knight landing on schoodic lake when deputy dow visited the campsite on june,he determined that the atv parked behind the campsite was very similar to the one depicted in pictures from the cultivation site,and that the license plate on the black volkswagen truck matched the license plate on the black volkswagen truck that had been observed hauling on the logging road.with this information collected,deputy dow prepared an affidavit in support of an application for a warrant to search the campsite for,inter alia,marijuana,drug paraphernalia and the atv.
the application was filed the next day,and a state district court judge concluded that probable cause existed and therefore issued the warrant.the ensuing search at knight landing resulted in the seizure of marijuana plants.rodrigue,who was asleep inside the camp at the time of the search,was subsequently charged with five criminal counts of violating federal drug laws.after a jury trial,he was convicted of three of the charges,conspiracy to possess with intent to manufacture and distribute or more marijuana plants,in violation of a,b b,and count i manufacture and possession with intent to distribute marijuana,in violation of a,b b,and count ii and use of a firearm during and in relation to,or possessing a firearm in furtherance of,the commission of the offenses outlined in counts i and ii,in violation of c a i 
before trial,rodrigue moved to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to the state search warrant,asserting that there was no probable cause to support the warrant,and also that the officers violated the knock and announce rule of the fourth amendment.the magistrate judge recommended denying the motion on both grounds.in determining whether there was a sufficient nexus between the marijuana growing operation and the camp to support the probable cause determination,the magistrate judge focused on the fact that the black volkswagen truck and the white polaris atv were seen parked adjacent to the camp on two separate occasions describing the case as a close call,and citing united states barnard,cir,for the proposition that in a doubtful or marginal case,the court defers to the issuing magistrate determination of probable cause,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court defer to the state court conclusion.the district court adopted the magistrate judge factual findings and accepted without discussion the conclusion that the warrant was supported by probable cause united states sherman,d.evidence of the seized marijuana plants was introduced at trial.
