second sentencing and appeal 
at a resentencing hearing on june,judge laffitte found correy responsible for at least kilograms of cocaine,again resulting in a base offense level of.judge laffitte again added a enhancement for possession of a weapon,for a total offense level of,and placed correy in criminal history category vi.he then correy month sentence and supervised release term.
on june,this court again vacated correy and his sentences.id.at.we found that,as to all defendants,the sentencing judge did not heed our instruction to thoroughly review the record in order to evaluate witnesses credibility and make individualized determinations,but rather persisted in his view that the jury verdict was controlling and categorically refuse d to engage in a credibility assessment.id.at.further,as to correy,the sentencing judge relied on a clearly deficient presentence report which,i ncredibly,was the exact same report as was used at his prior sentencing,and which simply included allegations copied from the indictment rather than providing the individualized,assessment that this court demanded.id.at.on remand,we insist ed that the sentencing judge resolve these issues.id.at.
third sentencing 
on july,the probation department filed an amended presentence report in preparation for resentencing.after summarizing trial testimony related to correy conduct,the report assigned correy responsibility for over kilograms of cocaine and recommended offense levels consistent with correy previous sentences.correy objected,challenging the credibility of the testimony the probation department relied on.he further claimed that the government was unable to prove he was responsible for more than five kilograms of cocaine,though he conceded that his conduct involved to kilograms of cocaine.
on october,following judge laffitte retirement,district judge gustavo gelpí presided over correy third sentencing.relying on the amended presentence report,and interpreting this court remand order as preventing him from making a finding below five kilograms of cocaine,judge gelpí found correy responsible for between five and fifteen kilograms of cocaine,resulting in a base offense level of.he declined to grant correy a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and added enhancements for correy possession of a weapon and career offender status,raising correy total offense level to and placing him in criminal history category vi.out of a guidelines range of months to life,judge gelpí sentenced correy to an incarcerative term of months followed by seven years of supervised release.
on october,correy filed a motion under federal rule of criminal procedure a to correct his sentence,arguing that judge gelpí erred by failing to consider prosecutorial misconduct during his trial as justification for a downward departure in his sentence judge gelpí denied the motion on the grounds that correy had waived the issue by not raising it at the october sentencing hearing,and the district court lacked jurisdiction to revisit the sentence pursuant to rule a.
this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
before us,correy challenges his sentence on four grounds first,he says that judge gelpí failed to follow this court instruction to make individualized,findings on remand.second,he claims that judge gelpí erroneously refused to consider his request for an sentence reduction.third,he contends that his sentence was procedurally flawed and substantively unreasonable.fourth,he says that judge gelpí wrongly denied his rule a motion for correction of sentence.but because we remand based on correy first challenge,we need not address the remainder.
individualized drug quantity determination 
correy first contends that judge gelpí refused to follow this court order to make an individualized finding by reviewing the record and assessing witness credibility upon remand.correy says judge gelpí mistakenly concluded that he lacked authority to find correy personally responsible for under five kilograms of cocaine based on this court determination that the amount was five kilograms or more.as a result,correy says,judge gelpí improperly declined to consider his claim that he was individually responsible for only to kilograms of cocaine.
