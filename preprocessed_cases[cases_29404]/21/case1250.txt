defendants dennis michael nouri michael nouri,reza eric nouri eric nouri,and anthony martin martin appeal from judgments of conviction entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin.all three were convicted in a jury trial of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,wire fraud,and commercial bribery in violation of,and of securities fraud in violation of b and,b,and.michael and eric nouri were also convicted of wire fraud in violation of,and,and of commercial bribery in violation of a and.michael nouri was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,eric nouri to months imprisonment,and martin to months imprisonment.
each of the appellants contends on this appeal that the district court erred in instructing the jury on fraud by deprivation of honest services,especially in the context of securities fraud,and that there was insufficient evidence to sustain convictions for securities fraud.martin also contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of wire fraud,that the district court erroneously limited his examination of a witness,and that his sentence was unreasonable.we find no merit to appellants arguments and accordingly affirm the judgments.
background 
we summarize the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the government,as required in assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.united states hsu,cir.
michael nouri was the president,chief executive officer,and chairman of the board of directors of smart online,a public company,which provided assorted assistance to small businesses.the stock of smart online was traded beginning april,on the over the counter bulletin board.eric nouri is michael nouri younger brother and was employed at smart online as a content engineer.smart online never turned a profit.
a.the market manipulation scheme 
william blume,a licensed stockbroker who worked at maxim group maxim from through,testified pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government that he met michael nouri in may and told michael that he,blume,could pay brokers to purchase smart online stock.michael nouri agreed to this plan and gave blume a check for to be used for such payments to brokers.
sometime after that initial meeting,michael nouri asked blume to enter into consulting agreements with smart online for everybody protection.trial tr.blume agreed but specified that the consulting contracts be in the names of his wife,myra,and son,mitchell,rather than his own.blume explained that he did not want his firm to know of his receipt of payments.michael nouri did not object to making the consulting agreements and sending the payments in the name of blume wife and son.eric nouri facilitated the process of setting up the agreements.the agreements did not reveal that the payments to blume wife and son were in exchange for blume customers purchases of smart online shares.
once the paperwork was signed,blume began receiving payments from smart online as compensation for purchasing smart online shares for his customers accounts and for getting other brokers to do the same.typically,blume was paid for each share of smart online purchased.between and,blume received over from smart online,usually by wire transfers sent by eric nouri.the wire transfers from smart online were in the names of mitchell,andrew,or myra blume.blume did not reveal to his customers for whom smart online stock was purchased that he was receiving money from smart online for their purchases of smart online stock.blume testified that he did not tell them about the payments because if they knew,they would not have purchased the shares and would have told his employer,maxim,about the payments.blume did not want maxim to know about the payments because he understood that his receipt of the payments was illegal and violated maxim rule that its brokers not receive compensation from third parties.
blume recruited several brokers,including the appellant martin,ruben serrano,james doolan,and alan kaiten all of whom worked at maxim as well as alain lustig who worked at jesup lamont to purchase smart online stock for their customers,for which the brokers would receive a portion of the money blume received.blume told martin he would pay martin if martin customers bought smart online shares and that the money was from michael nouri,the ceo of smart online.normally,brokers were compensated by receiving a portion of sales commissions charged by their employer to their customers,and commissions were generally under five percent of the amount of the transaction.maxim average commission was approximately two percent.blume paid martin approximately half a dozen times for buying smart online stock,at times for amounts as large as shares.
in addition to the brokers named above,david gardner,a broker who worked at vfinance between and,and who testified pursuant to a cooperation agreement,received payments from michael nouri as the president of smart online for purchasing smart online shares in his customers accounts and did not disclose the payments to his customers.
gardner entered into a consulting agreement with smart online in july and then promoted smart online to other brokers in july and august.shortly thereafter,smart online began compensating gardner for his customers purchases of smart online shares.gardner purchased over shares of smart online for his customers.smart online paid gardner more for those purchases than the authorized brokerage commissions he made on them.at michael nouri direction,gardner purchased smart online stock for his customers at an inflated price that was higher than the customers otherwise could have obtained.
gardner did not disclose to vfinance that he was being paid by smart online to purchase smart online shares because he understood his receipt of such payments violated the securities laws and vfinance policy.gardner told michael nouri that he had not disclosed the payments to vfinance.with the exception of one customer,gardner did not inform his customers that he received compensation from smart online for their purchases of smart online stock.gardner also did not disclose to his customers that michael nouri was directing him to purchase shares for them at higher prices than he otherwise could have obtained.
in addition to using smart online funds to pay blume and gardner for purchases of smart online stock,michael and eric nouri would also often direct them when to buy shares and at what prices.for example,michael nouri would frequently direct gardner to delay a purchase until the end of the day to so as show interest in the stock at the market close and to purchase shares at prices higher than the prices at which they were offered.blume and gardner both testified that they understood that the purpose of paying brokers to purchase smart online shares,and of purchasing shares as michael nouri directed,was to generate volume and to elevate the share price,and thereby to help smart online qualify for listing on the nasdaq stock market.william lederer,chairman and ceo of socrates media,llc in,testified that,in august,michael nouri told him of nouri desire to have smart online stock trade on nasdaq and said he was supporting the stock price and could prevent a decline in the stock price using his contacts with brokers.
in september,smart online submitted a listing application to nasdaq.at that time,smart online stock price was over per share,having risen from five months earlier,when it first traded on the over the counter bulletin board.on january,nasdaq approved smart online application.the securities and exchange commission sec,however,suspended trading in smart online stock on january,before its listing became effective.
in december,the federal bureau of investigation fbi approached blume regarding his connection to smart online,and around january,after the suspension of smart online stock,the fbi similarly approached gardner.gardner and blume agreed to cooperate with the fbi by allowing the fbi to record their conversations with michael nouri,eric nouri,and brokers,and to photograph blume paying the brokers.in recorded conversations prior to the trading suspension,michael and eric nouri directed blume when,how,and at what price blume and his brokers should purchase smart online shares,and discussed paying blume for the purchases.in another recorded conversation,blume and eric nouri talked about purchases of smart online shares and about paperwork relating to the wire transfers.blume also recorded a discussion with martin about obtaining smart online stockholder list so martin would be able to suggest to stockholders that they buy more shares,and about blume making payment to martin.
after the sec suspended trading in smart online,michael nouri instructed blume and gardner in recorded conversations to tell the sec that they never paid brokers to purchase shares and that they purchased smart online shares because they believed in the company.the sec later lifted its trading suspension.in subsequent conversations,michael nouri said he would continue paying blume to purchase smart online shares,but cautioned blume to be careful.
brokers misrepresentations and omissions to customers 
several regulatory and compliance officials testified at trial about the rules that apply to stockbrokers.william park,a director in the enforcement department of the financial industry regulatory authority finra,testified as an expert in the securities industry about the legal obligations of brokers in dealing with their customers and related rules.according to his testimony,brokers have obligations to be fair,just,and equitable with their clients,to make sure they give their clients all the information necessary to make an informed decision,and to execute clients orders as quickly as possible.industry rules,furthermore,require a broker to get written approval from their firm before accepting compensation from an officer or director of a company to solicit customers to purchase the company stock.the company would also be required to disclose those payments in public filings.
michael clements,former chief compliance office of jesup lamont,alain lustig employer,testified that brokers were required under finra rules to disclose any outside business obligations to their firms and under jesup lamont rules to obtain approval from jesup lamont compliance group prior to accepting compensation for business activity from persons other than jesup lamont.john sergio,a former examiner at the national association of securities dealers the predecessor to finra and chief operating officer of maxim,martin employer,testified that industry rules required that a broker seek,in writing,and obtain his employer approval for any business activities other than his employment at his securities firm.the rules also prohibited stockbrokers from receiving compensation from a company for selling the company stock to their customers and from receiving direction from a third party regarding when or at what price to place a customer order unless the customer had granted that third party power of attorney.he also testified that maxim supervisory procedures explicitly required employees to disclose outside business activities prior to engaging in them and prohibited employees from offering or soliciting bribes.none of the defendant brokers who worked at maxim disclosed to maxim their business arrangements related to smart online.
the government also called as witnesses three investors whose brokers martin,lustig,and serrano had either recommended or purchased smart online stock in exchange for payments from smart online.in no case had the brokers told their customers that the brokers would receive compensation from smart online for the customers purchases of smart online stock.had the investors known,they would not have allowed their brokers to purchase smart online stock.martin and serrano told their customers that smart online was a good investment.
defense case 
michael nouri called two witnesses jeffrey lerose,the former chairman of the smart online board of directors,and henry nouri,michael brother and of smart online.lerose testified about smart online investor relations program,which was run by michael nouri and two other individuals,and which was suspended after the sec suspended trading in smart online.lerose acknowledged he was never told that brokers were being paid money for purchasing smart online shares for their customers.he believed such payments should have been disclosed in smart online public filings,which they never were.henry nouri testified that,while he was a member of the smart online board of directors,he and the other board members approved investment relations contracts.his understanding was that the investor relations consultants were hired to find investors for smart online,but he was not involved with dealing with the investor relations contracts or consultants.
martin called one witness,reverend robert richardson,martin friend who worked as a broker with martin in the late and used martin as a broker in the.based on martin recommendation and information richardson reviewed about smart online,richardson purchased shares of smart online.richardson acknowledged that martin did not tell richardson that he was receiving payment from smart online in connection with his customers purchases of smart online stock.richardson testified that if he had known that martin was receiving such payment,it would not have made a difference to him and that he never doubted the sincerity of martin opinions about smart online.
discussion 
jury charge 
defendants contend the jury charge was erroneous in several respects.they argue that the wire fraud charge was erroneous in light of skilling united states,d.they also argue that the court erred by including fraud concepts in the securities fraud instructions and by failing to explain the significance between discretionary and accounts as they relate to a broker fiduciary duty to his customers.martin claims that the court failed to provide the correct legal standard for the in connection with requirement in the securities fraud charge.while some of the defendants contentions are correct,there was no error that would justify vacating the convictions.
honest services wire fraud 
defendants contend the court instructions on wire fraud were erroneous because the court failed to limit the definition of wire fraud to bribery and kickback schemes,as mandated by the supreme court subsequent ruling in skilling united states,d we agree that the charge incorrectly stated the law.however,because there was no objection to the charge,we review the charge under the plain error standard and under that standard find the error did not affect substantial rights of the defendants.
where a defendant has preserved his claim of error by a timely objection calling the district court attention to the problem when the court would have the opportunity to fix the error,we review a district court jury charge de novo,and will vacate a conviction for an erroneous charge unless the error was harmless.see boyce soundview tech,cir.but where,as here,a defendant fails to make a timely objection,we review the instruction for plain error.d,b see also united states middlemiss,cir under the rule,we may overturn a conviction by reason of an error not timely raised at trial only if the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states marcus,d quoting puckett united states,d.
in determining whether error occurred,we examine the jury instructions based on the law as it stands at the time of the appeal.united states needham,cir quoting united states ballistrea,cir.accordingly,to determine whether the charge was correct,we must consider the supreme court subsequent ruling in skilling.in skilling,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of the fraud statute.the defendant in skilling had been convicted,inter alia,of conspiracy to commit fraud based on his undertaking to defraud enron shareholders by misrepresenting the company fiscal health,thereby artificially inflating its stock price and by personally profiting from that fraudulent scheme through the receipt of salary and bonuses and the sale of enron stock.at.the supreme court rejected the government argument that proscribed undisclosed by a public official or private employee,the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that,in order to preserve the statute from being unconstitutionally vague,criminalizes only the core of the case law.id.at.because it was not alleged that skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making misrepresentations,the court concluded that skilling did not commit fraud.id.at.it therefore vacated his conspiracy conviction.id.at.
in applying skilling limitation on wire fraud,we have explained that,to violate the right to honest services,the charged conduct must involve a quid pro quo,an intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an act.united states bruno,cir see also united states bahel,cir.thus,in bruno,we held that the district court charge that fraud encompassed an official failure to disclose that his interest in his private economic affairs clashed or appeared to clash with the proper administration of his office was erroneous after skilling because it did not require the jury to find that the fraud involved accept ance of bribes or kickbacks to be convicted of honest services fraud.at.
a similar error exists in the district court wire fraud charge to the jury in this case.the court charge on the wire fraud counts was,in relevant part,as follows 
the first element of a wire fraud count the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is the existence of a scheme or artifice to defraud others of money or property or the intangible right to honest services by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.
with respect to intangible rights,an employee inherently owes his employer a duty of honest,faithful,and disinterested service.specifically,in the context of this case,a broker owes the brokerage firm that employs him a duty to act in a way that is consistent with his employment agreement and not to abuse his position at the firm to engage in secret transactions based on his personal financial interests,if you find that a duty to disclose existed.
with respect to the alleged scheme to deprive the broker employer of the intangible right to the broker services,as i already told you,an employee owes a duty of honest services to his employer.to establish a deprivation of honest services under the wire fraud statute as against a particular defendant,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant you are considering participated in a scheme with the intention that a broker failed to provide honest services to his employer by making false and misleading representations.
the charge did not require the jury to find that the scheme involved the payment of bribes or kickbacks to convict on fraud.therefore,under skilling and bruno,this instruction was erroneous.
we nevertheless conclude that the convictions should not be overturned because the error did not affect defendants substantial rights.see united states cain,cir.in the ordinary case,to meet this standard an error must be prejudicial,which means that there must be a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.marcus.at see also united states dominguez benitez,d a defendant must satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.quoting strickland washington,d.where the error is an instruction that incorrectly omitted an element of the offense,we will sustain the conviction if we find that the jury would have returned the same verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gomez,cir neder united states,d omission of element in jury instructions is harmless if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.if the evidence bearing on the omitted element is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted,there is no basis for concluding that the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.gomez,at.where,however,the evidence supporting the omitted element was controverted,we look to a whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find in favor of the defendant on the omitted element,and,if there was,b whether the jury would nonetheless have returned the same verdict of guilty.needham,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we have no doubt that,had the jury been properly instructed,it would have found the defendants guilty of wire fraud based on their scheme of concealed bribery.the most persuasive demonstration comes from the fact that the jury did find michael nouri and eric nouri guilty of violating the commercial bribery statute,based on the same facts.it is therefore not open to dispute that the jury concluded that they committed the crime of commercial bribery.
even were the nouris not convicted of commercial bribery,we would find no likelihood of a different result had the jury been instructed on the narrowed scope of fraud.the scheme constituting the offense was a scheme of bribery involving secret payments to brokers by smart online,which were arranged by the nouris,in exchange for the brokers convincing their customers to purchase smart online stock.the evidence overwhelmingly showed the participation of all three appellants in the scheme with michael nouri orchestrating it,eric nouri helping to carry it out,and stockbroker martin receiving substantial bribes in exchange for procuring his customers purchases of smart online shares.we can see no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have reached a different verdict on the fraud charges against defendants had the jury been instructed,in accordance with skilling,that the offense of fraud could be based only on a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a bribery or kickback scheme.
we conclude that,notwithstanding jury instructions that did not conform to the narrowed scope of wire fraud under skilling,the appellants can not satisfy the standard.
honest services securities fraud 
defendants also assert that the district court committed prejudicial error by including reference to the right to honest services in its jury instructions on the offense of securities fraud under b and and b.once again,because defendants made no timely objection on this ground,we review under the standard of plain error.see middlemiss,at.although we agree that the court should not have included this concept in the securities fraud charge,it was not reversible error as it did not affect substantial rights or cause injustice.the court instructions taken as a whole permitted the jury to find the defendants guilty only if the jurors found that the government had proved all the required elements of securities fraud.
the court did tell the jury that a scheme to defraud is a plan to deprive another of money or property,including the intangible right of honest services,by trick,deceit,deception,or swindle.trial tr.emphasis added.then,in instructing on securities fraud committed by failure to disclose material facts,the court stated that a fiduciary owes a duty of honest services to his or her customer,including a duty to disclose all material facts concerning the transaction entrusted to it.trial tr.emphasis added.in the same context,the court said that a fiduciary owes a duty of honest services to his principal,including a duty to disclose all material facts relevant to an investment decision of the principal.trial tr.emphasis added.
defendants correctly argue that the concept of deprivation of honest services is not part of the definition of fraud occurring in the securities laws set forth in title of the united states code.the statute providing that a scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services is,and that provision applies only to offenses specified in chapter of title,including the wire fraud charge against the defendants.it has no application to securities fraud offenses defined in title.
defendants argue that,because of the court reference to deprivation of honest services,they were deprived of the opportunity to have the jury pass individually on all the necessary elements of securities fraud.as to the scheme to defraud based on the concealment of bribes from the nouris and smart online to brokers to entice the brokers customers to buy smart online stock,apart from the use of the means or instruments of interstate commerce,those elements included whether the omitted facts were material,whether a broker was under a duty to disclose the bribe offer when recommending the purchase,whether the omission was in connection with a purchase or sale of a security,and scienter.see first jersey,cir see also chiarella united states,d.as for the scheme to defraud based on fraudulent and misleading representations,the elements were essentially the same,including whether the misrepresentations were material,were made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,and were made with scienter.see vancook,cir matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d setting forth elements private plaintiff is required to prove.on the facts of this case,defendants argument has no force.
the inappropriate references to honest services did not expose the defendants to a risk of conviction without the jury having found the essential elements of the securities fraud crime.it made no practical difference whether the court instructions presented the issue to the jury under the generalized rubric of employment of a scheme to defraud,a plan to deprive another of money or property by deceit,omission of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading,or depriving another of the right to honest services.each of those formulations can cover infinitely broad possibilities.but the jury was not permitted under the court instructions to find guilt based on any scheme to defraud,depriving another of money by deceit,omission of material fact,or deprivation of honest services.the instructions made clear that,regardless of which of those generalizing rubrics was considered as the umbrella term covering the charges,the court instructions permitted the jury to find the defendants guilty only if the jurors found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants either participated in a scheme for the payment by the nouris and smart online of bribes to the brokers in return for getting their customers to buy smart online stock,which the brokers concealed from their customers or participated in a scheme in which brokers made material misrepresentations to their customers when convincing their customers to purchase or purchasing for them smart online stock.see trial tr.as to either theory,the court instructions ensured that the jury could find guilt only upon finding all the essential elements.see trial tr.fraudulent and misleading representations or failure to disclose facts for which there was a duty to disclose in connection with a purchase or sale of securities materiality scienter 
and even if the reference to deprivation of honest services in connection with a scheme to defraud had made it theoretically possible for the jury to find guilt without expressly considering either the materiality of what had been concealed or the question whether the brokers were under a duty to disclose,on the facts of this case there can have been no effect on defendants substantial rights or a miscarriage of justice no finding of guilt without satisfaction of the essential elements.if a broker has been bribed by the issuer of a security to get his customers to buy that security,the broker failure to tell the customer of the fact of the bribe offer while recommending the purchase of the security or in purchasing for a discretionary account is,as a matter of law,the omission of a material fact,which the broker is under a duty to reveal.the broker expectation of a bribe paid by the issuer in exchange for the customer purchase of the issuer stock is a piece of information of crucial importance to the customer because the broker expectation of the bribe strongly suggests that the recommendation is motivated more to benefit the broker than to benefit the customer.at the very least it suggests the customer should seriously question the genuineness or reliability of the recommendation.the same is true where the broker exercises discretionary authority to purchase the stock for the customer without needing to make a recommendation.
because the concealed fact of the bribes would be of crucial importance to the broker customer in evaluating the broker recommendation,that fact is,as a matter of law,a material fact,which the broker is under a duty to disclose.thus,any possibility the jurors might have reached their guilty verdicts without expressly focusing on the question of the materiality of the fact of the bribe offers,or on the brokers duty to disclose it to their customers,can not have affected any defendant substantial rights or caused a miscarriage of justice.
defendants further argue that they were prejudiced by the court instruction to the effect that a broker,if the broker is a fiduciary,owes a duty of honest services to his or her customer.trial tr.see also id.this unwarranted reference to honest services was harmless,however,because the court went on to explain the duty in terms of a duty to disclose all material facts concerning the transaction entrusted to it,trial tr.see also id,which accurately describes the duty of a broker who has a fiduciary relationship or a similar relation of trust and confidence with his customer,see united states szur,cir broker has a duty to use reasonable efforts to give its principal information relevant to the affairs that have been entrusted to it internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as noted,as a matter of law,the bribe offer in connection with a recommendation is a material fact,which must be disclosed when a broker recommends or purchases a security for a customer.
failure to instruct on discretionary non discretionary accounts 
defendants also contend,again raising the issue for the first time on appeal,that,in its charge on fraud by failure to disclose,the court erred in failing to explain the significance of the difference between discretionary and accounts,permitting the jury to believe that all brokers had a fiduciary duty to disclose outside compensation to their customers.we find no merit in their argument.the court instructed the jury on the circumstances that make a broker a fiduciary and thus enabled the jurors to distinguish between the circumstances that imposed fiduciary obligations on a broker and those that did not.
in connection with instruction 
defendant martin also argues that the district court erred in its substantive securities fraud instruction by failing to explain to the jury that fraud,which is merely incidental to the sale of a security,does not satisfy the requirement of rule that the fraud be in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.we review a district court refusal to issue requested jury instructions de novo.united states desinor,cir.in addition to demonstrating that the given instruction was erroneous,where the defendant requested a different instruction than the one actually given,the defendant bears the burden of showing that the requested instruction accurately represented the law in every respect and that,viewing as a whole the charge actually given,the defendant was prejudiced.united states wilkerson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we find no error in the court refusal to so instruct the jury.
the supreme court has repeatedly held that rule requirement that a fraud be in connection with the purchase or sale of a security is easily satisfied.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d emphasizing the broad interpretation given to b and rule in connection with requirement,which is satisfied where the alleged fraud coincide s with the purchase or sale of securities super
