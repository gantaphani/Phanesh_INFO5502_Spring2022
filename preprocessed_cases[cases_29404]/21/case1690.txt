factual background 
spallone original sentence 
on september,after several witnesses had testified against him at trial,spallone pleaded guilty to two counts of income tax evasion in violation of.on august,he was sentenced to concurrent terms of incarceration and terms of supervised release with a special condition that he pay restitution to the united states in the amount of,plus interest and penalties.he was further sentenced to a special assessment on each count of conviction for a total of.on consent of the parties,the court entered an order on august,correcting the restitution amount to reflect the victim true loss of.see.a stating that w ithin days after sentencing,the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error.
b.the order reducing sentence pursuant to rule b 
following imposition of judgment,spallone began to cooperate with federal authorities,in consideration whereof the government,on july,moved in the district court for a reduction of spallone sentence pursuant to.b the government candidly advised the court that it was not then in a position to assess the value of spallone cooperation nevertheless,it filed the motion to prevent the lapse of the rule limitations period.the government stated that it would submit supporting papers or withdraw the motion as soon as it had fully evaluated spallone assistance.
nine months later,on april,the government filed a letter with the court detailing the investigative leads supplied by spallone.acknowledging that spallone cooperation had not yet led to any prosecutions,the government urged the court to rule on the pending rule b motion to ensure that spallone received consideration before he served his entire term of incarceration.prosecution letter to court,at.in response to what appears to have been an informal court inquiry as to whether the government opposed a sentence reduction to time served,the government filed another letter stating that it did not.prosecution letter to court,in as much as your honor presided over the trial,took the defendant plea and imposed the sentence,the government has no objection to any reduction of the defendant sentence that your honor deems appropriate.
by order dated april,judge mishler granted the government rule b motion,ruling as follows 
on april,the government respectfully submitted an application for a reduction of sentence pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure in reference to the above named defendant sylvio spallone.
the government having no objection to any reduction of the defendant sentence as stated in their letter dated april,
it is,ordered that the defendant sylvio spallone be sentenced to time served.
united states spallone.
judge mishler did not thereafter enter an amended judgment of conviction in spallone case.instead,it appears that a copy of his april,order was simply forwarded to the bureau of prisons,which promptly released spallone,thereby sparing him the further six months imprisonment,four months custody in a house,and ten weeks home detention that he would otherwise have been required to serve pursuant to his original prison sentence.
a release notice by the bureau of prisons advised spallone of his obligation to report to a probation officer within three days of arrival in his resident district and supplied the name and business address of the chief probation officer for the eastern district of new york.the same release order,on a line intended to alert spallone to outstanding obligations including fine,restitution,noted,presumably meaning not applicable.
c.the motion to compel supervised release and restitution 
following his release from custody,spallone did not report to the united states probation department to begin serving his term of supervised release accordingly,by letter motion dated november,the government requested the district court to order spallone to comply with the supervision and restitution provisions of his judgment of conviction,arguing that judge mishler april,order reduced only the incarceratory terms of spallone sentence.
in support of its motion,the government explained that its april,request for a ruling on the rule b motion had been prompted by discussions with spallone counsel,who was concern ed that the defendant would serve his entire sentence prior to the completion of the government investigation and that,therefore,the defendant would not receive any reward for his cooperation.prosecution letter to court,at.the government noted that during these discussions,there was never any consideration that the defendant term of supervised release or his restitution payments be modified.the sole issue was when would the defendant be released from incarceration.id.at.the government asserted that the court april,order answered this question,effectively ordering spallone immediate release.id.but a t no time did the court abrogate its prior order that the defendant complete years of supervised release and make restitution.id.
in a memorandum and order dated december,judge hurley granted the government motion and ordered spallone to serve the term of supervised release and to pay restitution ordered in his august,judgment of conviction.judge hurley ruled that the april,order granting rule b relief was not a superseding judgment imposing an entirely new sentence,as defendant argued,but simply a mechanism to modify the incarceration aspect of the earlier judgment,with no effect on the restitution and supervised release components of that judgment.united states spallone,order at.in support of this interpretation,judge hurley cited circumstances giving rise to the order 
the nature of the april,order must be viewed in the undisputed context in which it was issued defense counsel asked the government to make application to judge mishler to reduce the incarceration portion of the sentence so that spallone would receive some benefit from his post sentence cooperation neither party mentioned the restitution or supervised release portions of judge mishler sentence during those discussions and the government explained to judge mishler in its letter of april,that it was making the rule b motion then,rather than later,because otherwise spallone would have served his entire term of incarceration before the matter was presented to the court.
id.at.he further noted that judge mishler had entered n o amended judgment to eliminate the restitution and supervised release portions of defendant sentence.id.at.because the april,order,thus interpreted,did not reduce the supervised release and restitution sentences stated in the judgment of conviction,judge hurley concluded that he could grant the government application without any need to correct an error in the april,order,action that would have implicated the limitations of.a and id.at 
on spallone motion for reconsideration,judge hurley clarified that his interpretation of the april,order was not based simply on the fact that that ruling was labeled an order rather than a judgment,but on the totality of circumstances.citing the seventh circuit decision in united states niemiec,cir,he concluded that such circumstances were properly considered in interpreting ambiguities in a court order.united states spallone,order at.
ii.discussion 
a.a court inherent authority to interpret ambiguities in its judgments 
spallone argues that we must reverse the district court order of december,because the court had no authority to modify or correct the sentence of time served imposed on april.to be sure,a court may not resentence a defendant unless expressly mandated by this court,see,or pursuant to the strict conditions established by.or.see united states werber,cir united states gangi,cir see also united states handa,cir.this limiting principle prohibits a court from altering a judgment that is clear on its face,even if not reflective of the court actual intent.see united states werber,at.but where an order or judgment is unclear,a court retains inherent authority to interpret ambiguities.
the law has long recognized that the mere construction of a decree involves no challenge of its validity.louis.city.wabash.thus,if a judgment is clear and unambiguous,a court must adopt,and give effect to,the plain meaning of the judgment.d judgments west.but,if the judgment is ambiguous,the reviewing court must construe its meaning,and in doing so may resort to the record upon which the judgment was based.id.indeed,the power to construe a court decree is essential to its enforcement.see sec hermil,cir included in a district court power to administer its decrees is the power to construe and interpret the language of the original order.
in this case,we conclude that judge hurley december,order did not exceed the court authority.the order does not attempt to resentence spallone or to correct a perceived error in judge mishler april,order granting rule b relief.rather,the december,order properly clarifies an ambiguity in the april,order with respect to the term sentenced by reasonably construing that term,in light of the totality of the circumstances,to mean that only the sentence of incarceration in defendant judgment of conviction was reduced.
b.the ambiguity in the april,order 
the april,order rules on an application for a reduction of sentence pursuant to rule b.united states spallone,order.in granting the motion,judge mishler ordered that spallone be sentenced to time served.id.emphasis added.the highlighted word is ambiguous because it is subject to more than one plausible construction.see,brass am.film,cir noting that language is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person internal quotation marks and citation omitted.it could be interpreted,as defendant submits,to mean that spallone entire sentence as stated in his august,judgment of conviction had been reduced to time served,thereby absolving him of any responsibility to satisfy the supervised release and restitution provisions of that judgment.on the other hand,the word can also be interpreted,as the government urges,to mean that spallone incarceratory sentence had been reduced from thirty months to time served with no change to the supervised release term and restitution condition in the judgment of conviction.
a sentence is commonly understood to be the order by which a court or judge imposes punishment or penalty upon a person found guilty.webster third new international dictionary in short,the judgment of conviction,see black law dictionary ed defining sentence as t he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty oxford english dictionary ed.the judicial determination of the punishment to be inflicted on a convicted criminal.under federal law,however,the april,order is not a judgment of conviction.see.k requiring judgment of conviction to set forth the plea,the jury verdict or the court findings,the adjudication,and the sentence 
the term sentence is also commonly understood to refer simply to the punishment or penalty imposed by the court.webster third new international dictionary accord black law dictionary the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer,for example,a sentence of years in prison oxford english dictionary the punishment to which a criminal is sentenced.so used,sentence sometimes refers to the totality of punishment imposed.see,united states handakas,cir noting that the defendant sentence included a term of imprisonment,a fine,an order of restitution,an order of forfeiture,and three years of supervised release united states sweeney,cir noting that sentence,as ultimately revised,included months of incarceration,a fine,an order of restitution,and a term of supervised release.on the other hand,with equal frequency,sentence is used to refer to each punishment within the judgment of conviction,most particularly to the term of incarceration.see,united states johnson,cir noting that on a sentencing remand wherein restitution was ordered,the court imposed a sentence of months incarceration united states boyd,cir per curiam noting that challenge to sentence faulted court for calculating restitution on one basis while calculating prison sentence on another united states bove,cir noting that application of the sentencing guidelines produced a concurrent prison sentence of months and day on each count,a term of supervised release,a special assessment and a fine see also c using term sentence to refer only to prison sentence in requiring a statement of reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point within a guideline range that exceeds months.
precisely because the word sentence can plausibly support different meanings,it was necessary and appropriate for judge hurley to interpret the april,order to clarify whether the sentence of time served,as imposed,superseded all punishments imposed in spallone judgment of conviction or only his prison term.
c.the april,order reduces only spallone incarceratory sentence 
standard of review 
the interpretation of the text of a court order or judgment is considered a conclusion of law subject to de novo review.see in re duplan,cir reviewing bankruptcy court interpretation of district court order de novo sec salomon,cir applying de novo review to terms of a final judgment.when an issuing judge interprets his own orders,we accord substantial deference to the draftsman,and we will not reverse the judge construction of an ambiguity in his own words except for abuse of discretion.see in re blackwood,cir explaining that such deference is premised on the truism that the draftsman of a document is uniquely situated to understand the intended meaning of that document county of suffolk stone webster eng g,cir stating that issuing judge interpretation should not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion truskoski espn,cir per curiam it is peculiarly within the province of the district court to determine the meaning of its own order.internal quotation marks omitted.that,however,is not this case.because judge hurley did not draft the april,order,we apply traditional de novo review to his interpretation.in re blackwood,at bankruptcy court interpretation of stipulation drafted by the parties entitled to no special deference 
interpreting ambiguities in court orders 
court orders are construed like other written instruments,except that the determining factor is not the intent of the parties,but that of the issuing court.see ford motor summit motor,cir stating that court responsibility is to construe a judgment as to give effect to the intention of the court,not to that of the parties quoting united states acres of land,mo
