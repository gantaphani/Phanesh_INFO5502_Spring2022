this criminal appeal presents the unusual situation in which the literal meaning of a sentencing statute has been disregarded to the detriment of a defendant.latie whitley appeals from the december,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard conway casey,district judge,following a trial.he was sentenced principally to concurrent terms of months for a hobbs act robbery and a career criminal firearms possession violation,plus a consecutive mandatory minimum term of months for discharging a firearm.his appeal challenges the imposition of the consecutive minimum sentence for discharging a firearm,see c a iii,both because the except clause of subsection c a exempts him from the minimum sentence,and because he lacked the mens rea that he asserts is required for a valid firearms discharge conviction.
we agree that the consecutive minimum sentence is inapplicable to whitley because he was subject to a higher minimum sentence as an armed career criminal.as a result,we need not consider whether the consecutive sentence provision requires mens rea.we therefore remand for resentencing.
background 
whitley participated in an armed robbery of a delicatessen in the bronx in november,during which he emptied the store cash register,pointed a gun at employees,and inadvertently discharged the firearm,injuring himself in the face.the indictment charged three counts.count one charged a hobbs act robbery,in violation of.count two charged using,carrying,and possessing a firearm that was discharged during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c a iii.count three,the armed career criminal offense,charged possessing a firearm after having been convicted of at least three violent felonies or serious drug offenses,in violation of g and e.count three was bifurcated for separate trial to avoid any prejudice from evidence of the prior offenses relevant to that count.the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts.
as to count two,the court,over whitley objection,instructed the jury to make a finding on whether the firearm was discharged and stated the discharge need not be intentional.the jury specifically found that the firearm was discharged.as to count three,the jury found that whitley had at least three prior convictions for robbery or narcotics offenses.
the report psr calculated an adjusted offense level of,based on a grouping of counts one and two,which,in criminal history category vi,yielded a sentencing range of to months.the psr recommended a consecutive sentence on count two.judge casey sentenced whitley to concurrent terms of months on counts one and three,plus months consecutively on count ii.
discussion 
the validity of whitley consecutive term depends on the proper construction of the language contained in subsection c of,particularly the introductory except clause of subdivision a of subsection c that subsection specifies three levels of minimum sentences for firearms activity in connection with a crime of violence,depending on whether the firearm was possessed,brandished,or discharged.the subsection provides 
except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime 
i be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years 
ii if the firearm is brandished,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and 
iii if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
c a emphasis added.where applicable,the five,seven,or sentences for possession,brandishing,or discharge,respectively must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment,including the term imposed for the underlying crime of violence.see id.c d ii.
subsection e of,the armed career criminal provision,requires a minimum term of fifteen years for any defendant who,like whitley,has been convicted of violating g prohibiting felons from possessing firearms in or affecting commerce,and has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.see e.
thus,if the except clause of subsection c a means what it literally says,the minimum sentence required by subdivision iii of that subsection for discharge of a firearm,which must run consecutively by virtue of subsection c d ii,does not apply to whitley because,in the words of that clause,a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law,namely,subsection e,which subjects him to a minimum sentence.
the government urges us to reject the literal meaning of the except clause because it is unsupported by the text,design,or the purpose of the statute,br.for appellee at,would produce illogical and distorted outcomes that congress clearly did not intend,and has been rejected by other circuits,id.at.we consider these arguments in turn.
a text.the government text argument curiously departs from the wording of the except clause.its brief reads,the prefatory exception clause in section c a states that unless some other statutory provision requires a higher minimum consecutive sentence for a firearm offense,one of the sentences specified in sections c a i through iii for use,brandishing,or discharge of a be imposed.id.at emphases added.however,the emphasized words,consecutive and firearm,do not appear in the except clause.proceeding from its rewritten version of the clause,the government then illustrates what it contends is the limited meaning of the clause.possession of an ordinary handgun in furtherance of a crime of violence would require only a consecutive sentence under subsection c a i possession of an assault rifle would require a higher consecutive sentence under subsection c b i and possession of a machine gun would require the still higher consecutive sentence under subsection c b ii.see id.at.but,in the government view,the except clause does not exempt whitley from the consecutive sentence prescribed by subsection c a iii for discharging a firearm because his conviction on count three,although requiring a higher minimum sentence,does not require a higher consecutive sentence.the flaw in the government argument,of course,is that the word consecutive does not appear in the text of the except clause.the clause at the start of subsection c exempts whitley from the minimum sentence for discharging a firearm,contained in subsection c,because another provision of law,e,provides for a higher minimum sentence for his conviction on count three.
b design.the government design argument,advanced at oral argument,is drawn from united states alaniz,cir.alaniz declined to read the except clause literally out of concern that,in the absence of the clause,the provisions in subdivisions c b and c c of section are grammatically and conceptually incomplete.id.at.the eighth circuit noted that in the previous version of section c,the enhanced penalties for types of weapons and for prior convictions were set forth in what the court called an undivided subsection set forth in the margin,id.at,meaning that there were no numbered or lettered subdivisions within section c.the court thought that the except clause was needed to link the remaining prefatory language in c a to each sentence length set forth in subdivisions c b and c c.id.at.we disagree.
passing the objection that even a grammatical imperfection would be a dubious basis for adding a consecutive sentence contrary to the plain wording of a statute,we fail to see any grammatical problem at all,and neither the eighth circuit or the government has identified any problem that would result in the absence of the except clause.furthermore,the structural argument encounters the objectio
