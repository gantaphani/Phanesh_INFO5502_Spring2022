wayne gaskin and al castle were found guilty after a jury trial in the united states district court for the western district of new york charles siragusa,judge of conspiracy to traffic in kilograms or more of marijuana count one,see,a,b b vii,and of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of kilograms or more of marijuana in april count two,see id.a,b b vii gaskin was also found guilty on a separate substantive charge of possession with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of marijuana between may and june,count six.see a.further,gaskin was ordered by the district court to forfeit approximately in cash seized at the time of his arrest count eight.see a.
both defendants now appeal from final amended judgments of conviction entered on march,against castle and on february,against gaskin.pursuant to these judgments,defendants are presently incarcerated,castle serving a total term of months and gaskin serving a total term of months.
defendants assert that the trial evidence was insufficient to support their convictions and that the district court erred in failing to declare a mistrial based on jury misconduct.in addition,gaskin argues that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the indictment against him for violation of the speedy trial act filing requirement,see b refusing to suppress evidence seized in a warrantless search of his car declining to give a missing witness charge ordering forfeiture of money seized at his arrest and increasing his sentencing guidelines base offense level for use of a minor in the commission of a crime,see,obstruction of justice,see id,possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense,see id.b,and involvement as an organizer or leader of criminal activity involving five or more participants,see id.a.castle further challenges his conviction on the ground that his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective.
for the reasons stated herein,we reject each of these claims and,accordingly,affirm both convictions.
factual background 
between the spring of and june,wayne gaskin organized and financed the transportation of hundreds of kilograms of marijuana from the western part of the united states to rochester,new york,where he then distributed the contraband.in making arrangements to acquire the marijuana and to have various couriers transport it by air,train,and motor vehicle to rochester,gaskin was assisted by numerous individuals,including al castle.to prove defendants participation in the charged conspiracy,the government relied on the testimony of three gahr,kevin miller,and theodore by voluminous credit card,telephone,airline,car rental,and hotel records.the same evidence was also relied on to prove the substantive marijuana charges,each charge relating to a specific marijuana transportation by one of the couriers.thus,count two charged defendants in connection with gahr effort to transport approximately pounds of marijuana by car from san diego,california,to rochester in april count three charged gaskin in connection with miller transportation of an unspecified quantity of marijuana by train from san diego to rochester sometime between april and may count four charged gaskin in connection with a similar transportation of marijuana by miller in may count five charged both gaskin and castle with another miller transportation of marijuana in june and count six charged gaskin in connection with shaw efforts to transport pounds of marijuana by motor home from phoenix,arizona,to rochester between may and june.on counts two and six,for which there were corroborating drug seizures,the defendants were convicted.on counts three,four,and five,for which there were no corroborating seizures,they were acquitted.
because defendants raise sufficiency challenges to the counts of conviction,we outline the relevant evidence in some detail.
bonnie gahr transportation of marijuana 
the suitcase transports 
bonnie gahr testified that she had already known gaskin for almost six years when,in the spring of,he proposed that she fly to san diego to pick up a suitcase containing marijuana and transport it back to him in rochester.gaskin promised to pay gahr or two pounds of marijuana for her efforts and to cover her travel expenses.gahr accepted the offer and,following gaskin instructions,she flew to san diego where she met with a man,mundahla,who packed fifteen to thirty bundles of marijuana into a suitcase.upon gahr return to rochester,gaskin promptly came to her home to retrieve the suitcase,traveling in a black pickup truck driven by an male.in a proffer session with the government,defendant castle would identify this man as sammy.
throughout the spring and summer of,gahr traveled between rochester and san diego some five to ten times,transporting marijuana in suitcases for gaskin on each occasion.on two or three of these trips,gahr also acted as a reverse courier,carrying sums of cash as large as from gaskin to mundahla.
the truck transport count two 
in april,gaskin proposed to gahr that she and her boyfriend subsequently her husband,ron ruffin,drive truckloads of marijuana from san diego to rochester once a month over the next six months.gaskin offered to supply the truck,to cover the couple travel expenses,and to pay them for each successful marijuana delivery.
on april,gaskin brought a gmc yukon truck to gahr home.business records indicated that the yukon,which was registered to gahr,had recently been purchased in the name of one of gaskin.gaskin supplied gahr and ruffin with,a map outlining their route to san diego,and a.the trio then drove to the entrance of the new york state thruway where defendant castle was waiting in a minivan.gaskin got out of the yukon,joined castle in the minivan,and the two vehicles began to drive in tandem to california.
the next day,as the conspirators were traveling through kansas,a state trooper spotted the two vehicles and stopped the minivan for a traffic violation.at trial,the trooper identified gaskin as the driver of the van and testified that gaskin had denied that the van and yukon were traveling together.when the trooper subsequently stopped the truck,he noted several empty duffle bags in the vehicle.
as a result of the kansas stops,the truck and minivan became separated,and it was not until the morning of april that gahr,ruffin,gaskin,and castle reunited in san diego.gaskin assured his confederates that the kansas trooper had not discovered that he was carrying in cash.nevertheless,gahr expressed reservations about continuing with the marijuana scheme now that their vehicles were known to law enforcement authorities.she testified that all three men dismissed her fears and persuaded her to go forward with an alternative plan whereby she and ruffin would drive back to rochester by an alternate route,transporting the marijuana in a different vehicle.
that same night,the four conspirators went to a national rental car office.while gahr,ruffin,and gaskin waited outside,castle entered the agency and rented a buick sedan,a transaction confirmed at trial through rental company records and castle credit card receipts.gaskin and castle drove off in the buick,leaving gahr and ruffin to return in the yukon to their hotel.the next morning,gaskin told gahr and ruffin that the buick was packed and ready for their return trip to rochester.the couple left san diego that day,leaving the yukon with gaskin.
two days later,on april,while traveling through illinois,gahr and ruffin were stopped by a state police officer who discovered approximately pounds of marijuana concealed in the trunk of the buick.both gahr and ruffin were arrested.although ruffin was detained,gahr was released on bail.
contact with gaskin 
after her release,gahr promptly contacted gaskin,who had not yet returned to rochester,to tell him of the arrests and to ask for money to help her get back to new york.gaskin wired.in rochester,gaskin told gahr that money was then tight because the illinois seizure had cost him but,if she and ruffin would keep their mouth s shut,he would see that they were taken care of for the rest of their lives.trial,at.gaskin reported that he already had an attorney,mustapha muhammad,looking into the illinois case against ruffin,and he gave gahr to defray her own defense costs.
in discussions with gahr over the next few months,gaskin told her that another identified by authorities as kevin recently reported a lost shipment of marijuana,but that gaskin did not believe him.gaskin stated that he knew where this courier sister lived and planned to retaliate by shoot ing up her home.id.at.after gaskin own june,arrest,see infra at part,he told gahr that he planned to kill another had cooperated with authorities against him,describing the individual as a dead man walking.id.at.gahr testified that she knew gaskin had a gun because she had seen one in his waistband on one of the occasions when he had come to her home to retrieve marijuana.
kevin miller transportation of marijuana 
miller refers gaskin to a lawyer to assist in the case 
kevin miller testified that he met gaskin in april,when the two men were coincidentally traveling together by train from california to chicago.gaskin confided that he was in the marijuana business and that two of his couriers had recently been arrested in illinois.miller recommended chicago lawyer mustapha muhammad and used gaskin cell phone to call muhammad from the train.gaskin telephone records corroborated this call and also showed repeated calls at about the same time from the cell phone to defendant castle.in chicago,gaskin and miller met with muhammad,after which gaskin paid miller to visit ruffin which miller did not do,before gaskin boarded a train for rochester.according to telephone records,gaskin first cell phone call upon arriving in rochester was to castle.
miller two successful marijuana transports counts three and four 
a few days later,when miller arrived in rochester,gaskin offered to pay him per trip to transport marijuana from san diego.miller testified that on his first trip,on april,he and gaskin flew to los angeles where they picked up a yukon truck and drove to san diego.there,a supplier gave gaskin two suitcases full of marijuana.leaving the truck with the supplier,gaskin and miller returned to rochester by train.at the rochester station,gaskin and miller were met by a male in a black pickup sammy who retrieved the suitcases and drove away,leaving gaskin and miller to depart the station in gaskin sport utility vehicle.
miller made a second trip to san diego in may.once again,gaskin flew with him to california,but while miller transported the suitcases full of marijuana back to rochester by train,gaskin returned by air.once again,the man in the pickup truck met miller at the station and took the suitcases.
miller unsuccessful third marijuana transport count five 
miller final trip for gaskin began on june,in phoenix.gaskin had directed miller to meet him in phoenix because gaskin was there finalizing arrangements for a separate marijuana transported by theodore shaw,see infra at part.miller and gaskin drove overnight from phoenix to san diego.there,at gaskin direction,miller made travel reservations for castle to fly to san diego to bring gaskin additional money to pay his california marijuana supplier.miller testified that after castle arrived in san diego,he and gaskin went out together,returning with a quantity of marijuana that they repackaged to fit inside a number of suitcases.as the three men were leaving the hotel with the suitcases,gaskin introduced miller to a woman named julie,who he explained would also be acting as a courier.
miller testified that he traveled by train with julie and the suitcases full of marijuana as far as emeryville,california.there,miller left the train,caught a taxi to the san francisco airport,and flew to chicago.at trial,he explained these actions by saying he had personal things to attend to in chicago.trial,at.a few days later,miller went to the chicago station to meet julie train,but neither she nor the suitcases were on board.when miller reported these events to gaskin,gaskin accused him of stealing the marijuana and threatened to harm miller family.miller threatened similar violent retaliation against gaskin.instead,miller contacted illinois law enforcement authorities and offered his cooperation against gaskin.
theodore shaw transportation of marijuana count six 
the motor home transport 
theodore shaw testified that he had been a marijuana customer of gaskin for several months when,in may,gaskin proposed that shaw drive a motor home containing marijuana from phoenix to rochester in return for in advance and upon delivery.
accepting gaskin offer and following his directions,shaw rented a motor home in rochester and drove to phoenix,arriving on june.that day,gaskin met shaw at a phoenix motel to arrange for the motor home to be driven to the loading location.shaw told gaskin that a set of keys was inside the vehicle and that gaskin could move it to wherever he wished.later that evening,gaskin called shaw to tell him he could leave.the next morning,shaw began to drive the motor home back to rochester.
on june,shaw was stopped by oklahoma state highway authorities,who found four bundles of marijuana,weighing approximately pounds,hidden underneath the motor home bed frame.while placing shaw under arrest,the officers seized a cell phone whose number was assigned to gaskin.
the june,controlled delivery 
shaw agreed to cooperate with the federal bureau of investigation in making a controlled delivery of the marijuana.on june,shaw placed a monitored,recorded telephone call to gaskin reporting his arrival in rochester and cautioning that the stuff was beginning to smell.the two men agreed to meet a few hours later in the parking lot of a carvel ice cream store.
fbi agents who surveilled the meeting testified that gaskin arrived at the parking lot in a honda accord,accompanied by his son.leaving his son in the car,gaskin walked over to shaw and asked the courier how he was going to get home.shaw,who was recording their conversation by means of a concealed body wire,responded by asking gaskin how long he needed the motor home and offering to pass the time in the ice cream store.when shaw inquired about payment,gaskin assured him that he had the money with him,whereupon shaw gave gaskin a set of keys.as gaskin got in the driver seat of the motor home and tried to start the vehicle,federal agents placed him under arrest.
the searches of gaskin person and automobile 
incident to arrest,agents searched gaskin and seized in cash and a cell phone.telephone records showed that the seized cell phone was the device used to contact various at times pertinent to the different marijuana transports.fbi agents also searched gaskin honda,seizing in cash from a shoe box found in the trunk of the car,as well as various papers linking gaskin to muhammad,mustafa muhammad,kevin miller,and bonnie.initially agreeing to speak with federal authorities,gaskin disclaimed any knowledge of the seized and stated that the money did not belong to him.he further denied having recently been in phoenix.
d.the criminal complaint against gaskin and subsequent indictment 
later that same day,gaskin was arraigned in the united states district court for the western district of new york on a criminal complaint charging 
on or about june and june,defendant did,agree and conspire with another individual to have a quantity of marijuana transported from the state of arizona to rochester,new york,and did then attempt to possess said marijuana with intent to distribute it in violation of title united states code,sections and a.
compl.at.the only conspiratorial agreement described in the supporting agent affidavit is the one between gaskin and shaw to transport a single load of approximately pounds of marijuana from arizona in june.compl.aff.similarly,the only attempted possession of marijuana referenced in the affidavit relates to the four bundles concealed in the motor home.
gaskin pleaded not guilty to the complaint and was detained.six days later,on june,he was released on bail subject to electronic monitoring.no indictment was returned within thirty days of gaskin arrest nor did the government move to dismiss the complaint within that time.instead,the docket sheet indicates that in early august,gaskin changed counsel,and through october of that year,the parties wrangled over the conditions of gaskin continued release.thereafter,no filings or court proceedings are noted until november,when gaskin moved to dismiss the complaint for violation of the speedy trial act requirement that an indictment be filed within thirty days of arrest.see b,a.
in fact,that same day,the grand jury voted a sealed indictment charging gaskin,castle,and cruickshank with participation in a broad marijuana transportation conspiracy spanning almost two years and involving more than kilograms of contraband.with respect to the shaw transport,count six of the indictment charged gaskin with actual possession of the marijuana in the motor home,rather than the attempted possession charged in the complaint.
in an omnibus defense motion filed march,gaskin renewed his speedy trial act challenge to his prosecution,this time seeking dismissal of the at least the charges contained in counts one and six.relying on this court decision in united states napolitano,cir,the district court declined to dismiss the indictment,finding that the charges contained therein were not the same as those alleged in the complaint.specifically,the court ruled that the marijuana possession charged in count six was not the same offense as the attempted possession charged in the complaint.trial,june,at.further,applying factors relevant to double jeopardy review of successive conspiracy charges,see united states korfant,cir per curiam,the court concluded that the marijuana conspiracy charged in count one was not the same conspiracy charged in the complaint.see united states gaskin,wl,at.
ii.discussion 
speedy trial act 
gaskin submits that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the charges in counts one and six of the indictment for violation of the speedy trial act filing requirement.see b a.we review the district court findings of fact as they pertain to a speedy trial challenge for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see united states,cir citing united states simmons,cir.
the administration of justice depends heavily upon the prompt processing of criminal proceedings,both to safeguard the rights of the accused and to promote public respect for and confidence in the law.united states hillegas,cir accord united states breen,cir united states kelly,cir per curiam.toward this goal,congress enacted the speedy trial act of,et,which provides for dismissal of charges against a defendant who is not indicted,arraigned,or brought to trial within periods of time set forth in the statute.see id.
section b,invoked by gaskin in this case,states that a ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.id.b.the sanction for a b violation is set forth in a if,in the case of any individual against whom a complaint is filed charging such individual with an offense,no indictment or information is filed within the time limit required by section b,such charge against that individual contained in such complaint shall be dismissed or otherwise dropped.id.a.a a dismissal may be with or without prejudice depending upon the seriousness of the offense,the circumstances leading to dismissal,the impact of reprosecution on the speedy trial act and the administration of justice,as well as whether the defendant sustained any prejudice,see united states taylor,d 
as this court observed in united states napolitano,the dismissal remedy provided in a which is not constitutionally the product of legislative compromise and,by its terms,has very limited application.at citing legislative history.the statutory language requires dismissal only of such charge against the individual contained in such complaint.id.at quoting a.napolitano instructs that this language must be read strictly.thus,it applies only to charges actually pending against an individual.united states hillegas,at.if charges are dismissed before expiration of the filing period,there is no bar to their being resurrected in a new complaint or indictment.see d resetting speedy trial clock if,after a complaint charge is dismissed against a defendant,the defendant is recharged with the same offense in a new complaint or indictment.further,where complaint charges remain pending,courts will not dismiss an untimely indictment pursuant to a if it pleads different charges from those in the complaint,and this applies even if the indictment charges arise from the same criminal episode as those specified in the original complaint or were known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the complaint.united states napolitano,at.our sister circuits agree and similarly construe the dismissal sanction of a narrowly.see united states watkins,cir united states miller,cir united states nabors,cir united states giwa,cir united states heldt,cir united states brooks,cir.
we exercise such caution in the dismissal of criminal charges mindful that the purpose of the speedy trial act is simply to expedite the processing of pending criminal proceedings,not to supervise prosecutorial discretion in investigating and charging crimes not actually pending before the court.united states hillegas,at.the distinction is of no small import.as hillegas notes,to invade the latter area might well involve the legislative and judicial branches in matters that fall primarily,if not exclusively,within the jurisdiction of the executive branch.id.at.accordingly,we apply b and a to delay in pursuing only the specific charges alleged in a pending complaint.as to charges not so specified,a defendant protections against delay are those provided by the applicable statutes of limitations and the speedy trial safeguards of the due process clause.see united states lovasco,d united states hillegas,at.thus,the critical question in this appeal is whether the charges pleaded in counts one and six of the indictment are those specifically pleaded in the complaint because,unless they are,the dismissal sanction of a has no applicability.
gaskin argues that the conspiracies charged in the complaint and in count one of the indictment are the same because both allege violations of the same statute,and the time,place,manner,participants,and objectives of the complaint conspiracy are wholly contained within the indictment conspiracy.further,he insists that the charge of marijuana possession in both the criminal complaint and count of the indictment were brought under the same statute,namely,a,and involve identical events and participants relating to the same drug shipment.gaskin br.at.the government responds that gaskin was not charged with marijuana possession in both the indictment and the complaint.the complaint charges only attempted possession.see.the government submits that possession and attempted possession are not the same charge because the former offense requires proof of an additional element unnecessary to prove attempt,namely,actual or constructive possession of drugs.similarly,the government argues that the conspiracy pleaded in count one is not the same conspiracy charged in the complaint,not only because it is distinguishable under the standard outlined in united states korfant,at but because it too pleads an additional element,drug quantity,see b b vii prescribing higher penalties for crimes involving kilograms or more of marijuana,not required to prove the complaint conspiracy.see united states thomas,cir en banc holding drug quantity that increases statutory maximum sentence to be an element of an offense charged under that must be pleaded and proved.
we agree with the government that when a complaint charge and an indictment charge involve overlapping or even identical facts,dismissal is not warranted under a if the indictment charge requires proof of elements distinct from or in addition to those necessary to prove the crimes pleaded in the complaint.under such circumstances,the charge in the indictment is simply not such charge as was pleaded in such complaint.united states napolitano,at quoting a.
the government suggests that this conclusion simply extends traditional double jeopardy analysis to the speedy trial context.that is not precisely correct.double jeopardy proscribes multiple prosecutions not only for the same offense but also when one offense is a lesser included offense of the other.aparicio artuz,cir see brown ohio,d treating greater and lesser offenses as the same for purposes of double jeopardy.to safeguard against both circumstances,the traditional blockburger test calls for a comparison of successive charges to determine whether each requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.blockburger united states.accord aparicio artuz,at employing blockburger analysis to determine whether one offense is a lesser included offense of the other.but the narrow focus of a on such charge as was specifically pleaded in a complaint does not call for the equation of greater indictment charges with complaint charges.in short,charges that are distinct under double jeopardy analysis will always be distinct for purposes of a.but greater and lesser included offenses treated as one for double jeopardy purposes will not qualify as the same charge under a when the greater offense is charged after the lesser one.
this case illustrates the distinction we here draw.the drug possession pleaded in count six requires proof of a fact not necessary to prove the complaint charge of attempted possession,namely,defendant actual or constructive possession of marijuana.but the blockburger converse is not true.attempted drug possession requires proof of no fact unnecessary to possession rather,possession incorporates all elements of attempted possession.compare sand et,modern federal jury instructions,at instruction charging attempt with id.at,instructions and charging drug possession.in sum,attempted drug possession in violation of is simply a offense of the drug possession proscribed by a.see.c including attempt with offenses of which a defendant may be found guilty without a separate charge united states marin,cir holding that defendant charged with possession of cocaine may be found guilty of attempted possession,even though the latter crime was not specifically charged see also costo united states,cir holding attempted drug distribution to be a offense of actual distribution united states remigio,cir holding attempted manufacture of methamphetamines to be offense of actual manufacture 
similarly with respect to the challenged conspiracy charges,to survive a double jeopardy attack,the government would have to show that the two schemes involved distinct agreements.united states lopez,cir t he relevant double jeopardy inquiry is simply whether the second prosecution is for a conspiracy distinct from that previously prosecuted.quoting united states gambino,cir.that does not appear to be this case.the two conspiracies shared a common overall objective procurement of large quantities of marijuana to supply gaskin rochester drug operation.moreover,although the indictment conspiracy pursued this objective over a longer period of time and involved more participants,overt acts,geographic areas,and means of transportation than the complaint conspiracy,the relationship of the two schemes appears to have been that of concentric rather than overlapping circles.see aparicio artuz,at noting that offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy if their relationship is like that of concentric circles rather than overlapping circles quoting wayne lafave et,criminal procedure b ed.while korfant analysis is helpful to determining what constitutes a distinct agreement in the case of overlapping conspiracies,it may be unnecessary where the lesser conspiracy is plainly encompassed within the larger.as judge newman has observed,where a smaller conspiracy is wholly contained within a larger one,they are normally,perhaps always,treated as the same offense for jeopardy purposes.united states macchia,cir newman,concurring.indeed,in united states lopez,at,we recently vacated on double jeopardy grounds a conviction on an expansive second conspiracy that necessarily encompassed a narrower scheme for which defendant had already been convicted,concluding that,in such circumstances,no further analysis of korfant factors was necessary.
the fact that the complaint charges against gaskin thus appear to be offenses to the charges in counts one and six of the indictment does not,however,resolve this appeal.the issue before us is not constitutional double jeopardy but statutory speedy trial.the reason double jeopardy equates greater and lesser included offenses,even though the former require proof of additional elements,is to ensure against prosecutorial abuse in pursuing multiple punishments through successive prosecutions.as the supreme court explained in brown ohio,if the judge is forbidden to impose cumulative punishment for two crimes at the end of a single proceeding,the prosecutor is forbidden to strive for the same result in successive proceedings.at.gaskin,however,has never been at risk of successive prosecutions or multiple punishments for the greater and lesser offenses charged in this case.he invokes a to avoid any prosecution on these charges.the speedy trial act does not dictate such broad immunity its concern is that charges actually pending against a defendant be promptly processed.see united states hillegas,at citing legislative history.
when the government files a complaint against a defendant,what it does,in essence,is publicly pronounce that it has probable cause to believe that he has committed certain charged crimes.sections b and a give the government thirty days to make good on its representation by securing an indictment on such charge s or risk their dismissal.but a complaint charging a lesser offense does not publicly accuse the defendant of any greater crime.nor does it represent that the government has probable cause to support the additional elements of any greater offense.until there is such a formal public accusation,there is no speedy trial act interest in compelling the government to seek indictment on uncharged greater offenses within thirty days of charging ones.indeed,justice is usually best served by discouraging hasty prosecutorial judgments with respect to aggravated charges.thus,neither the language of the statute nor its purpose requires a dismissal sanction to reach beyond the original lesser offenses charged in a complaint to greater offenses requiring proof of additional elements that are charged for the first time in a subsequent indictment.in this respect,we do not apply double jeopardy analysis to interpretation of the term such charge in a.
the fifth circuit reached essentially the same conclusion in united states bailey,cir,a case in which a defendant initially charged with misdemeanor possession of a stolen firearm moved to dismiss an untimely indictment charging him with felony possession of the same weapon.the court denied a relief,holding that the additional element required to prove the felony,namely,that the stolen property had a value of or more,meant the indictment and complaint charges were not the same.id.at.in so holding,the court alluded to the blockburger test,but in bailey,as here,it was only the indictment charge that contained an additional element the complaint charge was a offense.thus,the court appears,in fact,to have applied a test akin to the one we here adopt,holding a inapplicable to indictment charges requiring proof of elements additional to those necessary to establish complaint charges.
gaskin,however,urges us to focus on language in napolitano that in other circuits suggesting that a may require the dismissal of an indictment which merely gilds an earlier charge.at.the existence and contours of a gilding doctrine to expand the scope of a beyond the express charges specifically pleaded in a complaint has generally been viewed with skepticism.see united states watkins,at surveying case law addressing gilding doctrine.we need not here decide whether there are any circumstances where we might apply the concept of gilding to a speedy trial act challenge.we hold simply that pleadings that add elements to the government burden of proof beyond those required for the lesser included charges in a complaint do more than gild the original charges.see generally united states oliver,noting dictionary definition of gilding as unnecessary ornamentation,quoted in united states watkins,at,and in united states bailey,at.they replace them with different charges that are not subject to dismissal under a when no timely indictment has been filed on the complaint charges.
in sum,a did not require dismissal of counts one and six of the indictment.
motion to suppress evidence 
prior to trial,gaskin moved to suppress cash and records seized by federal agents on june,as the result of two warrantless searches of his honda accord.the first search was conducted in the carvel parking lot shortly after gaskin arrest and resulted in the discovery of.the second search,conducted at fbi offices when the car was inventoried,resulted in the discovery of papers linking gaskin to various.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court upheld the searches pursuant to the automobile and forfeiture exceptions to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.reviewing the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo,see,united states yousef,cir,we conclude that gaskin suppression motion was properly denied.
the automobile exception 
under the automobile exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement,police may conduct a warrantless search of a readily mobile motor vehicle if probable cause exists to believe the vehicle contains contraband or other evidence of a crime.see pennsylvania labron,d per curiam carroll united states.see also california acevedo,d.the mobility prong of the exception is undisputed in this case gaskin challenges only the existence of probable cause.
as the supreme court has repeatedly explained,probable cause is a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts.illinois gates,d.its focus is on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,not legal technicians,act.brinegar united states.thus,probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched.id.at.quoting carroll united states,at.alterations in original accord united states patrick,cir.the standard does not demand certainty but only a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.illinois gates,at.accord united states harwood,cir.further,courts recognize that experience and training may allow a law enforcement officer to discern probable cause from facts and circumstances where a layman might not.see united states price,cir holding that circumstances must be viewed through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on the scene,guided by his experience and training internal quotation marks omitted see also wayne lafave,search and seizure c,at ed.a trained and experienced officer will have probable cause in circumstances when the layman would not.united states colon,cir concluding that facts that might have supported an investigative stop if known by a law enforcement officer could not support stop when known only to a civilian operator.
before the first search of gaskin car,fbi agents knew gaskin purpose in driving to the carvel parking lot on june,was not innocent he was there to take delivery of approximately pounds of marijuana gaskin was no novice to marijuana,he had sold marijuana to shaw for some months gaskin had personally financed and organized the marijuana transportation from arizona gaskin had already paid shaw several thousand dollars in fees and expenses and was to pay the remainder of his fee and expenses at the parking lot meeting gaskin had on his person at the time of arrest gaskin had used three different cell phones to communicate with shaw while the courier was en route to new york with the marijuana,and had one cell phone on his person at the time of arrest shaw had told authorities gaskin frequently carried firearms police records indicated that gaskin had a pistol permit listing four firearms and gaskin had no firearm on his person when arrested.in addition,the fbi agent who searched gaskin car testified that he knew from experience what this court has frequently observed guns are tools of the narcotics trade,frequently carried by dealers,particularly when they engage in transactions involving drugs or money.see,united states reyes,cir recognizing that firearms are regularly found on narcotics traffickers united states crespo,cir t o substantial dealers in narcotics,firearms are as much tools of the trade as are the commonly recognized articles of narcotics paraphernalia.the totality of these circumstances established probable cause to believe that guns,cell phones,and money linked to gaskin drug dealing would likely be found in his car.
specifically,shaw disclosure that gaskin frequently carried a gun during drug deals,together with public information corroborating gaskin ownership of multiple firearms,when viewed through the prism of agent experience,gave rise to a strong probability that gaskin would have brought one or more guns to the delivery site.having found no gun on gaskin person,the agents could have reasonably concluded that firearms were probably in his car.
agents did find a cell phone on gaskin person,but they knew from shaw that gaskin had used three different cell phones in recent days to communicate about the marijuana transfer.because cell phones are often kept and used in cars,there was probable cause to believe that gaskin other cell phones would likely be found in his car.
similarly,although agents seized from gaskin,an amount that might well have sufficed to meet his immediate obligations to shaw,the agents knew that gaskin ran a major drug distribution organization and that he routinely expended large sums of cash to meet expenses associated with his criminal activities.gaskin undoubtedly faced additional costs in connection with the storage,packaging,and distribution of the recently arrived marijuana.thus,there was a reasonable probability that gaskin had even more cash in his car to cover these costs.
in sum,because the agents had probable cause to believe that the honda accord contained incriminating evidence against gaskin in the form of guns,cell phones,and cash,their warrantless search of the vehicle was permissible under the automobile exception,and the district court properly refused to suppress the evidence seized.
the forfeiture exception 
citing united states zaicek,cir,and florida white,d,the district court further upheld the warrantless search of gaskin automobile on the ground that probable cause supported the vehicle forfeiture pursuant to a.we agree.
in zaicek,this court held that when a car is properly seized by the police pursuant to a forfeiture statute,the government has a greater possessory interest in the car than the owner,permitting law enforcement officers to search the seized vehicle without a warrant.at.thereafter,in united states lasanta,cir,we indicated that a warrant was necessary to effect a proper civil forfeiture seizure,but in florida white,at,the supreme court specifically rejected lasanta,at least as it pertains to motor vehicles seized in public places.the court ruled that law enforcement officers may seize forfeitable vehicles from public places without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that the vehicle is,in fact,subject to forfeiture.see id.thus,as the district court correctly observed,florida white and zaicek,read together,establish that law enforcement officers who have probable cause to believe an automobile is subject to forfeiture may both seize the vehicle from a public place and search it without a warrant.
gaskin submits that warrantless forfeiture searches should be limited to car seizures based on probable cause to believe the vehicle was used to transport or conceal drugs,not cases,such as this one,where the vehicle was used only to transport a drug dealer to a drug transaction.he offers no legal or logical support for drawing the distinction urged,and we find none in the relevant statutes and case law.
certainly zaicek does not support gaskin argument.there,the court acknowledged as well settled that a vehicle seized on the grounds that it was used to transport contraband could be searched without a warrant.at.but zaicek expressly declined to limit warrantless searches to such circumstances.indeed,the car at issue in zaicek was seized not because it had transported contraband,but because it had been reported stolen.see id.citing veh.traf.law mckinney permitting police to seize stolen motor vehicles.this court ruled that once property is properly seized by the police pursuant to a statute,such stolen or forfeitable property can be searched by them without a warrant.id.at.
section a and b of title provides the statutory authority for the seizure of gaskin car subsection b authorizes the warrantless seizure incident to an arrest of a ny property subject to civil forfeiture.b.subsection a defines the property subject to civil forfeiture 
the following shall be subject to forfeiture to the united states and no property right shall exist in them all vehicles,which are used,or are intended for use,to transport,or in any manner to facilitate the transportation,sale,receipt,possession,or concealment of a controlled substance.
construing subsection a in united states v.one cadillac eldorado sedan,cir,this court specifically refused to limit its reach to vehicles used to transport or conceal drugs.we ruled that the statute contemplates forfeiture if the vehicle in any manner facilitates the sale of a controlled drug.id.at.the cadillac at issue in that case had been used by two drug dealers to drive from a location in the bronx to an apartment building in manhattan where they met a prospective buyer and discussed a cocaine sale that took place sometime thereafter.ruling that conveyance of the drug traffickers in the cadillac to and from the june meeting did facilitate the sale of the drug,this court ordered the car forfeited to the united states.id.
gaskin use of his automobile on june,was certainly as important to the facilitation of his drug dealing as the vehicle use detailed in one cadillac eldorado sedan.gaskin drove to a meeting with a drug courier not simply to negotiate future transports of marijuana but to take delivery of a load of marijuana concealed in a motor home.that the agents had probable cause to believe that this was gaskin purpose and to arrest him for drug trafficking is indisputable.thus,pursuant to a and b,agents were lawfully entitled to seize the car that he had used to facilitate this transaction and,thereafter,to search it.
accordingly,we affirm the district court decision denying gaskin motion to suppress incriminating evidence found in the course of these searches.
sufficiency of the evidence 
both defendants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their conviction gaskin submits that the evidence failed to prove that he ever actually or constructively possessed marijuana,while castle asserts that the prosecution failed to prove his knowing participation in the charged crimes.gaskin further challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the court forfeiture order.these arguments are uniformly without merit.
challenges to convictions 
as we have repeatedly observed,a defendant raising an appellate challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction faces a heavy burden,because we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,united states henry,cir united states glenn,cir.reversal is warranted only if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.see jackson virginia,d accord united states henry,at.
gaskin possession of marijuana 
judged by this standard,gaskin claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove his possession of marijuana borders on the frivolous.gaskin was arrested while taking possession of an load of marijuana.nevertheless,he insists that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the substance seized was in fact marijuana because the drug exhibits in the case were received in evidence without the proper foundation of a chemical analysis.the parties,however,stipulated to the testimony of a forensic chemist that she had personally tested the drug exhibits and found all to contain marijuana.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence,the jury was entitled to credit this stipulation of opinion without further testimony regarding the particular analyses supporting the chemist conclusions.see.permitting expert to testify in terms of opinion without first testifying to the underlying facts or data,unless the court requires otherwise ambrosini labarraque,
in any event,neither actual drug exhibits nor reports of chemical analysis are required to support a conviction for possession of a controlled substance.see united states bryce,cir.as we noted in bryce,l ay testimony and circumstantial evidence may be sufficient,without the introduction of an expert chemical analysis,to establish the identity of the substance involved in an alleged narcotics transaction.id.quoting united states dolan,cir.a reasonable jury could have concluded from the testimony of accomplice witnesses gahr and shaw,as well as from the extensive circumstantial evidence linking gaskin to the marijuana seized from these couriers,that,at various times,gaskin had been in actual or constructive possession of the marijuana charged in counts two and six.although gaskin vigorously argues that the courier witnesses were not reliable,we must assume that the jury resolved all credibility disputes in favor of the prosecution.see united states desena,cir united states anglin,cir.
castle knowing participation in the charged crimes 
castle sufficiency challenge is equally meritless.the totality of the trial evidence clearly established the existence of a conspiracy to transport marijuana from the western united states to rochester,new york.once the prosecution proves a charged conspiracy,the evidence necessary to link a particular defendant to the scheme need not be overwhelming and may be circumstantial in nature.see,united states desena,cir and cases cited therein.indeed,the element of knowledge,whether in connection with a conspiracy or substantive charge,often can be proved only by circumstantial evidence.see united states hastings,cir holding that knowledge may be established by circumstantial evidence see also united states gordon,cir a defendant knowledge of the conspiracy and his participation in it with criminal intent may be established through circumstantial evidence.
in this case,gahr identified castle as the person who accompanied gaskin on the road trip to california preliminary to the illinois marijuana transport.the circumstances of the vehicles driving,in tandem,round the clock,with gaskin carrying in castle mere presence on the journey highly unlikely.see united states gordils,cir holding that defendant knowing participation in conspiracy could be inferred from circumstances indicating organization would not have compromised its security by giving access to an outsider united states padilla,cir holding that defendant knowing participation in crime could be inferred from evidence that confederates would not otherwise have included him in meeting with drug courier lest he find out the truth and interfere.in any event,gahr described castle as an active participant in the san diego meeting where all four conspirators discussed whether to continue with their transport scheme in light of the kansas vehicle stops.gahr testified that when it was agreed to go forward using a different vehicle,castle was the conspirator who actually rented the buick sedan in which the drugs were concealed,an act in furtherance of the charged scheme that was corroborated by rental and credit card records.further,after the marijuana was seized from this buick in illinois,telephone records revealed that gaskin repeatedly reached out for castle.assuming,as we must,that the jury credited gahr account,see united states desena,at united states anglin,at,this evidence amply supported castle conviction.
challenge to forfeiture 
count eight of the indictment sought forfeiture of any property that gaskin had used and intended to use,to facilitate the drug crimes charged in count one and count six,specifically the seized from his person and the seized from his car at the time of his arrest.indictment cr,at count.having heard the trial evidence,the district court found that gaskin had so used the seized monies and ordered forfeiture gaskin challenges this ruling on two grounds the prosecution failed to carry its burden pursuant to d to demonstrate no likely source for the seized monies other than drug trafficking and the district court decision was informed by unreliable evidence,a canine alert to drugs on the.
because criminal forfeiture is viewed as part of the sentencing process,see libretti united states,d,the government need prove facts supporting forfeiture only by a preponderance of the evidence,see united states bellomo,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see in re seizure of all funds in accounts in the names registry publ g,cir.
pursuant to a,the government may seek a defendant forfeiture of the following 
any property constituting,or derived from,any proceeds the person obtained,directly or indirectly,as the result of the violation of conviction 
any of the person property used,or intended to be used,in any manner or part,to commit,or to facilitate the commission of,such violation and 
in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,in addition any of his interest in,claims against,and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over,the continuing criminal enterprise.
a.subsection d of the statute affords the government a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture as to any property acquired by a defendant during the period of his criminal offense or soon thereafter.id.d.for the presumption to apply,however,the government must demonstrate no likely source for such property other than the violation of this subchapter.id.d.
section d is not applicable to gaskin case.by its terms,it applies only when forfeiture is sought pursuant to d statutory presumption as to the property criminal origins.in this case,the government did not invoke that presumption it sought forfeiture pursuant to a.because a preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that gaskin had used or intended to use the seized money to facilitate his drug trafficking,forfeiture was appropriate under a without regard to the likely source of the property.see generally united states,cir discussing various sections of.
gaskin,after all,had brought almost in cash with him to a site where he expected to take delivery of a large quantity of marijuana.gaskin intent to use the money to facilitate this drug transfer was established,in part,by direct evidence his own statement to shaw that he had with him the money necessary to pay the remainder of shaw fee,and to reimburse him for certain travel expenses.moreover,the trial evidence showed that gaskin,in his role as organizer and leader of the charged conspiracy,see infra at part,routinely carried and spent large sums of cash to meet myriad expenses associated with his drug operation.thus,a fair inference could be drawn that gaskin intended to use the cash at issue to pay shaw and to cover such other expenses as would arise in connection with the distribution of the delivered drug load.indeed,such an inference of guilty intent with respect to use of the seized money was strengthened by gaskin false exculpatory statement denying ownership or knowledge of the.see united states glenn,cir holding that false exculpatory statements do not alone prove guilt but may constitute circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt and may strengthen inferences supplied by other pieces of evidence.
further,such an inference was supported by the canine alert,which suggested that the had already been used in some way connected to gaskin drug operation.gaskin challenges the reliability of canine alerts.this court,however,has ruled that a reliability challenge to such evidence does not preclude its consideration so long as other evidence supports the factfinder conclusion.see united states marji,cir rejecting trial challenge to canine alert evidence.
because ample direct and circumstantial evidence supported a finding that gaskin had used and intended to use the seized money to facilitate his charged drug trafficking,we conclude that it was properly ordered forfeited.
missing witness charge 
gaskin maintains that the district court erred in denying his request for a missing witness charge based on the government failure to call ron ruffin as a prosecution witness.a missing witness charge invites the jury to draw an adverse inference against a party that fails to call a witness whose production is peculiarly within its power.united states mittelstaedt,cir quoting united states nichols,cir.because we recognize that an aura of gamesmanship frequently accompanies requests for missing witness charges,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,we afford district judges considerable discretion in deciding when they should and should not be given,see united states torres,cir.we are particularly disinclined to their decisions where,as in this case,a judge refrains from commenting on the inference to be drawn on the facts before the jury and allows counsel instead to argue the inference.united states mittelstaedt,at quoting united states saa,cir.we will reverse only upon a showing of both abuse of discretion,see united states nichols,at,and actual prejudice,see united states mittelstaedt,at.gaskin can show neither.
gaskin submits that ruffin was unavailable to the defense because federal authorities had relocated him to an undisclosed location.the availability of a witness to a particular party does not depend on knowledge of the witness whereabouts but on the totality of circumstances bearing upon the witness relation to the parties.united states myerson,cir.as the district court correctly observed,although gaskin may not have known ruffin physical location,he did know that ruffin was represented by counsel.gaskin attorney,however,made no effort to contact the witness through this lawyer.this is not surprising.early in the trial,both defense attorneys had expressly stated on the record that they had no intention of calling ruffin as a trial witness.under these circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants a missing witness charge,nor was gaskin prejudiced by this ruling.see united states mittelstaedt,at.
request for a mistrial based on jury misconduct 
both defendants submit that jury misconduct required the declaration of a mistrial.we review a trial judge handling of alleged jury misconduct for abuse of discretion,mindful that a mistrial is warranted only upon a showing of actual prejudice.see united states abrams,cir per curiam.
in this case,the concern about jury misconduct arose when a court officer informed the trial judge that fewer than twelve jurors might have discussed the case during a break in deliberations.the judge promptly questioned the foreperson and ascertained that the discussion in question lasted approximately five minutes and was limited to jurors expressions of surprise upon noticing that the verdict form included offense alternatives for counts three and four.
preliminarily,we observe that defendants were acquitted on counts three and four in all respects.thus,defendants can not claim that they were prejudiced as to these charges by the challenged juror discussion.further,because the foreperson,when questioned by the court,unequivocally stated that there had never been any consideration of evidence or culpability except with all jurors present,the trial court acted well within its discretion in concluding that there was no need to declare a mistrial.
gaskin sentencing challenges 
gaskin submits that the evidence failed to support the district court application of four sentencing guidelines enhancements.although we review a district court legal application of the guidelines de novo,see united states genao,cir,we review its factual findings deferentially for clear error,see e,bearing in mind that the standard of proof at sentencing is a preponderance of the evidence,see united states thorn,cir.
when making sentencing determinations,a district court may rely on any facts available to it,including information contained in the report.see united states shepardson,cir united states sisti,cir.further,a sentencing court,like a jury,may base its factfinding on circumstantial evidence and on reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.indeed,this will often have to be the case when the issue in dispute is a defendant knowledge and intent.see united states khedr,cir united states sisti,at.
use of a minor 
when gaskin arrived at the carvel parking lot in his honda accord on june,he was accompanied by his son.having heard extensive testimony about this parking lot meeting both at a suppression hearing and at trial,the district court,at sentencing,reached what it characterized as an inescapable conclusion gaskin had deliberately brought his son to the meeting so that the boy could drive gaskin car away from the parking lot while gaskin drove the motor home.accordingly,the court imposed a sentencing enhancement pursuant to.
guideline provides that i f the defendant used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of,or apprehension for,the offense,increase by levels.the application notes broadly define u sed or attempted to use to include directing,commanding,encouraging,intimidating,counseling,training,procuring,recruiting,or soliciting.id.application note see stinson united states,d c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.
as this language makes plain,the appropriate focus of a court inquiry is on the actions and intent of the defendant.whether the minor himself engaged in any criminal actions,whether the minor intended to assist in the adult criminal activity,or whether the minor even knew that the adult was involved in criminal activity are factors irrelevant to application of the enhancement.recent decisions by our sister circuits share this view.see united states tran,cir upholding enhancement for using a minor as an unwitting driver during criminal activity united states anderson,cir upholding enhancement for directing minor bank tellers under defendant supervision to make withdrawals that tellers did not know were unauthorized see also united states,cir upholding enhancement where father used son as decoy during drug smuggling trip to avoid detection united states warner,cir upholding enhancement where defendant offered to leave daughter with drug purchasers as collateral for the payment money they entrusted to him.thus,regardless of what gaskin son knew or intended with respect to his father drug trafficking activities on june,if the evidence supported a conclusion that gaskin brought the boy to the parking lot to help in any manner with his drug transfer plans,the district court properly applied a enhancement.
trial evidence indicated that gaskin had come to the meeting with shaw pursuant to a specific appointment made earlier that day.this fairly supported an inference that the boy presence at the meeting site was not coincidental but the product of a conscious choice by gaskin.further,the evidence showed that the single purpose of the meeting was to transfer possession of a motor home containing marijuana.because gaskin was arrested as he attempted to drive this motor home from the meeting site,it was obvious that he needed the assistance of some other person to drive his own car from the scene.shaw testimony indicated that it was never contemplated that he would drive gaskin car from the location.thus,the logical conclusion to draw from the fact that gaskin had brought his son to the meeting and left the boy in the honda when he got in the motor home was that gaskin intended his son to drive the car.
because the district court did not clearly err in finding such intended use of a minor,it properly applied the enhancement to gaskin guideline calculations.
obstruction of justice 
guideline provides a enhancement i f a the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and b the obstructive conduct related to i the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.the application notes to this guideline identify among the types of conduct deemed obstructive,threatening,intimidating,or otherwise unlawfully influencing a,witness,or juror,directly or indirectly,or attempting to do so.id.application note a.
bonnie gahr testified that,sometime after june,gaskin told her that he planned to kill the drug cooperation had led to his arrest.the district court concluded that gaskin made this statement to gahr,a potential witness who could provide even more incriminating evidence against him than shaw,to intimidate her into not cooperating with authorities in their pending investigation of his drug trafficking.a threat to a potential witness qualifies as an attempt to obstruct justice and fully warrants a sentencing enhancement pursuant to.see united states sanchez,cir.nevertheless,gaskin submits that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that his intent in threatening shaw life was to intimidate gahr.gaskin submits that the evidence shows only that he was blowing off steam.gaskin br.at.
gaskin argument casts his words and conduct in the light most favorable to him,a view the district court was not required to adopt.united states greer,cir.we generally defer to a sentencing court findings as to what a speaker meant by his words,and how a listener would reasonably interpret those words.united states shoulberg,cir accord united states sanchez,at.in this case,the district court conclusion about gaskin intimidating intent was supported by evidence of gaskin past efforts to ensure gahr silence with offers of financial assistance.in short,gaskin had long recognized the risk presented by gahr possible cooperation.with investigative pressure mounting in the aftermath of his arrest,gaskin disclosure to gahr of his plans to kill a cooperating courier necessarily communicated that the same fate could await her if she did not maintain her silence.the district court properly applied a enhancement.
possession of a firearm during a drug offense 
guideline b provides a enhancement for defendants who possess firearms during drug crimes.bonnie gahr testified that she saw gaskin armed with a gun on several occasions when he came to her home to pick up marijuana.despite the district court explicit finding that it credited gahr testimony,gaskin argues that no enhancement was warranted because he was acquitted of count seven,which charged him with violating c by carrying a firearm during and in relation to the charged marijuana conspiracy.
gaskin argument is foreclosed by the supreme court decision in united states watts,d per curiam,which holds that a jury verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge,so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence,id.at.even before watts,this court had ruled that a b enhancement could be applied to a defendant acquitted of violating c.see united states,cir accord united states lynch,cir.
we defer to the district court credibility finding with respect to gahr testimony about gaskin firearm possession,see united states lynch,at crediting testimony of confidential informant that he had seen defendant carrying a gun during narcotics transactions,and conclude that it properly applied a b enhancement.
leadership role 
guideline a provides a enhancement i f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.a.gaskin submits that the district court erred both in finding him an organizer or leader and in concluding that five or more persons were involved in his drug transport scheme.
once again,gaskin argument depends on a view of the evidence that is most favorable to him rather than the government.notably,he eliminates from consideration as participants in his drug scheme all persons who were not themselves convicted or who were involved in the substantive crimes for which he was acquitted.this approach is at odds with a,the commentary to which states that a participant is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,but need not have been convicted.id.application note emphasis added see united states si lu tian,cir.
based on the totality of the trial evidence,the district court reasonably concluded that there were at least eight persons involved in the charged criminal activity gaskin castle gahr shaw the san diego supplier,mundahla gahr fellow courier,ron ruffin kevin miller and miller fellow courier,julie.indeed,it might have added a ninth participant the rochester aide identified by castle as sammy.defendant need have been an organizer or leader only with respect to any one of these participants for the a enhancement to apply.see united states si lu tian,at guidelines only require that the defendant be an organizer or leader of one or more of the five participants for the section a enhancement to be appropriate.accord united states zichettello,cir.factors relevant to determining whether defendant was an organizer or leader include the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others,application note.
the testimony of gahr and shaw indicated that gaskin met each of these criteria in managing their activities.he personally recruited both gahr and shaw to serve as drug couriers in an ambitious scheme to transport large quantities of marijuana on a regular basis in order to supply gaskin rochester distribution operation.gaskin planned and organized every detail of these drug transports.he exercised total control over the couriers conduct,affording them almost no discretion.he expended hundreds of thousands of dollars financing all aspects of the scheme from the acquisition of the drugs to reimbursement of the couriers travel expenses to covering legal costs.undoubtedly,he claimed the largest fruits of the crime all transported marijuana was delivered to him.we do not mean to suggest that only someone who,like gaskin,so clearly satisfies each and every factor detailed in application note qualifies as an organizer or leader.rather,we highlight this fact to emphasize the patent lack of merit to this part of gaskin sentencing challenge.we conclude that a enhancement was properly applied.
castle claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 
castle contends that he was denied the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.const.amend.vi.specifically,castle claims that counsel should not have stipulated to castle signature on four government trial exhibits or advised castle to pursue consideration at sentence,pursuant to.
this court is generally disinclined to resolve ineffective assistance claims on direct review.see united states khedr,at and cases cited therein.as the supreme court recently reminded us,in most cases a motion brought under is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance because the district court is best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.massaro united states,d.nevertheless,direct appellate review is not foreclosed.as we stated in united states morris,w hen faced with a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,we may decline to hear the claim,permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to remand the claim to the district court for necessary factfinding or decide the claim on the record before us,cir.the last option is appropriate when the factual record is fully developed and resolution of the sixth amendment claim on direct appeal is beyond any doubt or in the interest of justice.united states khedr,at internal quotation marks omitted.this is such a case.
a defendant seeking to overturn a conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel bears a heavy burden.he must demonstrate both that counsel performance was so unreasonable under prevailing professional norms that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,strickland washington,d and that counsel ineffectiveness prejudiced the defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.accord united states campbell,cir united states trzaska,cir.in applying this standard,a reviewing court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound legal strategy.strickland washington,at.quoting michel louisiana.paramount to any review of a claim of ineffectiveness is whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.id.at.castle can not satisfy the strict criteria of strickland.
castle faults his attorney for stipulating to his signature on four trial exhibits two postal forms relating to a post office box in his name,a signature card for his bank account,and his fbi fingerprint card.as a rule,counsel decision to stipulate to certain evidence,like his decisions to offer or object to evidence,involves a strategic choice,which is virtually unchallengeable if made after thorough investigation.id.at.see united states berkovich,cir holding counsel decision to enter into a global stipulation part of a reasonable trial strategy see also brown artuz,cir identifying what evidence should be introduced,what stipulations should be made,what objections should be raised,and what motions should be filed as matters that primarily involve trial strategy and tactics quoting united states teague,cir en banc.
castle does not contend that counsel decision to stipulate was not adequately investigated.instead,he relies on counsel statement to the district court that he would not have entered into the stipulation if he had known that the government would not call an fbi handwriting expert as a witness.counsel explained that the four stipulated signatures had been submitted to the fbi expert as known exemplars of castle handwriting for comparison with a disputed signature on a national car rental receipt.counsel entered into the stipulation as a convenience,expecting to the handwriting expert at trial about the qualified nature of her conclusions with respect to the rental receipt signature.trial,at.some time after the stipulation was read to the jury,the prosecution opted not to call the expert,leaving the jury to make its own comparison of the stipulated signatures and the one on the rental receipt.counsel complained had al castle known that the expert was not going to be coming in,he clearly would not have stipulated to anything.id.at.
even if we accept counsel at his word,this hardly demonstrates that his stipulation decision was objectively unreasonable at the time it was made.in evaluating the performance prong of an ineffective assistance claim,we do not view the challenged conduct through the distorting len
