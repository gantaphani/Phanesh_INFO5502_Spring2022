this appeal tees up a question that has divided our sister circuits does federal rule of criminal procedure,entitled sentencing and judgment,apply to a sentencing proceeding that follows the revocation of a term of supervised release we decline the opportunity to take a swing at answering this question.discretion is often the better part of valor,and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.
taking this prudential path,we bypass the rule question and address the appellant claims on the merits.after careful consideration,we affirm the sentence imposed.
we start with the travel of the case.on april,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of new hampshire charged geraldo gonzalez with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.see a.after accepting a guilty plea,the district court sentenced the appellant to a month term of immurement plus years of supervised release.
the appellant served his prison sentence but,during his ensuing supervised release,flunked drug tests administered by the probation department.following a hearing,the district court revoked his term of supervised release,sentenced him to serve months in prison,and imposed a new month supervised release term.
once again,the appellant served his prison sentence without apparent incident.withal,his second supervised release stint proved to be no more successful than his first.we offer a decurtate account of four incidents that collectively inform the appellant fall from grace.
nashua incident.in december of,the appellant was eyeing a group of three women at a nightclub in nashua,new hampshire.the women asked the appellant to move away.when he refused,the women attacked him and he responded in kind.the police arrived and broke up the altercation.
portsmouth incident.on january,the appellant and his quondam girlfriend were at a bar in portsmouth,new hampshire.according to the woman,the appellant struck her several times.at her instigation,a criminal complaint was filed in state court charging the appellant with simple assault,criminal threatening,and witness tampering.at the time of the later revocation hearing,these charges remained pending and unresolved.
the appellant says that no such assault transpired and that the events limned in the criminal complaint are fabrications.despite his protestations of innocence,the appellant probation officer filed a notice of violation based on the portsmouth incident and the related charges.a federal warrant issued for the appellant arrest.
lawrence incident.while attempting to execute this warrant,united states marshals spotted a car in lawrence,massachusetts.they believed that the appellant was driving the vehicle.they tried to effect a stop but,after a short chase,the driver eluded them.the car was later found abandoned its contents included shooting targets and two balls filled with a white powder.
new jersey incident.on february,while driving in new jersey,the appellant fell asleep at the wheel and wrecked his car.when police responded to the crash,the appellant furnished false identification.the officers were not bamboozled they ferreted out the appellant true identity and arrested him for possession of a simulated document.after a brief stay in a new jersey jail,the appellant was transferred to federal custody.
at a hearing held on october,the appellant pleaded guilty to three supervised release violations failure to make required daily phone calls to receive instructions commission of a new state criminal offense possession of a simulated document and leaving the jurisdiction without permission of either the court or the probation officer.the court asked questions about the two counts pertaining to the new jersey incident,and also commented about the nashua,portsmouth,and lawrence incidents.at the end of the hearing the court,surveying the tableau created by descriptions of the four incidents,revoked the extant term of supervised release.it then sentenced the appellant to a flat month incarcerative term without any additional period of supervised release.the appellant responded by prosecuting this timely appeal.
in this venue,the appellant attacks his sentence on two grounds.first,he asserts that the district court violated federal rule of criminal procedure i b by failing to make rulings on controverted issues of fact raised at sentencing.second,he asserts that the court factfinding the nashua incident was not only clearly erroneous but also adversely affected his sentence.
the appellant gives the heaviest emphasis to his rule argument.at the outset,we note that it is uncertain whether rule applies at all to revocation of a term of supervised release.the eleventh circuit has stated that i t is clear from the language of rule that it does not apply to revocation hearings.united states jackson,app x,cir per curiam accord united states hernandez gonzalez,app x,cir.in the same vein,some courts have declined to import rule grant of a right of allocution into supervised release revocation proceedings,reasoning that to do so would render rule,entitled revoking or modifying probation or supervised release,superfluous.see,united states waters,cir there is no indication that congress intended the additional requirements of rule to apply to supervised release sentencing.however,other courts have held that rule and rule are designed to work together in a complementary,not mutually exclusive,fashion see,united states patterson,cir per curiam united states rodriguez,cir.
we need not try to cut a passable swath through this thicket.assuming for argument sake,favorably to the appellant,that rule does apply to revocation proceedings,the appellant claim nonetheless fails.
before embarking on an explanation of our reasoning,we pause to say a few words about the standard of review.we normally review de novo a sentencing court compliance vel non with the strictures of rule.united states gonzález vélez,cir.here,however,the government contends that the appellant failure to articulate a particularized objection below constrains our analysis to plain error.we need not resolve this contretemps even under the more lens of de novo review,the claim of error is unavailing.
the claim of error focuses specifically on rule i b.this provision states that,at sentencing,the court must for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing,or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.for present purposes and without deciding the issue we treat the revocation report as the functional equivalent of a presentence report.
it is apodictic that,for the requirements of rule i b to attach,the defendant must first raise a factual dispute on which the district court can rule.see united states mcgee,cir explaining that facts must be sufficiently controverted to trigger the sentencing court duty internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant may fulfill this prerequisite by a written objection to the facts set forth in a presentence report,see.f,or,if there is good cause for the delay,by a speaking objection at the sentencing hearing,see.i d.there is nothing in the record to indicate that the appellant pursued either avenue.
the only relevant writing submitted by or on behalf of the appellant to the district court prior to the revocation hearing was a sentencing memorandum the memorandum.the memorandum did not contain any objection to the facts limned in the revocation report.nor has the appellant identified anything in the memorandum that plausibly could be so construed.
by the same token,during the course of the revocation hearing the appellant did not dispute any of the circumstances of the nashua,portsmouth,or lawrence incidents to the precise contrary,defense counsel specifically advised the court of the appellant decision not to contest or otherwise offer conflicting evidence regarding those three incidents.
the colloquy that occurred at the revocation hearing bears out this conclusion.as to the nashua incident,the prosecutor indicated that he had no reason to question
