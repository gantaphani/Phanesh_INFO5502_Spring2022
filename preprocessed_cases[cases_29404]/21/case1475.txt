leon williams appeals from a june,judgment of conviction and sentence of the united states district court for the southern district of new york sand.williams was convicted of a drug trafficking crime which carried a mandatory minimum sentence under b a,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of that drug trafficking crime,an offense which carried a mandatory minimum consecutive sentence e xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law under c a i.in this opinion,we address whether the district court erred in imposing the mandatory minimum consecutive sentence under section c a i even though a greater minimum sentence was provided for the predicate drug trafficking crime.in united states whitley,cir,reh g denied,cir,we held that the mandatory minimum sentence under section c a was inapplicable where the defendant was subject to a longer mandatory minimum sentence for a career criminal firearm possession violation.we now hold that the mandatory minimum sentence under section c a is also inapplicable where the defendant is subject to a longer mandatory minimum sentence for a drug trafficking offense that is part of the same criminal transaction or set of operative facts as the firearm offense.
we therefore affirm the district court judgment of conviction and remand to give the district court the opportunity to resentence williams consistent with our holding that williams is not subject to the mandatory minimum under section c a.we also conclude that remand is required pursuant to united states regalado,cir.we reject williams other challenges to his conviction and sentence on appeal.
background 
at trial,the government presented evidence that on the evening of february,two new york city police department officers on patrol saw williams standing next to a parked car on the side of the road,urinating.as the officers approached,they saw that inside the car were multiple cellular phones,wads of cash wrapped in rubber bands,and a plastic bag containing white residue,later determined to be narcotics.one of the officers also noticed a strange odor which he associated with narcotics.later that evening,an inventory search of the car revealed a hidden compartment containing a loaded gun,a gun magazine,bullets,and small bags of powder and crack cocaine.williams fingerprints were on the gun magazine.at trial,williams admitted that he had been driving the car,which was registered to his sister,and that the cellular phones and cash,which totaled,were his.
the jury found williams guilty of three counts possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony,in violation of g possessing with intent to distribute over grams of crack cocaine,in violation of,a b a and possessing a firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime charged in count two,in violation of c a i.williams was sentenced principally to months imprisonment on count one,to run concurrently with a sentence of months imprisonment on count two drug trafficking,and an additional consecutive five years months imprisonment on count three possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking,for a total of months imprisonment.
the conviction carried no mandatory minimum sentence.g.but the drug trafficking conviction carried a mandatory minimum penalty of ten years under b a.because section b a is any other provision of law that otherwise provide s a greater minimum sentence,c a,williams argues that the minimum for possession of a firearm under section c a i does not apply.williams also raises various other challenges to his conviction and sentence.
discussion 
section c united states whitley 
section c provides graduated penalties for various types of firearm use.in united states whitley,cir,reh g denied,cir,we interpreted the introductory except clause of section c a that subsection provides,in pertinent part 
except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime 
i be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years 
ii if the firearm is brandished,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and 
iii if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
c a emphasis added.
in whitley,the defendant was convicted of three offenses all stemming from the same armed robbery a hobbs act violation,with no mandatory minimum penalty,see an armed career criminal act acca offense for possession of a firearm after conviction of three prior offenses,for which the minimum penalty was fifteen years,see g,e and a section c offense for discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,for which the minimum penalty was a consecutive ten years,see c a iii.we concluded that the consecutive minimum penalty under section c did not apply because a higher minimum was imposed by the acca.whitley,at.
in reaching this conclusion,we rejected the government argument that the except clause relates solely to those firearms offenses specified in section c.id.at.we held that the except clause of section c means what it literally says that the minimum sentences it requires do not apply where a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law.id.quoting c a emphasis added.any other provision of law includes the acca.we rejected the government arguments that this literal interpretation of the except clause is unsupported by the text,design,or the purpose of the statute,would produce illogical and distorted outcomes that congress clearly did not intend,and has been rejected by other circuits.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.we observed that,other than the decisions that have rewritten the except clause in different ways to escape its plain meaning,we are aware of no decision rejecting the literal meaning of statutory language to the detriment of a criminal defendant.id.at see also whitley,at.
we are,of course,bound by our own precedent unless and until its rationale is overruled,implicitly or expressly,by the supreme court or this court en banc.nicholas goord,cir quotation marks omitted.we must therefore determine whether the question of statutory interpretation in this case is materially different from the question addressed by whitley.there are two potentially relevant differences in whitley,the longer mandatory minimum sentence was provided by the acca for conduct,while in this case,it is provided by a offense and in whitley,the longer mandatory minimum sentence under the acca was to run consecutively with the sentence on the predicate offense,while in this case,the longer mandatory minimum sentence is supplied by that predicate offense.the government now argues that whitley should be limited to its is,to instances in which a defendant faces two consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for conduct resulting from the use of a single gun.the government again argues that its interpretation is required by the statutory text and structure,the legislative history,and to avoid illogical applications of the statute.we conclude that to accept the government position would contravene the reasoning and result of whitley.
statutory text 
s tatutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.puello bcis,cir quotation marks omitted see also whitley,at.the government argues that the clause e xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law,is ambiguous because it only directs a court where to look for the greater minimum any other provision of law,and does not specify the offense to which the greater minimum sentence may apply.see c a.the government urges that we adopt the first circuit conclusion that the except clause is ambiguous because it does not say a greater minimum sentence for what yet it has to have some understood referent to be intelligible.united states parker,cir.the first circuit rejected the possibilities that the referent could be any other crime related to this case or the underlying drug crime or crime of violence,and held that the more sensible referent is an additional minimum sentence for an underlying offense because of the presence of the firearm.id.the first circuit reasoned that whitley was distinguishable because the danger in whitley was the possibility of mandatory minimum consecutive firearms sentences could have applied for crimes involving the same gun.id.in parker,as here,the higher mandatory minimum sentence was supplied by a drug crime.id.
but this distinction finds no support in whitley.we held in whitley that the except clause is not means what it literally says.at.in whitley,we rejected the judicial insertion of the words consecutive and firearm into the except clause.id.at.we noted that the supreme court had recently condemn ed the insertion of words into a statute as not faithful to the statutory text,in united states rodriquez,in which it rejected the defendant argument that reads section e as referring to the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law for a defendant with no prior convictions that trigger a recidivist enhancement,because that is not what section e says.at quoting united states rodriquez,d emphasis in original.
we are not persuaded that the phrase any other provision of law is insusceptible to a plain reading.there is a discrete set of statutory offenses which require mandatory minimum for narcotics and firearm crimes,but also for murder and other dangerous weapons.see,biological weapons id.firearms id.restricted ammunition id.murder id.missile systems id.radiological dispersal devices,drugs.it is plausible to understand the reference to any other provision of law to include this limited set of crimes for which mandatory minimum sentences apply.as amicus counsel point out,there is no indication in the statutory language that congress intended to be more lenient to defendants with multiple convictions for conduct than to defendants convicted of drug trafficking crimes or other violent offenses,or that it intended to draw any distinction among offenses subject to minimum sentences.amicus br.at.
the statutory scheme supports this literal reading.section is the penalties section of chapter,firearms,of title of the united states code.if congress had intended the except clause to refer only to punishments for firearms offenses,it could simply have drafted that clause to read except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this section.instead,congress chose the more expansive phrase,this subsection section a or any other provision of law.c a emphasis added.
in holding that the except clause includes sentences for predicate offenses,we do not hold that the except clause is unbounded.the clause carves out an exception to the general rule that any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime and in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall face an additional mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment.c.thus,it is natural to read any other provision of law to include the penalty for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,so long as the firearm was possessed during and in relation to or in furtherance of that predicate offense.id.in other words,the except clause includes minimum sentences for predicate statutory offenses arising from the same criminal transaction or operative set of facts.an interpretation of any other provision of law,to include,for example,provisions under which a defendant was already sentenced for a prior unrelated crime in a previous case,would be suspect.in this case,it is undisputed that the firearm possession that subjected williams to the penalty under section c arose from the same criminal transaction as the drug trafficking offense 
the government asserts that other provisions of the statute support its structural argument that congress intended that courts impose a consecutive,or,sentence for a section c offense without regard to the sentence imposed for the underlying predicate offense.specifically,the statute states that the graduated penalties set forth in sections c a i iii must be applied in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,c a emphasis added see parker,at concluding that this language renders the literal reading of the except clause suspect on its face and n otwithstanding any other provision of law no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person,including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was used,carried,or possessed,c d ii emphases added.the government points to this court recent decision in united states chavez,which relied on this language to conclude that section c was plainly designed to impose penalties that are cumulative to the penalties imposed for other crimes,cir.
to be sure,the general rule of section c is that its penalties are cumulative.but the except clause is an exception to that rule.the government would have the rule swallow the exception.in whitley,we rejected the argument that section c d ii prohibition on concurrent punishments would be displaced by a literal interpretation of the except clause if the except clause is read literally,and another statute provides a higher minimum penalty,the minimum punishments set forth in the subdivisions of section c a would never be imposed at all,and thus,there would be no concurrent sentences.see whitley,at.
the government also urges this court to adopt the fourth circuit reasoning that the statute reference to any other provision of law is a safety valve that simply reserv es the possibility that another statute or provision might impose a greater minimum consecutive sentencing scheme for a c violation,and does not negat e the possibility of consecutive sentencing in the circumstances in which the defendant faces a greater mandatory minimum sentence for a predicate or offense.united states studifin,cir the fourth circuit based its conclusion on united states alaniz,cir,in which the eighth circuit held that the except clause was added just to make the statute grammatically correct.we rejected that precise line of reasoning in whitley,because we failed to see any grammatical problem with the statute absent the except clause,and because the argument could not explain why the statute includes the broad phrase or by any other provision of law.at.
legislative history 
the government urges that we turn to the legislative history to fill in the purported gap in the statutory language.only if we discern ambiguity do we resort first to canons of statutory construction,and,if the meaning remains ambiguous,to legislative history.daniel am.bd.of emergency,cir citations omitted.although we do not find the statutory terms to be ambiguous,were we to conclude that there was ambiguity,we would follow the supreme court directive to interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants,not prosecutors,rather than attempt to play the part of a mind reader divining congress presumptive intent.united states santos,d.see also united states granderson,d courts must resolve ambiguities in favor of criminal defendants crandon united states,d when construing a criminal statute,courts are guided by the need for fair warning mcnally united states,d when confronted with two rational readings of a criminal statute,one harsher than the other,courts are to choose the harsher only when congress has spoken in clear and definite language,superseded by statute,as recognized by united states rybicki,cir en banc.
the government argues that if williams had been sentenced before the except clause was added to the statute in,he would have faced bot
