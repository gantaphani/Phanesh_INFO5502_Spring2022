neron christie christie appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jones,entered january,denying christie motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to c.because the district court did not provide a sufficient explanation of its decision not to reduce christie sentence despite his eligibility for such a reduction,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in and,neron christie participated in conspiracies to distribute cocaine base crack cocaine in the new york city area.christie also sold several firearms,including a gauge shotgun,an intratec tec semiautomatic pistol,and a caliber pistol.
on september,christie pled guilty to drug offenses under a,b a and,as well as firearms offenses under a a and g.in the written plea agreement,christie stipulated to an applicable drug quantity of at least grams but less than grams of cocaine base,and a base offense level of pursuant to c.the parties also stipulated to a grouping analysis under and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under u.the parties agreed that christie adjusted offense level was and that he belonged in criminal history category v.this yielded an advisory range of to months imprisonment under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines.the pre sentence report subsequently prepared by the probation office largely tracked the parties guidelines calculation in the plea agreement,except that it concluded that christie belonged in criminal history category vi.
on march,united states district judge barbara jones sentenced christie to months imprisonment,to be followed by months supervised release.the statement of reasons in the judgment reported that the court adopt ed the factual finding s and guideline application in the presentence report except that the court has determined that a criminal history category of v rather than vi is appropriate.christie sentence of months thus was at the bottom of his guidelines range of to months.
on november,christie filed a motion pursuant to c to have his sentence reduced in light of the amendments to the sentencing guidelines that lowered the penalties applicable to crack cocaine offenses.on april,the district court granted christie motion and reduced his sentence to months imprisonment,which again represented the low end of his new guidelines range of months.
on january,christie filed a second motion under c for a further sentence reduction in light of the amendments to the sentencing guidelines lowering the penalties for crack cocaine offenses.in a letter to the district court,defense counsel urged the court to reduce christie sentence to a term of months imprisonment.the letter relied heavily on a memorandum dated november,from the probation office to the district court the probation memo,which found christie to be eligible for a sentence reduction based on his new amended guidelines range of months.in reaching this conclusion,the probation memo noted that the drug weight involved in christie offense,grams of cocaine base,straddled three offense levels under the amended guidelines,but the lowest level was applied.thus,the probation memo found that christie base offense level was,which was the level applicable to offenses involving grams of cocaine base under the amendments.see c.after two levels were added under the grouping analysis of and three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility under,the probation memo concluded that christie new adjusted offense level was.with a criminal history category of v,this yielded an amended guidelines range of months.defense counsel letter argued that a sentence at the low end of this range was appropriate in light of,inter alia,christie conduct and his prior sentences at the bottom of the guidelines ranges.
the government submitted a letter to the district court on february,conceding that,under the amended guidelines,the defendant total offense level is,resulting in an applicable guidelines range of to months imprisonment.despite agreeing that the court has the discretion to reduce the defendant sentence,the government argued that the district court should decline to reduce christie sentence because of his firearms offenses and extensive criminal history 
on january,almost a year after christie filed his motion for a sentence reduction,the district court entered an order denying the motion.the order,which consisted of the first page of a form formerly available through the administrative office of the united states courts form ao,contained no content beyond the notation that the motion was denied.the text included boilerplate language stating that the court had considered the defendant motion under c,and that the court had tak en into account the policy statement set forth at and the sentencing factors set forth in a.the court electronically checked a box marked denied below that language without adding a note indicating why.although the form provided space for an explanation page one contained about half a page of empty space before a set of blanks for the date and a judge signature,and page two provided additional room for comments on the sentence imposed the court wrote nothing.christie appealed from the court order on january.

although district courts generally may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,if the defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission pursuant to o,the court may reduce the term of imprisonment,after considering the factors set forth in section a to the extent that they are applicable,if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.c.the supreme court has set forth a inquiry for resolving motions pursuant to c for a sentence reduction.dillon united states,see also united states bethea,slip op.at cir,per curiam.first,the district court must determine whether the defendant in question is eligible for a reduction in sentence,which requires that such a reduction would be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission namely.united states mock,cir emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.if,and only if,a defendant is eligible for a reduction in sentence under c and,then the second step of the analytical framework set forth in dillon requires the district court to consider any applicable a factors and determine whether,in its discretion,the reduction authorized by reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.

in its submissions to the district court,the government conceded that christie was eligible to be resentenced and expressly agreed that he had an amended guidelines range of months imprisonment.the probation office likewise concluded that christie was eligible for a reduction.the government does not contest christie eligibility for a reduction on appeal.we have previously noted that i n general,we are entitled to assume that the sentencing judge understood all the available sentencing options.united states sanchez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,although the district court order does not explicitly state that christie was eligible for a reduced sentence,we may presume that the court below recognized christie eligibility for a reduced sentence,and then proceeded,in an exercise of its discretion,to decline to lower christie sentence
