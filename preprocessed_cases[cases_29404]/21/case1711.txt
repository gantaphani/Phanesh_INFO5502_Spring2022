background 
at all relevant times,ravelo was a member of the luquer street boys,a brooklyn,new york,street gang.on july,ravelo,together with other members of the gang,traveled in one of a caravan of two automobiles to a hangout of the hard pack,a rival street gang.the purpose of the trip,according to ravelo,was to go beat up members of the hard pack with bats and golf clubs,among other weapons,in retaliation for a prior altercation between the two groups.tr.of pleadings before marilyn go,plea tr,at.although one of the two automobiles belonged to ravelo,on instructions of a superior,another gang member drove that car.
before departing,ravelo expected a fight,but he did not,according to his lawyer,anticipate gunfire.while en route,however,ravelo learned that another passenger was armed.ravelo nonetheless continued to participate in the planned assault.
as the luquer street boys caravan drove by the hard pack hangout,a member or members fired shots from the caravan,and members of the hard pack returned fire.the members of the luquer street boys then fled the scene.although,fortuitously,no one was injured during the exchange of fire,shortly thereafter thomas palazatto,a member of the luquer street boys,was shot and killed,apparently by hard pack members in retaliation for the shootout that the luquer street boys had initiated.
on june,new york city police officers arrested ravelo on unrelated state charges of credit card fraud the following day,while ravelo was held in police custody,he was questioned about the palazatto murder.according to his later admission during the course of plea proceedings,ravelo told the detective that he had witnessed the murder of palazatto but really did see it.plea tr.at.ravelo later conceded that the statement to new york city police regarding palazatto murder was false and indicated that he thought that in addition to the police officer,an agent of the federal government was present at the time he made it.
based on his participation in the shootout,ravelo was charged in an information filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york with conspiracy to commit assault in aid of racketeering in violation of a based on his statement regarding palazatto murder,ravelo was also charged with making a false statement to a federal agent in violation of a.in a proceeding on march,before united states magistrate judge marilyn go,ravelo sought to plead guilty to both counts.after inquiring into ravelo state of mind and hearing his admissions to the conduct described above,the magistrate judge recommended that ravelo guilty plea be accepted,a recommendation later adopted by the district court.
between june and september,while ravelo was free on bail on the conspiracy and false statement charges,he used the social security numbers of his landlord,riqi wang,and others to apply fraudulently for credit cards that he then used in multiple attempts to transfer money to himself via western union.ravelo fraudulently obtained at least eight credit cards issued under the names of eight different persons.two of these heenan card and the wang card appear to have had limits of and respectively.ravelo made nine unsuccessful attempts to obtain either or using the wang card on july and.on august and,he made seven attempts,also all unsuccessful,to use the heenan card to obtain various amounts each approximating.on the basis of these failed attempts to transfer money to himself,and other uses of fraudulently procured credit cards not at issue in this appeal,ravelo was charged by information in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york with one count of credit card fraud under a and c a i.on november,he pled guilty before the district court to this count.
on march,ravelo appeared before the district court for sentencing with respect to the crimes charged in both informations.the court determined that ravelo criminal history category was iii,and that his total offense level was,resulting in a guidelines imprisonment range of to months.on the assault count,the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,the statutory maximum,and one year supervised release.on each of the false statement and credit card counts,the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment and three years supervised release.the court noted that it had the power under the guidelines to impose consecutive sentences for the crimes charged in the two informations.agreeing with ravelo and the government,however,and in light of ravelo enrollment in a substance abuse program,the court decided not to do so,observing that it had been persuaded not to separate these siamese twins we got here.tr.of sentencing hearing before john gleeson,sentencing tr,at the result was a net sentence of months imprisonment and three years supervised release.the district court also imposed a special assessment,and ordered ravelo to make restitution in the amount of,reflecting the harm caused by successful fraudulent transactions conducted by him and by a.
on appeal,ravelo challenges two determinations made by the district court in calculating his offense level its rejection of ravelo application for a minor role adjustment pursuant to b and its calculation of the intended loss under b based upon the sum of the amounts sought in the multiple unsuccessful attempts to withdraw approximately the limit on a credit card rather than upon the amount of the limit.

standard of review

ii.minor role adjustment 
an adjustment for a defendant minor role under b is warranted only if the defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant.united states jeffers,cir quoting cmt.a.the burden of proof to establish that a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment is on the defendant.in making this highly determination,united states shonubi,cir,a district court looks to factors such as the nature of the defendant relationship to other participants,the importance of the defendant actions to the success of the venture,and the defendant awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise,united states yu,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
according to the district court 
ravelo role in the conspiracy to commit assault in aid of racketeering was integral.he provided the car 
he was part of a gang.he went to pick up fellow gang members,to find some members of a rival gang to assault.it was obviously foreseeable to him that any dangerous weapons available,whether it bats or golf clubs or firearms,would be used.he lucky no one was hurt,despite the.
there is no merit whatsoever to the argument that he should receive a mitigating role adjustment.i reject it.
sentencing tr.at.there is no basis for ravelo argument that the district court findings of fact in this regard are erroneous,let alone clearly so.
in applying the law to these facts,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to characterize ravelo role in the assault crime as minor.this conclusion is fully supported by the court findings that ravelo was a member of a gang,knew the gang was going to attack a rival gang,supplied a car,and provided support by his presence as a passenger in the car,even if he did not commit or intend to commit the assault himself.
ravelo contention that he was only following orders does not require a contrary conclusion.perhaps it indicates that ravelo did not conceive the crime,but it does not show that he was substantially less culpable than the average participant.jeffers,at see also yu,at stating that to be eligible for a reduction,the defendant conduct must be minor as compared to the average participant in such a crime internal quotation mark omitted shonubi,at concluding that it was not clearly erroneous for a district court to decide that a lowly courier was not entitled to a minor role adjustment on the basis of status.
iii.loss calculation 
under b,the offense level of a defendant who engages in credit card fraud or another economic offense,such as theft or embezzlement resulting in a loss exceeding is based upon a graduated loss table.as applied to this case,the table provides that if ravelo caused a loss of more than but not greater than,the offense level would increase by.b d.but if he caused a loss of more than,the offense level would increase by.id.b e.
subject to certain exceptions not applicable here,loss in this context is defined as the greater of actual loss or intended loss.cmt.a.intended loss,in turn,
i means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense and ii includes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur,as in a government sting operation,or an insurance fraud in which the claim exceeded the insured value.
the united states sentencing commission added the definition of intended loss in cmt.a ii,quoted above,to resolve a split among the circuits.prior to the adoption of this application note,some federal courts of appeals had held that intended loss only encompassed possible loss,invoking a policy of punishing criminals in light of economic reality or amounts put at risk.see,supp.to app.c,amend.the definition of intended loss now makes clear,however,that a loss may be intended irrespective of whether it could actually occur.
although there is no direct documentary evidence in the record to this effect,the district court appeared to accept ravelo representation that two of the credit cards involved in ravelo heenan card and the wang limits of and respectively.ravelo made seven attempts,all unsuccessful,to use the heenan card to obtain various amounts approximating he also made nine unsuccessful attempts to obtain either or using the wang card.ravelo contends that these unsuccessful attempts represent a total intended loss of.he reasons that the maximum amount of loss he sought to cause to his intended victims by his use of the cards was the maximum the banks would have advanced to him under the cards limits.the government successfully argued in the district court to the contrary in its view,each unsuccessful attempt to withdraw using the heenan card or using the wang card was an independent attempt to cause loss.the court therefore concluded that all of the attempts to cause loss should have been added together to determine the total intended loss.
the district court view of the matter is reflected in the following exchange 
willstatter ravelo counsel we know with respect to the heenan and wang cards that the wang card had six hundred dollars cash advance limit.the heenan card had a six thousand dollar cash advance limit,which is why there were attempts to get that amount of money.
so we think that it highly exaggerates the loss in the case to say that because michael ravelo tried six sic times to get the approximately six thousand dollars,that that thousand dollars in loss 
the court i am intrigued by the premise to your argument.suppose i need a hundred thousand dollars.i go and try to rob ten banks and each time i go i ca get any money.is my intended you saying my intended loss is only a hundred thousand dollars even though i tried to rob a hundred thousand dollars ten times 
willstatter this is not a bank robbery 
the court i do buy the premise.every single time he unsuccessfully sought to use the card on that occasion he intended a six hundred dollar loss.you aggregate those,those are separate acts.i see nothing in this guideline that says simply because he unsuccessful and tries again we should only count his intent once.
willstatter well,respectfully,the reason i think that the guidelines say that is because the guidelines focus on the intended loss.
the court right.
willstatter the defendant intent was to get the six thousand dollars in the case of the heenan card.
the court how many times did he bear that intent,how many separate occasions 
willstatter he bore it several times.
the court that what i am counting.
sentencing tr.at.
under the district court view,when combined with other losses occasioned by the fraud perpetrated by ravelo and his,ravelo intended loss with respect to the heenan and wang cards put the total loss for guidelines purposes over the mark,requiring an upward adjustment.under ravelo view,the total loss was more than but not greater than,requiring only a upward adjustment.
we have considerable doubt about some aspects of the district court approach,as we understand it,at least in the abstract.if a person seeks to use a credit card fraudulently to draw down what he or she thinks to be the maximum limit on the card,we doubt that the number of attempts it turns out he or she must make to obtain the funds can affect what the person intends to gain and what he or she correspondingly intends the victim to lose the card limit.if ravelo knew,for example,that the heenan card had a maximum limit and it took him ten tries to obtain that,we do not understand why the loss he intended must necessarily be assessed at ten times what it would have been had he struck paydirt on his first attempt.had ravelo been attempting to sell the fraudulent card rather than trying to obtain a cash advance on it,surely the fact that he was unable to complete a transaction until his tenth approach to a prospective buyer would not mean he necessarily intended to impose a loss ten times the amount had he sold the card to his first prospective buyer.the number of attempts required to complete a crime may reflect at most the criminal level of competence at the crime attempted,particularly when the repeated attempts occur within a relatively short period of time.it would seem odd at best to read the guidelines to the contrary,requiring a sentence the severity of which varies inversely with the skill of the perpetrator 
whatever our concerns in the abstract,however,the concrete question is not before us.by letter dated the day before ravelo sentencing hearing,the government put ravelo on notice that it was the government position that the evidence did not support the conclusion that he had an intention of stopping at the credit limits of the cards ravelo argued at the hearing that he was chargeable only with an intended loss in the amount of the limits of the credit cards.but ravelo,despite the ample opportunity he had to do so,offered no direct evidence at the hearing or elsewhere as to his knowledge or belief regarding the limits,his intent to constrain the amount of loss he caused to those limits,or whether the limits were in fact in the amounts he claims.
ravelo suggests that the district court should nonetheless have drawn those inferences.for support,he points to the fact that the district court was apparently aware that he had made repeated attempts to withdraw amounts approximating the limits on the heenan and wang cards.sentencing tr.at appellant br.at.but while that might suggest that ravelo knew the limits of those cards,his attempts to obtain funds in amounts approximating those limits do not necessarily tend to establish that,had he been successful in one of those attempts,he would n
