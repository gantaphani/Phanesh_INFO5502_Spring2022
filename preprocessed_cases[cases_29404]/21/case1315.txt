this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york griesa,convicting appellant sanjaya bahel of four counts of use of the mail or wires in furtherance of fraud that deprived the united nations,his former employer,of its intangible right to his honest services in violation of,one count of corrupt receipt of things of value with intent to be rewarded with respect to official business in violation of and one count of conspiracy in violation of.we hold that the united nations expressly waived bahel immunity,and even if it had not,bahel himself waived any claim of immunity by failing to raise the issue until the trial was complete.we also hold that the united nations participation act,which authorizes the payment of the united states dues to the united nations,is both a federal program and a benefit within the meaning of section,which encompasses bribes as well as illegal gratuities.we further hold section is broad enough to encompass honest services fraud committed by a foreign worker at the,that bahel was properly sentenced as a public official under the sentencing guidelines section,and that the district court committed no error in ordering bahel to pay restitution in the form of remitting a portion of his salary at the,which amounted to what bahel was paid during the time he was suspended pending investigation of the conduct underlying his conviction.for the following reasons,the judgment of conviction is affirmed.
background 
the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial,and are presented in the light most favorable to the government.see united states ivezaj,cir.
sanjaya bahel served as a chief of the commodity procurement section within the procurement division from to.beginning around,nanak kohli,a long time friend of bahel,began to seek business as a supplier to the,with the assistance of his sons,nishan and ranjit as a section chief for the procurement division,bahel assisted the kohlis in their efforts to secure contracts as a supplier.in connection with the prosecution of bahel,nishan kohli,an indicted coconspirator,became a cooperating witness for the government and the primary source of information regarding bahel activities on behalf of the kohli family 
bahel work performance was subject to a variety of rules,which inform the contours of the duty bahel owed to his employer.these included an obligation to discharge his job duties with impartiality to work in the interests to avoid using his position for gain to obtain approval from the secretary general for gifts not to have an association with an entity seeking business and to disclose any conflicts of interest or be recused in such circumstances.the government offered evidence at trial to show that bahel violated these requirements,and by extension,certain federal statutes by providing the kohli family with inside information on the bidding process for contracts convincing employees that the kohli companies bids did not raise concerns counseling the kohlis on how to win contracts and assisting in the preparation of documentation to the,without disclosing to the bahel friendship with the kohlis or the financial benefits that the kohlis provided to bahel during the period that his assistance was given.
the government focused on three contracts at trial a digital trunking contract a communications and information technology manpower contract and a engineering manpower contract.first,in,the kohli family company,tcil,bid for the digital trunking contract,but was found technically.in response,bahel insisted that peacekeeping officials hold tutorials with tcil,which had provided the lowest bid,to see if it was possible to overcome technical deficiencies.when officials determined the technical flaws could not be rectified,bahel sent a letter objecting to the determination.at trial,one official testified that i t did appear to him and others within his section at the time that bahel involvement happened on a more regular basis with cases related to tcil.
next,in,tcil won a million contract for manpower support,although the company had no experience in that area.when peacekeeping learned that tcil was not providing the mission subsistence allowance msa stipend to its employees,peacekeeping sought to cancel the contract.bahel intervened.he had conversations with the kohlis,during which they discussed having workers sign letters of satisfaction stating that they had received the msa or its equivalent.bahel,along with nanak kohli,then met with members of the office of legal affairs.during that meeting,bahel never disclosed that he and nanak were old friends or that the two previously had private conversations regarding the contract.indeed,bahel never told the other meeting participants that he knew nanak in any capacity other than an official one.thus,the employees at the meeting believed that bahel was acting on behalf of the united nations insofar as he was negotiating at the meeting.the product of the meeting was that tcil and the eventually agreed that these letters were sufficient to avoid cancellation of the contract.nishan kohli would later testify that this resolution did little more than maintain the status quo,because,pursuant to the plan the kohlis negotiated with bahel,tcil put a lot of pressure on the workers to sign the letters,by explain ing to them that if they continued to complain the contract could be canceled and they would all be without jobs.tcil also threatened to encash the security deposit required of all workers,if they did cooperate.
finally,in,peacekeeping asked the to provide engineers for its missions around the world.nishan testified that his family learned of this request from bahel more than a month before it was published on the website.he also testified that bahel notified the kohlis that it was coming and that they should prepare for it.nishan testified that this information was beneficial because the kohli family new company,thunderbird,had not actually registered with the un so they had to go through that process which would take a bit of time.nishan further testified that in general early notification was helpful to them because they were really qualified or prepared to ultimately respond to this kind of requirement,so any additional time that they could get was helpful.in order to get thunderbird registered,nishan stated that i t was their intention to basically fake experience with providing manpower services.nishan testified that the kohlis had discussed this approach with bahel,who they considered an adviser.thunderbird registration was thereafter approved.
when the kohli family was preparing its bid,bahel discussed with them the price to bid in order to maximize the chances of obtaining the contract.indeed,nishan testified that t he very final numbers that i entered in by hand on the day of submission were read to me by bahel and i transcribed them over the telephone while talking to him.in response to queries from the kohlis regarding their lack of experience,bahel advised them that they would have to produce some form of experience or they would be qualified.specifically,he told them to get,by whatever means,letters stating that they had,in fact,this experience.
later,when peacekeeping raised concerns about thunderbird references,bahel gave the kohlis the on that unofficially and advised them to get in touch with the companies in advance and let them know that there would be a call coming from the and make sure they corroborate what they said in these letters.bahel instructed his subordinates to check the references by sending faxes to the relevant addresses,but crippled their ability to do so by allowing them to check on information provided only on the letters of reference themselves or in the thunderbird financial proposal.bahel ultimately told peacekeeping that the references checked out,were valid,and that this was a company with vast international contracts of high dollar amount,and they were performing well around the world.
bahel signed a request for audited financial statements,which nishan kohli testified caused him some concern,because the kohlis did have audited financial statements for thunderbird.the kohli family discussed the matter with bahel,who recommended that the kohlis argue to the that thunderbird was a limited liability corporation and privately owned and therefore not subject to requirements for audited statements.bahel repeated the same argument internally to personnel,explaining that law did not require limited liability companies to furnish audited statements.when bahel eventually had to tell the kohlis that they would not be able to avoid submitting audited financial statements,he was simultaneously working internally at the to limit their exposure to a full blown audit.although one of bahel subordinates recommended that the request three years of financial statements,on the ground that the should have some history of thunderbird llc financial performance,meaning financial audited statements or tax return,if they do have these,bahel requested only one year of audited statements from the company.
nishan testified that he was away when the financial statements were due,so,he sent an email to his brother,ranjit kohli,with a draft cover letter for thunderbird,which nishan wanted ranjit to put on top of the statements that the kohlis would ultimately receive from the account and sen d to the un after discussing it with bahel.the email also contained certain instructions regarding the submission of the statements.specifically,nishan instructed ranjit if possible check with sb if any changes need to be made to the cover letter,before submitting the statements.
on august,peacekeeping sent a memo ranking thunderbird at the bottom of the list of five companies bidding for the engineering manpower contract.peacekeeping found that thunderbird was only marginally compliant and lack ed sufficient documentation as to the company main product or line of work.among the concerns was the fact that thunderbird was not registered with dun bradstreet.in response,bahel instructed the kohlis to immediately register with dun bradstreet,which they did.
thunderbird was required to post a performance bond in order to qualify for the contract.ordinarily,a company would be required to post a performance bond,which was also what was specified in the request for proposals regarding this particular contract.however,when it came to thunderbird the un wanted an additional amount because they were a new company fully registered with the un and were only marginally compliant with the requirement s for the contract.nishan attended a meeting at the on this issue.he testified that he spoke to bahel in advance of the meeting unofficially and bahel briefed him for what was going to happen in the meeting.specifically,bahel told nishan that they would be discussing the audited statements,that they be discussing an enhanced performance bond.bahel also gave nishan a bit of insight on redfren,bahel subordinate,who was scheduled to attend the meeting,including on her personality and her work patterns.after the meeting took place,bahel called nishan to say that the had asked for an additional million bond.bahel also told nishan informally that he could probably get away with and said to offer half a million and to negotiate from there.
bahel received a number of financial benefits from the kohli family in exchange for the assistance he provided.between and,he received cash payments from to on a near monthly basis.the kohlis also gave bahel a laptop computer worth more than.an email sent by ranjit to nishan before bahel had physically received the computer stated sanjay does want the laptop to mention kohli anywhere.bahel received plane tickets to india and seats to the open tennis tournament.the most significant financial benefit was bahel rental,between october and april,and eventual purchase,of the kohli apartment a few blocks from the in the dag hammarskjold towers.the kohlis initially charged bahel per month rent when he first moved into the apartment,though the previous tenant had paid.lowering the rent further,bahel paid no rent for three months of each year of the lease.after the kohlis purchased the apartment in for million and invested in renovations,they sold the apartment to bahel in may for million.bahel misrepresented both the amount of rent and the purchase price of the apartment in communications to the board of the building.he also later told the contractor who renovated the apartment to conceal the connection between bahel and the kohlis.nishan testified that,at that time,the market value of the apartment was approximately million.
nishan kohli received a federal subpoena in late,at which point he notified bahel of the subpoena,who expressed concern.both then,and in subsequent conversations,bahel spoke with nishan about ways to conceal their relationship.specifically,bahel and nishan talked back and forth,and bahel suggested that the two get rid of a few things that could be incriminating for them,including files on nishan laptop and anything else that might link the two together.during these conversations,bahel also suggested that nishan just transfer the remaining files that nishan would need from his laptop to a new machine and dump the old one altogether,destroy it.
in july,the procurement fraud task force issued a report detailing a financial relationship between bahel and the kohlis.the referred the report to the united states attorney office.on october,a grand jury returned a sealed indictment against bahel and nishan kohli.the indictment contained six counts.counts one and two charged bahel with defrauding the of its intangible right to his honest services and using the mails in furtherance of that scheme,in violation of and.counts three and four charged bahel with defrauding the of its intangible right to his honest services and using interstate wire communications to further that scheme,in violation of and.count five charged bahel with participating in a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,and to corruptly accept things of value with an intent to be influenced or rewarded with respect to the award of contracts to companies associated with the kohlis,in violation of.count six charged bahel with the substantive offense of corruptly accepting and soliciting various things of value with the intent to be influenced or rewarded with respect to the award of contracts to the kohli companies,in violation of a b 
in an october,letter to the,the attorney office stated that it had sufficient evidence to bring federal charges against bahel relating to his receipt of things of value from in or about may through in or about may with the intent to be influenced and rewarded in connection with his duties as a procurement officer at the united nations,and requested that the united nations waive immunity for united nations employee sanjaya bahel.the united nations agreed.in a november,letter from the under secretary general for legal affairs,the organization stated 
in this case,the secretary general has no objection to the waiver of bahel immunity from legal process t he secretary general has waived,under article v,section of the convention,the immunity from legal process of bahel for purpose of the criminal proceedings initiated by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york,for crimes allegedly committed during his employment as a procurement officer at the.from in or about may through in or about may.
a trial in may and june resulted in bahel convictions on all counts.he was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,ordered to pay in restitution,and to forfeit in currency and title in the manhattan apartment.the final order of forfeiture was entered on april.bahel satisfied the restitution portion of the judgment as of july.bahel has since been released on bail.
bahel raises six principal issues on this appeal.in his moving brief,bahel argues first that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his prosecution because the did not effectively waive his immunity under the convention on privileges and immunities of the united nations the convention,which was adopted by the general assembly on february,and acceded to by the united states on april.bahel next argues that he was improperly convicted under,because the united states treaty obligation to the united nations is not a federal program to which the united states provides assistance benefits prerequisite to the statute application.bahel further argues that district court erred in its charge to the jury on section,because the court failed to instruct the jury that it had to find corrupt intent before it could adjudge bahel guilty of violating the statute.with respect to the honest services conviction,bahel maintains that congress definition of honest services does not reach foreign workers at the united nations,and even if it does,the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for honest services fraud.finally,bahel believes that the district court committed error in enhancing his sentence upon a finding that he was a public official and then miscalculated the value of the rewards he received as a result of the offenses underlying the conviction.
between the time bahel filed his moving brief december,and his reply brief july,the united states supreme court granted certiorari in united states black,cir,cert.granted,d may,to resolve the question of whether a fact finder must find that a fraudulent scheme contemplated economic harm to a victim prerequisite to a finding of liability for violating the honest services fraud statute.though he had not raised the underlying substantive arguments previously,bahel argued at length in his reply brief that the outcome in black would bear on his appeal,because there was some question as to whether the government was required to prove that his scheme to defraud the caused his victim economic harm.we first heard oral argument in this case on july,but held the appeal in abeyance pending the supreme court determination of the merits of black.
in the meantime,the supreme court granted certiorari in two cases presenting related issues united states weyhrauch,cir,cert.granted,d question presented whether,to convict a state official for depriving the public of its right to the defendant honest services through the of material information,in violation of the statute and,the government must prove that the defendant violated a disclosure duty imposed by state law,and united states skilling,cir,cert.granted,d question presented in relevant part whether the federal honest services fraud statute,requires the government to prove that the defendant conduct was intended to achieve private gain rather than to advance the employer interests,and,if not,whether is unconstitutionally vague.the supreme court heard oral argument in black,weyhrauch and skilling,but issued an opinion only in connection with the substantive issue presented by skilling united states.see,d vacating and remanding black and weyhrauch in light of skilling.the thrust of that opinion,with respect to the honest services fraud holding,was that honest services fraud under section is limited to a bribery and kickback core,and thus does not include undisclosed conflicts of interest,such as those held by jeffrey skilling.see.at.
following the supreme court decision,which issued on june,both parties submitted supplemental briefing to this court.bahel,in particular,raised a number of new arguments for the first time in his supplemental brief.these related principally to the sufficiency of the indictment and jury charge.with respect to the jury charge,bahel argued that the district court instruction was flawed,even though it was a bribery instruction,because it omitted the essence of bribery corrupt intent and a quid pro quo agreement.the government urged that skilling had no impact on bahel conviction,in part because the district court gave a bribery instruction,and bahel was clearly convicted on a bribery theory of liability.we heard oral argument on january,regarding the impact of skilling on this case.concluding now,as we do,that neither skilling nor any other relevant precedent compels a contrary conclusion,we affirm the judgment of conviction entered by the district court.
discussion 
immunity and waiver 
officials are granted immunity from prosecution pursuant to article v,section of the convention on privileges and immunities of the united nations the convention,u,entered into force with respect to the united states,which states in relevant part that officials are immune from legal process in respect of words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity.id.art.v,a.section of the convention provides that privileges and immunities,such as immunity from prosecution,are granted to officials in the interests of the united nations,and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves.id.art.v.only the secretary general may waive the immunity of a official.id.
bahel argued for the first time after his trial that the had not waived his immunity for the subject matter of the prosecution.bahel bases this claim in part on a contention that the diplomatic relations act dra,provides him with the right to raise a claim of immunity.however,as the government points out,the dra applies only to diplomats,and not to other officials,like bahel.instead,the international organization immunities act ioia,stat,et,governs bahel right to raise a claim of immunity the ioia expressly applies to officers and employees of international organizations,and states that such individuals shall be immune from suit and legal process relating to acts performed by them in their official capacity and falling within their functions as officers,or employees except insofar as such immunity may be waived by the international organization concerned.id.b.
bahel further contends that article ii,section of the convention would only allow for his prosecution had there been an express waiver of his immunity by the,which he maintains never occurred.article ii,section provides that t he united nations shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity.convention art.ii,emphasis added.although the plain language of this provision suggests otherwise,bahel contends that it applies both to the u.as an organization and to its employees.but see id.art.v,addressing immunity for certain employees deemed officials.from this faulty assumption,bahel deduces that a waiver of immunity by the secretary general as to an employee or official must be express in order to be valid because the as an organization may only waive its own immunity as conferred on the organization expressly.while bahel maintains that his immunity was expressly waived as to conduct between may and may,he also maintains that the charges against him relate only to conduct that occurred prior to may,for which there was no express waiver,and accordingly,bahel argues that those charges should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we disagree.
as a threshold matter,we note that the plain language of article ii leaves no doubt that the can only waive immunity for itself,as an organization,expressly.see id.art.ii,the united nations shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal process except insofar as in any particular case it has expressly waived its immunity.emphasis added see also brzak united nations,cir recognizing that the must expressly waive immunity.however,article v,which covers immunity for officials,lacks that same plain language.instead,article v section states that privileges and immunities are granted to officials in the interests of the united nations and not for the personal benefit of the individuals themselves.the secretary general shall have the right and the duty to waive the immunity of any official in any case where,in his opinion,the immunity would impede the courts of justice and can be waived without prejudice to the interests of the united nations.convention art.v.
bahel contention that an express waiver is required for officials is based largely on case law interpreting article ii,which is limited to the immunity as an organization not article v,which covers officials.see,emmanuel united states,cir noting that article ii immunity would apply to the mission in haiti,in light of the u.status of forces agreement that extended article ii immunity to the mission askir boutros ghali,dismissing the complaint sua sponte as against the organization because article ii rendered the immune from suit.further,the only two cases cited by bahel that directly analyze article v are wholly inapposite.one involved a situation where a party failed to argue that immunity had been waived.see de luca united nations,here,plaintiff has not alleged that the has waived the immunity of the four individual defendants.the other involved a situation wherein the had expressly declined to waive immunity for one of its employees.see mcgehee albright,d,noting that the under secretary general for legal affairs for the united nations informed the court that the united nations is not waiving its immunity in this action as to defendant secretary general kofi annan.
the absence of an express waiver requirement in article v,coupled with a lack of precedent to the contrary,leaves us unable to conclude that article v unequivocally requires an express waiver in order to be effective.accord restatement third of foreign relations law a,c and cmt.b explaining that in the absence of an express waiver requirement,waiver by a state can be effected either expressly or by implication compare also ioia,b international organizations are immune from suit in federal courts except to the extent that such organizations expressly waive their immunity emphasis added,with id.b o fficers and employees of international organizations shall be immune from suit and legal process except insofar as such immunity may be waived emphasis added.this determination,however,does not alter the outcome of this case,because we conclude that the expressly waived bahel immunity.
in response to the government request that the waive any claim of immunity,the sent a letter to the government,dated november,stating the secretary general has no objection to the waiver of bahel immunity from legal process.the letter further stated that the waived the immunity from legal process of bahel for the purpose of the criminal proceedings initiated by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york,for crimes allegedly committed during his employment as a procurement officer at the un from in or about may through in or about may.
although the letter did include specific dates,that is in or about may to in or about may,we believe that the circumstances surrounding the participation in bahel investigation and prosecution make pellucid that reference to the dates in the letter was intended only to identify the criminal proceedings that had been initiated by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york not to limit the scope of the waiver.it is significant that the itself referred the matter of bahel prosecution to the united states attorney office and cooperated at all stages of the prosecution,including by providing relevant documents and waiving immunity for several employees who testified at bahel trial.further,in a second letter dated january,the confirmed that its first letter was intended fully to waive bahel immunity.indeed,at no point did the object to the scope of the proceeding.
even if there had been no express waiver of bahel immunity by the,bahel himself impliedly waived any claim of immunity when he participated fully in the criminal proceedings without raising the issue of immunity until after the trial.see richardson fajardo sugar.holding that a defendant who appeared,filed answers to an original and several amended complaints,set a trial date,and first raised the defense of sovereign immunity eights months after the action began had waived the defense.though there is limited case law addressing waiver under the convention,which is the operable document in the case sub judice,we have previously stated that diplomatic immunity from prosecution may be waived.see united states lumumba,cir.in lumumba,we explained even if by a stretch of the imagination one could assume the existence of such status diplomatic immunity,it was waived in this case.lumumba,a member of the michigan bar,freely chose to appear pro hac vice in the united states district court to represent a criminal defendant.it would be anomalous to believe that he could participate in a trial as counsel without subjecting himself to the district court contempt procedures.id.at.
at least two of our sister circuits have expressed similar views.in holloway walker,cir,the fifth circuit explained that although it did not believe that appellant was entitled to plead diplomatic immunity,to the extent he was,this right was waived by his action in withholding such plea until the unsuccessful termination of such litigation.id.at.more recently,in united states campa,cir,the defendant,as here,waited until after the trial to raise the issue of immunity,and then argued that the district court had lacked jurisdiction to entertain an action against him in the first instance.id.at.although defendant argument in campa was based on his purported sovereignty under the foreign sovereign immunities act,f,d,which expressly states that waiver can be implied,id.a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication,notwithstanding any withdrawal of the waiver which the foreign state may purport to effect except in accordance with the terms of the waiver,the underlying conduct at issue in campa nevertheless informs our analysis.that is,in that case,the eleventh circuit emphasized that the defendant had waived his right to invoke immunity through his long and active participation in the action.at citing richardson,at.here too,bahel was present throughout the pendency of his prosecution and never raised the defense of immunity.the time to raise the issue has long since passed.having participated fully in the action,he is now bound by its outcome.accordingly,although we find that the effectively and expressly waived bahel immunity in its letter to the government,we also hold in the alternative that bahel waived his right to invoke immunity by waiting until after the trial to raise the issue.
having resolved the question of immunity from prosecution,we turn to bahel substantive arguments regarding the bases of his conviction.bahel was charged and convicted under count six of violating a b by accepting compensation as a reward for the favors he provided to the kohlis.with respect to this count,bahel first argues that n o reading of could plausibly be extended to the charges in this case,because t he united states membership in the united nations is not a federal program under section b,and the contributions made to the united nations under the united states treaty obligation in the convention and charter is not a benefit or form of federal assistance under that same.bahel argues accordingly that section can not reach the conduct at issue in this case.we disagree.
application of section to the 
title makes it a crime for an agent of an organization to corruptly solicit or demand for the benefit of any person,or accept or agree to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such organization involving any thing of value of or more.to prosecute an organization agent under,the organization must receive,in any one year period,benefits in excess of under a federal program involving a grant,contract,subsidy,loan,guarantee,insurance,or other form of federal assistance.b emphasis added.in united states zyskind,cir,we construed a federal program to mean there must exist a specific statutory scheme authorizing the federal assistance in order to promote or achieve certain policy objectives.id.at internal quotation marks omitted holding that et was a federal program insofar as it authorized payment of federal benefits to united states veterans.thus,there is a federal program for the purposes of section whenever there is a specific statutory scheme that authorizes payments thereunder for the purposes of promoting or achieving the policy objectives of the united states.
the supreme court has provided additional guidance on determining what constitutes a benefit for the purposes of section.in fischer united states,d,the defendant was convicted under section for defrauding a hospital that had received medicare funds.id.at.on appeal,the defendant argued that the medicare program provided benefits only to patients who received subsidized medical care,and not to hospitals,which merely received reimbursements from the government for services rendered.id.at.the supreme court disagreed,noting that 
to determine whether an organization participating in a federal assistance program receives benefits,an examination must be undertaken of the program structure,operation,and purpose.the inquiry should examine the conditions under which the organization receives the federal payments.the answer could depend,as it does here,on whether the recipient own operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program.
id.at.applying this approach,the supreme court determined that medicare payments constituted a benefit because the federal funds provided an advantage for both the patient who received the medical care,as well as for the hospital such payments ensured the hospital continued viability and thus advanced the policy objectives of the federal government.id.at.the court wrote the payments might have similarities to payments an insurer would remit to a hospital quite without regard to the medicare program,id.at,in which case they might be considered exempt under section c,which removes from the statute coverage any bona fide salary,wages,fees,or other compensation paid,or expenses paid or reimbursed,in the usual course of business,c.however,the government would not make any of the payments at issue in fischer unless the hospital complie d with its intricate regulatory scheme,at.thus,the supreme court noted,t he payments are made not simply to reimburse for treatment of qualifying patients but to assist the hospital in making available and maintaining a certain level and quality of medical care,all in the interest of both the hospital and the greater community.id.at.the payments,therefore,could be considered benefits subject to the strictures of section.
on the facts of this case,the united nations participation act participation act,which authorizes payment of the united states dues to the,can be considered to establish a benefit program much as the medicare act was considered to establish a benefit program in fischer.through the participation act,congress has authorized appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for the payment by the united states for its share of expenses of the organization as apportioned by the general assembly.because congress authorized payments through the participation act,the united states payments to the are made are made under a specific statutory scheme that aims to advance the government foreign policy objectives,specifically,the policy of participating in collective endeavors to secure the benefits of world peace.accord zyskind,at.further indicative of a benefits program,the united states funding of the,like the medicare funding at issue in fischer,is subject to several conditions designed in part to promote broader objectives related to national security while ensuring that any money contributed to the is responsibly expended and accounted for.fischer,at.for example,through the united nations reform act of,see consolidated appropriations act,stat,congress established a number of restrictions that are imposed on the as a condition of federal funding.these include requiring that the maintain a balanced budget,see b requiring that the conduct evaluations of its programs and make recommendations about which programs should be terminated,see id.b capping the growth of the budgets of agencies,see id.b,preventing the from borrowing from outside lenders,see id.a a and limiting the united states contribution to the to an amount below what the had assessed,see id.b,b.
the reform act also sets forth a host of measures that the is required to implement.for example,each agency must have an inspector general the must maintain protections there must be procedures in place to ensure that the complies with the inspector generals the must permit member states to access any report issued by the inspector generals and the must guarantee that the united states general accounting office has access to the financial data in order to perform audits of operations.see id.b.the reform act further regulates the u.staff and requires the to implement policies to ensure that all staff are appointed on the basis of merit,maintain a code of conduct,require senior employees to make financial disclosures,impose rules against nepotism,and maintain a personnel evaluation system.see id.b.
finally,in addition to the reform act,congress has adopted certain other measures designed to regulate the activities.these include the kassebaum solomon amendment to the foreign relations authorization act for fiscal years and,which required the to change its internal voting mechanisms to ensure that voting rights were proportionate to the financial contributions of each member state and to alter the previous requirement that staff return their salaries to their home governments.see foreign relations authorization act,fiscal years and,stat,codified as notes to see also department of state authorization act,fiscal years and,stat,codified as note to prohibiting contributions to the united nations educational,scientific and cultural organization if that organization implements any policy or procedure to censor or otherwise restrict the free flow of information within or among countries department of state authorization act,fiscal years and,stat,codified as note to providing that the united states shall not participate in the if israel is illegally expelled as a member organization departments of commerce,justice,and state,the judiciary,and related agencies appropriations act,stat,codified as note to prohibiting the u.from establishing a system of taxation for the internet or international currency transactions foreign relations authorization act,fiscal years and,stat,codified as note to prohibiting the from granting diplomatic recognition to entities that do not meet the internationally recognized attributes of statehood foreign relations authorization act,fiscal years and,stat,codified as note to providing that dues paid by the united states will not be available to the if it accords the palestine liberation organization the same standing as a member state.
the above restrictions,which are tied directly to funding,make clear that the united states payment of dues to the,similar to medicare funding,provide s benefits extending beyond isolated,transactions,fischer,at emphasis added.that is,the is not a contractor and funding to the is not merely payment for goods and services provided to the united states.rather,the funding provided to the by the united states fulfills significant purposes beyond performance of an immediate transaction,including the advancement of policy goals.id.at.and here,as in fischer,the government has a legitimate and significant interest in prohibiting financial fraud or acts of bribery being perpetuated at the organization receiving federal funds.id.at.
bahel argues that,regardless of whether the united states payments to the can be considered benefits,the payment of dues to the can not constitute a federal program as that phrase is used in section,because the united states agreed in a treaty,the united nations charter to make such payments to the however,there is no question that a federal statute duly enacted by congress,the participation act,is what authorizes the payment of the united states dues to the under the principles articulated in zyskind,this is sufficient to classify the participation act as a federal program.see at.
moreover,as a constitutional matter,the united states can not provide any funds to the without an express and independent authorization by congress.see const.art.i,cl.indeed,in order for a treaty to be,and thus not require independent action from congress,the treaty terms must reflect such an intention by both the president,who negotiated it,and the senate,which provided its advice and consent.see medellin texas,d distinguishing comegys vasse,pet,as stand ing only for the modest principle that the terms of a treaty control the outcome of a case accord brzak united nations,cir in determining whether a treaty is,we look to the text,the negotiation and drafting history,and the postratification understanding of the signatory nations.restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.i constitutional restraints on character of international agreement an international agreement can not take effect as domestic law without implementation by congress if the agreement would achieve what lies within the exclusive power of congress under the constitution.thus,an international agreement providing for the payment of money by the united states requires an appropriation of funds by congress in order to effect the payment required by the agreement.
the text of articles and of the charter reflect no such understanding.article provides that t he expenses of the shall be borne by the members as apportioned by the general assembly.charter,para.article provides that the remedy for a breach of the obligation to pay dues is the loss of a member vote in the general assembly.id.as the government points out,the fact that the charter provides for a diplomatic remedy in the event of a nation with its charter obligations strongly suggests that the dues provision of the united nations charter was not meant to be.further,as the supreme court explained in medellin texas,the absence of mandatory language,must or shall indicates that a particular provision is not a directive.at failure to include mandatory terms in article of the charter,including incorporation of directives shall or must,indicated that article was not a directive.
accordingly,we conclude that the payment of the united states dues to the is a federal program,because there is a specific statutory scheme authorizing the assistance,the participation act.further,the participation act plainly seeks to promote the united states foreign policy objectives,and thus is properly considered a benefit subject to the strictures of.therefore,we reject bahel argument that section can not reach employees of the united nations.
bahel as applied challenge to section 
bahel challenges section on constitutional grounds,arguing that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him because congress did not exercise its spending power to bind the united states to its treaty obligations under the charter.as explained above,bahel challenge to section is a variation on his argument that the does not receive benefits under a federal program because the united states is obligated by treaty to pay dues.this argument fails for one fundamental reason congress has the power to grant or revoke federal funding to the based on its independent policy judgments therefore,the allocation of federal funding to the is an exercise of the spending power.see sabri united states,d.it is that congress has authority under the spending clause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare,and it has corresponding authority under the necessary and proper clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for the general welfare,and not frittered away in graft or on projects undermined when funds are siphoned off or corrupt public officers are derelict about demanding value for dollars.id.internal citations omitted.pursuant to this principle,a number of officials of organizations have been prosecuted under section in various jurisdictions across the country.see,fischer united states,d executive of medical consulting firm united states hildenbrand,cir president of construction company doing business with a housing organization united states buck,cir executive of rural development organization united states edgar,cir executive officers of hospital united states dubón otero,cir lawyer and doctor who were directors for health services corporation united states neighbors,cir pharmacist at clinic run by charitable community health organization.we see no principled basis on which to distinguish congressional authorization of the payment dues from federal monies flowing to these organizations.accordingly,bahel constitutional challenge to section fails.
iii.honest services fraud 
bahel next argues that he was improperly charged with honest services fraud for a number of different reasons,each of which is outlined below.in relevant part,the indictment included four counts of honest services fraud counts one and two charged bahel with defrauding the of its intangible right to his honest services facilitated by his use of the mails in violation of and,and counts three and four charged bahel with defrauding the of its intangible right to his honest services facilitated by his use of interstate wire communications,in violation of and.
in skilling united states,d,the decision for which we held this appeal in abeyance,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of the honest services fraud statute codified at.that case involved the actions of jeffrey skilling,a longtime enron officer,and enron chief executive officer from february until august when he resigned.id.at.during his time at enron,skilling was alleged to have profited from the fraudulent scheme through the receipt of salary and other bonuses,and through the sale of approximately million in enron stock,which netted him million.id.at internal quotation marks.less than four months after skilling resigned from enron,the company declared bankruptcy.id.at.the indictment charged skilling with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud in particular,it alleged that skilling had sought to depriv e enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.id.at.relevant to the honest services charge,skilling was alleged to have conspir ed to defraud enron shareholders by misrepresenting the company fiscal health,thereby artificially inflating its stock price.id.at.notably,however,skilling never solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.id.
in determining the scope and constitutionality of the honest services statute,the supreme court adopted a limiting construction,explaining that t o preserve the statute without transgressing constitutional limitations,section could not reach skilling conduct.id.at.therefore,the court held that section criminalizes only fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks id.at.defining the scope of bribes and kickbacks,the supreme court wrote that the statute prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the case law,but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.id.at citing b,a.in reaching this holding,the supreme court rejected the government argument that should also encompass undisclosed by a public official such as the taking of official action by the official that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because the government in skilling did not allege that skilling accepted bribes or kickbacks,but rather that he was engaged in a pattern of,the supreme court determined that skilling honest services fraud conviction was flawed and vacated the fifth circuit affirmance of skilling conspiracy conviction.id.at.
bahel argues for the first time on appeal that section can not apply to foreign employees of the specifically,he asserts that section has only been applied to government or private sector employees,not employees of international organizations.see,united states ganim,cir applying section to former mayor of bridgeport,connecticut.in support of his argument,bahel cites united states giffen,d,united states lazarenko,cr.may,and this court decision in united states rybicki,cir en banc.although we agree with bahel that section is not limitless,we hold that it is broad enough to encompass bahel actions and neither giffen nor lazarenko nor rybicki provides otherwise.
bahel argues that this court holding in rybicki stands for the proposition that honest services fraud is effectively limited to the identity of the actors prosecuted in the caselaw.that is,he states that because n one of the cases extended an honest services theory of fraud to an international setting involving foreign nationals,rybicki means that he,as a foreign national,can not be prosecuted for honest services fraud under section.we disagree.rybicki,like skilling,stands for the proposition that fraud actionable under section is limited to the nature of the offenses prosecuted in the cases,bribery and kickback schemes not the identity of the actors involved in those cases.see rybicki,at see also skilling.at to preserve the statute without transgressing constitutional limitations,we now hold that criminalizes only the core of the case law.emphasis in original.
united states giffen is equally unhelpful to bahel position.that case involved a united states citizen who was charged with honest services fraud for bribing a government official from the republic of kazakhstan,resulting in the deprivation of honest services for kazakh citizens.d at.the district court,finding a total absence of precedent supporting the government overseas application of the intangible rights theory,id.at,ruled that congress did not intend that the intangible right to honest services encompass bribery of foreign officials in foreign countries,id.at.although bahel urges to the contrary,giffen does not dictate the outcome of this case,not only because this court has not itself so construed section,but also because,unlike in giffen,the conduct at issue in this case took place within the territorial united states,and the victim was not a foreign government citizens but the united nations,an organization headquartered in the united states,entitled to defendant honest services in the united states,and receiving its largest financial contributions from the united states.
united states lazarenko is also distinguishable.that case,which was cited in giffen,involved a former prime minister of the republic of ukraine,who was charged with depriving ukranian citizens of the honest services of their government officials.cr,at.at the close of evidence,the district court dismissed,inter alia,two counts of honest services fraud charged in violation of.id.at.in so doing,the district court stated that,in order to establish honest services fraud,the government would have had to plead and prove an analogous violation of ukraine law.id.at.this proposition has since been rejected by the ninth circuit.see united states weyhrauch,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds by,d vacating in light of skilling.that is,the ninth circuit has rejected the notion that a deprivation of honest services requires a underlying violation of state law in a domestic case.id.at in short,we have never limited the reach of the federal fraud statutes only to conduct that violates state law.lazarenko is also at odds with precedent in our circuit.see united states margiotta,cir at the outset,we reject the contention that absent a showing of a violation of new york statute or a duty imposed by new york law,a defendant may not be found guilty of using the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud on the basis of a breach of a fiduciary duty to the citizenry,overruled on other grounds by mcnally united states,d see also united states murphy,cir discussing the different approaches to honest services fraud as between the circuits.accordingly,lazarenko does not provide a basis on which to vacate bahel conviction.
we note that bahel conduct falls firmly within the ambit of the type of conduct that violates the right to honest services as set forth in relevant precedent.see,united states hasenstab,cir buyer for airline convicted of mail and wire fraud for receiving kickbacks from a supplier of business forms and computer paper in return for the buyer routing orders to the supplier,and giving the supplier advance information regarding its competitors bids on contracts offered by the employer.thus,we conclude that,on the facts of this case,section reaches bahel conduct.
iv.belated challenges to the indictment and jury charge 
bahel also appeals his conviction under both section and section on the ground that the indictment failed to charge bahel with bribery,and the district court failed to adequately instruct the jury on bribery,principally because the district judge omitted a corrupt intent element prerequisite to a conviction for bribery specifically,bahel argues for the first time on appeal that without an instruction on corrupt intent,he was convicted on an illegal gratuities theory rather than a bribery theory of liability.this was impermissible,bahel argues,because both section and reach only fraud that rises to the level of bribery.
at oral argument held after the supreme court issued is decision in skilling,the government expressed its belief that section does not encompass illegal gratuities,an argument it concluded was foreclosed by skilling.accordingly,the question of whether honest services fraud can be premised on a gratuity theory of liability is not before us and we do not consider it.however,with respect to section,the government argues that section covers both illegal gratuities as well as bribery,and therefore to the extent that bahel was convicted under section as having accepted illegal gratuities,but not bribes,this is not a basis on which to overturn his conviction.
generally,w e review challenged jury instructions de novo and will reverse only if all of the instructions,taken as a whole,caused a defendant prejudice.united states bok,cir.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.id.further,where a defendant fails to make a specific and timely objection to a district court legal instructions,we typically review those instructions only for plain error.see united states middlemiss,cir.however,where the source of alleged error is a supervening decision,as here with skilling and the charge under section,we have previously employed a modified rule,under which the government,not the defendant,bears the burden to demonstrate that the error was harmless.united states henry,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the government argues that our modified plain error rule has not survived the supreme court decision in johnson united states,d.we need not reach this issue,however,since we conclude there was no error in the jury charge.
a.the honest services jury charge 
bahel first argues that the jury instructions were flawed because the district court bribery charge omitted two important elements corrupt intent and quid pro quo agreement thereby effectively converting it into a gratuity instruction.however,the district court charge included language nearly identical to what the supreme court has described as the core of honest services fraud.the charge read in relevant part as follows 
it is now essential that you understand specifically what is covered by the third of these elements relating to the scheme to deprive the united nations of the intangible right to the defendant honest services.what is referred to is that the united nations had certain fundamental rules and regulations specifying how activities by united nations employees were to be carried out.the government charges that the scheme consisted of violation of these rules and regulations in the following manner the government charged that the defendant a provided information to the kohlis which was not available to other prospective bidders for business b provided unofficial advice and guidance to the kohlis when the kohlis were seeking business which was not available to other prospective bidders c advocated the position of the kohlis on issues that arose in connection with the kohlis attempt to obtain or maintain business with the in a manner the defendant did not use with other bidders d accepted financial benefits from the kohlis in return for these forms of assistance if the defendant violated the fundamental rules and regulations of the united nations through the activities described above,and concealed such violations with the intention of deceiving the united nations,this would be the crime covered by the statute.
in skilling,the supreme court defined classic kickbacks as involving the receipt of something of value from a third party in exchange for official action.at emphasis added.this language is strikingly similar to the district court instruction to the jury that it could convict bahel of honest services fraud if it found that he provided the kohlis with one or more specific forms of assistance in his capacity as a un employee,and that he accepted financial benefits from the kohlis in return for these forms of assistance.
further,the supreme court holding in skilling was consistent with its prior holdings in such cases as united states sun diamond growers of california,d,where the court distinguished bribes from gratuities.sun diamond involved a trade association illegal gifts to the secretary of agriculture,and in that case,the supreme court defined the crime of bribery as requiring a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.id.at emphasis in original.the court explained that this connection to an official act is what distinguishes bribery from gratuities an illegal gratuity may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take and may already have determined to take,or for a past act that he has already taken.id.at emphasis added.the district court instruction on section in this case did not incorporate the word reward nor did it discuss an analogous concept.indeed,the district court did not even refer to section in the context of the section instruction,which is significant because section does cover illegal gratuities,as we explain below.
during the interval between the supreme court decisions in sun diamond and skilling,this circuit had an opportunity to consider the differences between bribery and gratuities as set forth in sun diamond.in united states ganim,cir,we explained that in order to establish the quid pro quo essential to proving bribery,the government need not show that the defendant intended for his payments to be tied to specific official acts or omissions.id.at internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis added.rather,bribery can be accomplished through an ongoing course of conduct,so long as evidence shows that the favors and gifts flowing to a public official are in exchange for a pattern of official actions favorable to the donor.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,contrary to bahel assertions,it is not necessary,though it may be advisable,for the district judge to use the magic words corrupt intent or quid pro quo to effectively charge a jury on bribery rather,as we explained in united states alfisi,cir,t he corrupt intent necessary to a bribery conviction is in the nature of a quid pro quo requirement that is,there must be a specific intent to give something of value in exchange for an official act.id.emphasis added.in this vein,we find the in return for language in the district court instruction rests comfortably within the statutory requirement.
b.the section jury charge 
with respect to bahel arguments regarding the failure of the indictment to charge bribery under section,and the district court omission of a corrupt intent instruction thereunder,we find both arguments to be without merit.the crux of bahel argument is that the jury charge was flawed because without express mention of corrupt intent,the section charge instructed the jury only on an illegal gratuity theory,and section,bahel contends,is limited to garden variety bribery.as set forth in full detail below,we find that the district court adequately charged the jury on the elements of a violation of section,and that to the extent the verdict sheet indicated that bahel had been convicted on a gratuities theory,intent to be rewarded for official acts,section is broad enough to encompass an illegal gratuity theory of liability.
section a b provides that an agent of an organization that receives benefits in excess of under a federal program,in any one year period,is guilty of an offense if he corruptly accepts,or agrees to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such organization a b.we have held that section extends to both bribes where the thing of value is part of a quid pro quo,and gratuities where the thing of value is a reward rather than a exchange.for example,in united states crozier,cir,we held that a prior version of section,which is identical in all material ways to the current version of the statute,applied to both illegal gratuities and bribes.id.at.
although congress amended section in,those amendments had no effect on the statute applicability to illegal gratuities,and we have continued to hold that the current version applies to illegal gratuities as well as to bribes.see united states bonito,cir.indeed,in bonito,the appellant argued that the amendments to section warranted reconsideration of the scope of the statute and its relationship to illegal gratuities.id.we rejected that argument,noting that the deleted language ha d been replaced with language that is to the same effect.id.specifically,we noted that under the former version of section,the payment had to be for or because of official conduct,whereas the current version provides that the payment must be to influence or reward the official conduct.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
later,in united states ford,cir,we reiterated our earlier holding that section applies to both bribes and gratuities,noting that the statute it was designed to supplement,criminalizes both.at.in ford,we observed,among other things,the distinction between bribes and gratuities,noting that 
the distinguishing feature of each crime is its intent element.bribery requires intent to influence an official act or to be influenced in an official act,while illegal gratuity requires only that the gratuity be given or accepted for or because of an official act.in other words,for bribery there must be a quid pro quo a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.an illegal gratuity,on the other hand,may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take and may already have determined to take,or for a past act that he has already taken.
id.at quoting sun diamond,at emphasis in original.thus,we have made clear that section extends to both bribes and gratuities.
the jury charge on section in this case provided in relevant part that it is the law that if an employee of the un conducts certain un business in a perfectly honest and proper manner and later accepts a financial benefit intending to be rewarded for that past activity,this is a violation of the law.the district court further instructed in general,it would seem that the intent to be influenced would apply to un business,that is taking place or will take place in the future.the normal meaning of intent to be rewarded would seem to be the intent to be rewarded for conduct which has occurred in the past.the jury was asked to fill out a special verdict form for the section charge.this form bifurcated the bases on which a defendant could be found guilty.the form provided that the jury was to identify whether the defendant was guilty because he accepted payments and other compensation with a intent to be influenced,or b intent to be rewarded.the jury did not indicate yes or no in response to criteria a,but indicated yes in response to criteria b.we find the intent to be rewarded language to be sufficient to indicate that the jury convicted bahel under section at least on the ground that he accepted illegal gratuities see alfisi,at the element of a quid pro quo or a direct exchange is absent from the offense of paying an unlawful gratuity.to commit that offense,it is enough that the payment be a reward for a past official act or made in the hope of obtaining general good will in the payee performance of official acts off in the future.
bahel argues that even on a gratuities theory,the jury charge was erroneous because it provided for a conviction for receiving gifts or rewards without first having a corrupt agreement.in order for a conviction to have been proper,bahel contends that the charge would have had to specify that bahel had been corrupted at the time he acted in his official business.in support of his argument,bahel cites a footnote in united states jennings,cir.in jennings,the fourth circuit opined that a house report accompanying a narrowing amendment to,a provision parallel to section that prohibits the fraudulent giving of payments rather than their receipt,had an arguable implication for that crozier did not mention that congress changed,by adding the corruptly with intent to influence or reward language,to clarify that like prohibits only bribes id.at citing george brown,stealth statute corruption,the spending power,and the rise of,notre dame.bahel concedes that the fourth circuit discussion in jennings is dicta that was wholly ancillary to the central issue in that case.moreover,insofar as it is directly at odds with precedent in this jurisdiction,we find it unpersuasive.
in united states rooney,cir,we considered the meaning of the term corrupt as used in section,concluding that a fundamental component of a corrupt act is a breach of some official duty owed to the government or the public at large.id.at.we concluded that i t is an obvious violation of duty and public trust for a public official or some other person responsible for parceling out government benefits to accept or demand a personal benefit intending to be improperly influenced in one official duties.id.at collecting cases.although rooney involved bribery,our analysis of section in that case,coupled with the plain language and what we referred to as the conspicuous breadth of that section,id.at,makes clear that,in the case of a gratuity,the corrupt intent required under section refers to an individual state of mind at the time the payment is received section makes it illegal,inter alia,to corruptly accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such organization.a b emphasis added.accordingly,we find no error in the district court instructions to the jury insofar as they provided that the jury could convict bahel under section based on an illegal gratuity theory,and because we conclude that section covers illegal gratuities,we also find no error in charges in the indictment relating to section insofar as they were premised on a gratuity theory of liability.
sufficiency of the evidence 
bahel challenges his conviction with regard to sufficiency of the evidence on two grounds.first,he argues that the government failed to prove that he participated in a scheme to materially deprive the of its right to honest services and that he acted with the specific intent to defraud.second,with respect to count three of the indictment,which charged wire fraud,bahel argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an august,interstate phone call made from nishan to his father,nanak,for the purpose of discuss ing a message from bahel that thunderbird needed to immediately register with dun bradstreet was in furtherance of the honest services fraud scheme.the government alleged that bahel made an intrastate phone call to nishan to warn him to immediately register with dun bradstreet,which led nishan to make the interstate phone call to nanak regarding registration with dun bradstreet,which,in turn,resulted in nishan registering thunderbird with dun bradstreet later that same day.viewing the evidence in this case in its totality,and in the light most favorable to the government,as we are obliged to do,see united states temple,cir,we are unable to conclude that no reasonable juror could have found liability,see jackson virginia,d.
evidence of honest services fraud 
in the first instance,the evidence established that bahel received financial benefits from the kohlis worth hundreds of thousands of dollars as a direct result of the assistance he provided to them,including by advocating on behalf of tcil with respect to certain stipends and by providing advice regarding the falsification of references.the evidence also demonstrated that bahel repeatedly engaged in secretive and misleading conduct to prevent the from discovering the existence and nature of his relationship with the kohlis.this evidence included,for example,proof that bahel was integral in helping the kohlis obtain the million thunderbird engineering manpower contract,despite the fact that they were really qualified and were otherwise unprepared to incur the obligations thereunder.the kohlis discussed their lack of qualifications with bahel,which rather than dissuade him,appears to have strengthened his resolve.bahel directed the kohlis to fake experience and later submitted false reference letters to the with respect to the kohlis credentials.when officials were suspicious of the authenticity of the letters,bahel contacted the kohlis,cautioning them that representatives would be checking their references and that the kohlis should ensure that those vouching for them through the letters were prepared to corroborate the information.bahel then became involved with the reference checking process and imposed certain requirements that insured that his fraud would not be discovered he allowed his subordinates to verify the kohlis references only by sending a fax to the number provided by the kohlis bahel prevented his subordinates from contacting the references directly via telephone.bahel also falsely told peacekeeping officials,his supervisor,and the headquarters committee on contracts,which approved award of the contract,that the kohlis references checked out.
additionally,bahel communicated a number of other lies and half truths to help the kohlis win the contract.for example,in order to allay the concerns about thunderbird ability to perform,bahel staged a meeting between himself,a subordinate and nishan kohli.prior to that meeting,bahel and nishan talked about the issues of our financials for the company the company financials and the enhanced performance bond that was going to be asked for.at the meeting,nishan discussed those issues of the bond,of the financials with bahel and his subordinate,who was not aware that bahel had prepped nishan for the conversation.after that meeting,bahel called nishan to tell him that the had asked for an enhanced performance bond in the amount of million.bahel then told nishan informally that he could probably get away with,and instructed him to offer half a million and negotiate from there.
bahel later falsely promised peacekeeping that the would require the winning vendor to pass along the entire msa payment to its employees.but as soon as bahel had secured the contract for thunderbird,he instructed that the contract be drafted to permit thunderbird to keep the msa.when questions were raised regarding thunderbird,bahel prevented his subordinates from examining thunderbird audited financial statements.and in order to ensure that thunderbird encountered limited competition in obtaining the contract,he inserted a million revenue requirement into the engineering manpower contract,even though,at that time,the was trying to promote competition in order to get the best possible price.further,bahel advised the kohlis on a number of specifics regarding their thunderbird bid he reviewed the bid prior to submission and helped the kohlis formulate a strategy for responding to the complaints regarding their lack of audited financial statements.
with respect to tcil,bahel compelled peacekeeping to provide tutorials to the after their technical proposal on the digital trunking contract was found to be wholly inadequate in that it gave no detail of what they were offering and fail ed to meet the majority of the criteria set out in the request for proposals one official testified that bahel involvement with procurement happened on a more regular basis with cases related to tcil,and that it was uncommon for procurement officials to conduct the kind of tutorial that had been conducted for the kohlis.bahel even drafted or reviewed a portion of the kohlis correspondence with the before the kohlis sent it.
moreover,throughout the course of their relationship,bahel passed significant amounts of insider information to the kohlis.this included revealing specific problems that peacekeeping had with the thunderbird bid,and instructing the kohlis to immediately register thunderbird with dun bradstreet in order to placate certain employees who expressed concern that thunderbird was not registered.bahel also revealed the identities of the other likely bidders to the kohlis,which gave them a tactical advantage in assessing the winning price and then told them that their bid was the lowest,even though all of that information was to be kept confidential.
the evidence demonstrated that bahel was well compensated in exchange for his assistance.he received a computer,loans and an option to purchase an apartment worth more than one million at a severely discounted price.bahel attempted to cover his tracks with respect to these items.bahel never disclosed his relationship with the kohlis to any employee.he used a secret cell phone that the kohlis paid for in order to conceal his conversations with the kohlis.bahel instructed the kohlis to disguise their involvement when they bought him a laptop computer lent money in his name and rented,and then sold,him the apartment.bahel misrepresented the amount of rent and purchase price of the apartment in communications to the board of the building.he told the contractor who renovated the apartment to conceal the connection between bahel and the kohlis.when nishan kohli was served a subpoena,bahel counseled him to destroy evidence of their relationship and suggested alternate false explanations about their conduct.from this and other conduct the jury was entitled to infer that bahel violated his duty to provide the with his honest services.
bahel asserts that the government failed to show that his misrepresentations or omissions in discussing the kohlis companies with personnel were material.there was significant evidence to the contrary,and there is no serious question that the instances chronicled above were material as we have defined that term they had the natural tendency to influence or were capable of influencing the to change its behavior.united state rybicki,cir.in particular,it is beyond cavil that personnel were less inclined to investigate the kohlis companies as a direct result of bahel assurances and his efforts to downplay the need for verifying the kohlis past experience.this evidence,along with substantial evidence of financial benefits received from the kohlis,supports the conclusion that bahel intentionally participated in a scheme of honest services fraud at the 
evidence of wire fraud 
with respect to bahel second challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,relating to whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the phone call between nishan and nanak was in furtherance of the honest services fraud scheme,the relevant facts are as follows.in july,the kohlis submitted their thunderbird bid relating to a engineering manpower contract.on august,peacekeeping sent a memo to bahel regarding the five bids submitted for the contract.the memo listed a number of deficiencies with thunderbird bid,and recommended that peacekeeping undertake a legal review of thunderbird arrangement with the delhi state industrial development corporation limited,as well as a dun bradstreet report on thunderbird industries.but thunderbird was not registered with dun bradstreet.accordingly,bahel,who was in new york,called nishan,who was also in new york,to discuss the fact that somebody within the evaluating team pointed out that thunderbird did not even have a dun bradstreet registration.during that conversation,bahel instructed nishan to immediately register with dun bradstreet.contemporaneous with the discussion nishan had with bahel,nishan called his father,nanak,who was in virginia,to discuss the dun bradstreet issue.nishan registered thunderbird with dun bradstreet later that day.bahel disputes none of these facts.
rather,the basis for bahel appeal relates to a call nishan received from diana mills aryee also on august.on that day,mills aryee telephoned nishan to inquire as to the status of thunderbird dun bradstreet report.one of bahel subordinates,jane redfern,was with mills aryee when mills aryee made the call.redfern testified that she recalled mills aryee relaying that thunderbird was in the process of registering.bahel argues that this testimony fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he had contacted nishan before mills aryee,and therefore,calls into doubt whether he caused the interstate communication between nishan and nanak.we disagree and instead conclude that a rational jury could conclude that bahel made a phone call to nishan,instructing him to register with dun bradstreet in relation to the thunderbird contract bid,and that the call in turn caused nishan to make the interstate phone call to nanak.
to prove a charge of honest services wire fraud,the government must show that the defendant sent or caused to be sent an interstate or international wire communications and that such wire communication occurred in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme.see united states slevin,cir.to meet the in furtherance requirement,a wire communication need not be an essential element of the scheme.it is sufficient for the wire communication to be incident to an essential part of the scheme or a step in the plot.schmuck united states,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.further,it is not necessary for the defendant to participate personally in the wire transmission,as long as it is reasonably foreseeable that the charged transmission would occur in the execution of the scheme.see,united states amico,cir applying the reasonably foreseeable standard in the context of a mailing.
here,redfern testified that she was with mills aryee when mills aryee telephoned nishan,and that nishan told mills aryee during that conversation that he was in the process of registering thunderbird with dun bradstreet.c rediting every inference that the jury might have drawn in favor of the government,temple,at internal quotation marks omitted,nishan testimony indicates that he was already aware that thunderbird needed to be registered with dun bradstreet by the time mills aryee made the call.since the only other source of this information was bahel,the evidence establishes that bahel notified nishan informally before mills aryee called him in an official capacity.
on the facts of this case,however,the timing of the various phone calls is of only limited importance,because even if bahel had contacted nishan after mills aryee,it was reasonably foreseeable to bahel that,by contacting nishan,the call between nishan and nanak would occur in furtherance of the scheme.see amico,at to prove that a defendant caused a mailing,it is sufficient to prove that he could have reasonably foreseen that the mailing would take place.the jury was thus entitled to find that the phone call from bahel conveyed precisely the type of internal assistance that bahel provided to the kohlis and not to other vendors that violated procurement policies and formed the basis of his conviction for honest services fraud.
vi.sentencing 
bahel was sentenced to months imprisonment,based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of bahel base offense level was calculated as,because the district court considered him to be a public official and therefore applied sentencing guidelines section a.the district court enhanced this base level by an additional levels,applying section b,because the district court found that the fraud involved gains to bahel in excess of,see b h,at level enhancement for loss exceeding.finally,the district court enhanced his sentence by two additional levels based upon a finding that bahel had obstructed justice.the sentence range for a total offense level of is months,and bahel sentence of months imprisonment falls at the low end of the guidelines range.bahel appeals only the calculation of the base offense level under section and the imposition of a level enhancement based on the computed value of his crimes.he does not appeal the level enhancement for obstruction of justice.in addition to imprisonment,the district court ordered bahel to pay restitution,a judgment that he also appeals.
application of the sentencing guidelines 
when reviewing district court determinations as to the sentencing guidelines,we review factual findings for clear error and legal interpretations de novo.united states lenoci,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if,after reviewing all of the evidence,a court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states cuevas,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
fraud involving public officials 
guidelines sections and can both apply to mail and wire fraud convictions.see app,at.section applies generally to mail and wire fraud and carries a base offense level of,at theft,embezzlement,receipt of stolen property,property destruction,and offenses involving fraud or deceit.section,subtitled in relevant part,fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of public officials emphasis added,is more narrowly tailored than section in that it carries a base offense level of if the offender is a public official.a,at.because the district court determined that bahel was a public official as that phrase is used in the sentencing guidelines,it subjected bahel to section base offense level rather than the lower offense level of section.
in its definitions,section provides that the phrase public official shall be construed broadly,cmt,at.a public official includes,inter alia,a member of a state or local legislature,an officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of a state or local government,or any department,agency,or branch of government thereof,as well as appointed officials and individuals who have been elected and are waiting to take office.id.moreover,as relevant here,the definition includes a catchall provision that defines a public official as a n individual who,although not otherwise covered by the other subdivisions of the definition i is in a position of public trust with official responsibility for carrying out a government program or policy ii acts under color of law or official right or iii participates so substantially in government operations as to possess de facto authority to make governmental decisions,which may include a leader of a state or local political party who acts in the manner described in this subdivision.id.
bahel argues that he should not have been sentenced under section,because he was not a public official,in that he a did not possess official authority to enter into contracts b was not involved in policymaking in working on contracts for goods and services,and otherwise did not hold a position at the and c as a employee,he did not hold a position in government.we reject these arguments.
first,the fact that bahel was at an international organization,the does not mean that he was not a public official for the purposes of section.the district court correctly noted that the closely analogous guidelines provision found in section,which relates to commercial bribery offenses,demonstrates the applicability of section to this case.the commentary to section states this guideline covers commercial bribery offenses and kickbacks that do not involve officials of federal,state,or local government,foreign governments,or public international organizations,cmt,at emphasis added.as the district court noted,the commentary to section refers the reader to part c,for offenses involving public officials,if any such officials are involved.id.part c includes section,which is the section under which bahel was sentenced.the district court further noted that insofar as section refers the reader to part c for offenses involving public international organizations,this commentary plainly indicates that part c was meant to encompass employees of the,since the is undoubtedly a public international organization.
other provisions of the sentencing guidelines support this analysis.for example,commentary to section provides that the term public official shall be construed broadly,cmt,at section is not limited to those who work for a federal,state or local government,but has been applied to leaders of political parties,officials of indian tribes,and foreign public officials.see,cmt.e background,at.indeed,the phrase public official encompasses any individual who either is in a position of public trust with official responsibility for carrying out a government program or policy acts under color of law or official right or possess de facto authority to make governmental decisions.see,cmt.e,at.
additionally,although bahel argues to the contrary,it is difficult to imagine how he could not be considered a high ranking u.official,since he was chief of the commodity procurement section within the procurement division.while this position may not have been the same as that of a representative of a member state,it is far from the baggage porter to which bahel now seeks to compare himself.that is,bahel cites krichman united states,in support of his argument that employees with purely ministerial jobs can not ever be subject to prosecution as public officials.this argument misapprehends the holding in krichman.
krichman involved a defendant who was indicted under the bribery law for offering a bribe to a baggage porter to deliver to him the defendant certain trunks containing furs,which were checked from the pennsylvania station to points outside the state of new york.id.at.at that time,the federal government was in control and operated the railroads,so the porter was a federal employee.id.at.as the supreme court noted,in order to sustain the conviction under the bribery law the bribe must have been given to an officer of the united states,or to a person acting for or on behalf of the united states in an official function under or by the authority of a department or office of the government.id.at.in holding that the defendant could not be convicted for bribery under the statute,the supreme court explained that neither krichman nor the porter were officers of the united states.thus,the only question was whether the porter was acting for the united states in an official function when he was offered the bribe.id.noting that the government had conceded the statute ambiguity,the supreme court concluded that the ambiguity regarding the statute scope,were not to be solved so as to embrace offenses not clearly within the law.id.at.the supreme court was especially persuaded by the fact that the congress could not have contemplated that the statute would apply to railroad workers,because the united states did not control the railroads at the time the statute was passed.id.at.
here,not only do the guidelines expressly refer to the sentencing of individuals at public international organizations as appropriately considered in the context of part c,but bahel position,at the,as can be garnered from his title alone,was closer to that of a foreign diplomat,political party official,or a tribal leader,all of whom are expressly covered by the guideline than that of a baggage porter,window cleaner,doorkeeper or any of the other tasks recounted in krichman.see id.at.our conclusion is further supported by the fact that the convention on privileges and immunities of the united nations would have entitled bahel to invoke immunity in the first instance on the basis that he is an official.see convention,art.v,officials.guidelines section commentary also includes a note that suggests its direct applicability to individuals like bahel section also applies to offenses under the foreign corrupt practices act which generally involve a payment to a foreign public official,candidate for public office,or agent or intermediary,with the intent to influence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party,cmt.background,at.
bahel contends that section definition of public official can not be extended to include all employee of international non or organizations,such as the,the world trade organization,or the internal monetary fund.however,as the district court recognized,the guidelines commentary specifically instructs that employees of such public international organizations,fall under section and not section.bahel also argues that even if public official extended to a broad range of organizations,he could not have been considered a public official,because he was not making policy decisions or executing government programs.the guidelines reject this argument,providing in relevant part that a state employee who improperly influenced the award of a contract and used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under for fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right of honest services.such a case would be more aptly sentenced pursuant to.see,cmt,at.further,section contains a enhancement for those public officials who are in a or sensitive position,clearly indicating that the section was not meant to reach only those high level officials.see id.b,at.
bahel argues for the first time on appeal that to the extent that he could be considered a public official,he was sentenced under the wrong portion of the sentencing guidelines because he was convicted only on a gratuity theory under section,as indicated on the verdict form returned by the jury,but he was sentenced under a bribery portion of the guidelines.bahel argument ignores the fact that,in addition to violating section,he was also convicted of honest services fraud under,and he was sentenced under the portion of the guidelines that applies to honest services fraud.specifically,the sentencing guidelines provide that violations of may be sentenced under either sections,or,the latter of which applies,inter alia,to receipt and solicitation of gratuities,see app.a,at.the guidelines also provide that violations of sections and are to be sentenced under either section or.however,the guidelines do not provide that honest services fraud convictions under sections and are to be sentenced under the gratuities guideline,see app.a,at.accordingly,we find no error in the district court application of section with a base offense level of to bahel.
proceeds from the fraud 
the district court enhanced bahel sentence by levels based on the court observation that bahel gained in excess of from the fraud.see b h,b,at.bahel claims that this enhancement was in error because the district court calculation of the benefits he received was based on speculative evidence.we disagree.
much of the case law relating to estimating the price of fraud relates to estimations of losses suffered as a result of the fraud.in this case,however,the relevant measurement is how much bahel profited from his fraud.in calculating this number,the principles relating to estimating losses are equally applicable to estimating gains.in estimating the cost of fraud,the guidelines do not require that the sentencing court calculate the amount of loss with certainty or precision.united states bryant,cir.the sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.united states uddin,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also,cmt.c,at.disputed facts relevant to sentencing determinations should be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.see,united states garcia,cir.because the sentencing court is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence,its findings are entitled to appropriate deference on appeal,cmt.c,at.in reviewing a district court application of the guidelines to the specific facts of a case,this court will accord de novo review to issues of law,and accept its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.united states guang,cir.
the district court estimated bahel gains to be,by aggregating the following relevant values in bold 
the difference between bahel stated purchase price for the manhattan apartment,which had been approved by the condominium board million and what bahel actually paid million,for a benefit of 
the difference between bahel stated purchase price of the manhattan apartment million and a conservative estimate of the apartment fair market value million,for a benefit of 
the value of the free rent bahel received in connection with the manhattan apartment 
the difference between the fair market value of rent for the manhattan apartment and what bahel paid 
cash payments totaling 
plane tickets worth,as well as other plane tickets worth 
open tickets worth 
a laptop computer worth.
bahel does not object to the district court findings regarding rent,plane tickets,cash or other gifts.he objects only to the fair market valuation of the apartment,and argues that the district court erred in failing to take into account the that bahel paid in closing costs,failing to consider the fact that the condo board was willing to sell bahel its right of first refusal,which bahel argues indicated that the apartment was not sold at a material discount because otherwise the condo board would have exercised its right and bought the apartment itself,and failing to account for the that the kohlis saved by not having to pay commission to a real estate broker.
to the extent that the fact that the condo board sold its right of first refusal to bahel instead of exercising it,this fact could be considered probative of the fair market value of the apartment,because,as bahel points out,it could indicate that the apartment was not valued much if at all below market however,in this case,the balance of the evidence indicates exactly the opposite that the apartment was worth far more than bahel paid.the dag hammarskjold condo board estimated that the apartment was worth million.the estimate,far from speculative,was based on analysis of sales of comparable apartments in the building over a number of years.moreover,the condo board estimate was in line with other estimates,including that of nishan kohli,who testified that he believed the apartment to be worth approximately million.kohli based his estimate on the value of a similar apartment that he had sold.finally,the real estate market had appreciated significantly in the two years after the kohlis first purchased the apartment for million and subsequently spent approximately improving it.for example,the price of a three bedroom apartment in manhattan rose roughly in the first quarter of alone.while data about the real estate market,without more,might have been insufficient to support the imposition of the level enhancement,the totality of the evidence leaves no question that the apartment was worth at least million and bahel therefore benefitted by at least.we agree with the district court that the evidence established that the million valuation was very conservative.
the district court also rejected bahel argument that it should deduct from that amount,the that bahel spent on closing plus the that the kohlis realized by avoiding the payment of a real estate commission.in the first instance,the fact that the kohlis avoided paying a commission strikes us as wholly irrelevant to determining the benefit bahel received from the fraud.further,even if we were to credit bahel calculation that the total estimated benefit should have subtracted his payment,the subtraction of that value from the district court estimation of bahel gains still leaves bahel above the threshold and therefore firmly places him within the ambit of section b.
vii.restitution 
the mandatory victims restitution act mvra requires a defendant to reimburse a victim for,inter alia,necessary other expenses incurred during the participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.b.attorneys fees are other expenses that are properly included within a restitution award.see united states amato,cir.any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.e.
legal fees 
the district court in this case ordered bahel to reimburse the for worth of legal fees incurred in bringing this case as well as the in salary bahel was paid while he was suspended following the indictment total.bahel contends that the legal fees were not necessary for the purposes of section b because the retained a major new york city law firm to represent it in this matter when the had counsel at its disposal,which could have provide d the same services at a much reduced fixed cost.our decision in amato forecloses this argument.
in amato,the defendants fraud caused their employer to retain outside lawyers and accountants to perform an internal investigation and to represent the employer in connection with the government investigation and prosecution of the defendants.see at.we affirmed the award to the employer of full restitution for the expended on attorneys fees and accounting costs.id.at.as amato intimates,nothing in our case law limits restitution to cost of counsel.moreover,the law firm represented the at times for below its normal billing rates,and no one has contended that the fees themselves were unreasonable,or that any specific task undertaken by the law firm was unnecessary aside from bahel general and conclusory contention that counsel could have handled the investigation.likewise,nothing in the record indicates that it is uncommon for an organization to retain outside counsel in connection with investigations into internal fraud.see id.at.
bahel also complains that the government did not supply the supporting billing records until two days prior to the restitution hearing.the record reveals that this is true but that bahel refused to consent to an adjournment in advance of the hearing.the record also reveals that when the district court offered bahel an opportunity to request an adjournment during the hearing,so that he could fully review the records before the district court made a determination,but bahel again refused to take the adjournment.for these reasons and those stated above,we conclude that the district court committed no error in awarding the in legal fees.
finally,bahel claims for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in providing the restitution for the amount of his salary,because he opines his salary was beyond the scope of the mvra.specifically,bahel argues that b b i i requires a restitution order to include the value of the victim property on the date of loss,and because the does not claim that it suffered any specific pecuniary or financial loss resulting from the conduct of bahel,it was incorrect for the district court to speculate that the somehow lost services by bahel and divine a portion of salary to be refunded and represent it as property lost to the 
ordinarily,we review a restitution award for abuse of discretion.see united states boccagna,cir.but where,as here,the issue was raised for the first time on appeal,we review only for plain error.see united states fiore,cir.under plain error review,an appellate court may,in its discretion,correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states marcus,d quoting puckett united states,d.
there is one central problem with bahel argument it ignores the fact that the money the paid in the form of his salary was plainly property that belonged to the,at least some of which the lost as a result of bahel offense,since the paid him for his honest services,which is what he failed to provide.there is no question that a portion of an individual salary can be subject to forfeiture where,as here,an employer pays for honest services but receives something less.see united states crawley,cir salary and pension procured through fraud is within the statutory language of section b united states sapoznik,cir we may assume that the employer would not have hired the defendant had it known of his intentions,and in that event it would not have paid him four years salary w hat the employer lost was the difference in the value of the services that the defendant rendered and the value of the services that an honest employee would have rendered.
the amount eligible for forfeiture under section,however,appears to be a question of first impression in this circuit.in this context,some of our sister circuits have contemplated the issue and their conclusions inform our analysis.in united states crawley,the fifth circuit affirmed a district court order awarding restitution to an employer in the amount of the salary and pension awarded to the employee in the year after his fraud.at.crawley involved voter fraud relating to the defendant election as president of a local union.id.at.the evidence at trial established that crawley had falsified ballots in order to secure his election,and unrelated to the voter fraud,he had received a kickback in connection with a union contract.id.at.crawley was charged with one count of mail fraud in violation of,one court of embezzlement of an official ballot in violation of c one count of embezzlement from a labor organization for the kickback,also in violation of c and one count of making a false entry in records required by the labor management reporting and disclosure act,in violation of c.at.he was convicted of all counts.id.at.
crawley argued on appeal,similar to what bahel argues here,that his salary should not have been forfeited because the loss to the union,his employer,could not have been related to his salary and pension,because the union would have had to pay an honest president the same amount.id.at.rejecting this argument,the fifth circuit explained that the salary obtained as a result of the fraud fell within the plain language of mvra section b a,which requires a defendant in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense to a return the property to the owner of the property id.at quoting b a emphasis in original.the crawley court further explained that a contrary holding would allow crawley to benefit from his fraudulent conduct,a result which runs afoul of the principles on which restitution is based.id.
we think the same principle applies here.however,we also note that there is one distinguishing factor between the cases namely,that crawley obtained his position as union president through fraud whereas the evidence at bahel trial established only that he engaged in a significant pattern of honest services fraud,not that he obtained his position through fraud in the first instance.the seventh circuit confronted a similar set of facts in united states sapoznik.sapoznik involved a police chief who was convicted of violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico by taking bribes to protect illegal gambling in town bars and restaurants.at.judge posner,writing for the panel in sapoznik,explained the proper amount of restitution is the amount wrongfully taken by the defendant.id.at.the court continue the government argues that sapoznik obtained his salary from northlake under the false pretense that he was honest.we may assume that northlake would not have hired him had it known of his intentions,and in that event it would not have paid him four years salary,let alone one year.id.however,the court,noting that northlake would still have needed a police chief,then explained that northlake was entitled to restitution in the amount of the difference in the value of the services that sapoznik rendered northlake and the value of the services that an honest police chief would have rendered.id.
the district court had not calculated the value of that difference but instead had entered an order requiring sapoznik to pay back one year salary,which as the court of appeals noted,comprised of his total salary as police chief.id.at.the seventh circuit noted that this was an
