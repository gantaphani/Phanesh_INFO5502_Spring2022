hector hernandez appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,in,which a sentence of incarceration after remand from this court back in.the record indicates that the district court evidently started with an after so long an the baseline for the was the sentence imposed in,and thereby failed to properly consider the factors set out in a particularly hernandez submission of evidence of the time of.accordingly,we vacate and remand for before a different district court judge.
in,hernandez was arrested in connection with the of a large new york city heroin and cocaine trafficking organization doing business as the unknown organization.as described in this court opinion in united states rosa,cir,the unknown organization consisted of a highly structured distribution network that purchased relatively pure narcotics,diluted them,packaged them in glassine envelopes at locations known as mills,and sold them through street sales locations known as spots.
following severance,judge spatt presided over a trial of several defendants and judge platt presided over a trial of the remaining defendants,including hernandez.on june,following a jury trial,hernandez was convicted of four counts 
count to distribute and possession with intent to distribute in excess of kilogram of heroin and in excess of kilograms of cocaine,in violation of and b a.
count to kidnap and assault with a deadly weapon,in violation of,arising from the kidnaping and torture of pedro hernandez.
count to commit murder,in violation of,arising from the murder of walter hambrick.
count of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,in violation of c.
on december,the district court sentenced hernandez to months of incarceration,five years of supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.
hernandez appealed his convictions on multiple grounds,as well as his sentence on the grounds that the district court i erred in calculating the quantity of narcotics attributable to him,and ii applied a enhancement for his leadership role without making the requisite findings.this court rejected all of hernandez challenges except for his second sentencing argument.in an opinion dated december,this court vacated hernandez sentence and remanded for on that issue 
the presentence report psr prepared on hernandez recommended a increase in his offense level pursuant to guidelines a for his leadership role in the offense.hernandez objected to this characterization.the court made no finding with respect to his role.accordingly,we vacate hernandez sentence and remand for a factual finding on that issue.
rosa,at see also id.at the sentences of rodriguez and hernandez are vacated and the matters are remanded for findings as to their roles in the offense.on january,the mandate issued.
in,the district court resolved a question as to hernandez representation,granting the government application to appoint counsel.however,no progress was made toward between the appointment of new counsel and the filing of a letter by hernandez mother in,expressing bewilderment.that letter set the case in motion after a dormancy following this court remand.
on august,the district court held a conference,attended only by the government.judge platt expressed his view that the single issue presented on need for factual findings in support of the enhancement for hernandez leadership sufficiently answered in the circuit court rosa opinion itself judge kearse did it right there in her own opinion,answered the question she said i did answer.
in december,hernandez filed a sentencing memorandum seeking a sentence lower than months the government opposition urged the district court to a sentence.
at the outset of the sentencing hearing on march,the district court distributed a written memorandum and order primarily addressing the single issue posed by this court remand factual findings bearing on the role enhancement.the written memorandum and order did not discuss evidence of hernandez rehabilitation.the district court permitted the parties to review the order,heard argument on hernandez role and other issues,and decided to reimpose the same sentence.notwithstanding defense counsel arguments,the district court never expressly reacted to evidence of hernandez rehabilitation or other proposed mitigating factors.
on april,the district court entered an amended judgment sentencing hernandez to months of incarceration,five years of supervised release,no fine,and a special assessment.in its april,statement of reasons,filed under seal with this court,the district court justified the of the sentence as follows 
the action was remanded from the united states court of appeals for the sole purpose of placing findings as to the defendant role in the offenses and that this court did not set forth a sufficient basis for applying a four level enhancement of his leadership role in the conspiracy.the court addressed these issues,in depth,by written order dated march.the court provided the parties a copy at the time of the and gave the parties ample time to read and discuss the order prior to addressing the court.
the court considered all the filings in this case and the factors in a and vividly recalls the chilling testimony and facts of this case.although the court was not required to hear argument regarding a full outside of the court of appeals mandate,the court entertained the motions presented in defendant sentencing memorandum.all those arguments were denied.the court did reduce the fine amount to what the defendant already contributed with the government consent.
hernandez timely appealed.
hernandez principally challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his.we review the reasonableness of a district court sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard 
a ppellate courts play an important but clearly secondary role in the process of determining an appropriate sentence.we review the work of district courts under a deferential standard.this form of appellate scrutiny encompasses two components procedural review and substantive review.
as to substance,we will not substitute our own judgment for the district court on the question of what is sufficient to meet the a considerations in any particular case.we will instead set aside a district court substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.to the extent that our prior cases may be read to imply a more searching form of substantive review,we today depart from that understanding.
this degree of deference is only warranted,however,once we are satisfied that the district court complied with the sentencing reform act procedural requirements,and this requires that we be confident that the sentence resulted from the district court considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various,often conflicting,purposes of sentencing.
a district court commits procedural error where it fails to calculate the guidelines range unless omission of the calculation is justified,makes a mistake in its guidelines calculation,or treats the guidelines as mandatory.it also errs procedurally if it does not consider the a factors,or rests its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.moreover,a district court errs if it fails adequately to explain its chosen sentence,and must include an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.where we find significant procedural error,one proper course would be to remand to the district court so that it can either explain what it was trying to do,or correct its mistake and exercise its discretion anew,rather than for the appellate court to proceed to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness.

against this backdrop,we conclude that the district court procedurally erred in failing to consider how intervening particular,hernandez the section a analysis 
at his,hernandez offered in mitigation evidence that during the interval he succeeded at numerous vocational and educational efforts,including earning an associate in specialized business degree with honors for completion of the business management curriculum at the center for degree studies,and a diploma for completion of the professional financial planning specialist program at the school of financial planning.hernandez also tutored other inmates and received positive performance reports for work in a variety of prison jobs.there is no evidence in the record of any misconduct during hernandez incarceration.
if credited,the mitigating evidence could affect the weight given to considerations that were discounted in by the gravity of hernandez crime his difficult childhood,his youth at the time of the offense conduct he was years old when he was arrested,and his addiction to drugs at the time of the offense conduct.at the time of the hernandez was years old,a development that,though predictable by arithmetic,may if considered in the context of hernandez intervening history indicate a decreased likelihood of recidivism.none of this was weighed in the balance of the section a factors.
true,judge platt twice recited during the proceedings that he considered all of the section a factors at the march,sentencing hearing,judge platt stated i have definitely reconsidered the a factors,and the district court statement of reasons explained that t he court considered all the filings in this case and the factors in a and vividly recalls the chilling testimony and facts of this case.such statements by the district court reinforce the presumption that the sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors,with a caveat,however in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise.united states fernandez,cir see also id.w e will not conclude that a district judge shirked her obligation to consider the a factors simply because she did not discuss each one individually or did not expressly parse or address every argument relating to those factors that the defendant advanced.emphasis added.in this case,record evidence suggest s otherwise for several related reasons.id.
judge platt misconstrued the scope of.his initial comments at the august,conference with the government reflect an understanding that he might obviate the need for factual findings to support the role enhancement,and thus discharge the burden of.judge platt opined that i suppose i could put the burden on chief judge dearie to persuade chief judge jacobs to persuade judge kearse that she has already given the answer.
moreover,the court march,written memorandum and order focused almost exclusively on making the factual findings required by this court opinion.the statement of reasons observed that the court was not required to hear argument regarding a full outside of the court of appeals mandate.in the alternative,the district court perfunctorily denied those arguments it deemed outside the limited scope of.this limitation was procedural error in a so long delayed.the original sentence had been vacated accordingly,the district court was required to hernandez.although there is a presumption that resentencing would be limited,not de novo,that presumption yields if the defendant can show that the spirit of the mandate requires de novo resentencing,an issue became relevant only after the initial appellate review,or there is a cogent or compelling reason for resentencing de novo,such as a change in controlling law.united states rigas,cir.during the hiatus in this case,the law of sentencing substantially evolved,and hernandez may have undergone a remarkable rehabilitation.the district court thus was obligated to hernandez de novo,consistent with the wider principle that the district court i s required to resentence a defendant in light of the circumstances as they st an d at the time of his resentencing.werber united states,cir.
judge platt the same sentence originally imposed in notwithstanding evidence of rehabilitation that was neither credited nor discredited.instead it was offset by judge platt repeated emphasis on the seriousness of the offense conduct.this finding was of course.heightened emphasis on the nature of the crime at was said to be justified in the march,written memorandum and order as well as at the sentencing hearing by the absence of guidelines for murder at the time of the sentencing and the development of such guidelines in the interval.
a district court judge is required to consider the seriousness of the offense.however,mechanisms were available for that purpose at the time of the sentencing.as the government pointed out at the march,sentencing hearing,the original presentence report included an increase for insufficient,but an increase the district court adopted.and,as hernandez counsel argued at that hearing,an upward departure provision was available at the time of the sentencing if the district court believed that the guidelines sentence failed to capture the severity of the offense conduct.
moreover,judge platt reliance on the promulgation of a guidelines provision is misplaced.the adoption of such a provision in no way altered the gravity of hernandez offense conduct.that is one of the section a factors that did not change since.
irrespective of the weight judge platt attributed to the severity of the offense,he overlooked the mitigating evidence presented in hernandez sentencing submissions and at the march,sentencing hearing.at that hearing,judge platt remarked i do think i could change his sentence given there no new factor here.but as hernandez forcefully argued,there were new factors presented to judge evidence of hernandez rehabilitation and his age at the time of well as other mitigating considerations that were discounted in by the gravity of hernandez his difficult childhood and his youth at the time of the offense conduct.the root in the judge framing of the issue as whether he could change the sentence is that the baseline at was the sentence imposed eighteen years earlier.
considered together,these features of the record indicate that judge platt failed to consider the section a factors.specifically,judge platt failed to consider evidence of rehabilitation and other mitigating evidence this procedural error requires vacatur of the and remand for a third sentencing proceeding.
we take the additional step of the to a different district court judge.this court has considerable discretion in a case for 
three considerations listed in united states robin,cir per curiam,are useful in deciding whether to reassign a case on remand whether the original judge would reasonably be expected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind views or findings determined to be erroneous,whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice,and whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness.
united states demott,cir per curiam alterations in original.
these three considerations favor reassignment.first,judge platt has twice imposed a sentence without making the required findings or without providing the necessary assurance that all of the relevant factors have been considered,and therefore may reasonably be expected to have substantial difficulty ignoring his previous views during a third sentencing proceeding.id.second,although this record does not permit a finding that judge platt is personally biased against hernandez,an objective observer might nonetheless question the judge impartiality.id.third,reassignment would not waste substantial judicial resources because the original sentencing and the appeal from it have already been accomplished,and the work of updating the record and the section a factors has not yet been undertaken.accordingly,we direct that this case be assigned to a different district court judge on remand.
conclusion 
we have considered all of the government arguments in support of the judgment and have found them unpersuasive.for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the judgment and remand for before a different district court judge.
