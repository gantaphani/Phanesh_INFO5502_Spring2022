background 
in,pereira worked as a senior mechanical buyer for ltx corporation ltx,a manufacturer of equipment and other electronic components.at that time,henry mathieu mathieu was the owner of synertron associates,synertron,a company that sells components to firms in the computer and medical industries.pereira and mathieu entered into a kickback arrangement whereby mathieu paid pereira a five percent commission on all of synertron sales to ltx.by agreement,mathieu paid pereira each month in cash,on the understanding that these payments would not be reported to tax officials.between and,mathieu cash payments to pereira totaled approximately.the tax loss attributable to pereira unreported income was.
on march,the grand jury for the district of massachusetts indicted pereira on four counts of subscribing false tax returns in violation of,and counts of using the mails for commercial bribery in violation of.on october,pereira,pursuant to a plea agreement,pled guilty to all counts of the indictment.
the plea agreement set pereira total offense level under the sentencing guidelines at resulting in a guideline sentencing range gsr of to months imprisonment.however,the agreement permitted pereira to move for a downward departure.
prior to sentencing,pereira filed a sentencing memorandum seeking a downward departure.pereira claimed,inter alia,that his obligation to care for his elderly and ill parents was an exceptional family circumstance warranting a downward departure.pereira estimated that he spent approximately twenty hours per week tending to his parents needs,including preparing their meals,cleaning their house,doing their laundry,making appointments with their physicians,administering their medications,helping them with their daily activities,shopping for their food and other necessities,taking care of their finances,and driving them to appointments and community activities.furthermore,since pereira parents do not speak english,he also served as an interpreter for them.
in addition to the sentencing memorandum,pereira submitted several letters to the district court from family members and friends.pereira wife wrote a letter describing pereira responsibilities to his parents and the likely consequences that his incarceration would have on the family 
we live the closest of the three children to his parent s home,which makes it much easier for us to care for them if pereira were to be incarcerated his parents would need to move in with one of his two siblings versus a retirement home.
appellant brief app.at.pereira sister also reported that she was unable to assist her parents to the extent that pereira could.id.at.she concluded that without pereira their parents would certainly be dependent upon an assisted living facility or a home nursing arrangement.id.
at the sentencing hearing,witnesses testified in detail about the extensive care that pereira provided his parents.dennis rodríguez,a longtime family friend,testified 
pereira is the one that takes care of the parents or,if he ca take care of something,he call me,dennis,can you help me out with my parents the mother had strokes recently.pereira would be,you know,the one to go over there and get her to the hospital.and,obviously,the other siblings would join,but him being so close,he would be the one.
tr.sentencing proceedings at.on,rodríguez also reported that both pereira brother and sister worked in the immediate vicinity of the parents home.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court found that pereira total offense level was sixteen but,over the government objection,departed downward to a level ten.according to the court,the departure was warranted because of pereira extraordinary family obligations,and in light of the fact that none of his siblings could step up to the plate and provide similar services and the family could not afford external care for the parents.the court then sentenced pereira to three years of probation,with six months of home detention.
the court specified that pereira would be confined to his home only during the weekends,leaving him free to work and to care for his parents needs during the week.on weekends,the court noted,pereira parents would have to rely on others for assistance.id.at.
standard of review 
we review district court departures under the sentencing guidelines for abuse of discretion.koon united states,d.this analysis has three parts.first,we determine as a theoretical matter whether the stated ground for departure is permissible under the guidelines.if the ground is theoretically appropriate,we next examine whether it finds adequate factual support in the record.if so,we must probe the degree of the departure in order to verify its reasonableness.united states dethlefs,cir citations omitted.in employing this analysis,we recognize that a district court decision to depart from the guidelines will in most cases be due substantial deference.koon,at.
discussion 
the united states sentencing guidelines establish ranges for the criminal sentences of federal offenders.district courts must impose sentences within the applicable ranges set forth within the guidelines.see a.however,a district court may depart from the applicable guideline range if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines id.b.thus,not every aggravating or mitigating circumstance will warrant departure the circumstance must render the case atypical and take it out of the heartland for which the applicable guideline was designed.united states,cir.
sentencing courts are given considerable guidance as to the factors that are likely or not likely to make a case atypical.encouraged factors are those the sentencing commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines.when encouraged factors are present,they may take a particular case outside the heartland of the applicable guideline,thereby warranting a departure.conversely,discouraged factors are those not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.ch,pt.h,introductory cmt.the sentencing commission does not view discouraged factors as necessarily inappropriate bases for departure but says they should be relied upon only in exceptional cases.id.
in the instant case,the factor upon which the district court relied in departing downward,family ties and responsibilities,is a discouraged factor under the guidelines.thus,departure on that ground is permissible under the first prong of our analysis,dethlefs,at,only if the circumstances of pereira case are exceptional.the government claims that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that pereira family responsibilities were so exceptional as to warrant departure.it argues that pereira circumstances were adequately considered by the sentencing commission,thereby placing his case within the heartland and making the departure impermissible.
whether a discouraged factor is present in some exceptional way should be determined,in large part,by comparison with the facts of other guidelines cases.koon,at.thus,existing caselaw defines the parameters for departure,outside of which a court can not go without assuming the risk of acting beyond permissible limits.
existing caselaw is clear that family responsibilities,by themselves,are not sufficient to take a case out of the heartland.in united states carr,cir,this court vacated a downward departure granted because of the defendants obligation to care for their old son.id.at.we held that a convicted felon parental responsibility to care for a child was,by itself,neither atypical nor unusual,even when both parents faced incarceration.id.at.in concluding that these circumstances were not extraordinary,we noted that the defendant mother would care for the child while his parents were imprisoned.id.
similarly,in united states rybicki,cir,the district court granted the defendant a downward departure,in part because of his extraordinary family responsibilities.id.at.according to the district court,the departure was warranted,in part,because the defendant had a neurologically impaired old son who was in need of special supervision,and a wife who was experiencing fragile mental health.id.at.in reversing the departure,the fourth circuit held that the defendant family responsibilities were not so exceptional as to justify a departure.id.at.
finally,in united states sweeting,cir,the defendant was a single mother and the sole provider for five children,one of whom had a substantial neurological impairment.id.at.the disabled child required special care to ensure that he exercised regularly,ate well,slept properly,and took his medication at the appropriate times.id.at.the third circuit ruled that these factors did not make the case extraordinary,especially considering that there is nothing in the record to suggest that defendant and only defendant can provide him with the care and attention he needs.see also united states dyce,holding that the district court erred when it departed based on defendant status as a single mother with three children under the age of four,one of whom was being,and where incarceration would require placing the children in foster care united states rushby,cir holding that defendant,who had been married for ten years,was the main breadwinner for wife and two children,and did chores for wife grandmother,did not have unusual family circumstances united states goff,cir ruling that defendant support of three children and a wife with depressive disorder and panic attacks was an insufficient basis for departure.
considering the immense hardships that fall within the heartland,it is difficult to conclude that pereira circumstances fall outside of it.the extensive care that pereira provides his parents is no more,and likely less,than the care required by young children with neurological deficiencies.unlike dependent children who require constant care and attention,pereira parents live alone and,minus the twenty hours per week that pereira cares for them,independently.although we do not disparage pereira significant and commendable devotion to his parents,we conclude that it falls short of what the caselaw has defined as extraordinary circumstances.
moreover,it is the unfortunate norm that innocent family members suffer considerable hardship when a relative is incarcerated.as this court has noted,d isruption of the defendant life,and the concomitant difficulties for those who depend on the defendant,are inherent in the punishment of incarceration.united states,cir.this being so,something more is necessary to elevate pereira those of others similarly of the heartland.
in united states archuleta,cir,the tenth circuit vacated a departure based on the defendant sole support of two children and an elderly diabetic mother.though the court found the defendant circumstances to be difficult and,it concluded that the defendant circumstances were not sufficiently rare to warrant departure.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court noted that the record had failed to establish that other relatives could not care for the dependent family members and that home nursing or other alternative services were not available.id.
conversely,courts have affirmed departures where the evidence established that the care rendered by the defendant was irreplaceable.in united states haversat,cir,the eighth circuit held that the defendant care for his ailing wife justified the district court departure.the defendant wife suffered severe psychiatric problems,and the defendant was needed to identify the beginning of any regressions and to seek out immediate treatment to avoid a serious situation.id.in affirming the district court departure,the court relied heavily on the treating physician testimony that the defendant participation in his wife care was irreplaceable.see also united states sclamo,cir ruling that defendant personal presence was needed to assist in the care of a old boy who suffered from a clinical disorder and whose condition would deteriorate in the defendant absence.
in contrast to haversat,the instant case is replete with evidence demonstrating alternative sources of care for pereira parents.therefore,to the extent that the district court departure was based on a determination that pereira care was irreplaceable we hold that such a finding does not find adequate support in the record under the second prong of our analysis.dethlefs,at.the nature of the care that pereira renders shopping,cleaning,food preparation,is not so highly specialized as to make him difficult to replace.moreover,dennis rodríguez testified that he provided help to pereira parents whenever he was called upon.he also reported that pereira siblings,who work in close proximity,helped out in caring for the defendant parents.in her letter to the court,pereira wife stated that i f pereira were to be incarcerated his parents would need to move in with one of his two siblings.pereira sister noted that without the defendant,their parents would certainly be dependent upon an assisted living facility or a home nursing arrangement.nothing in the record supports the district court conclusion that the family could not afford such external care.with this network of family,friends,and possible alternative care facilities,it is exceedingly difficult to characterize pereira care as irreplaceable or otherwise extraordinary.
in addition,the very sentence imposed by the district court highlights pereira replaceability.the sentence requires the defendant be confined to his home every weekend,during which time his parents would have to rely on others for assistance.the court thus acknowledged,to some degree,that pereira was able to rely on others to care for his parents in his absence.
though it may be that none of pereira siblings will be able to provide the same level of parental care,this fact alone is not sufficient to deem pereira irreplaceable.as long as there are feasible alternatives of care that are relatively comparable to what the defendant provides,the defendant can not be irreplaceable.in this case,pereira siblings and the possibility of home nursing provide adequate substitutes in pereira absence.
in response,pereira insists that his family obligations are truly extraordinary,especially in light of how unique they are.pereira argues that it is uncommon to find parents who are as elderly and disabled by serious illness as his are,and even more rare to find a child like him who has provided a similar degree of care and assistance to his parents.
we believe that pereira argument is flawed because it erroneously equates uniqueness with extraordinariness.though pereira circumstances may be unique,this fact alone does not mean that his family circumstances are necessarily extraordinary.every family circumstances are unique,with idiosyncracies that are unlikely to be duplicated.instead,the crucial question is whether the unique set of facts,taken together,rise to the level of extraordinariness.
given the network of friends and family to care for pereira parents in his absence,we find nothing extraordinary or exceptional about pereira family circumstances.though pereira parents will likely be inconvenienced by their son incarceration,inconveniences are part of the disruption inherent in incarceration.
conclusion 
because pereira circumstances are not so compelling as to remove him from the guidelines heartland,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in granting pereira a downward departure.we reverse and remand this case for action
