the appellant,robert rowe,brings a third appeal from his conviction and sentence for bankruptcy fraud.see united states rowe,cir rowe i united states rowe,cir rowe ii.in the present appeal,rowe contends that the district court erred in imposing a fine and in ruling that the mandate in rowe ii precluded consideration of rowe motion to dismiss count ii of the indictment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decisions of the district court.
rowe filed a personal bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in september of.as part of his bankruptcy proceeding,rowe was obligated to file bankruptcy schedules listing specified assets.when asked in schedule a to provide a description of real property in which he had an interest,rowe answered none,although he then owned,with his,a house in nahant,massachusetts.in schedule j,pertaining to current expenditures,rowe listed one rent payment but omitted another.
in may of,rowe was indicted on three charges of bankruptcy fraud in violation of.following an trial,he was acquitted on count i but was convicted on counts ii and iii,which charged him with making false statements in his bankruptcy schedules.he was sentenced to serve months in prison and to pay a special assessment.neither restitution nor a fine was imposed.the sentence was stayed pending appeal.
on appeal,rowe argued that the district court mishandled incidents involving two jurors.he also argued that the district court erred in not granting his motion for judgment of acquittal on count iii,in calculating the intended loss from his fraud,in imposing upward adjustments to his offense level,and in failing to put a juror communication in the record.we affirmed rowe conviction on count ii,reversed his conviction on count iii,vacated his sentence,and remanded for resentencing.see rowe i,at.
before the resentencing proceeding was held,the united states attorney office filed an ethical complaint with the massachusetts board of bar overseers against rowe counsel.the district court continued the resentencing proceeding while rowe counsel responded to the complaint.after the complaint was dismissed,rowe counsel argued that the complaint was brought in retaliation for his charges that a government agent had given perjured testimony at rowe trial.rowe asked for an evidentiary hearing on his allegations of government misconduct.the district court denied his request for a hearing.
resentencing occurred on november.rowe was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and months of supervised release.the court also imposed a special assessment and a fine of.see rowe ii,at.
rowe again appealed,arguing that the district court erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of governmental misconduct,in determining the intended loss from his criminal conduct,and in increasing his base offense level for violating a judicial order or process and obstructing justice.he also contended that the fine imposed was vindictive.we affirmed the district court decisions not to hold an evidentiary hearing and to increase the base offense level based on a finding that rowe violated a judicial order or process.we concluded,however,that the district court erred in determining the amount of rowe intended loss and in imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement based on rowe testimony about his property interests.we did not address the question of the fine,noting that rowe would have to be resentenced in any case,and we urged the district court to consider rowe arguments about the fine at that time.see rowe ii,at.
rowe sentence was vacated,and the case was remanded for further proceedings before a judge.on remand from rowe ii,rowe filed a motion to dismiss count ii of the indictment,asserting that our decision in rowe ii,reversing the district court valuation of the intended loss in count ii,constituted a ruling that the property was worthless,thereby negating any intent to defraud.during argument on the motion,the district court construed the motion as one for a new trial.at the close of the hearing,the district court denied the motion on the ground that the mandate from rowe ii did not permit consideration of the issue raised.
the third sentencing was held on april.rowe was sentenced to five years of probation,a fine of,and a special assessment of.the court adopted the factual findings and guideline application contained in the presentence report in its statement of reasons for the sentence rowe did not object to any part of the sentence.
discussion 
rowe raises two issues on appeal.he argues that the court erred in imposing a fine of in the absence of evidence that he was able to pay such a fine.he also argues that the district court erred in not considering his motion to dismiss.
rowe did not object below to the imposition of the fine by judge young but first raised his objection to the fine in this appeal as a result,the district court decision is reviewable only for plain error.see.b see also united states peppe,cir.review for plain error requires four showings that there was error that it was plain that the error affected substantial rights and that the error affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states terry,cir quotation marks omitted.
deviation from a rule is error unless the rule has been waived.united states olano,d.rowe argues that the district court,in imposing the fine,failed to provide factual findings in support of the fine,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure c,a,and united states sentencing guidelines.rowe also contends that the district court erred because no fine was imposed as part of his first sentence and the government presented no additional evidence at the subsequent sentencings to show that he was able to pay a fine.
a presumption exists that a fine will be imposed as part of a sentence,and the defendant bears the burden of showing that an exception should be made in his case.see a united states merric,cir.to meet his burden,a defendant must establish that it is more likely than not that he is both unable to pay a fine and will not be able to pay in the future.see united states kadonsky,cir.a defendant may rely on the information provided in the presentence report or he may make an independent evidentiary showing.see id.a present lack of assets or even a negative net worth will not preclude imposition of a fine unless a defendant also demonstrates that he lacks the ability to earn and to pay a fine in the future.see peppe,at.
when imposing a fine and its conditions,a district court must consider,inter alia,any evidence presented as to the defendant ability to pay the fine including the ability to pay over a period of time in light of his earning capacity and financial resources and the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments.peppe,at quoting d and citing a.express findings about a defendant financial condition are not necessary to support the imposition of a fine if the record is sufficient to permit appellate review.see merric,at.as long as the record evidence supports a fine,the district court is presumed to have considered the applicable statutory criteria.see united states saxena,cir.
following rowe ii,judge young,in the third sentencing proceeding,adopted the presentence report in support of his decision to impose a fine.although the report was three years old and had not been revised or updated since may of,rowe did not object or indicate that the information was out of date.the report establishes that rowe is college educated,that he has a strong work ethic,having been employed for most of his adult life doing residential and general contracting,construction and home design,and that he is in good health.he has usually held managerial or ownership roles in his undertakings,and he also possesses a real estate sales license that requires him to work under the authority of a broker.
his wife worked as a professional dance teacher until she was injured and has worked as a nanny since that time.rowe has two daughters by his first marriage,one of whom was in college on a scholarship in.his second wife has a
