in this appeal we confront the narrow question of whether the district court clearly erred in imposing a sentencing enhancement for two defendants pursuant to section b of the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines.this provision requires courts to increase a defendant base offense level by four points if the defendant possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.the items at issue are two live,military fragmentation hand grenades that were stolen from a united states military facility and delivered to defendant jason zawadzki.
zawadzki and david molloy were apprehended by federal law enforcement officials after attempting to sell the hand grenades to a government informant.both subsequently pled guilty to one count of possession of unregistered destructive devices and one count of transferring unregistered destructive devices.zawadzki,who at the time was serving a state sentence of home confinement,also pled guilty to a third count of of firearms and ammunition.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court decision to impose the enhancement for both defendants is well grounded in the factual record and the relevant case law.accordingly,we reject the appellants claims and affirm the decision below.
in december,zawadzki arranged to obtain two hand grenades from david joseph,a convicted felon who had earlier been deported to canada.joseph instructed his girlfriend to deliver the hand grenades to zawadzki,who was confined to his home and required to wear an electronic monitoring device under the terms of his sentence for a prior state felony conviction.as part of his sentence,zawadzki was also required to attend alcoholics anonymous meetings at the essex county house of correction farm program.at one meeting,zawadzki offered to sell the hand grenades to another convicted felon named david santiago tucky whom the defendant knew to be a member of a street gang in lawrence,massachusetts,called the outlaws.
after tucky declined to purchase the grenades,zawadzki contacted molloy to request his assistance in finding a buyer.molloy informed zawadzki that he knew a member of the latin gangsta disciples street gang named luis colon slot who would potentially be interested in purchasing the grenades for up to.the disciples were declared enemies of the outlaws who trafficked drugs and stolen weapons in north lawrence.molloy knowledge of slot involvement with the disciples stemmed from a friendship between the two,during which time molloy assisted slot in selling a mm handgun to a friend of molloy named lapoint.molloy was also aware that slot frequently socialized with victor laboy papito bosero,a known leader of the disciples,and that slot had been shot by leslie carabello,a member of the outlaws.unbeknownst to molloy,however,slot had recently become a cooperating witness for the massachusetts state police.
on january,molloy approached slot at a party in lawrence and offered to sell him the two hand grenades.molloy appeared anxious to unload the grenades,and attempted to accelerate the pace of negotiations by informing slot that if he could not commit to purchasing the hand grenades quickly,molloy would instead sell them to tucky,whom both parties knew to be involved with the rival outlaws.slot left the party and telephoned massachusetts state trooper frank hughes,who instructed slot to make the purchase the next day.on january,slot contacted molloy and,in a telephone conversation that was recorded by law enforcement agents,elicited from molloy that the hand grenades belonged to a third party and that molloy would need to retrieve them before the sale.during the conversation molloy agreed to sell the grenades for due at the time of purchase,and to be paid once slot verified the authenticity of the grenades.slot agreed to meet molloy at a location near molloy residence later that evening to complete the transaction.
after the phone conversation,the police provided slot with in marked bills and equipped him with a wire.that evening,after several phone conversations,slot drove to the agreed location,which turned out to be zawadzki residence.molloy obtained the grenades from zawadzki and gave them to slot in exchange for the initial payment.on january,after law enforcement officials confirmed that the hand grenades were live and authentic,slot met with molloy and paid him the outstanding balance of.the next day,molloy approached slot and offered to sell him other stolen weapons,including a shotgun and two handguns.
between january and february,slot and molloy had several conversations monitored by law enforcement agents to negotiate the price of the weapons and to make arrangements for the exchange.these recorded conversations,coupled with the earlier recorded discussions regarding the hand grenades,are the main subject matter of the dispute.the conversations reveal that slot,prior to his purchase of the hand grenades,invented a fictitious buyer for whom he was supposedly purchasing the weapons.slot portrayed this fictitious buyer as a hostile individual with substantial knowledge of hand grenades,ostensibly to convince molloy that the buyer would react negatively if molloy attempted to sell him fake grenades.in one january telephone conversation,slot remarked that the fictitious buyer do want to get stiffed for that bullshit cuz he already got stiffed once,and represented that this guy wants them you know he collects them shits i guess.
on the basis of these conversations and the recovered hand grenades,the police obtained a search warrant for zawadzki residence.while executing the warrant,the police recovered a shotgun,two handguns,and of the cash payment that slot made to molloy.molloy was subsequently arrested,and the two eventually pled guilty to the aforementioned charges.
to impose the sentencing enhancement for molloy and zawadzki,the court was required to find,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the recorded conversations revealed that the had knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that the hand grenades sold to slot would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.b.the court concluded that the requirements of section b were satisfied as to molloy the tenor of the transcripts and all the circumstances convince the court by a fair preponderance of the evidence that molloy thought these grenades were going to be used in a felony.the court similarly imposed a enhancement for zawadzki,concluding that there is significant evidence to warrant the inference that zawadzki in fact had reason to believe that the grenades would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense and further,i find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did so believe.
zawadzki and molloy advance separate theories of error in the district court sentencing determinations.the government concedes that zawadzki had no knowledge of the fictitious buyer invented by slot zawadzki,in turn,argues that the government proof that the defendants sold the grenades to a known gang member was by itself insufficient to trigger a enhancement under b.molloy,on the other hand,insists that he had reason to believe that slot would convey the grenades to an who did not intend to use them in a felony,but wished to purchase them for his personal collection.we examine each of these arguments in turn,mindful of the deference that we accord a district court factual findings if a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing,we review the finding for clear error.in doing so,we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.united states powell,cir internal citation omitted.
zawadzki claim of error 
at zawadzki sentencing hearing,the government conceded that its best evidence supporting the court application of b was that zawadzki was selling to a gang member in the lawrence area with knowledge of what was going on in the lawrence area but no specific knowledge of any specific felony.yet as molloy and zawadzki
