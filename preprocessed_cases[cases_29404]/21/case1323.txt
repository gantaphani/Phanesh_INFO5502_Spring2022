james gansman defendant or gansman appeals from a february,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york miriam goldman cedarbaum,judge convicting him of insider trading under the misappropriation theory.the supreme court has distinguished the misappropriation theory from the classical insider trading theory by explaining that i n lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company stock,the misappropriation theory premises liability on a deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.united states,
the principal question presented is whether the district court erred in declining to adopt an instruction proposed by gansman setting forth a theory of the defense based in part on sec rule.promulgated pursuant to of the securities exchange act of,stat.codified as amended at et act rule provides a list of possible circumstances that give rise to a duty of trust or confidence which in turn constitutes an element of the offense that must be proved by the government in a prosecution pursuant to the misappropriation theory of insider trading.the rule provides,in relevant part 
for purposes of this section,a duty of trust or confidence exists in the following circumstances,among others 
whenever a person agrees to maintain information in confidence 
whenever the person communicating the material nonpublic information and the person to whom it is communicated have a history,pattern,or practice of sharing confidences,such that the recipient of the information knows or reasonably should know that the person communicating the material nonpublic information expects that the recipient will maintain its confidentiality or 
whenever a person receives or obtains material nonpublic information from his or her spouse,parent,child,or sibling provided,however,that the person receiving or obtaining the information may demonstrate that no duty of trust or confidence existed with respect to the information,by establishing that he or she neither knew nor reasonably should have known that the person who was the source of the information expected that the person would keep the information confidential,because of the parties history,pattern,or practice of sharing and maintaining confidences,and because there was no agreement or understanding to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
emphasis supplied 
relying upon rule,gansman proposed the following jury instruction,in relevant part 
in this case,gansman contends that he did not provide donna murdoch with material nonpublic information with the understanding that murdoch would use the information to purchase and sell securities.any material nonpublic information that murdoch may have received from gansman was shared with her as part of a relationship of trust and confidence,in which they had a history and practice of sharing work and personal confidences such that gansman reasonably expected that murdoch would keep any confidences he shared with her confidential,and certainly expected that she would not use those confidences to buy or sell securities.unbeknownst to gansman,murdoch used information he conveyed to her in confidence to trade securities for her benefit and the benefit of others 
joint app x at emphasis supplied.we hold that gansman was entitled to assert a defense theory that he did not have the requisite intent to commit securities fraud,and that in defining the nature of his relationship with murdoch to the jury,he had the right to use language found in rule.
gansman raises a number of other challenges to his conviction,all of which are without merit.
background 
on february,after a trial by jury,gansman was convicted of six counts of securities fraud,in violation of b of the act,b,and its implementing regulations,sec rules and,b,he was prosecuted pursuant to a misappropriation theory of insider trading.see part a,post see also united states,discussing the misappropriation theory.the evidence underlying the conviction,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,jackson virginia,established the following facts.
beginning in late and continuing through late,gansman participated in an insider trading scheme in which he repeatedly disclosed material information to donna murdoch,a woman with whom he was having an affair.in his professional capacity as an attorney in the transactional advisory services department of ernst young,llp,gansman obtained material information about potential mergers and acquisitions.gansman disclosed this information to murdoch,in violation of his duty of confidentiality to ernst young and its clients murdoch,in turn,traded on this information before the deals became public,profiting from the increase in stock price that occurred when the deals were later announced these basic facts are not disputed for purposes of this appeal.see br.at.
on february,the district court sentenced gansman principally to imprisonment of one year and one day on each count of securities fraud,to run concurrently.this appeal followed.
gansman defense theory 
a person commits securities fraud for purposes of both civil and criminal enforcement actions under b of the act and rule when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes,in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information,at.rule,in turn,lists a set of examples in which a duty arises for purposes of b and rule.see preliminary note insider trading,securities and exchange commission,provides that a person receiving confidential information under circumstances specified in the rule would owe a duty of trust or confidence and thus could be liable under the misappropriation theory.
on appeal,gansman contends that the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury pursuant to a theory of the defense based in part on rule.the proposed charge,set forth above,reflected a defense theory that gansman lacked the requisite intent to commit securities fraud because he had shared material information with murdoch only as part of a relationship of trust and confidence,in which they had a history and practice of sharing work and personal confidences.joint app x at.according to gansman,he therefore reasonably expected that murdoch would keep any confidences he shared with her confidential and would not use those confidences to buy or sell securities.id.
the district court declined to give gansman proposed instruction.instead,it gave a slightly modified version of the charge,as follows 
in this case,gansman contends that he did not provide murdoch with insider information with the understanding that she would use it to buy and sell securities.according to gansman,any material non public information that murdoch may have received from him was shared with her as part of a relationship in which they shared work and personal confidences.

to secure a reversal on a flawed jury charge,a defendant must demonstrate both error and ensuing prejudice.united states white,cir quotation marks omitted.no particular wording or phrasing is required for an instruction to be legally sufficient,so long as,taken as a whole,the instruction correctly conveys the applicable law.victor nebraska,quotation marks omitted.at trial,the district court gave an instruction that was substantially similar to the one gansman requested and that clearly informed the jury of gansman theory that he lacked the requisite intent to commit the crime with which he was charged.accordingly,in the circumstances presented here,we hold that the theory of the defense was adequately conveyed to the jury and defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of the district court instruction,even though the instruction did not use the exact words gansman preferred.
moreover,the government presented ample evidence that gansman knew or had reason to know that murdoch was trading on the information he gave her.the jury could have reasonably accepted this evidence.for example,the government presented evidence that 
in late september,following a profitable trade,murdoch gave gansman an apple computer as a thank you present.gansman said to her,i do even want to know how much you made with that trade.
gansman told murdoch he kept expecting to see her name on an ernst young list that gansman got whenever there was suspicious activity in a stock.the government proved that such a document existed an ernst young employee testified that the firm periodically circulated lists with respect to trading on transactions where ernst young has played a part in the transaction.
after gansman last tip to murdoch,relating to a corporate acquisition,murdoch said she did not speak to gansman immediately afterwards because she was freaked out and she knew gansman was freaked out as well.murdoch had made approximately on this deal,and,as she put it,i t was a lot of money and it was very fast and it was too much.when murdoch and gansman finally spoke,they decided to put an end to their scheme no more.ca do it i do remember who said it first but it was sort of like blurted out of both of our mouths at the same time when it came out,no more,i agree we ca talk about this any more.according to murdoch,gansman said to her,i love you but i do want to go to jail.sorry.
the government further argues that the district court would have erred if it had given the requested jury charge.we disagree.
in prosecuting a putative tipper under the misappropriation theory of insider trading,the government must prove as an element of the offense that the tipper conveyed material information to his tippee with the understanding that it would be used for securities trading purposes.see a see also indictment,united states gansman,cr,at may,charging gansman with disclosing i nside i nformation to murdoch,with the understanding that murdoch would use it to purchase and sell securities,and thereby generate illegal profits.pursuant to this misappropriation concept of insider trading liability,the sec has recognized a number of situations,set forth in rule,in which a tippee,but not the tipper,may be liable for insider trading on the theory that the tippee owed a duty of trust or confidence to the tipper and the tipper conveyed confidential information without intending to have it used for securities trading purposes.see,united states corbin,d see also rocklage,cir civil enforcement action in which only the tippee was liable yun,cir same.
here,it was perfectly appropriate for gansman to seek to present to a jury a defense that his relationship and interactions with murdoch exemplified just such circumstances.that is,gansman was entitled to support his general defense that he lacked the intent to commit securities fraud by showing,in particular,that he shared a history,pattern,and practice of sharing confidences with murdoch sufficient to create a duty of trust running to gansman,see sec rule,and that gansman had confided in murdoch with the understanding that his communications would not be used for securities trading purposes by presenting the defense theory in this way,gansman presumably wished to show that his relationship with murdoch was factually similar to cases in which a tipper like gansman was not liable for insider trading despite the presence of a tippee like murdoch who was liable for insider trading.see corbin,d rocklage,yun.gansman could have been properly acquitted of the crime with which he was charged if the trier of fact had agreed with his theory 
in arguing that gansman was not entitled to assert this defense,the government incorrectly frames the issue as a question of whether a duty of trust or confidence under rule can be owed to an individual who transmits material information with the knowledge and intent that it will be used for securities trading purposes.see,gov t br.at arguing that the rule can not apply to gansman insofar as he was a tipper gov t supp.br.at stating that the government uses the term tipper to refer to a party who misappropriates inside information with the knowledge or intent that the recipient will trade on it.in our view,the government logic is neither useful nor instructive with respect to the propriety of gansman requested jury charge,for the simple reason that gansman was entitled to put on a defense that did not rest on the premise that he intended to commit securities fraud.indeed,gansman concedes that a person with the intent to commit securities fraud would not be owed a duty of trust pursuant to rule,see supp.br.at.his claim,of course,is that he was not such a person a claim that,alas,the jury found unpersuasive.
in sum,we hold that the district court would not have erred if it had given gansman requested jury charge but also that the slightly modified charge it did give was legally sufficient.
conscious avoidance 
gansman argues that the district court charge on conscious avoidance misstated the law a nd confused the jury.the principal conscious avoidance charge given by the district court provided,in relevant part 
i n determining whether gansman acted knowingly,you may consider whether he deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him if you find that gansman was aware of a high probability that murdoch would use the inside information he disclosed to her to purchase or sell securities and that gansman acted with deliberate disregard of that fact you may find that he acted knowingly.however,if you find that gansman actually believed that murdoch would not purchase or sell securities using that inside information,he may not be convicted.
joint app x at emphasis supplied.while gansman concedes that this instruction regarding high probability and actual belie f was unobjectionable,see br.at,he argues that the court subsequently erred by failing to reiterate the actual belie f language in a later instruction,which charged 
y ou will determine whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant understood that murdoch was very likely to use information he disclosed to her to buy or sell securities.
gansman claim is without merit because it is based on a reading of the second instruction in isolation.in the circumstances presented here,there can be no doubt that the instructions as a whole adequately communicated the essential ideas to the jury.united states sabhnani,cir quotation marks omitted.
polygraph evidence 
gansman also challenges the district court exclusion of testimony that murdoch obstructed justice by engaging in studied efforts to beat two polygraph examinations.specifically,at trial,the district court held that the defense could murdoch regarding her multiple polygraph examinations,her efforts to beat the tests,and her numerous lies during those tests however,the district court prohibited the defense from eliciting the actual results of the tests,explaining 
b ecause i do not think that it is sufficiently relevant that she was able to deceive a lie detector expert,because of the unreliability generally of lie detectors and in order not to have the jury speculating about the reliability of lie detectors,i do not think it is admissible,and i preclude it under federal rule of evidence because i think it leads to confusion and distraction,and i do not think that it adds very much relevance.
joint app x at 
we review the district court ruling for abuse of discretion.see united states curley,cir see also sims blot,cir explaining abuse of discretion.here,the restriction imposed by the court was much narrower than gansman acknowledges,and despite this restriction,gansman succeeded in murdoch at length about the polygraph examinations.accordingly,we hold that the district court ruling was a reasonable exercise of its discretion to delimit under rule.
impeachment by third party conviction 
gansman asserts that the district court improperly prohibited him from murdoch about her father previous securities fraud convictions.according to gansman,introducing the conviction was necessary to elicit that murdoch had visited her father in jail and it was painful and awful and going to jail is something she willing to avoid at all costs.
gansman claims are without merit.rule of the federal rules of evidence provides that evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted,subject t
