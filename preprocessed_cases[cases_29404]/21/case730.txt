falcón diómedes andújar claims that his sentence for illegal reentry after deportation was unlawful because the district court declined to account for unwarranted sentence disparities as required by a.he claims that these unwarranted disparities result from the operation of sentencing programs in other districts.these programs allow some districts whose resources are strained by high immigration workloads to offer diminished charges or sentences in immigration cases in exchange for a defendant agreement to waive certain procedural rights.in addition,andújar argues that programs violate his constitutional right to equal protection.finally,he argues that the district court erred in treating his prior convictions as sentencing factors.we reject each of these contentions and affirm his sentence.
andújar was born in the dominican republic in and entered the united states when he was about eighteen years old to join his mother,who had already immigrated to peabody,massachusetts.shortly thereafter,andújar became addicted to cocaine and was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in.he was deported in,after serving his sentence.
in,andújar returned to the united states and assumed the name of dwight braswell,an identity he maintained until the time of his arrest in this case.by,he had become addicted to heroin and was convicted for three heroin offenses between april and november.according to the report psr prepared by the probation office in connection with the current illegal reentry charge,andújar devoted himself to recovering from his addictions following his arrest in november.he signed himself into a detoxification program and then joined an outpatient program with weekly meetings he became an active member of the church of the living god in woburn,massachusetts and he secured a job working for a fellow parishioner repairing floors.
despite these positive developments,andújar was convicted of indecent assault and battery in april.fingerprints taken in connection with that conviction revealed his true identity as a result,he was subsequently indicted for illegal reentry into the united states after having been deported.see a,b.andújar entered a guilty plea to that charge in july.
the psr calculated a base offense level of,and recommended a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.using a criminal history category of v,the psr concluded that the applicable guidelines sentencing range was months of imprisonment.andújar did not object to the psr or its guidelines calculations.however,he submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court arguing that the court could not use prior convictions that were not charged in the indictment or admitted by him in determining his sentence and a sentence of months would be adequate to achieve the purposes of sentencing prescribed by statute.see a requiring the court to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to meet certain sentencing goals and which enumerates a number of factors that the court shall consider in arriving at that sentence.andújar based his request on several grounds,including his extraordinary rehabilitation and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities resulting from the absence of a program in the district of massachusetts.programs in other parts of the country might allow a defendant in andújar circumstances to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for a guilty plea to the charged immigration offense or to a lesser reentry charge and a waiver of certain procedural rights.we describe these programs in detail in section ii,infra.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court rejected all of andújar contentions.it explained that the supreme court decision in united states,d,allows prior felony convictions to be used as sentencing factors so long as they are proven to the court by a preponderance of the evidence.the court found that the probation office investigation was sufficient to satisfy that standard.the court also rejected defendant disparities argument,concluding,based on this court previous decision in united states martin,cir,that the different sentencing standards of different districts was not a sufficient justification for a departure.although the court acknowledged andújar arrest,it found that his criminal history and persistent use of a false throughout his alleged that rehabilitation and made a variance unwarranted.considering all relevant factors,the court announced a sentence of months of the bottom of the guidelines be followed by two years of supervised release.
andújar now appeals,claiming that the court erred in refusing to consider sentence disparities engendered by the presence of programs in some districts and not others.by failing to consider these factors,andújar argues,the district court committed an error of law,making his sentence per se unreasonable.he also argues,for the first time on appeal,that sentencing currently his constitutional right to equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.finally,he argues that recent decisions by the supreme court cast doubt on the continuing validity of.
we review constitutional questions de novo.goodrich hall,cir.we also review claims of legal error in sentencing de novo,united states wallace,cir,but we review the final sentence for reasonableness,regardless of whether it falls inside the sentencing guidelines range,as it does here,or outside.united states,cir.
andújar contends that the district court committed legal error in rejecting his argument that the availability of sentencing programs in some districts creates unwarranted sentence disparities which compelled a sentence in this case.such inconsistencies must be taken into account,he argues,under a,which requires courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.andújar unwarranted disparities argument has three components first,that programs generally create unwarranted sentence disparities as defined by a second,that the attorney general implementation of programs has fallen outside congress mandate,thereby creating unwarranted disparities and third,that programs,both inherently and as they have been implemented in districts around the country,contravene congressional intent and create unwarranted disparities.andújar asks us to conclude that his sentence was unreasonable as a matter of law because the district court failed to vary his sentence from the guidelines range based on these disparities.
the government contends that the district court did consider andújar argument,but rejected it on the basis that such disparities are not unwarranted.it further argues that disparities arising from congressionally approved programs can not be considered unwarranted under the statute,and that sentence variations arising from systems are a product of executive discretion and,as such,provide no basis for varying from the guidelines sentence.
although andújar says that he only seeks from us a directive to the district court that it may consider in its sentencing decision the unwarranted sentencing disparities created by the programs,that is not the logic of his arguments.taken to their logical conclusion,andújar arguments would compel us to find that any sentence in an illegal reentry case that failed to account for disparities reflected an unwarranted sentencing disparity and hence was per se unreasonable.in essence,he asks us to find that district courts must,as a matter of law,account for such disparities.
we reach the opposite conclusion.we agree with the government that the limited disparities arising from approved programs reliant on downward sentence departures,as contemplated by congress,are permissible.we also find that programs using measures rather than downward sentence departures are within the discretion of the united states attorneys and additionally have been authorized by the attorney general.therefore,the disparities resulting from programs,whether a product of downward departures or programs,are warranted and may not be considered by a district judge in sentencing as a basis for a variance from a guidelines sentence pursuant to a.
in this case,the district court did not commit legal error by declining to adjust andújar sentence on the basis of such disparities.we begin our analysis by briefly discussing the background of programs.
origins of the program 
the first program was a product of prosecutorial discretion rather than congressional legislation.see rebecca schendel norris,disparities in the world illegal reentry sentencing policies,hereinafter schendel norris.in the,the united states attorney office for the southern district of california allowed some offenders charged with illegal reentry under b which carried a maximum sentence of five or fifteen years,depending on the defendant criminal plead guilty to a lesser reentry offense,a which carried only a maximum the offender agreed to waive indictment,plead guilty,waive appeal of all sentencing issues,stipulate to the sentence,and further agreed not to seek downward adjustments or departures see united states,cir.similar programs were adopted by federal prosecutors in texas,new mexico,arizona and in other california districts.united states,cir.
in,congress passed the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today protect act,stat.codified in sections,and of the,which explicitly authorizes programs.the act seeks to substantially reduce the incidence of downward departures in sentencing,protect act,m a,stat.at,and also creates an explicit,regulated exception for programs.id.m b,stat.at.to that end,the act required the sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.id.thus,the language of the protect act suggests that congress intended to authorize a narrow departure scheme for programs while otherwise restricting the use of downward departures.
there is additional evidence of congress intent to establish a narrow exception in a house of representatives report issued prior to the enactment of the protect act,in connection with a companion bill,the child abduction prevention act of also known as the feeney amendment.the house report to the feeney amendment endorsed a formal program of limited departures from the sentencing guidelines for those particular classes of offenses such as illegal reentry whose high incidence within the district has imposed an extraordinary strain on the resources of that district as compared to other districts.see cong.rec,daily ed,amendment offered by feeney.the report explicitly acknowledged that sentence disparities would result between districts and track districts however,it specified that such disparities do not confer authority to depart downward on an ad hoc basis in individual cases.id.at see,united states mejía,cir 
a contemporaneous report to congress from the sentencing commission also noted the tension between a and the protect act,m a and b,explicitly highlighting that sentencing disparities would result 
defendants sentenced in districts without authorized early disposition programs can be expected to receive longer sentences than defendants in districts with such programs.this type of geographical disparity appears to be at odds with the overall goal of reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity furthermore,sentencing courts in districts without early disposition programs,particularly those in districts that adjoin districts with such programs,may feel pressured to employ other departures in reach similar sentencing outcomes for similarly situated defendants.this potential response by sentencing courts could undermine the goal of the protect act to reduce the incidence of downward departures.
sentencing commission,report to congress downward departures from the federal sentencing guidelines at,available at.the report concluded that review of program performance might be appropriate in the future to provide additional guidance to the courts on these issues.id.at.
shortly after congress passed the protect act,and pursuant to the legislation,the attorney general issued a memorandum outlining the elements required for any program and explaining the conditions necessary to obtain the attorney general authorization for such a program a month later,applications were submitted in fifteen districts thirteen specifically addressed the crime of illegal reentry.schendel norris,supra,at.those approved were arizona,idaho,nebraska,new mexico,north dakota,oregon,all four california districts,the southern and western districts of texas,and the western district of washington.id.at.at the time of andújar sentencing,massachusetts had no program.
b.the statutory challenge 
whether sentence disparities attributable to the existence of programs are unwarranted is a question of first impression in this circuit.every other circuit except the circuit has addressed this issue,and each has reached the same conclusion.because sentence disparities resulting from the presence of programs in some districts and the absence thereof in others are not unwarranted,a court failure to adjust a sentence to compensate for such disparities does not make that sentence unreasonable.mejía,at united states vargas,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states sebastián,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states anaya castro,cir.the fourth circuit has taken an additional step,finding that a district court sentence was unreasonable as a matter of law because the court justification for such variance,namely a desire to avoid sentence disparities,was improper,at if a district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in imposing a sentence outside the properly calculated advisory guideline range,the sentence will be found unreasonable and vacated.in reaching these conclusions,courts have relied on the same rationale congress must have thought the disparity warranted when it authorized early disposition programs without altering a,at,and it is within the province of the policymaking branches of government to determine that certain disparities are warranted,and thus need not be avoided.sebastián,at.
while we have not squarely addressed this issue before,we have twice expressed in dicta our view that sentence disparities arising from programs are not unwarranted.see united states,cir en banc the existence of programs certainly permits disparities but they are the result of a congressional choice made for prudential reasons,implicitly qualifying the general aim of equality.united states,cir it is arguable that even,it would never be reasonable to depart downward based on disparities between and jurisdictions given congress clear if implied statement in the protect act provision that such disparities are acceptable.however,in each case,we did not have to reach the ultimate substantive issue,at t he district court ruled that the defendant had not furnished a factual basis for assessing the extent of the disparities or provided a reason why to take them into account in declining to alter the sentence on this ground,the district court did not act unreasonably,at dismissing the argument on plain error grounds.we now join the other circuit courts and make that holding explicit.because congress has authorized programs with the understanding that such programs would create sentencing disparities,we find that such disparities are not unwarranted as a matter of law.therefore,a sentence imposed without consideration of such disparities under a is not legally erroneous or,as defendant would put it,per se unreasonable.in passing the protect act,congress determined that the benefits of maintaining high prosecution rates and relieving the case management burdens on many districts outweighed the costs of lower sentences.see,at.as a court we are not in a position to second guess that determination.
seeking to convince us otherwise,andújar argues that whether disparities are warranted within the context of a must depend only upon the nature of the offense and the offender,and that the needs of the the burdens placed upon its resources by the high incidence of particular serve as a legitimate basis for interdistrict disparities.andújar supports this claim by pointing out that a itself,in listing the factors the court must consider when imposing a sentence,focuses on the nature of the offense and the offender and never mentions governmental resources.in addition,he argues that the legislative history behind the unwarranted disparity language in a also indicates no expectation that scarce government resources could justify sentence disparities.however,this argument ignores congress authority to modify that focus in the protect act itself we agree with the ninth circuit that 
when congress passed the protect act,it did so with knowledge that a was directing sentencing courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.by authorizing programs without revising the terms of a,congress was necessarily providing that the sentencing disparities that result from these programs are warranted and,as such,do not violate a.
at.we therefore reject andújar argument that sentence disparities arising from congressionally sanctioned programs are unwarranted under a.
c.the challenge 
andújar also presents an challenge to programs,contending that even if disparities occasioned by congressionally approved programs are warranted,disparities arising from programs as they are currently implemented are unwarranted because they deviate from congressional intent.specifically,andújar argues that the attorney general decisions to approve and deny applications in individual districts have defied congressional intent.because the attorney general actions are at odds with congressional intent,andújar concludes that the disparities resulting from this system have not in fact been warranted by congress.to our knowledge no other circuit has squarely decided such a claim and the district court did not explicitly address the challenge raised below.
to support his argument that the attorney general has defied congressional intent in its implementation of the programs,andújar marshals substantial statistical evidence,including data prepared by the united states sentencing commission office of policy analysis,to show that the attorney general has approved programs in districts where immigration cases make up a low percentage of the district total caseload and has denied programs to at least one district where they make up a high percentage of the caseload.the sentencing commission office report states that,for that year,sentences accounted for of the national total of terms imposed.they accounted for of the sentences handed down in the southern district of california,in the southern district of texas,and in the district of arizona.however,they accounted for only of the sentences in the western district of washington and in the district of nebraska,both of which maintained programs.see united states sentencing commission,office of policy analysis,datafiles,generally available at compiling annual sentencing statistics and reporting the number of immigration sentences in relation to the number of total sentences in table of each file.in addition,andújar notes that the attorney general denied a program to the district of utah,where immigration cases comprised of the sentences imposed in.id.according to andújar,this data shows that these programs,as regulated by the attorney general,have strayed from the intent of congress as expressed by the house report,which stated that programs be approved for particular classes of offenses such as illegal reentry whose high incidence within a district has imposed an extraordinary strain on the resources of that district as compared to other districts.cong.rec.at daily ed.
in a further attempt to support this argument,andújar compares the number of immigration cases per assistant united states attorney ausa in each district,and finds that these numbers also fail to correlate with the incidence of approval based on these statistics,andújar concludes that programs,as they are implemented currently,deviate from congressional intent,and that they thereby create arbitrary sentence disparities across districts.
the government responds that the statistical relationships cited by andújar present,at best,an incomplete picture of the resource demands imposed by illegal reentry cases on each of the districts studied.when congress authorized the attorney general to approve programs,it did not restrict the criteria for such programs to the mere proportion of each district caseload comprised of immigration cases.instead,it allowed the attorney general to evaluate such factors as the number and type of immigration cases encountered by each district and the quantity and variety of resources each district could marshal in response.see,ashcroft memorandum,at.
andújar statistic of choice is the number of immigration cases as a percentage of total cases within each district.however,this measure of the resource burden resulting from immigration caseloads obscures the fact that different types of cases may require different types and amounts of resources in addition,the statistics dividing immigration cases by the number of ausas lump together attorneys handling civil and criminal cases and do not account for ausas assigned to particular programs,such as the organized crime and drug enforcement task force.even a district with significant personnel can find resources tight when only a small subset of its workforce is available for immigration cases.likewise,a district with a high overall number of immigration cases may possess the resources to manage that caseload without incident,or it may determine that,though stretched,it would rather continue to employ tougher sentences than apply for a program in addition,andújar statistics do not account for sudden influxes of immigration cases.the government notes that,while nebraska is not a border state,it faced a sudden increase in its immigrant population over the relatively short period between and the government thus argues that if andújar statistics were adjusted to account for these distinctions between districts,the seeming anomalies he relies on in labeling interdistrict disparities unwarranted would likely disappear.
we find the government arguments compelling.the text of the feeney amendment requires that programs be established to address extraordinary resource constraints,not typical of most districts,associated with the disproportionately high incidence of illegal reentry or other specific offenses within a particular district cong.rec.at daily ed.although andújar argues otherwise,such judgments regarding resource allocation can rarely be reduced to a single variable or calculation.if they could,congress would have little reason to delegate such decisions to an executive agency,such as the attorney general office.as a product of such delegation,the attorney general decisions regarding questions of implementation and resource allocation deserve significant deference by courts,especially when they address the enforcement of the nation criminal laws.see,united states armstrong,d.we therefore decline to the attorney general methods for determining which districts warrant programs.
andújar raises two additional claims,each challenging the use of programs to obtain comparable sentence and efficiency results.rather than relying on government initiated downward sentence departures,several districts engage in practices,which allow attorneys to reduce the charges filed against an illegal reentry defendant in return for a waiver of certain procedural rights.in the southern district of california,where the first program was established in the,the district attorneys could charge an illegal reentry defendant with one count under a,which carries a maximum sentence,instead of one count under b,which at the time carried a maximum penalty of five or fifteen years,depending on the defendant criminal history.other districts have adopted similar schemes.
first,andújar asserts that these programs were not expressly authorized by congress and,similarly,operate outside the intent of congress.as a result,andújar argues the disparities resulting from such programs are unwarranted.second,andújar argues that these programs,as implemented,have produced sentence reductions greater than those intended by congress and the attorney general.such disparities,therefore,have not been approved by congress and remain unwarranted under a.we address these arguments in turn.
facial challenge 
in pursuing his facial challenge,andújar relies on the text of the protect act and the legislative history highlighting congressional intent,neither of which,he claims,authorized the use of methods to obtain the specific,limited departures congress authorized.essentially,he argues that the failure of congress to include such programs in the text of the statute implies that such programs are per se contrary to congressional intent.
the protect act did not explicitly address the issue of.the decision whether to charge a defendant and,if so,what crime s to charge,traditionally resides with the attorney general and the individual prosecutor.see united states labonte,d t he discretion a prosecutor exercises when he decides what,if any,charges to bring against a criminal suspect is an integral feature of the criminal justice system,and is appropriate,so long as it is not based upon improper factors.bordenkircher hayes,d t he decision whether or not to prosecute,and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury,generally rests entirely in the prosecutor discretion.see also united states rodriguez,cir.as a result,congress and the courts play a minimal role in regulating such charging decisions,despite their inevitable impact on sentencing.wayte united states,d the prosecutor broad discretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly to judicial review.united states smith,cir w e note that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,at the very core of the executive function,has long been held presumptively unreviewable.quoting in re sealed case.the protect act silence on this issue,therefore,is not evidence of congress intent to preclude such programs,at noting that even if the attorney general had not authorized programs under the protect act,prosecutors still would have been free to achieve the same outcomes via the bargaining process.
further,although the protect act does not expressly address programs,there is contemporaneous documentation which indicates that both congress and the attorney general were aware of several programs and approved of them.the house report on the feeney amendment recognized that several districts had already instituted such programs years earlier.see cong.rec.at daily ed.these programs relied on measures.see schendel norris,supra,at.in his memo to the united states attorneys outlining the principles for implementing a program,attorney general john ashcroft specifically referenced programs,noting that,if established,they should also provide for sentencing reductions commensurate with the downward departure system discussed in the memo and the protect act itself.ashcroft memorandum,supra,at.finally,in,deputy attorney general james comey distributed a memo sixteen existing programs,including several that used practices,and confirming the attorney general policy that required districts relying on practices to obtain the approval of the attorney general prior to implementation.comey memorandum,supra,at.the inclusion of this confirmatory language by deputy comey suggests that the attorney general believed,notwithstanding the text of the protect act,that such schemes were within the province of the executive branch and unaffected by the statute.that many programs predated the protect act,and were subsequently authorized by the attorney general after the act passage,further supports the proposition that systems are not at odds with congress directives.see interim report,supra,at noting that some programs involve to restrict the defendant maximum statutory penalty.
finally,andújar argues that even if programs are not per se contrary to congressional intent,many such programs are currently operated outside the bounds of the protect act and,therefore creating unwarranted disparities for purposes of a.specifically,he argues that some programs are at odds with congressional intent because they provide more than a departure from the guidelines.to support this claim,he relies on two items.first,andújar cites the decision in a single district court case,united states,which examined how systems currently operate in many districts.d at the fast track districts that rely on use methodologies that permit far greater sentence reductions tha n contemplated by congress directive in the protect act and the sentencing commission policy statement in.next,he offers the interim staff report on immigration reform and the federal sentencing guidelines,which notes that some programs charge an illegal reentry defendant with two counts of rather than a single count under,which carries a greater penalty interim report,supra,at.a term of months imprisonment under represents an departure for a defendant who otherwise shares the same criminal history and sentencing characteristics as andújar.see ch,pt.a sentencing table.andújar thus argues that disparities resulting from these unauthorized schemes are clearly unwarranted.
in the face of andújar evidence on this point,the district court declined to find that programs in districts had produced sentences outside the parameters set by congress.we agree with the district court decision.when a party contests a sentence based on the failure of the court to consider a specific factor,that party must provide the factual basis for its argument,at.this obligation is most significant when the party has raised an challenge,which necessarily requires a concrete and developed factual record for the court to consider.see sam ali,ohio of liquor control,cir declining consideration of an,statutory challenge because the plaintiffs had failed to develop a sufficient factual record mcguire reilly,cir noting,in the context of the first amendment,that plaintiffs remain free to challenge the act,as applied,in a concrete factual setting emphasis added carey wolnitzek,kkc,slip op.at,wl,rejecting an challenge because the factual basis of plaintiff claim remained speculative.
as the government notes,andújar sole evidence that these programs operate outside the bounds of the protect act was a government submission in another case in another district,stating that,by their terms,programs can lead to a sentence reduction greater than the four levels specifically authorized by congress in the protect act.andújar provided no evidence that has,in fact,resulted in any sentence reduction equivalent to a five level departure or more in any particular case.moreover,the government notes that the ashcroft memorandum specifically provides that programs should provide for sentencing reductions that are commensurate with the reduction authorized under.ashcroft memorandum,supra,at.without evidence that prosecutors in individual districts have deviated from this requirement,andújar argument that programs result in unwarranted sentence disparities must fail,and we need not address whether such outcomes would constitute unwarranted disparities under a.
moreover,even if we agreed with the premise of andújar programs fall outside the parameters of the protect fail to see how his argument justifies the remedy he seeks.that is,we do not believe that the appropriate response to unauthorized prosecutorial action in some districts is to require judges in other districts to consider ad hoc downward variances that would equalize sentences at the level resulting from the unauthorized actions.see,at,a llowing sentencing courts to determine whether they should sentence defendants as if they had been would produce unwarranted sentence disparities between similarly situated defendants,some of whom would benefit from the existence of others deals and some of whom would not.to find otherwise would be to allow judges to ignore the decisions of united states attorneys and the attorney general to not have such a program in a specific district and to disregard congressional intent on the proper scope of such programs.see albert llosas barrueco,united states booker why judges should not fix fast track disparities.pub.int,j udges are to impose fast track programs by judicial mandate.such decisions have the inescapable result of invading the province of the prosecutor by delivering the discretion to charge and establish enforcement policies into the hands of judges.if congress agrees with andújar criticism of the regime as applied,it is in the best position to reshape the system.
equal protection 
andújar also argues that sentence disparities violate his constitutional right to equal protection under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.while our review of constitutional claims is generally plenary,united states proctor,cir,we review only for plain error because andújar raises this argument for the first time on appeal.see united states olano,d.
andújar cites no case law in support of his equal protection claim any error,therefore,could not qualify as plain.see id.at.moreover,he has failed to show any constitutional deficiency.because his challenge does not implicate a suspect class,andújar must show that there is no rational basis for the legislated this case between the treatment of illegal reentry defendants in districts and of similar defendants in massachusetts.naeem gonzales,cir citing heller doe,d.where,as here,congress has made its purpose explicit,andújar must show the statutory purpose has been implemented in a manner so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.andújar has failed to meet these burdens.
indeed,we have already denied a claim presenting a facial equal protection attack on programs,at concluding that the incidence of programs in some states and not others could rationally be related to different incidences of crime across districts,different prosecutorial needs,or a determination that the absence of such a program increases deterrence.we believe that these justifications apply with equal strength in this case.further,for the same reasons we rejected andújar challenge to disparities,we find that such programs have not been implemented in a manner that is so attenuated as to render the congressionally established distinction arbitrary or irrational.cleburne,at.we conclude,therefore,that programs,as applied,are rationally related to the congressional goal of protecting prosecutorial resources.
we may quickly dispatch andújar claim that is no longer persuasive precedent.we rejected a similar argument in united states,at whatever the continuing validity of,we have previously held that we are bound to follow it until it is expressly overruled.citation omitted,and have since repeated that conclusion many times.see,united states shoup,cir united states coplin,cir united states peralta,cir.we find nothing new in andújar argument that requires us to reopen this issue.
although the court uses the term departure in reference to the defendant request for a sentence,in fact the defendant was requesting a variance.the distinction between departures and variances is a product of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,which made the sentencing guidelines advisory rather than mandatory.courts may still justify sentences outside the recommended guidelines range by reference to guidelines departure provisions.when a court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range based on its assessment of the section a regard to specific guidelines departure deviation is considered a variance.
a b generally prohibit the crime of illegal reentry.section b imposes additional penalties for the illegal reentry offense based on the prior criminal history of the defendant.section b applies additional penalties to an individual whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs,crimes against the person,or both,or a felony other than an aggravated felony and b applies to an individual whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.in,congress increased the maximum penalties for violations of b and b from and years to and years,respectively.
the sentencing commission complied,establishing,which mirrored the protect act language.section reads upon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court.
although this is a house report only,the feeney amendment was itself narrowed by the conference committee,with the portion addressing programs remaining in the final signed version.see stephanie bibas,the feeney amendment and the continuing rise of prosecutorial power to plea bargain.criminology.
among these requirements,a defendant must agree to accept the factual basis of the charge against him,forgo filing motions described in federal rule of criminal procedure b,waive appeal and waive collateral challenges under except on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.memorandum from john ashcroft,attorney general,to united states attorneys september,reprinted in fed.sent.hereinafter ashcroft memorandum.

moreover,defendant overstates his argument.even before the adoption of the protect act,congress had determined that sentencing disparities are warranted in some circumstances to address government resources and administrative concerns.for example,where the government finds that a specific defendant has assisted in other prosecutions,saving the prosecuting attorneys time and resources,congress has explicitly allowed a departure from the statutorily required minimum sentence.e upon motion of the government,the district court s shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.see,at.

reflecting this variety,a report of the sentencing commission stated that,in addition to the illegal reentry programs noted above,the districts of arizona,southern california,new mexico,southern texas and western texas had approved programs for transportation and harboring cases arizona had a program specifically for alien baby child smuggling,and northern georgia and southern florida had programs for fraudulent immigration document cases.see united states sentencing comm n,interim staff report on immigration reform and the federal sentencing guidelines,available at hereinafter interim report.
