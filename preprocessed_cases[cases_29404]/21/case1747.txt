this case arises out of the brutal shooting of patricia capozzalo capozzalo,whose brother,peter chiodo chiodo,was a member of the luchese crime family and was suspected by other members of cooperating with a government investigation.the,robert spinelli spinelli,is the brother of michael spinelli michael,who served in chiodo crew and sometimes acted as his bodyguard.because spinelli drove a second getaway car for the perpetrators of capozzalo shooting,a jury convicted spinelli of conspiracy to murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a of assault with a dangerous weapon,in violation of a of conspiracy to tamper with a witness,in violation of and of witness tampering,in violation of a a.the district court dearie,sentenced spinelli to months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment.
on appeal,spinelli argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his brother,who was convicted of the same charges as spinelli,as well as on two counts of using a firearm during a crime of violence and that his own sentence was improperly enhanced for committing a crime involving permanent or bodily injury,in light of the fact that the victim sustained only minor physical injuries in the murder attempt.we affirm the judgment of conviction,but vacate and remand for resentencing.
background 
on may,after his fellow luchese crime family members came to believe erroneously that he was cooperating with the government,peter chiodo was assaulted and shot thirteen times.family member richard pagliarulo pagliarulo,a member of chiodo crew,assigned the shooters and replaced chiodo as captain after the murder attempt.subsequently,pagliarulo and an associate warned chiodo through his attorney that chiodo wife would be killed if he cooperated with the government investigation.they also advised chiodo father to warn chiodo that his whole family would be assassinated if he cooperated.chiodo nevertheless decided to cooperate with the government.while most of his family was relocated under the federal witness protection program,his sister patricia capozzalo declined to join them.later,her husband was advised to abandon the job chiodo had found for him at a warehouse,and the family considered moving as a precaution.but,after some time away,they decided to return to their home.
four months after the attempt on his life,chiodo testified against several organized crime members who were on trial for corruption in new york window replacement industry.pagliarulo and michael sent individuals to monitor his testimony,and attempted to unearth information to discredit chiodo.in early,chiodo was scheduled to testify in additional trials,including that of luchese family boss vittorio vic amuso amuso.around this time,pagliarulo asked crew members for capozzalo address and physical description.michael told dino basciano basciano,another crew member,to expect to be asked to kill someone.pagliarulo later told basciano that the target was capozzalo,and that amuso had approved the hit.pagliarulo apparently gave michael the task of selecting the crew members who would carry out the murder,and michael assigned his brother,spinelli,to drive a second,or switch,getaway car.the crew members planned to use so that michael could signal spinelli that the hit had occurred and that they were on their way to his getaway car.spinelli secured the getaway car,but did not participate in the group surveillance of capozzalo,or in the procurement of firearms.
the group made two unsuccessful attempts to carry out the hit in the first,as they approached capozzalo car,a girl came out of a nearby house,and michael radioed spinelli that the hit was off.the second attempt was also foiled by the arrival on the scene of a potential witness.then,on march,as capozzalo returned home from driving her children to school,michael blocked her car with his van while basciano walked to the driver side of capozzalo car and fired two shots through the window.the gun adaptor apparently disintegrated,causing the gun to begin to fall apart.basciano fired additional shots and then jumped into the van.though capozzalo was able to duck under her dashboard,one bullet lodged in her neck and another ricocheted off her back.she was treated at vincent medical center at richmond,where the bullet was dislodged and she received three sutures for a minor wound behind her ear.remarkably,tests revealed no internal injuries or other physical harm,and capozzalo was released after only a couple of days in the hospital.
as michael and basciano made their escape,michael apparently radioed spinelli that they were on their way to him.they got into spinelli getaway car and drove to michael house.spinelli took the guns,ski masks,and other items used in the crime to his sister house and disposed of the switch car.they only learned later that capozzalo had survived the attack.
michael and robert spinelli were indicted together,and were scheduled to be tried together.prior to trial,spinelli made a motion for severance.michael submitted an affidavit to the court supporting his brother request.in this statement,michael swore that he had been advised by counsel that in a joint trial,he should invoke his fifth amendment privilege not to testify.if,however,the brothers were tried separately,michael averred,he would waive the privilege and testify that robert spinelli played no role in connection with the shooting of patricia capozzalo.his affidavit concluded,if the court grants a severance,and allows me to be tried first,i fully intend to testify on robert spinelli behalf at his trial.
spinelli also submitted a memorandum of law in support of his motion for severance.he argued that the availability of michael exculpatory testimony was conditioned upon separate trials for the two brothers that michael testimony would not be cumulative since the evidence against spinelli was minimal that neither trial was expected to last more than one or two weeks,rendering concerns about judicial economy inapposite and that michael testimony would not be subject to substantial impeachment.spinelli motion for severance was denied.
at trial,basciano testified that pagliarulo had ordered the shooting of capozzalo,and that basciano and michael gathered a group together to carry out the hit.he added that jody calabrese and gregory cappello carried weapons and drove the first car.according to basciano,michael selected his brother to drive the second,or switch,car unarmed.basciano also testified about the numerous violent crimes in which he had participated as a member of the luchese crime family,including an aborted murder attempt involving michael,cappello,and calabrese.
capozzalo testified about the events leading up to the shooting,and described the shooting itself.she was unable to identify any of the perpetrators.dino marino,a luchese family associate,testified to michael involvement in physical assaults on union officials,and described his own participation in murders and attempting killings.marino also testified that spinelli worked at a legitimate construction job.
in exchange for leniency,luchese family member frank gioia testified about prison conversations he had had with the spinelli brothers while the brothers were incarcerated on unrelated charges.gioia testified that michael told him details about the capozzalo shooting,including the fact that spinelli was involved.michael apparently complained to gioia that,despite michael key role in the attempt on capozzalo life,he had not been inducted into the luchese family.the family indicated to michael through intermediaries that they were interested in inducting him,and also apparently arranged to pay his attorneys fees to discourage him from cooperating with the government.michael eventually was inducted into the luchese family by an underboss while in prison.spinelli allegedly told gioia that michael had been seduced into participating in the capozzalo hit because of the alluring possibility of joining the luchese family as a made member.spinelli said that it was this desire on michael part that had led to the brothers involvement in the capozzalo shooting.spinelli added that he feared that eventually we going to get indicted.also according to gioia testimony,michael had been given the opportunity to plead guilty to the capozzalo shooting and receive less jail time,but luchese bosses convinced him not to include that crime in his plea agreement.
spinelli called no witnesses in his defense.michael called two himself,and scott konop.before michael testified,spinelli again moved for a severance.the judge expressed bemusement at this motion,noting that spinelli prior motion for severance was premised solely on the necessity from spinelli point of view of getting michael to testify,an event that was now about to occur despite the lack of a severance.the judge again denied spinelli motion.
in his testimony,michael admitted to a variety of criminal activities,including murder,extortion,assaults,and drug dealing,but denied involvement in the capozzalo shooting.twice,during,he was asked about uncharged acts of murder allegedly committed by spinelli.when the prosecutor asked michael whether he had recruited his brother and others to carry out the capozzalo attack,michael declined to answer scott konop,who was incarcerated for cocaine trafficking,testified on michael behalf that basciano had confessed to konop that he and a sal romano had carried out the capozzalo shooting.
after less than a day of deliberation,the jury convicted the spinelli brothers on all counts.the presentence investigation report psr recommended a sentence of between and months for spinelli,a figure that included a recommended enhancement for a crime involving permanent or bodily injury.the psr noted that capozzalo suffers from stress disorder ptsd,and that she and her family continue to suffer from the severing of ties to their extended families and the stresses associated with entering the witness protection program and assuming new identities in new locales in a letter to the district court,spinelli counsel countered the enhancement recommendation,arguing that the injuries sustained by capozzalo warranted only a enhancement for serious bodily injury.
at spinelli sentencing,the district court agreed with the probation department that a enhancement was appropriate.on the issue of whether or not the adjustment for permanent or injury was correct,the judge stated,in my view,without hesitation,it was.he continued 
it would strike me as being peculiar indeed to have this woman shot in the head and shot in the back,who by act of god or some other fortuitous hand did not die,who continues to this day to suffer the consequences of her injuries,to a certain degree physically but perhaps even more so emotionally,that this woman did not sustain permanent injury.no doubt in my mind about it.
in a subsequent hearing,judge dearie reconsidered the issue but reached the same conclusion.he noted that spinelli attorney had made a persuasive argument that the second circuit may agree with i do.i think in most cases the injury itself will resolve the problem,the issue.in this case,i do think so.he went on 
here we have an instance,a very unusual case where a woman is shot at range,once in the back,once in the head.and admittedly,neither one of those bullets by itself does any serious damage to the woman body,much less itself pose a serious risk to her life,that is to say the result of the action taken.
but the definition,curiously reads permanent or bodily injury means injury involving a substantial risk of death,as opposed to resulting in a substantial risk of death.
if someone is shot by an automatic weapon that fortunately for her broke apart,and by dint of circumstances,call it act of god or the hand of god,as it may well have been,is spared any serious physical injury in one sense,i think that that injury involved a substantial risk of death 
i must say if we going to read this definition in a manner that is literal and limited to the injury in fact definition which works in most cases,i would say this.it would be an absurd result although i never one for leaping at opportunities to upwardly depart,that what i could do directly,if indeed that was the definition,should be done indirectly,because why should michael and robert spinelli in effect reap the harvest of the hand of god,to use the metaphor that being used here 
at the sentencing hearing,spinelli counsel attempted to depict the defendant as a victim of his brother criminal scheming,who was led astray by his admiration for michael and was vulnerable to evil influences in part because of his low.the government responded that spinelli had earned a high school equivalency diploma while in prison belying low intelligence,that he had been involved in other criminal activity including a marijuana conspiracy and a series of robberies of elderly individuals,and that he had sought to gain from michael elevation to the status of a made member of the luchese family.spinelli attorney also argued that spinelli had no knowledge of the specifics of the plot to murder capozzalo rather,she contended,he was brought in to drive the switch car at the last minute.finally,she argued that spinelli family has two sons,then aged and,whose mother was unavailable to care for work in favor of a lesser sentence.
taking these factors into account,judge dearie characterized spinelli role in the capozzalo attempted murder as relatively minor,warranting a role adjustment.because of his lesser level of culpability,and given his low and his relationship with his older brother,the judge downwardly departed further,and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment.
discussion 
motions for severance 
as written at the time of spinelli sentencing,federal rule of criminal procedure permitted a district court to grant a severance of defendants if it appear ed that a defendant was prejudiced by a joinder of defendants for trial together.the decision to grant or deny severance is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.united states blount,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in order to overturn a district court denial of a severance motion,we must conclude that the joint trial resulted in substantial prejudice to the appellant.see united states stirling,cir.indeed,such decisions can be reversed only if a defendant can show prejudice so severe that his conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice and that the denial of his motion constituted an abuse of discretion.united states diaz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is not enough to demonstrate that separate trials would have increased the chances of the appellant acquittal,see united states burke,cir rather,the appellant must show prejudice so severe as to amount to a denial of a constitutionally fair trial,united states serpoosh,cir.
considerations of efficiency and consistency militate in favor of trying jointly defendants who were indicted together,as the spinelli brothers were.see united states feyrer,cir citing zafiro united states,d.joint trials are often particularly appropriate in circumstances where the defendants are charged with participating in the same criminal conspiracy,as is the case here.united states salameh,cir per curiam noting that spillover prejudice is unlikely in cases where defendants are charged in same conspiracy.
spinelli argues that the joint trial with his brother resulted in substantial prejudice,because testimony from prosecution witnesses related in graphic detail michael spinelli violent and murderous criminal history,a history robert spinelli does not share because the evidence against spinelli himself was less than overwhelming,especially when compared to the voluminous proof of michael guilt because michael testimony on his own behalf reinforced the perfidy of michael crimes,did not refute spinelli role in the capozzalo shooting,and exposed the jury to would not have been admissible at a separate spinelli involvement in other violent acts and because the jury heard frank gioia testimony that michael told him that spinelli was involved in the crime and this evidence would not have been admissible had spinelli been tried alone.
the defendant arguments are,however,unavailing.d iffering levels of culpability and proof are inevitable in any trial and,standing alone,are insufficient grounds for separate trials.united states carson,cir.even joint trials involving defendants who are only marginally involved alongside those heavily involved are constitutionally permissible.united states locascio,cir.there are,of course,cases in which the sheer volume and magnitude of the evidence against one defendant so dwarfs the proof presented against his that a severance is required to prevent unacceptable spillover prejudice.but the case before us is not such a case.this is especially so since the district court explicitly instructed the jury to consider the defendants individually see united states miller,cir noting that spillover prejudice may be remedied through clear judicial instructions.
as the government points out,much of the evidence about michael crimes would have been admissible at a separate trial of spinelli,since it was relevant to proving the nature and scope of the conspiracy in which both were,to differing degrees,involved.moreover,even the fact that evidence may be admissible against one defendant but not another does not necessarily require a severance.carson,at.here,the defendant has not shown that otherwise inadmissible evidence about his brother crimes,or the questions briefly raised about his own prior criminal activities,resulted in substantial prejudice 
finally,the defendant argues that his brother refusal to answer questions about spinelli involvement in the shooting was prejudicial to spinelli case.the appellant original motion for severance similarly was premised upon michael likely invocation of fifth amendment privilege and his resulting inability to offer presumably exculpatory testimony on spinelli behalf.michael had offered to testify to spinelli innocence,but only if spinelli were tried separately and subsequently.we have,however,noted that such conditional offers smack of bad faith.united states bari,cir.and we are not convinced that michael was significantly hampered in testifying for spinelli,had he wished to do so,by the lack of a severance.
all in all,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant motions for severance.
enhancement for permanent or bodily injury 
the sentencing guideline applicable to crimes involving attempted murder provides for a enhancement if the victim sustained permanent or bodily injury,and a enhancement if the victim sustained serious bodily injury.b.definitions for those terms are found in the commentary to.the commentary defines permanent or bodily injury as injury involving a substantial risk of death loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent it further specifies that i n the case of a kidnapping,for example,maltreatment to a degree,by denial of food or medical care would constitute bodily injury,cmt.h.the commentary defines serious bodily injury as an injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation,cmt.j.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,and its interpretation of the guidelines de novo.see united states maaraki,cir per curiam.
the district court offered alternative theories in support of its application of a enhancement.in his initial consideration of the psr recommendation,judge dearie emphasized the permanent nature of capozzalo emotional injury.upon reconsideration,the judge also referred to the circumstances to which capozzalo was subjected,and emphasized the sheer good fortune that had prevented her death.the government argues that the district court imposition of the enhancement was appropriate under either of these rationales.the defendant,instead,contends that because the victim escaped with minor physical injuries of a temporary nature,only a enhancement for serious bodily injury is appropriate.
we agree with the defendant that the sentencing enhancements apply to the results of a crime,rather than to the circumstances of its commission.in remanding for resentencing,however,we emphasize that emotional injury can result in loss or substantial impairment of the function of a mental faculty that is sufficient to warrant a enhancement.the issue before the district court,on remand,is whether capozzalo suffered such a loss or impairment.
the threshold question presented by this case is whether the sentencing enhancements at issue should depend solely upon the results of the criminal act,or,alternatively,at least in some extreme and unusual situations,can reflect the defendant conduct,the circumstances surrounding the crime,or the nature of the crime attempted.at least two circuits that have considered this question have unequivocally held that the resulting injury to the victim is the sole determinant of whether these enhancements are justified.see united states dodson,cir it is not the defendant conduct which determines whether a victim has sustained bodily injury rather,the resultant physical injury is the determining factor.united states perkins,cir t he enhancement for causing bodily injury is premised upon a particular result,not the defendant conduct.it penalizes the defendant based on the severity of the outcome 
we believe that these circuits have correctly interpreted the guidelines.since,for example,attempted murders are,by definition,to consider the defendant conduct or the intended result of his actions could subject every attempted murder to the enhancement,regardless of the injuries actually suffered by the victim.but the guidelines clearly contemplate various levels of enhancement for attempted indeed no enhancement at all.it follows that a focus on results is virtually compelled by the guidelines structure.
finally,neither the language of the guidelines nor of the commentary suggests that the defendant conduct or the circumstances surrounding the crime are relevant to the enhancements applicability.of course,the defendant intentions and actions are not off limits to judges making sentencing decisions.indeed,other provisions of the guidelines expressly allow for adjustments based on these factors.see,enhancement for hate crime motivation enhancement for a felony that was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism enhancement for defendants who abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.but the particular sentencing enhancements before us are differently written and are,on their face,made clearly dependent on the resulting injuries to the victim.
the second important question raised by this case concerns whether and to what extent the enhancement for permanent or bodily injury applies to crimes in which the victim has suffered only emotional injury.in sentencing spinelli,judge dearie emphasized the permanence of the emotional harm that the defendant crime had inflicted on capozzalo.the defense argues that even if an enhancement for serious bodily injury may properly encompass the emotional wounds suffered by a victim like capozzalo,a enhancement requires a showing that the victim mental faculties were impaired as a result of the crime.
the emotional agony suffered by victims of violent crime eludes precise measurement and often defies description.there is no question that emotional or psychological injuries can be permanent or,and that they may,in some instances,cause the loss or substantial impairment of the function of a mental faculty.courts that have considered the applicability of the permanent or and serious bodily injury sentencing enhancements to emotional or psychological injuries have interpreted bodily injury to include harm to a victim mental processes and psychic.any suggestion,then,that this sentencing enhancement applies only in cases of corporeally manifest physical injury is untenable.united states jacobs,cir noting that guidelines treat physical and injuries with comparable seri
