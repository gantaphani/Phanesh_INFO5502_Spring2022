this case raises an issue of first impression for this court the scope of the supreme court holding in scheidler national org.for women,d scheidler ii in which the supreme court tightened the requirements for finding that a defendant has committed extortion under the hobbs act.on appeal,the gotti,richard gotti,anthony sonny ciccone,and richard that scheidler ii invalidates all of the hobbs act counts in this case that were premised on the extortion of intangible property rights.we hold,however,that scheidler ii did not invalidate the challenged extortion counts at issue in this case,because scheidler from holding that a hobbs act extortion could not be premised on the extortion of intangible property clarified that for hobbs act liability to attach,there must be a showing that the defendant did not merely seek to deprive the victim of the property right in question,but also sought to obtain that right for himself.that standard,which can be satisfied regardless of whether the property right at issue is tangible or intangible,has been met by each of the hobbs act counts at issue here.we also reject the numerous other challenges brought by the to their convictions.finally,with regard to the sentences,we remand ciccone and bondi cases for resentencing pursuant to united states fagans,cir,and we remand peter gotti case for consideration of resentencing pursuant to united states crosby,cir we also reject the argument advanced in the government that the district court erred when,in sentencing peter gotti under the sentencing guidelines,it declined to impose a leadership role enhancement upon him despite its finding that he had served as acting boss of the gambino organized crime family of la cosa nostra the gambino family.

tolan further testified that after express scripts refused to allow an audit that the mila trustees wanted,mila began using exclusively,both north and south of the virginia border.tr.tolan stated that he did not consider,because it was more expensive than other service providers.tr.in june of,requested a dollar annual fee increase,at which point tolan decided to have the mila consultants initiate a new round of bidding for the contract.tr.after the bids came in,came in second place in first place was advance pcs,a pharmaceutical benefit provider whose bid was million cheaper than that submitted by.tr.although all the trustees then initially agreed to award the contract to advance pcs,the union trustees subsequently changed their position and sought to impose two conditions on advance pcs.tr.advance pcs agreed to the conditions,but the union trustees still refused to support it,and brought a motion to continue using.tr.at that point,the management trustees submitted the matter to binding arbitration,and the arbitrator ultimately ruled in favor of advance pcs.tr.thus,ultimately held the lucrative pharmaceutical services contract from approximately to.
the government also adduced evidence that helped to explain why certain ila trustees had been such strong supporters of,notwithstanding its higher rates ciccone had so ordered.barone testified that vincent nasso was a gambino family associate who paid kickbacks to ciccone out of the contract proceeds.tr.moreover,after becoming the president of local in august of,became a mila testified that he was informed that sonny ciccone was interested in vincent nasso,keeping the gpp in place.tr.he stated that sonny himself told me to keep him abreast of it.tr.scollo further testified that when advance pcs emerged as a strong challenger in,cassarino instructed ciccone,make sure you do all you can to help gpp.tr.scollo responded,i do the best i can,but i think it too far gone.tr.scollo testified that he did not reveal ciccone connection with nasso to any of the other mila trustees or members.tr.

the gambling counts 
these counts alleged that certain defendants,including ciccone and bondi,had run an illegal bookmaking business as well as an illegal gambling operation.indictment.the bookmaking charge rested on the allegation that ciccone,bondi,and other gambino family had run the new york operation of the costa pelican sports bookmaking business from approximately september,to december.the charge rested on the allegation that several defendants,including ciccone and bondi,had operated a gambling business that employed electronic gambling devices,including those placed at café roma.
a.the bookmaking charges 
at trial,with regard to the bookmaking charges,the government adduced evidence that numerous bondi and ciccone as well as defendants cassarino,brancato,malara,orsino,and collectively run the new york operation of the pelican sports bookmaking business.this evidence included various wiretapped conversations that indicated the respective roles of bondi and ciccone in the operation.as to bondi,the wiretaps indicated that he participated in paying winning bettors,collecting from losing bettors,and freezing bettors who owed money.indeed,in one conversation between bondi and cassarino,bondi reported that they had to freeze a particular bettor,stating,he do have it till wednesday so he froze.gov t exh.cassarino responded,w hat is he,what is he up,up or minus that the important part before you freeze him if he up,you do want to freeze him.id.bondi responded,alright,well let me call,i call him right,then i call you back.id.approximately six minutes later,bondi called back to report that the bettor was minus,to which cassarino replied,good.freeze it.gov t exh.similarly,in a conversation between cassarino and lisi,the men discussed the need to talk to richie bondi about a bettor who wanted to straighten out now,so he could play tonight.gov t exh.
the wiretap evidence also indicated that ciccone acted as the ultimate supervisor of the bookmaking business,with cassarino reporting directly to him.in several wiretapped conversations between cassarino and ciccone,cassarino provided an update as to the various business developments.on october,cassarino reported to ciccone,w e had a decent fuckin week.gov t exh.ciccone asked,how many guys are bettin id.cassarino responded about ah thirty thirty guys but see one guy we got on commission one guy,in other words,one,one guy is on a forty percent sheet the kid jerome orsino we get all his players instead of givin him sheet we givin him forty percent.id.ciccone replied,now you gon na give him thirty.id.cassarino replied,cut him down to thirty,yeah come down thirty he do us a favor do worry about it.id.

b.the charges 
on the charges,the government presented evidence at trial that ciccone,bondi,and other had run a gambling operation using electronic gambling machines at a number of locations,including café roma.in addition to alayev testimony about the defendants having forced him to install gambling machines at café roma,the government also introduced the testimony of various law enforcement officials.for example,detective paul grzegorski of the new york city police department testified that on august,he observed bondi entering frank sal hair stylists in brooklyn,going over to a gambling device located therein,opening the device with a key,and removing the currency from the device.tr.when asked to describe the device,detective grzegorski stated,you put money into it and you bet credits and you play the credits and you get basically what is called extended play.if you win,you get additional credits and you can get paid off on those credits.tr.detective grzegorski further stated that after observing this,he stopped bondi as he was exiting the shop and placed him under arrest.tr.he then searched bondi and found on his person a list of locations with gambling devices.tr.detective martin provided additional testimony as to how the gambling devices in question worked you insert a sum of currency into the machine,you receive credits for your currency,and you play those credits,and during that course of the game you play the credits until you win a game,if it is cherries,bells,plums,whatever it may be.tr.
the witness tampering count 
this count alleged that certain defendants,including ciccone,had tampered with a witness in this case before it went to trial.indictment.that witness was bondi stepson,anthony frazetta,whom the government had served with a grand jury subpoena.
at trial,the government adduced wiretap evidence indicating that in a february,conversation between ciccone,bondi,and primo cassarino,ciccone said the following about frazetta this fucking joe,i do know where the fuck his mentality is.if,if,if you start to answer and they can ask you everything and anything every fucking thing has got nine fucking questions.you know what i saying he goes,so how you get this job it was my father,my father.who is your father friend sonny ciccone he taking the f ifth.i do want to hear it.gov t exh.when cassarino indicated that frazetta had apparently provided some information already,ciccone responded,yeah,but why,but he opened up a pandora box.cause they ask you one question,they ask you another.id.
on february,frazetta lawyer advised the government by letter that frazetta would assert his fifth amendment privilege against.on february,when frazetta was scheduled to appear before the grand jury,cassarino commented to ciccone,t hat kid is going there today.gov t exh.the next day,ciccone asked cassarino,how richie kid do gov t exh.cassarino reported that there had been some uncertainty as to whether the court would accept frazetta letter asserting the privilege,and that apparently frazetta would have to return in person.id.cassarino noted that he had told bondi that frazetta shoulda went there with the lawyer and fucking hand in the letter.if they accept it,they accept it they do accept it,you there.id.ciccone replied,that was stupid,what the lawyer did.he shoulda made him go there anyway.id.cassarino reiterated just go in there,do what you got ta do,and get the fuck out that all,you take the f ifth and that it.goodbye.id.ciccone agreed that the end of it.id.

ii.challenges by the defendants to their convictions 
a.the defendants challenge under scheidler national organization for women,d scheidler ii 
the first argue that numerous extortion counts in the indictment became invalid upon the issuance of scheidler ii,which was decided by the supreme court on february,just as the trial in this case was concluding.for ciccone and bondi,who were charged with and convicted of multiple hobbs act extortion counts both as separate offenses and as rico predicates,as set forth in detail above,this argument goes to their actual convictions.for peter gotti and richard gotti,this is a sentencing issue they were not charged with extortion,but the extortion counts included in the indictment were considered by the district judge as relevant uncharged conduct under the sentencing guidelines when imposing their sentences.
it is undisputed that we evaluate the legal issues of whether the indictment properly charged hobbs act extortion and whether the district court correctly charged the jury on these counts under a de novo standard.in assessing these issues,we begin by discussing scheidler i and analyzing its scope.we then apply our interpretation of scheidler ii to each of the challenged extortion counts in this case,and ultimately conclude that each of them can stand.
the scheidler ii decision 
scheidler ii,as set forth below,tightened the requirements for finding that a defendant has committed extortion under the hobbs act.to appreciate the significance of scheidler ii,it is therefore necessary to begin with the text of the hobbs act,upon which the challenged extortion counts here rested.it provides 
whoever in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do,or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years,or both.
a emphasis added.the hobbs act further defines extortion as 
the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.
b emphasis added.
before scheidler ii,this circuit and others had interpreted the phrase the obtaining of property from another quite broadly,in two key respects property had been held to encompass intangible as well as tangible property rights and obtaining had been held to encompass cases where the defendant caused a loss of or interference to the victim property rights,even though the defendant had not actually sought to exercise those property rights for himself or herself.clear examples of these two propositions can be found in our precedents.
as to the first,the expansive interpretation of property our circuit decision in united states tropiano,cir,stands as an early landmark case.the tropiano defendants were partners in a garbage collection company who were displeased when a new competitor,caron refuse removal,caron,started soliciting business in their vicinity and taking away some of their customers.id.at.they then used threats of violence to force caron to stop recruiting their customers and to agree not to solicit any business in the area.id.on appeal,this court upheld the tropiano defendants hobbs act extortion convictions,rejecting their argument that nothing more than the right to do business in the milford area was surrendered by caron and that such a right was not property obtained by the appellants.id.at.we explained 
the concept of property under the hobbs act,as devolved from its legislative history and numerous decisions,is not limited to physical or tangible property or things but includes,in a broad sense,any valuable right considered as a source or element of wealth and does not depend upon a direct benefit being conferred on the person who obtains the property.
obviously,caron had a right to solicit business from anyone in any area without any territorial restrictions by the appellants and only by the exercise of such a right could caron obtain customers whose accounts were admittedly valuable.some indication of the value of the right to solicit customers appears from the fact that when the tropiano defendants company accounts were sold for,the agreement obtained from caron not to solicit those customers was valued at an additional caron right to solicit accounts in milford,connecticut constituted property within the hobbs act definition.
id.at internal citations omitted.more recently,this circuit similarly held that t he right of the members of a union to democratic participation in a union election is property that the right is intangible does not divest it of protection under the hobbs act,and on that basis,crime families who sought to replace control of the union could be found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion.united states bellomo,cir.
as for the second proposition the expansive interpretation of obtaining,in united states arena,cir,this court a case involving protestors who tried to shut down a the obtaining prong of the hobbs act definition of extortion was satisfied in cases where an extortionist used violence to force his victim to abandon the property rights in question,even though the extortionist was not seeking to exercise those property rights for himself.the arena court explained that where the property in question is the victim right to conduct a business free from threats of violence and physical harm,a person who has committed or threatened violence or physical harm in order to induce abandonment of that right has obtained,or attempted to obtain,property within the meaning of the hobbs act.id.at.
this second proposition was evaluated by the supreme court in scheidler ii,which implicated facts similar to those in arena.in scheidler ii,the defendants were protestors who had attempted to shut down abortion clinics.at.the plaintiffs argued that these defendants by using or threatening to use force,violence,or fear to cause respondents to give up property rights,namely,a woman right to seek medical service from a clinic,the right of the doctors,nurses,or other clinic staff to perform their jobs,and the right of the clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats,violence,coercion,and fear had committed extortion under the hobbs act.id.at.the seventh circuit agreed,stating that the defendants assert that,even if property was involved,the defendants did not obtain that property they merely forced the plaintiffs to part with it but this argument is contrary to a long line of precedent in this circuit.org.for women,scheidler,cir.
the supreme court reversed.initially,the court noted that on appeal,the respondents had shifted the thrust of their theory with regard to precisely which property rights had been extorted from them.scheidler ii,at.it stated that although the respondents had argued below that the extorted property rights were those of the women and the clinics to receive and perform medical services,they 
now assert that petitioners violated the hobbs act by seeking to get control of the use and disposition of respondents property.they argue that because the right to control the use and disposition of an asset is property,petitioners,who interfered with,and in some instances completely disrupted,the ability of the clinics to function,obtained or attempted to obtain respondents property.
the united states offers a view similar to that of respondents,asserting that where the property at issue is a business intangible right to exercise exclusive control over the use of its assets,a defendant obtained that property by obtaining control over the use of those assets.
id.internal citations omitted alteration and emphasis in original.
the court then concluded that even this revised construction was inconsistent with the hobbs act explicit reference to obtaining of property from another,b.see id.at.it stated that 
w e need not now trace what are the boundaries of extortion liability under the hobbs act,so that liability might be based on obtaining something as intangible as another right to exercise exclusive control over the use of a party business assets whatever the outer boundaries may be,the effort to characterize petitioners actions here as an obtaining of property from respondents is well beyond them.
id.the court went on to state that the protesters had neither 
pursued nor received something of value from respondents that they could exercise,transfer,or sell.to conclude that such actions constituted extortion would effectively discard the statutory requirement that property must be obtained from another,replacing it instead with the notion that merely interfering with or depriving someone of property is sufficient to constitute extortion.
id.at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the court also explained that such a construction would eliminate the distinction between extortion and the separate crime of coercion the crime of coercion,which more accurately describes the nature of petitioners actions,involves the use of force or threat of force to restrict another freedom of action.id.the court found it telling that in drafting the hobbs act,congress had specifically included extortion as a hobbs act violation,while not including coercion.id.at.the court concluded that b ecause the protestors did not obtain or attempt to obtain property from respondents,there was no basis upon which to find that they committed extortion under the hobbs act.id.at.
justice stevens,the lone dissenter,protested that the scheidler ii majority murky opinion seems to hold that this phrase the obtaining of property from another covers nothing more than the acquisition of tangible property,and that n o other federal court has ever construed this statute so narrowly.id.at.stevens,dissenting.in other words,justice stevens argued that scheidler ii had struck down not only the second proposition the expansive definition of obtaining but also the first proposition the expansive definition of property.id.at.
the majority opinion,however,expressly disclaimed the notion that it swept so broadly.indeed,in addition to stating that it need not now trace what are the outer boundaries of extortion liability under the hobbs act,such as whether liability might be based on obtaining something as intangible as another right to exercise exclusive control over the use of a party business assets,the majority explicitly stated that the dissent is mistaken to suggest that our decision reaches,much less rejects,lower court decisions such as tropiano,in which the second circuit concluded that the intangible right to solicit refuse collection accounts constituted property within the hobbs act definition.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in construing the scope of the scheidler ii holding,we are guided by the majority explicit statement that scheidler ii did not even reach,much less reject,our holding in tropiano.indeed,we believe that the appropriate interpretation of scheidler ii must be one that with tropiano,both as to the property and obtaining prongs.thus,as an initial matter,we easily conclude that scheidler ii did not overturn tropiano broad interpretation of the hobbs act reference to property,nor otherwise suggest that only tangible property rights can be extorted under the hobbs act.the scheidler ii majority,in going out of its way to emphasize that it was not reaching tropiano,essentially said as much.indeed,scheidler ii consistently emphasized that it was only tightening the obtaining requirement of the hobbs act,and that in this regard,an important inquiry was whether the defendants had pursued or received something of value from victims that they could exercise,transfer,or sell.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in the case of the protestors who sought only to shut down abortion clinics,they had not.generally speaking,however,intangible property as,for instance,or exclusivity certainly things of value that are capable of being exercised,transferred,or sold.we therefore read scheidler ii as leaving intact this circuit precedent that intangible property rights can qualify as extortable property under the hobbs act and as simply clarifying that before liability can attach,the defendant must truly have obtained or,in the case of attempted extortion,sought to obtain the property right in question.
the more complex question is precisely what,pursuant to scheidler ii,it means to obtain a property right.the scheidler ii court framed this question as a inquiry that requires both a deprivation and an acquisition of property,explaining that while the protestors in that case may have deprived or sought to deprive respondents of their alleged property right of exclusive control of their business assets,they did not acquire any such property.id.at.in further explaining why the protestors could not be viewed as having acquired such property,the court stated that they had neither pursued nor received something of value from respondents that they could exercise,transfer,or sell.id.at.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
this explanation,in our view,provides the key to understanding what it means,pursuant to scheidler ii,to acquire property and thus to obtain it.we read the court emphasis on the possibility of exercising,transferring,or selling the property as a concern with the extortionist intent with respect to the property at issue.the ultimate goal of the protestors in scheidler ii was merely shutting down a clinic that performed abortions.id.at.this did not constitute acquisition in the eyes of the scheidler ii court,we believe,because there was no further intended activity on the part of the protestors,and mere interference with the clinics right to conduct their business,even to the point of getting them to cease conducting their business altogether,was closer to coercion than extortion.but had the protestors sought to take further action after having deprived the clinics of their right to conduct their business as they,for example,forcing the clinic staff to provide different types of services,forcing the clinic to turn its operations over to the protestors,or selling the clinic or its property to a third party we believe that they would have satisfied the scheidler ii court definition of obtaining.
against this backdrop,it becomes clear why the supreme court indicated that tropiano remains good law notwithstanding scheidler ii.the scheidler ii court characterized the right at issue in tropiano as the intangible right to solicit refuse collection accounts.id.at.had the tropiano defendants sought merely to get caron to stop soliciting collection accounts because they believed that the milford area should be entirely free from any solicitation,tropiano could not stand like the protestors,the tropiano defendants would have been seeking simply to deprive someone of a right without doing anything affirmative with that right themselves.but unlike the protestors,the tropiano defendants did seek to take action with respect to caron solicitation rights they sought to transfer those rights to themselves so that they could continue their own solicitation unimpeded by competition,and thus,in a sense,broaden their own solicitation rights.in other words,the tropiano defendants essentially forced caron to give no agreement,which,according to the tropiano court,was valued at about,and they used that agreement to further their own business activities.tropiano,at.their goal was ultimately to enrich themselves,something that could not be accomplished without appropriating to themselves the economic value of caron property rights.these actions,unlike those in scheidler ii,constituted extortion under the hobbs act.
thus,we hold that in evaluating an extortion count conformity with scheidler,whether it adequately alleges the obtaining of property for purposes of the hobbs act definition of key inquiry is whether the defendant is alleged to have carried out or,in the case of attempted extortion,attempted to carry out the deprivation of a property right from another,with the intent to exercise,sell,transfer,or take some other analogous action with respect to that right.a motive ultimately to profit by cashing out the value of the property right will generally serve as powerful evidence that the defendant goal was to obtain the right for himself,rather than merely to deprive the victim of that right.
we thus proceed to apply this test to each of the challenged extortion counts.
the challenged extortion counts 
on appeal,the cite the following counts in the indictment as being invalidated by scheidler ii the extortion counts the local extortion counts the extortion counts the tommy ragucci counts the alayev counts and the seagal counts.they argue that in each of these counts,the allegations support only a charge of coercion,not extortion.relatedly,they argue that the district court charge as to each of these counts was inconsistent with scheidler ii.we therefore assess each count to determine whether it is consistent with our construction of scheidler ii,first looking at how each count was framed in the indictment,and then considering how the district court ultimately described each count to the jury when issuing its charge.
a.the indictment 
i.the ila and local counts 
on both the and local extortion counts,the indictment alleged that the defendants sought to obtain,and did obtain,the union members lmrda rights to free speech and democratic participation in union affairs as well as their lmrda rights to loyal representation by their officers,agents,and other representatives.it further stated that the defendants sought to exercise those rights themselves,by telling various delegates whom to vote for in certain leadership positions,and by controlling various elected officials performance of their union duties.we believe that these allegations satisfy our interpretation of scheidler ii,because the government charges not only that the defendants caused the relinquishment of the union members lmrda rights,but also that the defendants did so in order to exercise those rights for,in a way that would profit them financially.
we note that the have also argued that these counts must fail because they could not legally exercise the union members lmrda rights,and therefore can not be said to have obtained them.this argument builds upon a recent split that has emerged,ii,among various district courts in this circuit.three of the four district courts considering this district court in this case,see march,sentencing tr,along with two other district concluded that lmrda rights can constitute extortable property under the hobbs act,notwithstanding the fact that lmrda rights can not be legally exercised by third parties.see united states muscarella,wl,at,united states cacace,wl at july.one district court,however,has reached a different view,concluding in a pair of cases that intangible property rights can qualify as extortable property under the hobbs act,but only if they can be lawfully exercised,transferred,or sold,and that lmrda rights therefore do not qualify.see united states bellomo,d,united states coffey,d.
we agree with the majority of district courts that have concluded that intangible property can qualify as extortable property under the hobbs act regardless of whether its exercise,transfer,or sale would be legal.the supreme court did not include a legality limitation in scheidler ii.moreover,as the government points out,the approach adopted by one district court gives rise to the untenable implication that one can never extort,under the hobbs act,illegal property such as narcotics because such property can not be legally used,sold,or transferred.in bellomo,the district court tried to distinguish this argument by stating that t he victim grievance in that hypothetical would surely not be the loss of his right to distribute drugs,but what the extortionist has obtained from him,the drugs.bellomo,d at.it is,however,as illegal to possess tangible drugs as it is to exercise the intangible right to distribute drugs.the bellomo court thus seems to suggest that its legality gloss on scheidler ii only applies to intangible property.we see no basis in principle,policy,or the text of scheidler ii,however,for holding that tangible property is obtainable regardless of whether its use,transfer,or sale is legal,but that intangible property is obtainable only if its exercise,transfer,or sale is legal.nor do we see any basis for imposing a legality requirement on the extortion of both tangible and intangible property.accordingly,we hold that the and local hobbs act extortion counts all survived scheidler ii.
ii.the mila counts 
similarly,as to the extortion counts,the indictment alleges that the defendants sought to obtain,and did obtain,the mila participants and beneficiaries rights to have the mila trustees contract with the service provider of prescription drugs of the trustees choice,and to have mila trustees and fiduciaries discharge their duties in mila best interest.the indictment further asserts that the defendants sought to exercise these rights for themselves by telling the mila trustees which service provider to support,and thereby ensuring the selection of a enterprise that would pay kickbacks.here,too,the allegation is that the defendants exercised the rights in question in order to profit themselves.thus,the hobbs act extortion counts satisfy the dictates of scheidler ii.
iii.the tommy ragucci counts 
as to the tommy ragucci counts,the relevant portion of the indictment alleges that the defendants attempted to obtain money and the right of john doe tommy ragucci to be an employee of howland hook container terminal.indictment.in its brief,the government similarly characterizes the extorted property from tommy ragucci as his salary and right to be employed at howland hook.we note that while tommy ragucci was presumably an employee with no guaranteed right to continued employment at howland hook,he surely had the right to be employed there for as long as he sought the job and his employer would have him.the defendants unquestionably sought to deprive him of that right,and of its attendant salary,when they ordered him to quit.the defendants also sought to take affirmative steps with respect to those rights of employment and salary,insofar as their ultimate goal was to transfer those rights to their own preferred candidate.thus,for the same reason that we believe tropiano survives scheidler ii,we conclude that the tommy ragucci counts similarly survive in both cases,the defendants tried to force their victim to relinquish a property right so that they could transfer that right either to themselves as in tropiano or to a third party of their choice as in the tommy ragucci counts.
iv.the alayev counts 
the alayev counts also state a claim for hobbs act extortion under our interpretation of scheidler ii.here,in relevant part,the indictment alleges that the defendants obtained alayev intangible property rights to make various business decisions such as whether to keep illegal gambling machines on the premises free from outside pressure.as the government aptly states in its brief,t he defendants did not seek merely to shut down alayev business but essentially made themselves his silent partners and exercised his rights to their own advantage.because here the allegation is that the defendants sought to exercise for themselves alayev rights in a manner that would profit them,the alayev counts survive scheidler ii.
v.the seagal counts 
finally,the seagal counts also satisfy the scheidler ii standard.here,it is alleged that the defendants sought to exercise for themselves seagal right to make his own business decisions,by threatening him with possible violence unless he worked with jules nasso again.thus,here the defendants sought to exercise for themselves seagal intangible right to decide with whom to work,in order to secure profit for themselves.this constitutes hobbs act extortion under scheidler ii.
b.the jury charge 
we similarly conclude that the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of extortion under the hobbs act.
the charge that the district court ultimately issued to the jury on march,mere days after scheidler ii was decided was,in relevant part,as follows 
the term crime in the hobbs act includes not only money and other tangible things of value but also includes any intangible right considered as a source or component of income or wealth 
y ou should find the defendant guilty of extortion provided the government has proven that as a consequence thereof the defendant obtained money or something else of value from the victims that the defendant could exercise and transfer or sell.
in other words,merely interfering and depriving someone of property is insufficient to constitute extortion.you have to be sic the obtaining of money or something else of value from the victims that the defendant could exercise,transfer or sell as well.
in addition to setting forth that definition of obtaining,the district court also defined the relevant property implicated in each of the various extortion counts.for example,as to the extortion counts,the district court identified the property at issue as consisting 
not only of union positions,money paid as wages and employee benefits and other economic benefits,but also certain intangible rights of ila members that are guaranteed to them by the labor management reporting disclosure act,which we refer to as the lmrda the lmrda is a federal statute that guarantees and protects the rights of employees who are members of labor organizations or unions the lmrda guarantees the rights of union members to fully and freely participate in the internal affairs and governance of their union,to run for union office,if they choose,to assemble and express their views and opinions about union affairs,to support and campaign on behalf of candidates of their choice and to vote in union elections,all without being subject to retaliation,threats or other punishment in the exercise of those rights.the lmrda also guarantees the right of union members to have their organization money,property and financial affairs of their labor organizations managed in accordance with the loyal and responsible representation of the union officers,agents,shop stewards and other representatives solely for the benefit of the union and its members and not on behalf of any party whose interests conflict with those of the union and its members.
as to the extortion counts,the district court identified the property at issue as including 
one,money and other economic benefits that mila and its participants and beneficiaries would have obtained but for the defendants corrupt influence over mila.
two,the right of mila and its participants and beneficiaries to have the mila trustees contract with the service provider of prescription pharmaceuticals of the trustees choice and 
three,the right of mila and its participants and beneficiaries to have the mila trustees and fiduciaries discharge their duties with respect to mila solely in the interest of mila and its participants and beneficiaries and not on behalf of a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of mila and its participants and beneficiaries these latter rights are guaranteed by certain statutes,including the employee retirement income security act of,which we call erisa.
on the local extortion counts,the district court stated that they implicated the same property interests as had been implicated by the extortion counts.tr.
as to the tommy ragucci counts,the district court stated that the property at issue was the right of tommy ragucci to be an employee of howland hook terminal.tr.
as to the extortion counts,the district court stated that the property at issue consisted of money or the right to conduct a business free from outside pressure,including the right to refuse to keep the illegal gambling machines at a business and the right to sell the business free from outside pressure.tr.
the district court added that,in regard to the rights to refuse to keep illegal gambling machines at a business and to sell the business,
merely interfering with or depriving someone of those property rights is insufficient to constitute extortion.more is required.before you can find the defendant guilty of extortion under these sub parts,you must find the government has proven that as a result of wrongfully inducing the victim to part with the property right identified in those sub parts,the defendant obtained money as sic something else of value from the victim that the defendant could exercise,transfer or sell.so,in other words,it is not enough just to discourage somebody or coerce somebody from not selling his business,you have to get something because of that type of activity.
finally,as to the extortion counts,the district court stated that the property at issue was money and the right to make business decisions free from outside pressure.tr.
we believe that the district court charge to the jury as to each of these counts was generally consistent with scheidler ii and with the analysis that we have set forth above.the argue that the district court charge was erroneous because,at several times during the lengthy charge,it called to mind concepts inconsistent with the scheidler holding,such as coercion.in particular,they point out that when discussing the counts,the district court stated that i further instruct you that you may find that a defendant induced labor union members to surrender property by the wrongful,actual or threatened use of force,violence or fear if the defendant threatened or coerced such members or their agents or representatives against their will in a manner that caused the members to refrain from exercising their rights under the lmrda.tr.the neglect to mention,however,that in the very next sentence,the district court went on to state that if you do so find,then you should find the defendant guilty of extortion provided the government has proven that as a consequence thereof the defendant obtained money or something else of value from the victims that the defendant could exercise and transfer or sell.tr.emphasis added.thus,the district court clearly and expressly tied its instruction on the ila extortion counts back to the scheidler ii standard.
similarly,the point out that when charging the jury on the extortion counts,the district court told the jurors that if you conclude that the government has proven that a defendant used such coercion to induce a mila trustee or another person who exercised discretionary authority or control in regard to mila assets in the transaction to select vincent nasso firm as a service provider without regard to the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries,but,rather,in the interest of vincent nasso and others acting on his behalf,then you may find such defendant wrongfully induced the obtaining of intangible rights of the mila participants and beneficiaries.tr.the suggest that this language practically told the jury to find on the basis of coercion rather than obtaining property by extortion.this characterization is simply incorrect.contrary to the assertion,here the district court was instructing the jurors that to find that the defendants had wrongfully obtained the intangible rights of the mila participants and beneficiaries,they had to find not only that the defendants had caused the relinquishing of these rights,but that the defendants had exercised those rights for themselves,by ensuring the selection of gambino associate vincent nasso company,as a service provider.even this excerpted portion was,therefore,entirely consistent with the scheidler ii standard.it is also worth noting that a mere two sentences before this discussion,the district court had expressly reiterated that merely interfering with or depriving someone of property is insufficient to constitute extortion.you need the other branch of this,that the defendants obtained money or something else of value from the victims that the defendants could exercise,transfer,or sell.tr.
in short,the record makes clear that the district court consistently emphasized to the as a general matter and in its discussion of the particular extortion obtaining requirement as set forth in scheidler ii.and where a jury is repeatedly and correctly instructed,in the language of the controlling supreme court decision,on the elements required for conviction,a defendant can not claim prejudicial error.see united states coyne,cir.we therefore reject all of the scheidler challenges to their extortion convictions.
b.the sufficiency of the evidence challenges 
the also raise various challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions of the local counts,the local counts,the howland hook counts,the molfetta counts,the money laundering counts,the tommy ragucci counts,the zinna count,the marinelli counts,the alayev counts,the seagal counts,the gambling counts,and the witness tampering count.we discuss each of these challenges below.as an initial matter,we note that the same standard of review applies to all of these challenges the are subject to the heavy burden of demonstrating that no jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the reasonably drawn inferences from the evidence,which this court views in the light most favorable to the government.see,united states locascio,cir.we also note that,to the extent that one asserts a evidence argument that is also relevant to the case of another,we assume that the other joins in that argument,given that each of them have so indicated in their submissions to this court.
the local counts ciccone,bondi 
as described in detail above,the local counts rested on the argument that the defendants,including ciccone and bondi,had attempted,schemed,and conspired to exercise control over local officials saccenti and knott.on appeal,both ciccone and bondi argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their fraud convictions as to local,and bondi also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for extortion of local.we first analyze whether there was sufficient evidence on the local fraud counts,and then move to an assessment of the local extortion counts.
a.the local fraud counts 
it is undisputed that the local fraud alleged a conspiracy and scheme to defraud local in an honest services wire fraud theory.as this court has previously explained,the general elements of wire fraud under are a scheme to defraud money or property as the object of the scheme and use of the wires to further the scheme.fountain united states,cir.the specific type of wire fraud at issue here honest services wire fraud arises under,which this circuit has interpreted to clearly prohibit a scheme or artifice to use the mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers purporting to act for and in the interests of his or her employer or of the person to whom the duty of loyalty is owed secretly to act in his or her or the defendant own interests instead,accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to the employer.united states rybicki,cir en banc see also id.at stating that a conviction requires a showing of a scheme or artifice to defraud for the purpose of depriving another of the intangible right of honest services where the misrepresentations or omissions made by the defendants are material in that they have the natural tendency to influence or are capable of influencing the employer to change its behavior and use of the mails or wires in furtherance of the scheme.
here,the essence of the government honest services wire fraud theory as to the local counts was that the defendants schemed to defraud local union members of the honest services of two of their elected saccenti and steve getting these officials to secretly act at the behest of the gambino family.in his appeal,ciccone has not disputed that there was sufficient evidence demonstrating that he attempted to exercise control over the decisions of saccenti and knott.rather,ciccone argues that there is no evidence that saccenti or knott ever actually acceded to this coercion,and that the local members were therefore ultimately defrauded of nothing.
as the government points out,however,this circuit has held that in wire fraud cases,it is the scheme itself,rather than its success,that is the required element for conviction.united states trapilo,cir.ciccone has responded to this argument by attempting an analogy between the instant case and this circuit holding in rybicki an honest services wire fraud case that 
honest services cases fall into two general groups,cases involving bribes or kickbacks,and cases involving in bribery or kickback cases,the undisclosed bribery itself is sufficient to make out the crime,but in cases,the existence of a conflict of interest alone is not sufficient to do so in the context,though not in the bribery context,the defendant behavior must thus cause,or at least be capable of causing,some some economic or pecuniary the employer.
rybicki,at.essentially,ciccone suggests that this case is analogous to a case,and that because no detriment to local actually occurred here,no liability can attach to the scheme.this argument fails for two reasons.first,we do not believe that an analogy can properly be drawn between a case in the private sector and the conduct alleged here,attempts to coerce union officials into shifting their loyalty from their union members to organized crime.indeed,rybicki stated that c ases involving union officials tend to fit the pattern of the bribery cases in which case no showing of detriment is required and that in any event,b ecause federal law imposes special duties of loyalty on union officials,analysis of such cases may depart from analysis of other private sector cases.rybicki,at.second,even assuming arguendo that this analogy could somehow stand,it is clear that the defendants commission of this conduct was at least capable of causing some detriment economic and otherwise to the local members,which is all that rybicki requires.we therefore reject ciccone challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of the local fraud counts.
bondi,meanwhile,raises an additional challenge he alleges that there was no evidence that he personally ever had any contact with local official louis saccenti,and that he simply happened to be cassarino visited saccenti house with the purpose of telling saccenti to stop his resistance.construing the facts in the light most favorable to the government,however,we believe that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that when,after ciccone instructed cassarino to take bondi with him to tell saccenti that he better stop it otherwise,you know what going to happen here and bondi proceeded to accompany cassarino to saccenti home,see supra,bondi did so as a participant in the criminal scheme.see,locascio,at stating that although t raditionally,conspiracy law has required more than mere presence or mere knowledge to sustain a conviction for conspiracy.t here is a distinction between mere presence and presence under a particular set of circumstances that indicate participation,and that presence coupled with other signs of involvement will be enough to sustain a conviction.we therefore reject bondi challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of the local fraud counts.
b.the local extortion counts 
bondi challenges his conviction of the local extortion counts on the same basis that he challenged his conviction of the local fraud counts he suggests that it was mere coincidence that he was present when cassarino went over to saccenti house in order to tell him to stop his resistance.for the reasons set forth above,we reject this argument and thus affirm his conviction of these counts.
the local counts ciccone 
the local counts,as described in detail above,rested on the theory that ciccone and other defendants had exercised control over the actions of local president scollo,thereby extorting and defrauding local and its members.in his brief,ciccone does not dispute that he exercised control over scollo,but argues that scollo ultimate actions were consistent with the interests of local.he points out,for instance,that scollo testified that he himself wanted to terminate scala,and that ciccone permitted him to do so.
as the government argues,however,the harm caused to local was that scollo generally had to seek ciccone permission before taking any significant action,and that the local members were therefore deprived of scollo honest services.we agree.the local members had the right to have elected make the decisions that he wanted to make,according to the timetable that he thought appropriate.because of ciccone control over scollo,this was not possible.for instance,during the trial,when scollo was asked whether he had felt that he had the authority to terminate phil scala,he answered not really.tr.he explained that he had to wait until sonny ciccone said if you want to get rid of him,get rid of him,because sonny always told us when it the big decisions that we should have to confer with him first.tr.by ordering scollo to confer with him on the big decisions,ciccone defrauded the local members of scollo honest services.that ciccone often ultimately permitted scollo to follow through on his proposed course of action is irrelevant.we therefore reject ciccone challenge to his conviction of the local counts.
the howland hook counts 
as set forth in detail above,the gravamen of the howland hook counts was that ciccone,along with other defendants,had extorted quarterly cash payments from carmine ragucci,the of howland hook,for a period of multiple years.on appeal,ciccone apparently concedes that these cash payments were made,but states that there was insufficient evidence as to what these payments were for or why they were made,stressing that carmine ragucci himself never testified.
as discussed above,extortion is defined in the hobbs act as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by the wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear.b emphasis added.this circuit has stated that t he statute does not limit the definition of extortion to those circumstances in which property is obtained through the wrongful use of fear created by implicit or explicit threats,but instead leaves open the cause of the fear,and we have indicated that the required showing is that the defendant must knowingly and willfully create or instill fear,or use or exploit existing fear with the specific purpose of inducing another to part with his or her property.united states abelis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,we believe that given the evidence described above,a reasonable jury could have concluded that ciccone obtained these cash payments from carmine ragucci by exploiting ragucci fear of ciccone,particularly given scollo testimony that ciccone would be pissed off when the payments were late,and that scollo would then communicate that displeasure to ragucci.it is true that ragucci did not himself testify,but there is no dispute that ragucci made sizeable cash payments to ciccone on a scheduled basis,no dispute that ragucci would be told that ciccone was pissed off when the payments were late,and no affirmative evidence whatsoever that these payments were for a legitimate purpose,such as repayment of a loan or payment for services rendered.indeed,ragucci brother,worked with him at howland testified that he did not know of any legitimate basis for these payments.scollo testimony about the highly surreptitious nature of the transmission of the money,and the fact that he knew his involvement in it was not the proper thing to do,further supports the conclusion that these payments were the result of extortion.although ciccone has posited on appeal various other reasons for why these payments were made,no evidence supporting such reasons was presented to the jury,and we can not say that,construing all facts in the light most favorable to the government,a reasonable jury would have been unable to conclude that these payments were the result of extortion.we therefore reject ciccone challenge to his conviction of the howland hook counts.
the molfetta counts 
the molfetta counts,in turn,rested on the theory that ciccone had extorted cash payments from frank molfetta,the owner of the bridgeside drayadge trucking company.in his brief,ciccone acknowledges receiving cash payments from molfetta,but argues that he liberated molfetta from the obligation to pay carmine ragucci and that this was therefore not a case of extortion.this argument fails to persuade us that a reasonable jury could not have concluded that the payments were the result of extortion,for two reasons.first,ciccone has never addressed the uncontradicted evidence that molfetta had already concluded at least three years earlier that he was no longer obligated to pay carmine ragucci.this evidence,of course,seriously undermines ciccone claim that he somehow freed molfetta from that obligation.second,in his grand jury testimony,molfetta himself stated that ciccone had ordered him to start making monthly payments retroactive to the prior month,and that he had made those payments out of fear,adding,i afraid right now.see supra.ciccone acknowledges the admissibility of molfetta grand jury testimony as a prior inconsistent statement,but states that even crediting this,there was no proof that ciccone affirmatively exploited any such fear.in so arguing,ciccone fails to confront the actual substance of molfetta testimony,which certainly provided sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude that he made the payments in question out of fear.we therefore reject ciccone challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of the molfetta counts.
the money laundering counts peter gotti,richard gotti,ciccone 
peter gotti,richard gotti,and ciccone were convicted of money laundering conspiracy in violation of h and numerous acts of money laundering in violation of either a a i promotion money laundering and a b i concealment money laundering.as set forth in detail above,the money laundering charges essentially implicated the payment of cash tributes from the proceeds of illegal activities up the gambino family chain to peter gotti,as acting boss.ciccone,as described supra,both received moneys and paid a portion of those moneys up the chain to peter gotti.
on appeal,the make several arguments stemming from the statutory text of we therefore begin with the relevant statutory language,which provides that 
whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity 
a i with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity or 
b knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part 
i to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity 
shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction,whichever is greater,or imprisonment for not more than twenty years,or both.
a.the money laundering conspiracy provision,in turn,simply makes it a crime to conspire to commit the above acts.see h any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.
thus,the money laundering charges against peter gotti,richard gotti,and ciccone required the government to prove that the defendants,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducted or attempted to conduct a financial transaction which in fact involved the proceeds of that unlawful activity,either a with the intent to promote the carrying on of that unlawful activity or b with the knowledge that the transaction was designed at least in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of the unlawful activity.
the argue that prongs two,three,and four were not met.we address each of these arguments in turn.
prong conducting a financial transaction 
to evaluate the contention that there was insufficient evidence to show that the conducted a financial transaction,we must first look to the statutory definitions of conduct,transaction,and financial transaction.
under c,the term conducts is defined as includ ing initiating,concluding,or participating in initiating,or concluding a transaction.
under c,the term transaction is defined as including 
a purchase,sale,loan,pledge,gift,transfer,delivery,or other disposition,and with respect to a financial institution includes a deposit,withdrawal,transfer between accounts,exchange of currency,loan,extension of credit,purchase or sale of any stock,bond,certificate of deposit,or other monetary instrument,use of a safe deposit box,or any other payment,transfer,or delivery,by,through,or to a financial institution,by whatever means effected.
finally,under c,a financial transaction is defined as 
a a transaction which in any way or degree affects interstate or foreign commerce i involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or ii involving one or more monetary instruments,or iii involving the transfer of title to any real property,vehicle,vessel,or aircraft,or b a transaction involving the use of a financial institution which is engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce in any way or degree.
the advance two arguments as to why the conducting a financial transaction prong was not met,both of which are primarily legal in nature.first,they argue that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that they conducted any transactions.second,they argue that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the alleged transactions they conducted were financial,that the transactions in any way or degree affect ed interstate or foreign commerce.
the first argument,advanced principally by peter gotti,is that at most,the government demonstrated the receipt of moneys,and that merely receiving funds can not rise to the level of conducting a transaction.the statutory text,however,indicates the mere receipt of funds does constitute the conducting of a transaction pursuant to c,under which the term conducts includes participating in the conclusion of a transaction and the term transaction includes transfers and deliveries.in other words,when a person accepts a transfer or delivery of funds,he has participated in the conclusion of that transfer or delivery,and has therefore conducted a transaction.this interpretation is also consistent with the indication in the legislative history that congress intended the term transaction to be interpreted broadly.see,united states leslie,cir noting,with reference to the senate report,that congress intended the term transaction to be interpreted broadly.indeed,the sixth circuit,sitting en banc,has specifically concluded that the delivery or transfer of cash to another person is a financial transaction,explaining that although the mere transportation of cash does not meet the definition of a financial transaction,the purchase,sale,transfer,delivery,of cash do qualify as transactions,because they constitute some disposition of funds.see united states reed,cir en banc.we agree,and therefore reject the argument that the receipt of funds does not constitute a transaction.
we similarly reject the second argument that the transactions in question were not financial because they did not affect interstate or foreign commerce.our circuit has stated that in the context of money laundering prosecutions under,the only required showing is that the individual subject transaction has,at least,a de minimis effect on interstate commerce.leslie,at.we have explained that 
t he interstate commerce element of the money laundering statute,while an essential element,is jurisdictional in nature.the requirement that the transaction or financial institution affect interstate commerce means that proof of a minimal effect on interstate commerce is needed to support federal jurisdiction.the statute requirement that the questioned activity affect commerce in any way or degree signals congress desire to exercise the full extent of its commerce clause power.hence,the government burden is not heavy.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.although the argue that the mere receipt of moneys can not affect interstate commerce,and that it is inappropriate to look at the conduct that gave rise to the money in the first place,we have held,since leslie,that it is indeed permissible to consider the conduct that gave rise to the laundered funds.see,united states goodwin,cir stating that laundering of narcotics proceeds met the jurisdictional requirement because narcotics trafficking and money laundering are activities which,in the aggregate,will undoubtedly affect interstate commerce internal citations omitted see also united states hatcher,cir holding that the money laundering counts were linked to interstate commerce because they stemmed from a purchase of stolen jewelry,and the robbery of that jewelry had affected interstate commerce.
this interpretation,in turn,makes clear that the money laundering offenses charged in this case affected both interstate and foreign commerce.the moneys in question were alleged to be the proceeds of the hobbs act extortions and other illegal activities discussed in detail above.the alleged extortion victims were businesses and unions that engaged in interstate commerce,and the gambling operations in which the defendants allegedly operated the new york branch of a costa rican bookmaking enterprise were international in scope.as such,these criminal activities affected interstate and foreign commerce,and the laundering of their proceeds also affected interstate commerce by promoting the activities that gave rise to them.moreover,as the government also notes,the alleged money laundering activity which resulted in the payment of tributes up to gambino family leaders such as gotti and ciccone also affected interstate commerce insofar as it promoted the gambino family clearly affects interstate a whole.
we believe that these factors collectively demonstrate that the money laundering had at least the minimal effect on interstate commerce necessary to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement,and we therefore reject the argument that there was insufficient evidence to find that they conducted financial transactions within the meaning of.
prong proceeds of unlawful activity 
the next argue that even assuming arguendo that the receipt of the moneys in question constituted a financial transaction,there was insufficient evidence to conclude that these moneys represented the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.in contrast to the essentially legal nature of the prong two analysis,the argument as to this prong requires a more inquiry.
the gravamen of the contentions here is that the government did not sufficiently link the moneys in question to specified unlawful activities,but simply argued that the proceeds came from various possible unlawful sources.under our circuit precedent,the government is required to link the moneys in question to specified unlawful activities,but this link can be made through circumstantial evidence.see united states reiss,cir concluding that various pieces of evidence gave rise to the inference that the laundered funds in question were drug proceeds.
here,we conclude that the government adduced evidence sufficient to prove that the moneys in question derived from hobbs act extortions and illegal gambling businesses.indeed,as set forth in detail above,the government presented evidence indicating that these moneys came from,inter alia,the molfetta extortion,the mila kickbacks,and the machines that the gambino family placed in businesses including café roma.see supra.
prong intent of promoting or concealing the unlawful activity 
finally,the argue that at most,the government has shown that cash payments were made up to peter gotti,and that even if it could be shown that this money derived from unlawful activities,his receipt of the money was separate from,and neither promoted nor concealed,those activities.as noted above,either the promotion or the concealment prong is a required element of a money laundering conviction.
based on our review of the trial evidence,we believe that there was ample evidence upon which a jury could conclude that the participated in concealment money laundering,that they participated in a transaction delivery of the cash that was designed at least in part to conceal the source of these moneys.as noted above,at trial the government adduced evidence that the process by which the cash tributes were transmitted was highly complex and surreptitious.for example,the defendants would communicate about the transactions in coded language,by referring to peter gotti as him or the guy rather than by name the money would be transmitted to peter gotti through several intermediaries the money would be transmitted in a surreptitious manner and the payments were made in cash.see supra.we therefore believe that a reasonable jury could infer that peter gotti accepted the cash payments knowing that the deliveries of those payments had been designed in a way that would conceal the source of the moneys see,united states prince,cir finding the concealment prong met by the elaborate arrangements for transmitting the money in question,which protected the defendants from a paper trail united states,cir stating that a conviction of concealment money laundering requires evidence of intent to disguise or conceal the transaction,whether from direct evidence,like the defendant own statements,or from circumstantial evidence,like the use of a third party to disguise the true owner,or unusual secrecy emphasis added.
the tommy ragucci counts ciccone 
ciccone next challenges his conviction of the tommy ragucci counts,described on the allegation that ciccone conspired and attempted to force tommy ragucci to resign from his job at howland hook,and thus to obtain the value of his right to compete for that job.in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting these convictions,ciccone argues that n o evidence of any threat communicated to tommy ragucci was elicited,that at worst,ciccone simply made a determination or recommendation that tommy ragucci should be replaced by anastasia,and that there is no evidence of any affirmative exploitation of tommy ragucci fear of ciccone much less that ciccone was aware of it.
these arguments,however,are directly contradicted by the wiretapped conversation between ciccone and scollo as to tommy ragucci,in which ciccone instructed scollo tell him i do want him there.tell him i do want him there.see supra.they are also squarely contradicted by tommy ragucci own testimony that scollo told him that ciccone wanted him to step down,which caused him to feel intimidated.see id.we therefore believe that there was ample evidence upon which a jury could conclude that ciccone attempted to extort the economic value of tommy ragucci right to compete for his position at howland hook.
the zinna count ciccone 
the zinna count,as set forth above,rests on the allegation that ciccone schemed with other defendants to demand in cash from zinna.in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on this count,ciccone principally argues that there is no proof that zinna was ever actually asked for this money.this argument fails to appreciate that the zinna count did not charge ciccone with extortion itself,but with conspiracy to extort.the evidence described above is certainly sufficient to support a conclusion that ciccone schemed with cassarino and scollo to extort property from zinna,in violation of the hobbs act.see supra see also united states clemente,cir in order to establish a hobbs act conspiracy,the government does not have to prove any overt act the government needs to prove only that an agreement to commit extortion existed,not that extortion was actually committed.ciccone also argues that there is no evidence that scollo and cassarino actually agreed to carry out his orders to extort the money from zinna.in the conversation between ciccone,scollo,and cassarino,however,the three men discussed zinna activities with shared disapproval,and expressed no hesitation about carrying out ciccone orders to extort him.we therefore reject ciccone challenges to this conviction.
the marinelli counts ciccone 
the gravamen of the marinelli counts,as described above,was that after marinelli enlisted the help of ciccone and cassarino in obtaining his workers compensation payments,they extorted a portion of the proceeds from him.in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of these counts,ciccone argues that there was no evidence that marinelli paid ciccone and cassarino out of fear,noting that marinelli was the one who initially contacted ciccone and cassarino for the help in question.this argument does not respond,however,to the evidence that once marinelli did contact ciccone and cassarino and later received his payment,ciccone and cassarino demanded a portion of the proceeds and then instructed marinelli son,vito,that the initial payment was insufficient.see supra.it seems clear that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that at this point,marinelli decision to pay them another was prompted by fear.indeed,marinelli son,vito,specifically testified at trial about his fear of not paying enough.see id.we therefore reject ciccone argument that there was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction of this count.
the alayev counts bondi 
the only challenge to the alayev counts has been brought by bondi,who argues that he was not personally involved in the eduard alayev extortion.at trial,however,the government adduced evidence sufficient to tie bondi to the extortion.specifically,as noted above,alayev testified that both cassarino and bondi came together to order him to install gambling machines at café roma.see supra.the government also introduced wiretap evidence in which bondi provided cassarino with information about alayev whom they referred to as eddie and the at café roma.see supra.alayev also testified at trial that bondi was the person who would come to collect the money from the gambling machines,and would sometimes give him some of the proceeds.see supra.based on the above,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to tie bondi to the alayev extortion.
the seagal counts ciccone 
ciccone next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of the seagal counts,which essentially alleged that he had attempted to force seagal to work with jules nasso.on appeal,ciccone acknowledges that seagal was subjected to fear by other gambino family associates,but asserts that he had no involvement in these interactions.the evidence adduced at trial,however,plainly supported a finding that ciccone himself was involved in exploiting seagal fear of him in order to get him to work with jules nasso.indeed,seagal testified to numerous instances in which ciccone interacted with him in a threatening manner while telling him to resume his business relationship with jules nasso and to pay the defendants significant sums of money.see supra.the wiretap evidence also indicated that ciccone was directly involved in the pressure brought to bear on seagal.see supra.accordingly,we reject this challenge.
the gambling counts bondi 
bondi presumably joined by ciccone next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his gambling convictions for bookmaking and under.this statute provides that w hoever conducts,finances,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.a emphasis added.an illegal gambling business,in turn,is defined as one which 
i is a violation of the law of a state in which it is conducted ii involves five or more persons who conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of such business and iii has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of in any single day.
bondi argues that his convictions for bookmaking and did not satisfy these statutory requirements.
bookmaking 
with regard to the bookmaking count,bondi essentially makes three arguments as to why there was insufficient evidence to convict him of bookmaking.his first two arguments arise from the b i requirement that the business must violate the law of the state in which it was conducted.his third argument arises from the b ii requirement that the business involve five or more persons who conduct,finance,manage,supervise,direct,or own all or part of the business.
first,bondi asserts that the bookmaking business was not a violation of new york law and therefore did not satisfy the requirements of b i because pelican sports was located offshore in costa rica,its actions were legal there,and no bets were received or accepted in new york.at trial,however,the government adduced evidence sufficient to conclude that the defendants,who were new,had been operating a local branch of the business,essentially managing a stable of clients who placed their bets from new york.see supra.when bets are placed from new york,the gambling activity is illegal under new york law,regardless of whether the activity is legal in the location to which the bets were transmitted.see,people ex rel.vacco world interactive gaming,misc d,u nder new york penal law,if the person engaged in gambling is located in new york,then new york is the location where the gambling occurred see penal law it is irrelevant that internet gambling is legal in antigua.the act of entering the bet and transmitting the information from new york via the internet is adequate to constitute gambling activity within new york state.new york penal law further provides that a person advances gambling activity when,acting other than as a player,he engages in conduct which materially aids any form of gambling activity,which the defendants here did.thus,the defendants violated new york law by organizing a bookmaking operation through which bettors made their bets from new york.
second,bondi argues that the bookmaking business was not a violation of new york state law because there was no evidence that the bookmaking business accepted bets in any one day that totaled more than.see penal law a person is guilty of promoting gambling in the first degree when he knowingly advances or profits from unlawful gambling activity by engaging in bookmaking activity to the extent that he receives or accepts in any one day more than five bets totaling more than five thousand dollars.the betting records introduced into evidence at trial,however,indicated that the defendants new york operation of pelican sports did take in more than five bets totaling more than on certain days.see,gov t exh.
third,bondi argues that the government did not satisfy the b standard of showing that at least five people were involved in the defendants operation.at trial,however,the government adduced evidence that in addition to bondi,ciccone,cassarino,brancato,thomas lisi,jerome orsino,and carmine malara were also involved in the bookmaking operation thus,bondi arguments as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the bookmaking charges lack merit.
bondi also asserts that the elements of were not satisfied with respect to the charges,principally on grounds that the machines in question were not illegal gambling devices.
as noted above,makes illegal only those gambling businesses that are a violation of the law of the state in which they are conducted.under new york state law,an illegal gambling device is a machine usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity.penal law.gambling,in turn,is defined as the staking or risking of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance,upon an agreement or understanding that the individual will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.penal law emphasis added.something of value is defined as any money or property,any token,object,or article exchangeable for money or property,or any form of credit or promise directly or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any interest therein.penal law.a contest of chance is defined as a game in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance,notwithstanding that the skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein.penal law.thus,in sum,an illegal gambling device is a machine that is used in an activity where money or something else of value is staked upon the outcome of a contest that depends in a material degree upon chance.
on appeal,bondi raises several arguments as to why the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence that the machines in question were illegal gambling devices.first,he contends that there was no evidence that people who played the machines actually received something of value from them.second,he argues that the games in question were games of skill rather than contests of chance.both of these arguments lack merit.as to bondi something of value argument,the government adduced evidence that customers of the machines in question would purchase credits to play the machines,that they would receive credits if they won,and that they could ultimately redeem these credits for cash.see supra.thus,there is no question that the customers risked something of the outcome of the games played on the machines.as to bondi argument that the games were games of skill rather than chance,he fails to recognize that a contest of chance encompasses games in which the skill of the contestants may play a role,as long as the outcome depends in a material degree on chance.bondi concedes that the games in question had the theme of poker,and he has not contended in his brief that chance does not play a material role in the outcome of a poker game.
bondi also argues that there was no proof that the games in question were in fact games,pointing to the testimony of the government expert witness,detective martin,that he had not seen any pure machines.this argument,however,misconstrues detective martin testimony.detective martin consistently referred to type machines as an umbrella term encompassing different types of illegal gambling machines.see,tr.in the statement at issue,he was simply clarifying that he had not seen any of the subset of machines that involve playing poker with actual cards displayed on the machine screen called pure machines.tr.there are no pure machines that you have seen in this entire case,correct card machines,no,but clearly machines,like lucky eight lines.
finally,bondi suggests that the indictment gambling count referring to count should have been dismissed because that count incorrectly referred to new york penal law which was relevant to the bookmaking charge,rather than new york penal law or.bondi previously raised this argument to the district court,which rejected it on grounds that under united states eucker,cir,if an indictment properly charges an offense,it is sufficient,even though an inapposite statute is referred to therein.we agree with the district court resolution of that issue.see also.c unless the defendant was misled and thereby prejudiced,neither an error in a citation nor a citation omission is a ground to dismiss the indictment or information or to reverse a conviction.
the witness tampering count ciccone 
the final evidence challenge is brought by ciccone on the witness tampering count involving anthony frazetta bondi stepson.this count arose under b,the witness tampering provision of the federal obstruction of justice act,et.pursuant to b,it is unlawful to knowingly intimidat e,threaten,or corruptly persuade another person,with intent to prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding emphasis added.this circuit has defined corrupt persuasion as persuasion that is motivated by an improper purpose.united states thompson,cir.we have also specifically stated that the obstruction of justice act can be violated by corruptly influencing a witness to invoke the fifth amendment privilege in his grand jury testimony.see united states cioffi,cir.
in his brief,ciccone argues that he was merely suggesting that frazetta,who had every right to invoke the fifth amendment privilege,do so,and argues that this suggestion was not motivated by an improper purpose.we believe,however,that there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could conclude that ciccone indeed had an improper purpose in suggesting to frazetta via a command to his stepfather,bondi,over whom he had authority under the hierarchical structure of the gambino family to plead the fifth amendment ciccone wanted to ensure that frazetta did not implicate him.see supra.we therefore reject ciccone challenge to his conviction on this count.
c.the defendants other challenges 
the also raise several other challenges to their convictions,all of which we reject.
the crawford error 
bondi argues that the admission of guilty pleas by malara and lisi as to the bookmaking counts violated crawford washington,d,therefore mandating reversal of his convictions on those counts.
it is undisputed that under crawford,which was decided one year after this trial,the admission of these guilty were admitted for the purpose of showing that the bookmaking business employed five or more people,a required element for conviction under b was error.this court has explained,however,that crawford errors should be reviewed under a harmless error standard.see,united states mcclain,cir the erroneous admission of the three plea allocutions is therefore reviewable for harmless error,and does not necessitate a new trial as long as the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in this case,we believe that the admission of malara and lisi guilty pleas was harmless.even absent any evidence as to malara and lisi,there was overwhelming evidence at trial that five other,ciccone,cassarino,orsino,and involved in the bookmaking business.see supra.additionally,there was also independent evidence adduced by the government as to the involvement of malara and lisi.see id.
the existence of this other evidence as to the involvement of at least five people in the bookmaking business renders the crawford error harmless.accordingly,we reject this challenge.
the wiretap challenge 
the next argument brought by bondi and,presumably,joined in by the other is that the district court erred in denying a motion to suppress the products of a wiretap on cassarino cellular phone the warrant for this wiretap was originally authorized by justice nancy smith of the new york supreme court,appellate division,second department,on april.justice smith concluded,based primarily upon the affidavit of joseph rauchet,deputy chief investigator for the new york state attorney general task force on organized crime octf,that there was probable cause to believe that cassarino and others were committing and are about to commit the crimes of promoting gambling,possession of gambling records and conspiracy to commit those crimes and that evidence of these crimes may be obtained by the interception and recording of communications on cassarino cell phone.
before trial,cassarino moved to suppress the fruits of this wiretap.the district court denied that motion on december,concluding that probable cause supported the wiretap and that even assuming that probable cause had been absent,the agents enforcing the warrant relied in good faith upon it.this court reviews that determination de novo.see,united states smith,cir on an appeal from a ruling on a motion to suppress,we review a district court findings of historical fact for clear error,but analyze de novo the ultimate determination of such legal issues as probable cause and the good faith of police officials in relying upon a warrant.
here,we agree with the district court that probable cause supported the issuance of the warrant for the wiretap.as noted above,the initial application for the wiretap was based upon rauchet lengthy and detailed affidavit.rauchet set forth four categories of information supporting a wiretap of cassarino cell phone surveillance evidence analysis of telephone toll records supplied by sprint on the cassarino cell phone cassarino use of false subscriber information on his cell phone and rauchet own opinions,based on his experience of over fifteen years investigating organized crime and gambling.
first,in terms of surveillance evidence,rauchet described numerous instances of meetings between cassarino and gambino family members,such as louie vallario an alleged capo in the gambino family,brancato,and ciccone.in fact,in one conversation overheard by an octf special investigator,cassarino and brancato allegedly discussed football gambling,that one location was making barrels of money,and that gambling locations could not be touched.second,in analyzing cassarino sprint records,rauchet described numerous calls between cassarino cell phone and various gambino family officials.third,rauchet noted that cassarino cell phone number was listed to cassarino prime rather than primo cassarino,that it was linked to the contact address for jerry café an alleged meeting place for the gambino family rather than cassarino home address,and that the social security number associated with the cell phone was off by one digit.rauchet stated that i n my experience,those who utilize telephones to engage in illegal activities often attempt to disguise their identities.fourth,based on his lengthy experience,rauchet set forth his opinions about the nature of the gambino family gambling enterprises,and specifically opined that ciccone who,as a gambino captain,had a higher profile had used cassarino to carry messages to and set up meetings with other members of the gambino crime family in order to guide and perpetuate gambling enterprises.
based on the above,we conclude that under the federal totality of the circumstances standard,there was probable cause to conclude that cassarino was engaged in criminal activity.see united states rowell,cir holding that the relevant standard for federal courts on motions to suppress evidence obtained under a wiretap warrant is whether the totality of the circumstances indicate a probability of criminal activity.it is true that,as bondi argues,rauchet affidavit included an incorrect statement namely,that cassarino had been convicted of a hobbs act violation,when in fact cassarino had only been arrested for a hobbs act violation.according to the government,this error occurred because a detective misread cassarino rap sheet to rauchet over the telephone.as the district court noted,however,even without this misstatement,the affidavit still set forth ample evidence from which to find probable cause.bondi other arguments about misstatements and omissions contained in rauchet affidavit essentially amount to alternative explanations for rauchet observations.although these explanations are not necessarily wholly implausible,they do not undermine the notion that there was at least probable cause upon which the warrant could issue.we therefore reject this challenge.
partial sequestration of an anonymous jury 
peter gotti contends that the district court erred in empaneling an anonymous and partially sequestered jury the other presumably join in this argument as well.
the parties agree that in this circuit,a court may order the empaneling of an anonymous jury upon a concluding that there is strong reason to believe the jury needs protection,and b taking reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure that his fundamental rights are protected.united states paccione,cir.within these parameters,the decision whether or not to empanel an anonymous jury is left to the district court discretion.id.
gotti does not argue that reasonable precautions were not taken to minimize prejudicial effects.nor can he,as the precautions set forth in a thorough voir dire and providing the jurors with a plausible and nonprejudicial reason for not disclosing their identities,see followed here.the district court made use of a juror questionnaire that was jointly submitted,and instructed the jury that the special precautions had been implemented to protect them from the inquiring media.
instead,gotti argument goes solely to prong one of the paccione standard whether there was strong reason to believe that the jury needed protection.here,the case law from this circuit makes clear that the district court legitimately found strong reason to believe that the jury needed protection,and that it therefore did not abuse its discretion by granting the government motion.see paccione,at collecting cases and stating that sufficient reason for empaneling anonymous juries has been found in cases where a the defendants have been charged with grand jury tampering and the trial is expected to attract publicity b the defendant has a history of attempted jury tampering and a serious criminal record c there had been extensive pretrial publicity and there were abundant allegations of dangerous and unscrupulous conduct or d the defendants were alleged to be very dangerous individuals who had participated in killings and there was strong evidence of the defendants past attempts to interfere with the judicial process internal citations and quotation marks omitted.here,the district court identified the following factors as relevant to its decision that the defendants were charged with membership in a powerful crime organization,the gambino family that the defendants included gotti,the alleged head of the gambino family whose pretrial detention had already been ordered by the district court and affirmed by this circuit due to dangerousness as well as ciccone,a gambino family captain,whose pretrial detention had similarly been ordered by the district court due to dangerousness,united states ciccone,wl july,that the indictment itself charged two defendants with witness tampering in connection with grand jury testimony and that there was expected to be intense media coverage and public interest in the trial.the presence of these factors unquestionably made this case one in which the district court had the discretion to empanel an anonymous and partially sequestered jury.we therefore reject this challenge as well.
iii.challenges by the defendants and the government to the defendants sentences 
we turn finally to the challenges brought by the and,in the case of peter gotti,the government to the sentences imposed by the district court in this case.as noted above,we need not address richard gotti sentence,which was already remanded to the district court in a prior proceeding.
peter gotti 
peter gotti challenges to his sentence and forfeiture order 
peter gotti challenges both the length of his sentence and the forfeiture order against him.with regard to his various challenges to the judicial that influenced the calculation of his guidelines sentence,we vacate his sentence pursuant to united states crosby,cir,so that the district court can determine whether to resentence him.
we reject,however,his contention that the forfeiture order should be vacated and remanded for recalculation.in this regard,peter gotti argues solely that the order was excessive,because his rico convictions stemmed solely from his money laundering convictions,and he was not convicted of the more lucrative aspects of the racketeering scheme,such as the extortions and frauds.
initially,we note that peter gotti did not raise this argument at trial.therefore,we must review it under a plain error standard,which requires a showing that there was an error,that it was plain,that it affected substantial rights,and that it seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see,united states williams,cir.
here,we do not believe that there was error,let alone plain error.peter gotti was convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy under.under a,a defendant who is convicted of is to forfeit any property constituting,or derived from,any proceeds which the person obtained,directly or indirectly,from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section.the district court expressly found that it was reasonably foreseeable to peter gotti that the racketeering enterprise in which he participated would engage in activities such as those underlying the counts.see march,sentencing tr.at.that finding is supported by the evidence adduced at trial and is sufficient to support the challenged forfeiture order.see,united states fruchter,cir stating,in challenge to rico forfeiture amount,that s o long as the sentencing court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the criminal conduct through which the proceeds were made was foreseeable to the defendant,the proceeds should form part of the forfeiture judgment.
the government challenge to peter gotti sentence 
when sentencing peter gotti,the district court concluded that under a preponderance of the evidence standard,gotti was the acting boss of the gambino family during all relevant times,and determined that the ila counts,mila counts,local counts,howland hook counts,molfetta counts,tommy ragucci counts,zinna counts,marinelli counts,and alayev counts constituted relevant conduct.march,sentencing tr.the district court also said that it was going to impose a leadership role enhancement under to reflect gotti leadership role in the enterprise.id.at.when the sentencing resumed several weeks later,however,the district court stated that it had changed its mind,and although it still considered the various counts listed above to constitute relevant conduct for sentencing purposes,it was no longer convinced that the leadership role enhancement was warranted.april,sentencing tr.
the government argues that this change in position constituted error on the district court part.it acknowledges that the guidelines are now advisory,and that peter gotti sentence will in any event be remanded to the district court under crosby,at which point the district court may ultimately choose to impose a sentence.it argues,however,that appellate review is still warranted at this juncture,so that the district court the context of reconsidering peter gotti sentence under able to start with the correct calculation of his guidelines sentence.we agree that,in the interest of efficiency,it is appropriate for us to address this issue now.
to evaluate the government argument as to whether a leadership role enhancement had to be imposed under the guidelines,it is first necessary to look at the text of.a provides for a enhancement if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.b provides for a enhancement if the defendant was a manager or supervisor but not an organizer or leader and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.
the commentary to this section is also instructive.first,the introductory commentary notes that t he determination of a defendant role in the offense is to made on the basis of all conduct and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.second,application note provides that t o qualify for an adjustment under this section,the defendant must have been the organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of one or more other participants.an upward departure may be warranted,however,in the case of a defendant who did not organize,lead,manage,or supervise another participant,but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property,assets,or activities of a criminal organization.app.third,application note provides that i n distinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision,titles such as kingpin or boss are not controlling.factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.app.finally,the background states that t his adjustment is included primarily because of concerns about relative responsibility.however,it is also likely that persons who exercise a supervisory or managerial role in the commission of an offense tend to profit more from it and present a greater danger to the public are more likely to recidivate.
in explaining why it had decided not to impose a leadership enhancement on gotti,despite finding him to have been the acting boss and despite finding the various uncharged conduct to constitute relevant conduct for sentencing purposes,the district court explained that it did not think it automatically follows that because somebody is the acting boss of the crime family that he responsible for these four level enhancements in each and every relevant conduct scenario.april,sentencing tr.the district court referred to application note statement that titles such as kingpin or boss are not controlling,and its emphasis on actual authority.it concluded 
the court understands this application note to mean that it is not enough for the government simply to establish that gotti held the position of acting boss,but rather it must present some evidence to show an active role in his participation.applying the application note factors,the court notes that none of them,maybe with the exception of one,support the finding that gotti was an organizer or leader within the meaning and intent of the guideline provision 
the specific evidence put forward in this case strongly suggested that peter gotti did not exhibit typical leadership characteristics that one would expect of the acting boss of a new york crime family,but was simply filling a power vacuum brought about by the incarceration of other members of the gotti family 
there simply no evidence before the court that gotti exercised authority in the commission of these crimes constituting the relevant conduct,that he participated in their commission.there nothing.in fact,the evidence shows that he did not participate in their commission that he recruited any accomplices for those particular crimes,that the tribute payments he received amounted to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,is debatable.
on appeal,the government urges us to find error in the district court refusal to impose the enhancement.this circuit has not always been consistent in describing the standard of review for such determinations,whether we review a district court decision not to impose a leadership enhancement under a de novo or under a clear error standard.see,united states huerta,cir collecting cases,and noting the divergence among various panels of this court.in huerta,we ultimately declined to reach the question,on grounds that we would reach the same result regardless of which standard applied.id.subsequently,we held that,as a general matter,in determining the appropriate standard of review for a district court application of the guidelines to the specific facts of a case,we should follow an approach,adopting a de novo standard of review when the district court application determination was primarily legal in nature,and adopting a clear error approach when the determination was primarily factual.see united states vasquez,cir.since the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,which rendered the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory,we have continued to follow this approach.see,united states selioutsky,cir explaining that even under the sentencing regime,calculation of a correct guidelines sentencing range will normally be part of the process of determining an appropriate sentence that our appellate review of a sentence will therefore include an evaluation of the district court guidelines calculation and that in performing such an evaluation,we will review issues of law de novo,issues of fact under the clearly erroneous standard,and mixed questions of law and fact either de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard depending on whether the question is predominantly legal or factual internal citations omitted.
in this case,we believe that the clear error standard is appropriate,because the district court application of to the facts of this case presents an issue that is predominantly factual rather than legal.indeed,although the government asserts in its brief that there is no dispute about the relevant facts and therefore suggests that de novo review is appropriate,the government has basically devoted its argument to reference to other the district court determination that peter gotti did not exercise a sufficient level of control over the enterprise to be deemed an organizer or leader of the enterprise regardless of whether we would have reached the same decision were a de novo standard to apply,we do not believe that the district court committed clear error here.
pursuant to united states fagans,cir,we vacate ciccone sentence and remand his case for resentencing we note that ciccone has raised numerous arguments as to the district court calculation of his guidelines sentence,and that he also asserts that certain of these arguments similarly invalidate the restitution and forfeiture orders imposed against him.rather than addressing those issues at this juncture,we believe that the more prudent course is to let the district court pass upon them in the first instance when resentencing ciccone.see,fagans,at.because these arguments are also the bases of some of his challenges to his restitution and forfeiture orders,the district court,if it is so inclined,may revisit those calculations as well 
bondi and the government are in agreement that bondi,like ciccone,is entitled to resentencing pursuant to fagans.we therefore vacate bondi sentence and remand his case for resentencing.
iv.conclusion 
we have considered all of the contentions on these appeals and have not found any basis for reversing their convictions.in light of the supreme court decision in booker and this court decisions in crosby and fagans,we remand peter gotti sentence to the district court for consideration of whether to resentence pursuant to crosby,and we remand ciccone and bondi sentences to the district court for resentencing pursuant to fagans.
this decision is frequently abbreviated as scheidler ii,because it represented the case second journey up to the supreme court.the case first visit to the supreme organization for women,scheidler,d is generally referred to as scheidler a recent ruling by the supreme court on yet another issue in the case,scheidler org.for women,d,is known as scheidler iii.for purposes of clarity,we employ these abbreviations in this opinion.
richard gotti appeal was previously severed from this appeal,and his case was remanded to the district court for consideration of resentencing pursuant to crosby.the district court declined to resentence,and richard gotti then moved to reconsolidate his appeal with the instant appeal so that he could join in the arguments of the other to the extent that they benefitted him.accordingly,we assume that richard gotti joins in those of the challenges to their convictions that are applicable to his own convictions.given that we ultimately reject all of those challenges for the reasons set forth infra,and that the district court has already considered whether to resentence him pursuant to crosby,there is no need for a further remand of richard gotti case.
for a brief discussion of the meaning of those terms,see infra page.
those ten defendants,certain of whom figure in the factual recitation below,were peter piacenti,anna eylenkrig,thomas lisi,carmine malara,jerome orsino,frank scollo,vincent nasso,anthony pansini,julius jules nasso,and salvatore cannata.

these three examples illustrate various ways in which an exto
