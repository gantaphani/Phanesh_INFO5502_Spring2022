alfred lenoci,lenoci appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet bond arterton,judge convicting the defendant,after a guilty plea,of one count of bribery in violation of a and one count of executing a scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services in violation of and.on appeal,lenoci contends that the district court erred by failing to group his two counts of conviction under c or d of the united states sentencing guidelines manual.we find meritless the defendant claim that his counts should have been grouped under c.as for his claim that the district court erroneously failed to group his convictions under d,we decide the issue on the ground of harmless error.we write,however,to describe some of the ambiguities of d that would have made resolution of the defendant claim difficult had his challenge demonstrated harmful error.we also direct the clerk of the court to forward a certified copy of this opinion to the chairperson and chief counsel of the united states sentencing commission 
background 
the facts of this case are largely derived from the defendant presentence report.according to his presentence report,lenoci,along with his son and brother,sought to become the preferred real estate developer for certain tracts of land in bridgeport,connecticut.one of these was a parcel of land at the former site of the father panik village housing project.to further his development plans at the site,lenoci sought the support and approval of bridgeport,joseph ganim.lenoci agreed to pay for a variety of construction projects for the mayor personal residence.in exchange,ganim used his official position to advance lenoci efforts to develop the land in particular,ganim wrote a letter in august to the bridgeport housing authority to support lenoci request to enter into a long term lease for the site.
similarly,in late,lenoci sought to develop a parcel of land on the bridgeport waterfront known as steel point.to secure the rights for development,lenoci agreed to pay the mayor intermediary for every square foot of commercial space in bridgeport developed in the future by lenoci company,including any development at the steel point site.at a later meeting,lenoci also agreed to raise funds for the mayor anticipated campaign for governor,in return for ganim support for the venture at steel point.
with respect to the father panik village site,lenoci also sought state development funds to subsidize the proposed facility.from june to october,lenoci provided mark trinkley,a senior development manager at the state of connecticut department of economic and community development,with approximately worth of landscaping services,home improvements,and other personal benefits.these expenditures were made in exchange for trinkley recommendation that million in state development funds be directed to lenoci company.
on october,lenoci waived his right to a grand jury indictment and pled guilty to a information arising from his attempts to illegally advance real estate development ventures in bridgeport.in count one,the defendant was charged under with bribing joseph ganim.in count two,lenoci was charged under and with using the united states mails to execute a scheme to deprive the public of the honest services of mark trinkley.
pursuant to a written plea agreement,lenoci and the government made several stipulations concerning their view as to how lenoci sentence should be calculated under the november sentencing guidelines.the parties agreed that the offense level for count one should be determined under,entitled offering,giving,soliciting,or receiving a bribe extortion under color of official right.under that guideline,the parties agreed to a base offense level of under a,plus an enhancement under b b because the offense involved a payment for the purpose of influencing an elected official or any official holding a or sensitive position.thus,the parties calculated an offense level of under count one.
similarly,the parties agreed that the offense level for count two should be determined under,which applies to fraud involving deprivation of the intangible right to the honest services of public officials conspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions.under that guideline,the parties agreed to a base offense level of under a,plus a enhancement under b a based upon the parties stipulation that the fraud concerning mark trinkley was valued at.see also b e.thus,the parties calculated an offense level of under count two.
importantly,however,the plea agreement did not stipulate whether counts one and two should be grouped.the complex grouping provisions in the guidelines describe the calculation of a defendant offense level in cases,like lenoci,which involve multiple counts of conviction.see to.the defendant argued that his two counts involved substantially the same harm and,therefore,should have been grouped under c or d.the defendant contends that such a grouping would have led to a combined offense level of.with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,his adjusted offense level would have been.
by contrast,the government argued that lenoci counts involved distinct transactions and victims,such that grouping was inappropriate.under the government analysis,if the offenses were not grouped,lenoci would have a combined offense level of,which,subject to the reduction for acceptance of responsibility,would have resulted in an adjusted offense level of.the day before sentencing,the defendant was made aware of an alternative argument proposed by the government.the government stated that even if the counts were grouped as lenoci argues they should be,the court should then apply a upward adjustment under b,which states that i f the offense involved more than one bribe or extortion,increase by levels.with such an adjustment,the government argued,lenoci adjusted offense level still would have been.thus,under the government view,lenoci offense level would have been the same regardless of the court resolution of the d grouping issue,so that any error made by the district court was harmless.
the probation office took the view that the offenses should be grouped under d but concurred with the government alternative calculation,finding that the upward adjustment is appropriate.the defendant took issue with both the probation office recommendation and the government alternative calculation,claiming that the upward adjustment was not consistent with the parties plea agreement.
at lenoci july,sentencing hearing,the district court declined to group the two counts.the court determined that the two counts did not involve the same aggregate harm 
count one is driven by the fact of payment to influence an elected official while count two is driven by the value of the benefits or loss,such that you do have the kind of aggregate value that is a predicate for this concept of grouping a t the bottom line it is an endeavor to buy the influence of public officials,one is elected,one is not elected,they two different programs,and the difference of officials,schemes,the official s status,seems to me to fall outside what is contemplated to be achieved by the grouping.
thus,starting with the combined offense level of,the court applied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,producing an adjusted offense level of.having decided not to group the counts,the court did not reach the government alternative argument that a upward adjustment under b would have applied in any event.
the district court then granted the government motion for a downward departure under based upon lenoci cooperation with the government in a investigation into public corruption in bridgeport.had the court not applied the downward departure,lenoci would have been given a sentence in the range of months of incarceration based on his adjusted offense level of.however,because of the downward departure,lenoci sentence was not rigidly dictated by the court calculation of lenoci adjusted offense level.rather,having considered lenoci adjusted offense level in conjunction with the government motion,the court exercised its discretion to principally sentence lenoci to a term of imprisonment of months and day on each count,to be served concurrently lenoci filed a timely notice of appeal on august.on august,the district court granted lenoci request for continuation of release on bond pending the outcome of this appeal.
discussion 
when examining district court determinations as to the sentencing guidelines,we review factual findings for clear error and legal interpretations de novo.see united states gordon,cir,cert.denied,d united states carboni,cir.when applying the guidelines to the facts of this case,we give due deference to the district court.e.
the key grouping provision for our purposes is subsection d of,entitled groups of closely related counts.it provides as follows 
groups of closely related counts 
all counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule 
d when the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss,the quantity of a substance involved,or some other measure of aggregate harm,or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.
offenses covered by the following guidelines are to be grouped under this subsection 
specifically excluded from the operation of this subsection are 
all offenses in chapter two,part a 
for multiple counts of offenses that are not listed,grouping under this subsection may or may not be appropriate a determination must be made based upon the facts of the case and the applicable guidelines including specific offense characteristics and other adjustments used to determine the offense level.
exclusion of an offense from grouping under this subsection does not necessarily preclude grouping under another subsection.
the guideline begins by stating the standard which governs grouping under this section.namely,a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together it goes on to explain what this means in subsections a,b,c,and d.most important for our purposes,subsection d provides certain circumstances where counts are deemed to involve substantially the same harm.it lists several guidelines and,using seemingly mandatory language,provides that offenses covered by those guidelines are to be grouped.it then goes on to provide another list of guidelines which are s pecifically excluded from the operation of this subsection.afterward,it states that offenses which fall under guidelines that are not listed should be examined on a basis.
i.the to be grouped language of d 
a critical preliminary issue presented by d is the meaning of its seemingly mandatory provision that o ffenses covered by the following guidelines are to be grouped.d emphasis added.the list of offenses under subsection d which are to be grouped is composed of rows of guideline sections from chapter of the united states sentencing guidelines manual.individual guidelines that fall under the same part of chapter all contain the same alphabetical letter,appear on the same line,and are separated from each other by commas.thus,for example,all of the guidelines in the second row of the to be grouped list are from part c of chapter,which addresses offenses that involve public officials.each row is separated from the other rows by.notably for our purposes,and,the guidelines covering lenoci offenses,both appear in the second line in the listing of to be grouped offenses.thus,a question is raised as to whether,contrary to the district court determination,the guidelines provide that lenoci offenses must be grouped.
unfortunately,the guidelines are not entirely clear as to what is to be grouped under d.had we not the benefit of interpretive case law,the provision would suggest at least three possible interpretations.we could 
group all counts that fall under guidelines which appear anywhere in the to be grouped list 
group all counts that fall under guidelines that appear on the same line of the list or 
group all counts that fall under a particular guideline in the list,all counts under are to be grouped together.
the first interpretation,namely,that we are to group all offenses in the to be grouped list,has been rejected by most courts that have considered the issue and also poses practical difficulties of aggregation.in our circuit,this approach is likely precluded by our decision in united states napoli,cir,cert.denied,d.napoli addressed whether or not fraud and money laundering counts should have been grouped under d.at the time,the applicable guidelines,fraud and money laundering,both appeared in the d list of offenses which are to be grouped under this subsection.in a footnote in that case,we stated that we reject the broad view that money laundering and fraud counts can be grouped under subsection d simply because they both appear on its list of counts to be grouped.id.at.we pointed out that the list of counts to be grouped under d contains offenses,such as drug dealing and fraud,that measure the harm they seek to punish in different ways,drug quantity versus amount of money.because the guidelines for each of these offenses measure harm differently,it would be impossible to use either guideline to determine an offense level based on the total or aggregate harm from is required when counts are grouped under subsection d.id.therefore,we concluded that the appearance of both guidelines on the to be grouped list was not conclusive.
furthermore,this first interpretation is contrary to case law in many other circuits where grouping is not automatic simply because each count falls under a guideline in the to be grouped list.see united states williams,cir,cert.denied,d united states taylor,cir united states seligsohn,cir,cert.denied,d united states harper,cir united states johnson,cir.in addition,in several cases in this circuit where we eventually concluded that grouping is appropriate for counts that fall under different guidelines,we first engaged in an analysis of whether the offenses were of the same general type and were otherwise suitable for grouping.see gordon,at united states petrillo,cir united states fitzgerald,cir.if appearance on the list of counts to be grouped was conclusive and grouping automatic,the careful analysis in those cases would have been unnecessary.
lastly,this interpretation is not supported by application note to the application note states that c ounts involving offenses to which different offense guidelines apply are grouped together under subsection d if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection.this strongly suggests that the grouping of counts that fall under different guidelines is not automatic merely because the counts are covered by guidelines in the to be grouped list.
the second interpretation would automatically group counts that fall under guidelines that appear on the same row of the list.this makes intuitive sense because the offenses under guidelines listed on the same row are generally similar,having been selected for inclusion in the same part of chapter.in addition,the presentation of the list,which separates guidelines on the same row with commas and uses semicolons to set these lines off from the rest,might suggest that this clustering was intentional.furthermore,guidelines on the same row generally measure harm in the same way,making it easier to aggregate harm for counts under guidelines on the same line.
at least two circuit courts have been sympathetic to the view that courts should automatically group counts covered by guidelines which appear on the same row of the to be grouped list.see united states zanghi,cir holding that grouping is automatic for counts under guidelines and,and while finding uncertainty in the case law as to whether it is imperative to group all offenses covered by guidelines listed in paragraph of d,noting that such cases do not address grouping as to offenses covered by guidelines listed in the same row of that paragraph,cert.denied,d united states emerson,cir stating that t here is some question whether all of the offense sections listed under d are to be grouped with each other,or if only those sections listed in the same row are to be grouped together.
on the other hand,there is little in the language of the sentencing guidelines to support an approach under which grouping is automatic for counts in the same row but not for those on different rows.napoli,at a minimum,provides no support for this approach.although the offenses in napoli involved guidelines listed on different rows,it did not distinguish between offenses under different guidelines on different rows and offenses under different guidelines on the same row.furthermore,application note to draws no distinction as to grouping procedures on a basis rather,it seems to group offenses under different guidelines the same way regardless of whether or not they are listed on the same line.in addition,d lists certain guidelines that are s pecifically excluded from the operation of this subsection.these listings have the same format as those which are to be grouped.this suggests that the physical layout of the guidelines on the page is largely just a matter of visual clarity and alphabetical ordering,without legal significance.given that some rows contain only one guideline,it is particularly difficult to find that the placement of certain guidelines on the same row is meant to signify a particular relationship among those guidelines.in short,other than the guideline aesthetic presentation,there is little support in this circuit for the view that the placement of certain guidelines on the same line has legal significance.
under a third approach,only offenses covered by the same guideline must be grouped when that common guideline appears in the to be grouped list.thus,the guideline language specifying that o ffenses covered by the following guidelines are to be grouped under this subsection is read as applying to counts under individual guidelines,but not across guidelines.if,for example,both of lenoci offenses were covered under,a to be grouped guideline,then,following this interpretation,both offenses would have to be grouped.
this third approach is consistent with application note to,which states that c ounts involving offenses to which different offense guidelines apply are grouped together under subsection d if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection.emphasis added.by specifying a specific approach to take when different guidelines on the list are involved,the application note implies that grouping is automatic for counts covered by the same guideline.see united states,cir if the offenses at issue are covered by one of the listed guidelines we do not analyze the facts of the particular case.here,the offenses in counts one through three are covered by congress has determined that such offenses are categorically groupable under d.yet,as discussed further in the next section,the view that we must group counts that fall under the same to be grouped guideline has not met with universal agreement.
the preceding discussion shows that the plain language of the to be grouped provision in d is ambiguous.while the application notes and interpretive case law may clarify that language and perhaps foreclose certain interpretations,the range of interpretations available has surely limited the value of the to be grouped language,which was likely intended to offer straightforward guidance as to grouping in at least certain instances.
we also note that the three interpretations described here are not exhaustive,and we raise a question as to whether mandatory grouping,under any of these interpretations,ought to be limited based on whether the relevant offense level calculations primarily involve some measure of harm that can be aggregated.for as we discuss in the next section,in considering whether lenoci offenses should be grouped,it is not clear how much weight we ought to give to the fact that his harmful conduct can not easily be aggregated under the guidelines.
ii.aggregation of the harm from defendant conduct 
if the plain meaning of the to be grouped language failed to resolve the grouping question presented here,we would turn next to the question of whether the counts here ought nevertheless be grouped under the more general provisions of d.the government argues,inter alia,that grouping is inappropriate here because the offense levels associated with each count are not determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm.d.the offense level for count one was determined by the upward adjustment triggered by ganim status as an elected official.see b b.by contrast,the offense level for count two was determined by the monetary amount paid to trinkley.see b a,b e.as the government correctly notes,the harm from these offenses can not easily be aggregated were they placed into the same group.
the difficulty presented by this challenge is that the relevant guidelines,and,while not identical,are virtually identical.in fact,had both of lenoci counts been deemed to fall under the same guideline,then under any of the three interpretations of the to be grouped language discussed in the previous section,we would ordinarily have grouped them,despite the difficulties in aggregation noted by the government.if we were compelled by the guidelines to group both of lenoci offenses had they fallen under the same guideline,then the government concern about aggregation is diminished somewhat.furthermore,one of the purposes of the grouping provisions is to reduce the importance of the charging decision.see,ch.pt.d,intro.cmt.stating that the grouping rules serve to limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct quoted in united states ahmad,cir.we should,therefore,be hesitant to find both that we must group counts that fall under identical to be grouped guidelines but that we need not group counts that fall under virtually identical to be grouped guidelines.
there is,however,some precedent suggesting that grouping is not automatic even for counts which fall under identical to be grouped guidelines.the government cites united states mcelroy,cir,where we held that the district court did not err when it declined to group counts of paying bribes with counts of receiving bribes,even though they appear to have fallen under the same to be grouped guideline.in that case,we did not require grouping because the counts did not involve either the same property or the same victim.id.based on mcelroy,it would seem that grouping is not mandatory even for counts under the same to be grouped guideline.
even if mcelroy was a case in which we failed to group counts in the same to be grouped guideline,however,we must read it in light of subsequent case law.for example,in napoli,we explicitly disapproved of the requirement which led the mcelroy court not to group counts that fell under the same to be grouped guideline.see napoli,at.furthermore,in united states gelzer,cir,we held that it was clear error not to have grouped two firearms counts,both of which fell under,a to be grouped guideline.in that case,our analysis turned,perhaps exclusively,on the fact that the relevant guideline appeared in the to be grouped list.the case at bar does not present a proper occasion to resolve these issues,however,because we find,as discussed in section iv,infra,that if the district court did err as to grouping under d,such error was harmless.
iii.grouping under c 
the defendant argues that if his counts are not grouped under d,they should be grouped under c.under c,counts involve substantially the same harm and should be grouped w hen one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in,or other adjustment to,the guideline applicable to another of the counts.c.this provision is intended to prevent double counting of closely related offense behavior.c,cmt.according to lenoci,his conviction under count two for honest services mail fraud requires that the public be deprived of the intangible right to the honest services
