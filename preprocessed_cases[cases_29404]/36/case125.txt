ii.discussion 
the csra,as amended through june,imposes criminal liability on persons who have been ordered to pay support for their children living in another state and who have willfully failed to do so for extended periods or in substantial amounts.the offense is defined as follows 
a person who 
willfully fails to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than year,or is greater than 
travels in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to evade a support obligation,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than year,or is greater than or 
willfully fails to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than years,or is greater than 
shall be punished as provided in subsection c.
a.the term support obligation is defined as any amount determined under a court order or an order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a state or of an indian tribe to be due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living.id.f.the punishment prescribed in subsection c is a fine up to six months imprisonment for a violation of subsection a,see id.c or a fine up to two years imprisonment for a subsequent violation of subsection a or for any violation of subsection a or a,see id.c.in addition,subsection d provides that u pon a conviction under this section,the court shall order restitution under section in an amount equal to the total unpaid support obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing.id.d.
salahuddin contends that the presence of the mandatory restitution provision demonstrates that congress intended not simply to criminalize willful disregard of obligations but also to provide monetary relief for the beneficiaries of those obligations.she asserts that the department of justice lacks sufficient funding to bring prosecutions against more than a small percentage of the parents who are in violation of the csra,and that i nferring a private right of action from the csra in favor of custodial parents who seek restitution of payments owed under a state child support decree would advance congress evident intent to enforce the child support obligations of noncustodial parents living in different states from their children salahuddin brief on appeal at.although these assertions may be true,we remain unpersuaded that the language and history of the act reveal congressional intent to authorize a private right of action.
the csra does not expressly provide that a person entitled to a support payment may bring a private action under the act to obtain that payment.the question thus is whether such a private right of action is implied that question,in turn,depends on whether it can reasonably be inferred that congress intended to create such a private remedy.see,karahalios national federation of federal employees,local,d transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d transamerica touche ross redington,d cannon university of chicago,d.
in cort ash,d,which involved a private litigant claim for damages for violation of a criminal statute that had not theretofore been thought to include a private remedy,the supreme court set out four factors to be considered whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted that is,does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff whether there is any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one whether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states,so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in subsequent cases,the court emphasized that the four cort factors do not necessarily carry equal weight and that the dispositive question is whether congress intended to create a private right of action.transamerica,at.if that question is answered in the negative,our inquiry is at an end see,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d our cases subsequent to cort ash have plainly stated that our focus must be on the intent of congress the key to the inquiry is the intent of the legislature.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted touche ross redington,at.indeed,the first three factors discussed in language and focus of the statute,its legislative history,and its purpose,see at.ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative intent.transamerica,at.quoting touche ross redington,at.unless such congressional intent can be inferred from the language of the statute,the statutory structure,or some other source,the essential predicate for implication of a private remedy simply does not exist.karahalios national federation of federal employees,local,at.quoting thompson thompson,d.the ultimate issue is whether congress intended to create a private right of action.california sierra club,d.
as an elemental canon of statutory construction,we are to be especially reluctant to imply a private right of action where the statute explicitly provides a different remedy.karahalios national federation of federal employees,local,at.quoting transamerica,at.in the absence of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent,we are compelled to conclude that congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers ass n,d.
further,the mere fact that the statute was designed to protect a certain group does not require the implication of a private cause of action for
