greg and appeal judgments terminating parental rights to their minor children,valerie and gregory together the children,under welfare and institutions code section 
on appeal,greg and assert the court erred in terminating their parental rights because there is no substantial evidence to support the court adoptability finding and the court failed to apply the sibling relationship exception.subsequent to the filing of the appeal,appellate counsel for the minors minors counsel asserted the viability of the joint adoption by the children caregivers was in doubt.this court has been informed on appeal that the children caregivers,vera,and her adult daughter,juana,seek to jointly adopt the children.minors counsel also filed a motion asking this court to take additional evidence on this issue,which we ordered considered with the appeal.
we conclude the order terminating parental rights must be reversed because the finding of adoptability was not supported by substantial evidence.the assessment report prepared by the san diego county health and human services agency agency for the children was inadequate and failed to consider a whether juana was qualified to adopt them,and b whether there was a legal impediment to a joint adoption by vera and juana.the report also inadequately assessed gregory medical condition.we deny the motion to take additional evidence on appeal.we direct the court on remand to order the agency to complete an assessment that is in compliance with section,subdivision i,and that addresses the deficiencies in the original assessment report identified in this opinion.we also direct the court to hold a new hearing under section to select and implement a permanent plan for the children.
factual and procedural background 
in june valerie and gregory became dependents of the court under section,subdivision b and were removed from parental custody.greg was a heroin addict and had recently relapsed.had an extensive criminal and substance abuse history.her parental rights to an older daughter,had been terminated through dependency proceedings.
the court denied reunification services to,and ordered reunification services for greg.on the recommendation of the agency,the court placed the children in the approved home of vera,a extended family member.
vera met the family when she was the principal of an elementary school that attended.at greg request,vera cared for the children for several months following gregory birth.vera lived with her four children,two of whom she had adopted from liberia through international procedures.
vera adult daughter,juana,and juana partner,andrea,provided respite and daycare for the children.andrea was the adoptive sister of,the children biological.
during the initial review period,did not contact the social worker or visit the children.greg did not maintain his sobriety.at the review hearing,the court terminated reunification services and set a section hearing.
in reports prepared for the section hearing,the social worker stated that valerie,now four years old,was healthy,sociable and doing well in school,but she had behavior problems for which she was receiving therapeutic services.valerie was very confused about where she was going to live,who her parents were and who would take care of her.
although the agency reported gregory was healthy,it also reported he was small for his age,had recently fallen below pediatric growth charts and suffered from asthma.a year earlier,gregory had a seizure,but tests showed no brain abnormality.the emergency room physician recommended that gregory undergo a neurological examination to rule out seizure disorders.a developmental evaluation showed gregory had some delay in speech development,possibly caused by a very small lower jaw and overbite.because of gregory short stature,small lower jaw,seizure and gastrointestinal problems,the public health nurse recommended that gregory undergo genetic testing.
the agency indicated gregory had a pediatric visit scheduled the following month to monitor his below normal growth.if he did not register on the growth charts by that visit,further testing would be necessary.the agency also reported that gregory recently had an electroencephalogram eeg and was scheduled to undergo a thorough genetics test as well.gregory had anemia and additional testing was required to determine its cause.in later addendum reports,however,the agency did not provide information concerning the results of gregory pediatric examination,eeg results,or the status or result of any other medical or developmental test.
the social worker reported that the children were bonded to their caregivers and to the extended family.the report indicated the caregivers are in the process of completing their home study and have made significant progress the caregivers have adopted previously and have had an approved home study for international adoption.there is no foreseeable reason that they would not be approved to adopt valerie and gregory.italics added.the social worker recommended the court find that the permanent plan of adoption with the current caregiver is appropriate and is identified as the preferred permanency plan.italics added.
on june,the court granted vera application for de facto parent status.
greg and each filed a section petition asking the court for placement of the children under a plan of family maintenance services.at a hearing on the section petitions,valerie therapist,kimberly corbett,testified valerie possibly had reactive attachment disorder,disinhibited type,as a result of pathogenic parenting from birth through age two.in corbett opinion,valerie had attachment issues,but was starting to form more secure attachments with her current caregivers.
corbett believed both vera and juana were the children foster parents.corbett had more contact with juana than vera because juana brought valerie to her weekly therapy appointments.valerie wanted to change her last name to juana last name,and she no longer wanted to be valerie because valerie was bad and bad things happened to valerie.
the court denied the parents section petitions.it found that both children were emotionally fragile and needed to become attached to a constant,trustworthy parent.the children,particularly valerie,trusted vera and had a strong,nurturing relationship with her.the court stated that the children would face nothing but potential injury if they were removed from vera and her daughter.
other than the evidence presented at the section hearing,the parties presented no additional evidence at the section hearing.greg argued the children might not be adoptable because of their unresolved medical and emotional problems and because the agency did not assess whether other homes were available to the children if the foster home was not approved for adoption.
vera asked to address the court.she stated,i have daughter and i have started the process of applying for adoption,and we have started the home study process.i am an adoptive mother of two other children,so i have been through the adoptive process before.italics added.vera informed the court we have started the adoption process,and we intend to follow through with it should valerie and gregory become available.they are very much a part of our family.italics added.
the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the children were likely to be adopted by vera if parental rights were terminated,noting vera had taken appropriate steps to start the adoptive process and clearly intended to adopt both children.the court found that adoption was in the children best interests and there were no exceptions under section,subdivision c the court terminated parental rights and designated vera as the children prospective adoptive parent.
appellate proceedings 
in december minors counsel informed the court that the viability of the joint adoption by the caregivers was in doubt and requested oral argument on behalf of the children.we then asked the parties to submit simultaneous letter briefs addressing the following issues 
did the agency identify both the foster parent and her adult daughter as prospective adoptive parents if so,did the assessment report prepared for the hearing under section comply with the requirements under section,subdivision i,and 
in view of the recommended neurological and genetic testing of gregory,did the assessment report contain an adequate evaluation of his medical condition as required by section,subdivision i 
what is the legal authority for the joint adoption of a child by two persons who are not married to each other and who are not partners in a civil union with each other 
is there any legal impediment to the joint adoption of the children by the foster parent and her adult daughter 
on january,minors counsel filed a motion asking this court to take additional evidence through her sworn declaration under section of the code of civil procedure.see cal.rules of court,rule c a party may request the reviewing court to take evidence on appeal.greg and did not oppose the motion,but the agency did.we ordered the motion to be considered with the appeal.
discussion 
minors motion to take additional evidence under section of the code of civil procedure 
minors counsel asks this court to take additional evidence under code of civil procedure section of the facts contained in her declaration.the agency objects to admission of the proffered postjudgment evidence on the grounds that it is untested,inadmissible hearsay its admission would violate due process it is evidence that was not before the juvenile court at the time it rendered its decision and it contravenes the holding of the california supreme court in in re zeth cal th,d,zeth.
in zeth,supra,cal th,d,an appeal challenging the juvenile court finding that the beneficial relationship exception to adoption did not apply,appellate counsel sought to augment the record on appeal with postjudgment evidence that the parent was currently interacting with the child and the relative caretaker had felt pressured by the social services agency to agree to adopt the child.id.at,d.the california supreme court held the court of appeal erred in receiving and considering the postjudgment evidence.id.at,d.the court in zeth set forth the general rule that 
a n appeal reviews the correctness of a judgment as of the time of its rendition,upon a record of matters which were before the trial court for its consideration.citation.this rule reflects an essential distinction between the trial and the appellate court that it is the province of the trial court to decide questions of fact and of the appellate court to decide questions of law citation.the rule promotes the orderly settling of factual questions and disputes in the trial court,provides a meaningful record for review,and serves to avoid prolonged delays on appeal.although appellate courts are authorized to make findings of fact on appeal by code of civil procedure section and rule of the california rules of court,the authority should be exercised sparingly.citation.absent exceptional circumstances,no such findings should be made.citation.citations.zeth,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
zeth also made it clear that t here is no blanket exception to the general rule for juvenile dependency appeals.review of such appeals is governed by generally applicable rules of appellate procedure,with proper deference to be paid to the factual findings and uncontested rulings of the juvenile court,and all appropriate inferences to be drawn in favor of the judgment below.zeth,supra,cal th at,d.only under exceptional circumstances may an appellate court properly receive and consider postjudgment evidence that was not before the juvenile court.id.at,d.
this case does not present any exceptional circumstances warranting our departure from the general rules of appellate procedure to consider postjudgment evidence.minors counsel is asking us to revisit what are essentially substantive evidence issues with new evidence and make new factual task that is better suited for the trial court than for an appellate court.the statutory scheme does not authorize a reviewing court to substitute its own judgment as to what is in the child best interests for the trial court determination in that regard,reached pursuant to the statutory scheme comprehensive and controlling provisions.zeth,supra,cal th at,d.further,the record already prepared is adequate to decide the issues,whether substantial evidence supports the court finding on adoptability.we therefore deny the motion to take additional evidence on appeal.
ii.adoptability 
introduction 
greg contends insufficient evidence supports the court finding that the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.joins in greg argument.greg asserts the evidence shows valerie was emotionally fragile and her behaviors were deteriorating,and gregory had unresolved neurological and genetic issues that required further testing.he further asserts the agency assessment report does not constitute substantial evidence of the children adoptability because it contained only limited information concerning the prospective adoptive parents,who did not live together,and the agency did not report on the nature of each caregiver relationship to the children,the children living arrangements,and whether other families were interested in adopting the children.
in supplemental briefing,contends the agency did not specifically identify vera and juana as the children prospective adoptive parents,and the record does not clearly reflect who was seeking to adopt the children.she asserts the children are not generally adoptable thus,the agency must identify the prospective adoptive parents to allow the court to assess the suitability of the prospective adoptive home.
greg asserts the agency did not specifically identify vera and juana as the children prospective adoptive parents and did not make the court aware of the proposed joint adoption.he states the issue was raised for the first time during closing argument at the section hearing when county counsel referred to vera and juana as joint caregivers,who wish to adopt,and vera told the court that she and juana had together started the adoption process.greg contends the inadequate assessment report left many unanswered questions concerning the children proposed adoption and did not substantially comply with section,subdivision i,and.and minors counsel join in greg argument.
minors counsel maintains the agency did not expressly state in its reports that both vera and juana were prospective adoptive parents,but the record permits the inference the agency intended to permit them to jointly adopt the children.minors counsel argues the assessment report contains little of the relevant information required by section,subdivision i through,and can not support a finding the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.she also asserts gregory had and continues to have significant medical issues for which medical professionals recommended genetic and neurological testing,and the agency did not provide any test results in its assessment report as required by section,subdivision i.minors counsel asserts the children best interests will be served by remanding the matter to the trial court for a new hearing on the issue of the children adoptability.
the agency now admits vera and juana applied to adopt the children jointly.it argues that its assessment report need only be in substantial compliance with statutory requirements,and asserts that where an assessment is deemed incomplete,a reviewing court looks only at the totality of the evidence and whether any deficiencies were significant.the agency maintains the court had the information it needed to make an informed decision regarding the children best interests,including the fact that one of the prospective adoptive parents was a licensed foster parent and at one time had an approved home study for international adoption.with respect to gregory test results,the agency argues that gregory caregivers were involved in his medical treatment and were aware of the concerns about his condition.it contends the totality of the evidence provided to the court constitutes a sufficient basis for a finding that gregory did not suffer from severe problems that impacted his adoptabilit
