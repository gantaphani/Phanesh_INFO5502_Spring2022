a father had been paying child support for many years.in january,he was laid off from his job as a software salesman due to the economic downturn in the high technology field.accordingly,he filed a motion motion to reduce his child support obligation and family code section,subdivision b section b that the modification order be made retroactive to the date he served the motion.the mother opposed the motion.
the court granted the motion in part by reducing monthly child support,but refused to make the order retroactive.concluding that the father had other financial resources and that the needs of the children would make retroactivity inappropriate and unfair,the court made the order effective on the date of the hearing on the motion.
the father appeals the trial court failure to reduce the child support obligation retroactively.he claims that the court abused its discretion under section b by not making the order effective on the date the motion was served.
under section b,if a court modifies or terminates a support order because of a party unemployment,the trial court must make its order retroactive unless it finds good cause to deny retroactivity and specifies its reasons.the statute,however,does not define good cause justifying a trial court denial of retroactivity.
we define good cause as it applies to section b.we determine that the court provided specific reasons for its order,supported by the evidence,sufficient to constitute good cause.we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the father request for retroactivity.accordingly,we affirm the trial court order.

iv.mark changed circumstances.
on january,mark was laid off from his software sales position with imanage,where he had worked since april.mark testified that his termination was involuntary.over leslie opposition,the court ultimately found that to be the case.
because of the downturn in the economy and the weakening of jobs in his area,mark decided after being laid off that he would become in the franchise business that he and his wife had begun to develop in discussed post.this decision was reflected in both his january declaration and in his testimony at the july hearing.mark declared that imanage had been laying off staff continuously for a period of over six months before his january layoff and that there was no possibility that he would be called back to work.he testified that,before his termination,he made inquiries about opportunities to stay in the high technology field,but high tech has been devastated,as is,and decided to devote attention to creating a business that is very predictable that could afford him the same level of income as he had previously earned.mark also testified that,after being laid off,he continued to make inquiries of people he knew in the industry and concluded that his chances of locating another position were very poor.
since around,mark and his wife had planned to own and operate a subway sandwich shop in san francisco.they had expended approximately toward this venture up to july.originally,mark and his wife had intended that she would run the business,as she was not employed for most of.since she received another contract to work elsewhere and because mark was laid off,they later decided that mark would operate the business.as of the time of the july hearing,mark expected that the store would be operating in october.he estimated that,based upon the income figures for other franchises,his store would have approximate monthly profits of after one year of operation.
procedural history 
mark filed and served the motion for modification of child support on january.mark sought a modification of a prior order entered pursuant to stipulation,under which he paid monthly child support for two minor children in the total amount of.he requested that the proposed order modifying child support be made retroactive to the date of service of the motion.
mark alleged in support of the motion that he had been involuntarily laid off in january by imanage.he alleged further that,given the downturn in the high technology market and his knowledge that colleagues in the industry had been unable to find work,he had decided to become by developing a subway sandwich franchise business in san francisco.
leslie opposition to the motion requested that the court establish guideline support by determining mark actual earning ability and by imputing income based upon his prior earnings.leslie declaration urged that t he court should not allow mark to shirk his child support obligations after his job mysteriously disappeared at the beginning of this year just after he had to start paying per month in child support.her declaration indicated,inter alia,that mark request should be denied and child support should be established based upon imputed income of per year.she also requested that she be awarded attorney fees of at least.
after a specially set hearing on july,the court entered an order on august,in which it granted mark motion for modification of child support,ordered that child support be reduced from to per month as requested by mark,made the reduction order effective july,and denied leslie for attorney fees.in its order,the court expressly found that mark did not voluntarily terminate employment with imanage and that he has been making good faith efforts in the current economy to produce a higher income not only for himself but for the minor children as well.
on august,mark filed alternative motions for new trial code civ,subds,to reconsider code civ,subd.a,or to vacate the prior order code civ,alternative motions.the court denied mark alternative motions on october.it stated i would amplify the court order that i made previously by saying that in doing that,least mentally but did articulate in the order that i made,findings in doing that,which included the respondent other resources,i am persuaded that the padilla case in re marriage of padilla th,d padilla and its reasoning are persuasive i felt on balance that,in fact,making the finding that i did was equitable for both parties.and in fact,if i had made the order retroactive to the date of its original filing,i think leonard would have had some period of time where he would have had to make any payments because it would have been basically a credit for some period of time,which in light of the needs of the children did seem to me to be appropriate or fair.later during the hearing,the court stated that the priority number one is the support of the children.
mark filed a notice of appeal on november.the court order granting mark motion to modify his child support obligation is an appealable order.see code civ,subd.a county of los angeles patrick th,d.
discussion 
standard of review.
a trial court award concerning child support is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton th,d cheriton see also in re marriage of chandler th,d in re marriage of wood,supra,th at,d.likewise,a determination regarding a request for modification of a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found from examining the record below.in re marriage of drake th,d see also in re marriage of mccann th,d.in addition,a trial court decision whether to make an order for child support retroactive is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.in re marriage of drake,supra,th at,d.
of course,the trial court discretion is not unfettered.it has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation in re marriage of muldrow d.cheriton,supra,th at,d.moreover,we are mindful that the deferential standard concerning child support orders is tempered significantly by this state uniform child support guideline et the present statutory scheme limits the broad discretion accorded to the trial court under prior law and channels its remaining discretion within the new statutory parameters.citation.in re marriage of drake,supra,th at,d.in short,the trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the law regarding child support.citations.county of stanislaus gibbs th,d.cheriton,supra,th at,d.
the order challenged on appeal by mark concerned the modification of child support after a judgment of dissolution.accordingly,we review the order under an abuse of discretion standard.
ii.child support.
the duty of a parent to support the parent child or children is a fundamental parental obligation.moss superior court cal th,d,see also.our state has a strong public policy that favors adequate child support.see,county of kern castle th,d stewart gomez th,d.
our statutes clearly reflect this policy in their uniform child support guideline.see.the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.in setting guideline support,the courts are required to adhere to certain principles,including these a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a.each parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.children should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children,subd.f.cheriton,supra,th at,d.further,there is a presumption that the custodial parent contributes a significant portion of available resources for the support of the children,subd.i.as an overarching concern,c hild support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support reflecting the state high standard of living and high costs of raising children compared to other states,subd.l.
an order of child support may be modified or terminated at any time as the court deems to be necessary,subd.a.statutory procedures for modification of child support require a party to introduce admissible evidence of changed circumstances as a necessary predicate for modification.cheriton,supra,th at,d see also in re marriage of brinkman th,d.the burden of proof to establish that changed circumstances warrant a downward adjustment in child support rests with the supporting spouse.see in re marriage of stephenson th,fn,d modification of spousal support.
ordinarily,a factual change of circumstances is required for an order modifying support,increase or decrease in either party income available to pay child support.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.there are no rigid guidelines for judging whether circumstances have sufficiently changed to warrant a child support modification.so long as the statewide statutory formula support requirements are met fam.code,et,the determination is made on a basis and may properly rest on fluctuations in need or ability to pay.id.at,see also in re marriage of laudeman th,d.the ultimate determination of whether the individual facts of the case warrant modification of support is within the discretion of the trial court.philbin philbin d.the reviewing court will resolve any conflicts in the evidence in favor of the trial court determination.in re marriage of kepley d.
iii.the order modifying child support.
family code section,subdivision b.
section b is the statute central to this appeal.it provides as follows if an order modifying or terminating a support order is entered due to the unemployment of either the support obligor or the support obligee,the order shall be made retroactive to the later of the date of the service on the opposing party of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or terminate or the date of unemployment,unless the court finds good cause not to make the order retroactive and states its reasons on the record.b.the language of the statute thus requires the court to make retroactive the order modifying or terminating support due to the parent unemployment,unless it makes a specific finding of good cause and specifies on the record its reasons for denying retroactivity.
the statute does not define the circumstances under which the court may find good cause to deny retroactivity.further,the parties cite no we are aware of either discuss section b generally or analyze the statute good cause requirement for nonretroactivity.while there are,of course,numerous examples in which the family code has adopted the concept of good cause,in nearly all instances,there is no decisional authority construing good cause under the relevant statutes we therefore look to decisional authority outside of the family code for guidance in construing the requirements of section b.
one appellate court has noted the term good cause is not susceptible of precise definition.in fact,its definition varies with the context in which it is used.very broadly,it means a legally sufficient ground or reason for a certain action.zorrero unemployment ins.appeals bd.d.similarly,another court has stated that the phrase good cause,as used in a variety of contexts,has been found to be difficult to define with precision and to be largely relative in its connotation,depending upon the particular circumstances of each case.citations.cardinal ritchie d.t he essential ingredients of good cause are reasonable grounds and good faith.id.at.
eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits is one area using the term good cause.an employee is,of course,ineligible for benefits if he or she has left his most recent job voluntarily and without good cause.one court concluded that the employee ineligibility because he or she left the employment voluntarily and without good cause turned on an evaluation of whether the employee reasons were real circumstances,substantial reasons,objective conditions,palpable forces that operate to produce correlative results,adequate excuses that will bear the test of reason,just grounds for action,and always the element of good faith.cal.portland cement cal.unemp.ins.appeals board d,quoting bliley electric unemployment comp.bd.of,see also sanchez unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d,good cause means an adequate cause,a cause that comports with the purposes of the unemployment insurance code and with other laws.
another familiar context for the element of good cause exists in the area of employment law.in a wrongful discharge action involving an agreement not to terminate except for good cause,i n deciding whether good cause exists,there must be a balance between the employer interest in operating its business efficiently and profitably and the employee interest in continued employment.citations.walker blue cross of california th,d walker see also cotran rollins hudig hall,cal th,d.this definition of good cause is incorporated into the civil jury instructions applicable to wrongful termination actions.see caci ed.former baji ed.
in applying the above discussion to section b,we start by recognizing the fundamental purpose of our statutes concerning child support obligations.see rabago unemployment ins.appeals bd.d.essential basis for determining good cause is examination of the purposes of the statute involved.as we have noted,the statewide uniform guideline for support seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.in the context of this state high standard of living and high cost of,c hild support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support,subd.l.
other statutory principles of child support that we must consider in reviewing a trial court finding of good cause under section b include a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,subd.b and e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.the guideline takes into account each parent actual income and level of responsibility for the children,subd.c.further,c hildren should share in the standard of living of both parents,subd.f see also in re marriage of de guigne,supra,th at,d parent with higher standard of living has obligation to ensure that children share in that lifestyle.
we conclude that good cause under section b requires the court to make a good faith finding that nonretroactivity is justified by real circumstances,substantial reasons,and objective conditions.cal.portland cement cal.unemp.ins.appeals board,supra,d at.a determination under section b that there is good cause to make nonretroactive the modification or termination of a prior child support order must give due consideration to the above stated statutory principles concerning child support.
our decision in cheriton,supra,th,d,is instructive.in cheriton,we addressed whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to make its order modifying child support retroactive to the date of filing of the motion under section,subdivision a although we did not consider in cheriton the question of retroactivity under section b,we held in exercising its discretion concerning retroactivity,the trial court was required to analyze the children then current needs,as measured by the parents ability to provide support.cheriton,supra,th at,d.because there the trial court focus was on the parents expenses and it did not adequately consider the children needs,we concluded that the court had abused its discretion in evaluating the issue of retroactivity.ibid.
consonant with our analysis in cheriton,we glean from the principles in section that whether there is good cause to deny retroactivity under section b requires an evaluation of the children needs at the time.those needs of the children must be examined in the context of the ability of the custodial and provide child support from the balancing test employed in the wrongful termination believe that determining good cause under section b requires a balancing of interests,with the primary focus being to ensure,if possible,that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support,subd.l,italics added.stewart gomez,supra,th at,d.
this balancing includes an evaluation of the needs of the minor children and the potential hardship resulting to them from the retroactive reduction or termination of support.since each parent is obligated to provide support according to his or her ability,subd.d,the court must examine the financial circumstances of both parents.the court balances the needs of the children against the interests of the supporting parent not to be faced with an unjust and unreasonable financial burden resulting from a nonretroactive order.this latter inquiry examines the supporting parent financial resources and ability to pay for the support of the children during the period of potential retroactivity being considered.since the needs of the children are of paramount concern,where retroactivity would result in demonstrable hardship to them,good cause may exist to deny a retroactive support reduction or termination when the supporting parent has the ability to bear that financial burden.
good cause for denial of retroactivity.
we apply the above principles to determine whether the court abused its discretion by denying mark request to make the order reducing child support retroactive to the date of service of the motion.this involves an evaluation of whether there was evidence supporting a finding of good cause to deny retroactivity under section b.
we begin by noting that the trial court did not specifically state that it found good cause for refusing retroactivity while desirable,we do not believe that the statute requires the incantation of the particular words good cause,so long as the was done with section b by identifying its reasons for concluding that good cause exists to deny retroactivity.a contrary conclusion would exalt form over substance.see,people hatch cal th,d,trial courts need not use specific words or recite substantial evidence standard when dismissing case pursuant to,so long as they make their rulings clear enough for reviewing courts to confidently conclude they viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and found that no reasonable trier of fact could convict.
the court at the hearing on mark alternative motions identified its reasons for denying retroactivity doing what was equitable for both parties the reasoning of padilla,supra,th,d mark other resources and evaluation of the needs of the children.these findings were not made at the time the motion was originally decided.the court,however,had the power to amend or correct its order when it was subject to direct attack by mark motion for new trial under code civ,or his motion to vacate under code civ,it did so at the time it disposed of the alternative motions.see greene superior court cal d.
the first ground enunciated by the trial nonretroactivity was equitable to both parties was too general to constitute a specification of reasons as required by section b.likewise,the trial court unarticulated reliance upon padilla was insufficient to establish good cause to deny mark request for retroactivity 
the court third and fourth reasons for denying retroactivity,of mark financial condition and the children have significant evidentiary support.in this instance,there was a significant disparity between the overall assets of the parties that the court could have considered in evaluating the parties financial condition and the needs of the children.mark identified assets totaling home,sailboat,cash,and retirement funds.mark also received in severance pay and accrued vacation at or about the time he filed the motion.leslie listed assets of home.mark
