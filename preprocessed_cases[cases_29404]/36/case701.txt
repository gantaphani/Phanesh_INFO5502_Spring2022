victor appeals the dismissal of his petition seeking to establish that he is the father of old donald.based on undisputed facts,it appears that while victor and mary were romantically involved,victor impregnated mary.about one month before donald was born their relationship terminated and mary married roger.mary and roger brought donald into their home as their son and have prevented victor from having contact with the child.in response to victor petition to establish a relationship,mary moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that victor has no standing to bring the action,and the court granted the motion.we conclude that under the family code as it now reads,victor does have standing to bring the petition and that further proceedings are necessary to determine whether victor or roger should be adjudicated to be the child legal father.
background 
without elaborating on the parties understandable angst reflected in the record,the facts necessary to resolve the issues on appeal were succinctly summarized in the trial court tentative decision the facts are not in dispute.although she stops short of saying so outright,mary apparently admits that victor is donald biological father mary married roger before donald birth roger is named as the father on donald birth certificate.roger has received donald into his home and has openly held out donald as his natural child.victor has never met donald and has no relationship with him clearly he would like to do so but mary has thwarted victor attempts.
donald was born april.after discovering the birth and making unsuccessful efforts to gain access to the child,on december,victor filed a petition to establish his parental relationship with donald,together with a request to compel genetic testing and for other related relief.mary then filed a motion seeking an order quashing this proceeding and dismissing this action due to victor lack of standing fc,subd.a dawn superior court cal th.dawn.the court tentative ruling to grant mary motion explained,roger is donald presumed father pursuant to fc a and d.roger and mary were not married when donald was conceived,but fc a does not include that requirement it creates a presumption of paternity if the child is born during marriage and does not state that the child must have been conceived during marriage.if the legislature had wished to interpose the latter requirement,it could have done so.thus,victor does not have standing to pursue a uniform parentage act action regarding donald fc.the cases construing these statutes make clear that if the petitioner does not qualify as the child presumed father,his action must fail dawn d lisa superior court phillip th neil mary th.in its formal order,the court added to its explanation that in dawn the supreme court appears effectively to overrule michael giovanna th and hold that the biological father of a child born to a woman married to another man has no liberty interest in establishing a relationship with the child,protected as a matter of substantive due process,that overcomes its lack of statutory standing to challenge the presumption of a husband paternity under family code a.the court therefore dismissed the action,and victor timely noticed this appeal.
discussion 
the trial court correctly stated the import of family code,section,concerning what is required to be deemed the presumed father of a child,but erred in holding that section,as it now reads,denies another man who alleges that he is the child father the right to bring an action to determine his paternity.
section sets out the rebuttable presumption that a man is the natural father of a child if he meets any of several conditions,including,most commonly,a he and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage or d he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.there is no question but that roger qualifies as a presumed father of donald under both alternatives,as the trial court held.
section,subdivision c now provides that except as to cases coming within section et.which no party contends is applicable,an action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship may be brought by several categories of persons including a man alleged or alleging himself to be the father.until the statute was amended in,subsection c provided authorization to file such an action only with respect to a child who has no presumed father under section or whose presumed father is deceased.see stats,ch.however,in the statute was amended to remove this qualification.see,stats,ch.under the current version of section,subdivision c,therefore,victor,who claims to be the father of donald,is entitled to bring this action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship even though roger unquestionably is a presumed father of donald 
dawn is not authority to the contrary.there an alleged biological father sought to establish his paternity of a child conceived and born during the mother marriage to another man.dawn arose prior to the amendment to section,subdivision c and the alleged biological father acknowledged that he had no statutory standing to bring such an action.his contention,rejected by the supreme court,was that he had an asserted constitutional liberty interest,protected as a matter of substantive due process,not to be denied the opportunity to establish a parental relationship with the child.cal th at.the subsequent amendment to the statute explicitly provides the statutory standing that was lacking in dawn the amendment does not determine the issue of fatherhood,but it does confer on victor standing to assert his claim.
mary asserts that the legislative history of the amendment indicates that the change in the statute was designed only to broaden standing to assert paternity in connection with adoption proceedings as a statute that addresses standing to establish paternity for children not being raised by a fit parent.we find the legislative history far less clear on this point than mary argument suggests,but in all events if the words of the statute are unambiguous,as they are here,there is no occasion to resort to the legislative history,people anderson cal th,equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th.there is no ambiguity in the amended statutory provision,giving one who alleges himself to be the child father the right to bring an action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship,regardless of whether another man is also a presumed father of the same child.while there may be some redundancy in subsections a,b,and c of section,there is no conflict between those provisions,at least with respect to any issue in the present case 
this conclusion is supported by the recent decision in th.there the court recognized that the amendment was not in effect at the time relevant to the decision in dawn,and that the subsequent amendment provides standing to one alleging himself to be a child father even if another man is the presumed father of the child.th at.it is true,as mary argues,that the man with whom the mother was living in that case,and who was the presumed father by virtue of section,subdivision d,was not married to the mother at the time of the child conception or birth.but that difference does not affect the reasoning of that court,or our own reasoning,as to the application of the amended section,subdivision c.
the fact that the mother and presumed father were not married when the child in was born may be argued to render inapplicable a second ground on which the court found standing in that case,but even as to that ground the factual difference is not significant.the court in held that even without the statutory amendment id.at the alleged biological father had standing by virtue of the principles stated in adoption of kelsey cal th and applied in gabriel suedi th.id.at.those cases hold that an alleged biological father has a constitutionally protected interest conferring standing to establish his paternity where,at the time of the child conception,the mother of the child was not married to the man who subsequently beca
