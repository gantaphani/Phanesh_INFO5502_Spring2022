factual and procedural background 
before his marriage to carol,william built a national reputation as a professional investment adviser over a period,managing pension plan monies for various companies.these companies,called plan sponsors,hire pension consultants to help them hire the right investment adviser.the main hiring criterion the pension consultant uses is the investment adviser track record,meaning history of investment returns over time.investment advisers are chosen based on the strength of their track records compared to the track records of other similar advisers.to be successful,investment advisers must outperform their peers regardless of the performance of the stock market.plan sponsors have a fiduciary duty to select the top performing investment advisers.
once a pension consultant identifies the best three to five advisers,the advisers are interviewed,with one or two of them qualifying for a final interview.when an adviser is selected,the plan sponsor transfers control of investing certain pension monies to the adviser.plan sponsors and pension consultants continue to monitor the adviser investment performance by comparing it to other similar advisers with the same investment style to determine whether to continue his or her investment services.if plan sponsors are dissatisfied with the investment performance of their investment adviser,they can withdraw their funds.
in william and carol formed duncan capital management to manage pension funds for large corporations and institutions.within five months,the company was managing million in pension funds.the funds were invested in stocks in companies defined as,and,depending on their market capitalization.frank hurst,a marketing specialist,joined the business in exchange for percent of the stock the company then became known as,with william serving as chairman,chief executive officer,chief investment officer,and portfolio manager of the and funds.william maintained complete control of the management and operation of the company and was the sole member of the board of directors.hurst was manager of marketing and client services,as well as president and chief administrative officer.
william was solely responsible for all investment decisions for at least percent of assets under management.as and portfolio manager,william actively managed about stocks daily.in so doing,he made all buy,sell and hold decisions and signed every trade ticket.david magee and stephen mcnally managed the remaining percent of assets,comprised of the portfolio,the hedge fund and an offshore mutual fund.william assisted in managing these funds.he initiated the company investment strategies and policies in and supervised their ongoing application.william was also primarily responsible for approving all professional hiring decisions and employee compensation.
carol and william had two children,born in and.carol devoted the majority of her time and effort to the home and children while william continued to run the business.
by september had employees,including investment analysts,traders and marketing specialists.the company was managing billion in assets.william annual income was million.
after carol and william separated in september,william continued to operate.the value of the company continued to increase,with assets under management totaling billion by august.
in april the court heard issues of property division and support in four phases.in the first phase,the court found was community property and selected the date of separation as an alternative valuation date under section,subdivision b.specifically,the court found william was the key to success and the company value increased after the parties separated as a result of william reputation,investing skill and guidance.in the second phase,the court valued the company at million using the standard appraisal technique of comparable sales.
in the third phase,the court determined the terms of william obligation to pay carol the value of the community interest in,spousal and child support,and life insurance.the court awarded carol per month in child support,plus retroactive child and spousal support of carol received to equalize the property division,million of which was to be paid in cash,and the balance,including interest,to be paid monthly under a secured promissory note.in the fourth phase,the court denied carol request for attorney fees based on need and ability to pay.the court entered judgment on all findings and orders.
discussion 
carol appealidate of valuation 
carol contends the court prejudicially erred by applying the exception of section,subdivision b to value as of the date of separation rather than the date of trial.she asserts the significant increase in value after the parties separated resulted from factors other than william personal efforts.thus,she claims,an alternative valuation date was legally impermissible.
when a spouse operates a community property business after separation,there is an inherent tension between the general rule that the business must be valued as of the date of trial former,subd.a,now,subd.a and the rule that a spouse earnings after separation are his or her separate property.former,now,subd.a see in re marriage of green d.before,the only method a court had to ameliorate the effects of a trial date valuation was to equitably apportion a spouse postseparation efforts between community and separate interests.in re marriage of imperato d.however,in,the legislature amended former civil code section,subdivision a now,to provide 
t he court shall value the assets and liabilities as near as practicable to the time of trial,except that,upon days notice by the moving party to the other party,the court for good cause shown may value all or any portion of the assets and liabilities at a date after separation and prior to trial to accomplish an equal division of the community property and the property of the parties in an equitable manner.
the amendment was designed to remedy certain inequities such as when the hard work and actions of one spouse alone and after separation greatly increases the community estate which must then be divided with the other spouse.in re marriage of barnert d.in this regard,family code section,subdivision b gives the trial court considerable discretion to divide community property in order to assure an equitable settlement is reached.in re marriage of connolly cal d.
where,as here,the trial court is vested with discretionary powers,we review its ruling for an abuse of discretion.in re marriage of reuling th,d.as long as the court exercised its discretion along legal lines,its decision will be affirmed on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support it.in re marriage of smith d.further,because the reasons for change in value of an asset are ordinarily factual,our role is limited to determining whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude the trial court decision was within the permissible range of options set by the legal criteria.dorman dwlc th,d.
case law has established that good cause generally exists for a professional practice to be valued as of the date of separation.in re marriage of kilbourne d.valuation of law practice in re marriage of green,supra,d at.valuation of law practice.this exception to trial date valuation applies because the value of such businesses,including goodwill,is primarily a reflection of the practitioner services accounts receivable and work in progress and not capital assets such as desks,chairs,law books and computers.because earnings and accumulations following separation are the spouse separate property,it follows the community interest should be valued as of the date of cutoff date for the acquisition of community assets.in re marriage of stevenson th,d.
moreover,t he rationale for the general exception to trial date valuation is not limited to small law practices.it applies with equal logic to other small businesses which rely on the skill and reputation of the spouse who operates them.in re marriage of stevenson,supra,th at,d small general contracting business falls within general exception to trial date valuation.thus,an alternative valuation date may apply to a business when its value devolves largely from the personal skill,industry and guidance of the operating spouse,rather than the business capital assets.see also in re marriage of king d.husband postseparation efforts,earnings and accumulations from technical consulting business were his separate property bing bing d,value of husband general contracting business dependent on his personal skill and industry.conversely,a trial date valuation may be appropriate where the postseparation efforts of the operating spouse have minimal impact on any increase in the value of the business.in re marriage of green,supra,d at.
here,the evidence showed has all the attributes of a professional practice,including performing services for a fee,offering specialized knowledge and experience,being licensed and regulated and having assets that consist largely of office equipment,accounts receivable and work in progress.value and success depend almost exclusively on william skill,industry,guidance and reputation.jeffrey lovell,a leading expert in the investment management industry,testified the entire value of derives from william skill and exceptional track record,and the company success a bsolutely depends on him.william is most significant asset.without him,there is no value to the firm.this opinion was corroborated by hurst,several pension consultants and institutional stock brokers,as well as several employees.carol own industry expert,kenneth bodenstein,testified william performs all critical functions at and is largely responsible for success.
william presented evidence of his reputation as one of the nation top investment advisers for more than years.reputation is attributable to william skills and efforts.his skills,industry and guidance enable him to make all investment decisions for percent of assets under management.without william guidance,clients will not remain with the firm.thus,the value of is derived not from its capital assets,but from the professional investment advisory services william provides to plan sponsors.
carol claims increased value was not solely dependent on william,but rather on a confluence of major factors.citing in re marriage of green,supra,d at page,and in re marriage of stevenson,supra,th at page,d,carol asserts the exception of section,subdivision b applies only if the change in value of a business is due entirely to the efforts of the operating spouse.however,green and stevenson stand for the proposition that valuation as of the separation the trial is the proper approach whenever the value of an asset especially a business devolves largely from the personal skill,industry and guidance of the operating spouse,rather than the underlying capital.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,to,italics omitted.nothing in section,subdivision b,case law or logic requires the court to find the entire postseparation change in value was due exclusively to the personal efforts of the operating spouse in order to apply an alternative valuation date.
nevertheless,carol argues the increase in value after separation resulted from contractual fees paid by its clients for funds under management,regardless of william efforts.however,the record shows william efforts include managing percent of all assets.he selects the stock in his portfolios based on his own methodology and criteria.according to carol expert,the key element to is its investment strategy and the key element to investment strategy and process is william.the variation in portfolio value is a result of william investment decisions,which directly impact fee revenues.william skill,reputation and proven track record allow him to obtain new clients and retain existing ones.further,he plays a central role in marketing by actively participating in every final interview with prospective clients,who compare william performance to that of his competitors without regard to the overall performance of the equities market.contrary to carol position,william does affect the aggregate total of assets under management.
carol argues much of increased value resulted from the growth of funds under management during marriage.this argument is based on the erroneous assumption that clients,making predictable or mandatory contributions on an ongoing basis,are locked into doing business with.after is hired to manage pension plan funds,the plan sponsors and pension consultants continue to monitor william performance to determine whether he should continue to manage those funds.clients can almost instantaneously withdraw their funds if they are not satisfied.the fact that clients have remained with is directly attributable to william outstanding performance,which continued after separation.his skills and reputation are crucial to retaining assets under management because he is the only person at with a track record to manage and portfolios.
carol also claims increased value is due to a flourishing stock market.however,the record shows success is based on william active trading of stocks on a daily basis and is not tied to any stock index.during the relevant period,william sometimes overperformed and sometimes underperformed various indices.his performance does not track the stock market in that he does not purchase the same stocks as are in any particular index.he selectively purchases stocks,and sells based on his criteria and methodology at a time and in an amount he considers appropriate.success results from william buy,sell or hold decisions with respect to each stock.
carol asserts william was not the entire business because promoted itself as a team effort.however,when questioned about the role of staff at,industry expert lovell testified that no knowledgeable pension consultant or potential buyer would ever confuse these support functions with the true key to the value of investment skill,reputation and track record of william.william track record and reputation are marketed to clients,who have a fiduciary duty to choose the best investment adviser.contrary to carol position,hurst is not critical to success.a marketing director such as hurst can do little to assure client satisfaction if william investment performance does not meet the plan sponsor standards.indeed,a pension consultant who bases his recommendation on a relationship with a marketing director breaches his professional duties to a plan sponsor.
further,william assists both magee and mcnally on a daily basis.neither magee nor ncnally have brought clients to.based on his years of experience and unique investment style,william generates his own investment ideas,initiates research by analysts,provides direction and focus,and sets forth investment criteria.he makes trade or hold decisions independently.
as the overwhelming evidence showed,and even carol expert conceded,william was largely responsible for the success of.thus,the court acted well within its discretion in finding that good cause existed under section,subdivision b to value as of the date of separation.
attorney fees 
carol contends the court abused its discretion in denying her request for attorney fees.she asserts the cost of litigation should have been apportioned equitably between the parties in accordance with their relative circumstances under section,subdivision a.
under section,subdivision a,the court may,upon determining an ability to pay and consideration of the respective incomes and needs of the parties in order to ensure that each party has access to legal representation to preserve all of the party rights,order any party to pay the amount reasonably necessary for attorney fees and for the cost of maintaining or defending the proceeding.the purpose of such an award is to provide one of the parties,if necessary,with an amount adequate to properly litigate the controversy.in re marriage of sullivan cal d,in re marriage of ward th,d.
the court may award attorney fees under section where the making of the award,and the amount of the award,are just and reasonable under the relative circumstances of the respective parties,subd.a.
in determining what is just and reasonable under the relative circumstances,the court shall take into consideration the need for the award to enable each party,to the extent practical,to have sufficient financial resources to present the party case adequately,taking into consideration,to the extent relevant,the circumstances of the respective parties described in section.the fact that the party requesting an award of attorney fees and costs has resources from which the party could pay the party own attorney fees and costs is not itself a bar to an order that the other party pay part or all of the fees and costs requested.financial resources are only one factor for the court to consider in determining how to apportion the overall cost of the litigation equitably between the parties under their relative circumstances,subd.b.
the court may order payment of an award from any type of property,whether community or separate,principal or income,subd.c.
the parties circumstances as described in section include assets,debts and earning ability of both parties,ability to pay,duration of the marriage,and the age and health of the parties.further,i n assessing one party relative need and the other party ability to pay,the court may consider all evidence concerning the parties current incomes,assets,and abilities,including investment and properties.in re marriage of drake th,d in re marriage of terry th,d.
a motion for attorney fees and costs in a dissolution proceeding is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.citations.in the absence of a clear showing of abuse,its determination will not be disturbed on appeal.in re marriage of sullivan,supra,cal d at.thus,we affirm the court order unless no judge could reasonably make the order made.citations.id.at,see also in re marriage of keech th,d.
carol claimed she had incurred attorney fees of million,of which were paid from community funds under a prior court order.she sought reimbursement for the rest.the court had previously found,in connection with spousal support issues under section,that carol was highly educated and had worked as a certified public accountant in various accounting positions.the length of the marriage was relatively short five years seven months and the marital standard of living was very high.carol was years old and in good health william was years old and in good health.in accordance with the court order following the third phase of trial,william paid carol in cash,excluding child support,on september.based on carol income and expense declaration dated november,the court found she had an estate of,including in liquid assets,and an imputed monthly income of,based on her earning capacity and interest income the court found william monthly income was times greater than that of carol.having paid carol,william had in remaining liquid assets and in other property 
in ruling on carol request for attorney fees,the court noted both parties had sufficient resources from which to fund the litigation,making this an unusual case for a finding of need.based on the relative circumstances of the parties,the court denied carol request for an award of fees and costs.
carol asserts the court abused its discretion in denying her request for attorney fees because she had no earned income and william earned more than million per month.while acknowledging she has substantial assets,carol claims william superior ability to pay makes a fee award just and reasonable under section.
in determining need,the court was required to,and did,consider the parties relative circumstances.those circumstances included the parties income,expenses and assets.the court considered the discrepancy in the parties incomes,but also considered carol had far greater liquid assets.although section,subdivision b permits an award to a spouse,such as carol,who has sufficient resources to pay,it does not endorse any fixed measure or percentage as a way to demonstrate need or the lack thereof.in re marriage of th,d.both carol and william had adequate resources to litigate the controversy.thus,the court acted well within its discretion in denying carol request for attorney fees.
william appeal 
method of valuation 
william contends the court erred in valuing by using unadjusted comparable sales of investment advisory firms that included employment contracts.he asserts this method of valuation impermissibly includes his efforts in violation of section,subdivision a 
under section,the court must divide the community estate of the parties equally.in this regard,the court has broad discretion to determine the manner in which community property is divided and the responsibility to fix the value of assets and liabilities in order to accomplish an equal division.in re marriage of connolly,supra,cal d at,in re marriage of walrath cal th,d.the trial court determination of the value of a particular asset is a factual one and as long as that determination is within the range of the evidence presented,we will uphold it on appeal.in re marriage of cream th,d in re marriage of hewitson d.
t he determination of the value of infrequently sold,unlisted,closely held stock is a difficult legal problem.most of the cases illustrate there is no one applicable formula that may be properly applied to the myriad factual situations calling for a valuation of closely held stock.citation.it is,therefore,incumbent upon a court faced with such a problem to review each factor that might have a bearing upon the worth of the corporation and hence upon the value of the shares.in re marriage of hewitson,supra,d at.
in the exercise of its broad discretion,the trial court makes an independent determination of value based upon the evidence presented on the factors to be considered and the weight given to each.the trial court is not required to accept the opinion of any expert as to the value of an asset.in re marriage of bergman d.see also in re marriage of foster d.in establishing value of goodwill,opinion evidence is admissible but not conclusive.differences between the experts opinions go to the weight of the evidence.in re marriage of bergman,supra,at.in re marriage of hargrave d.rather,the court must determine which of the recognized valuation approaches will most effectively achieve substantial justice between the parties.in re marriage of lopez d.
after ordering an alternative valuation date,the court heard evidence from various experts as to the value of.the evidence showed that as of the date of separation,had assets under management of approximately billion and revenues of million.carol expert,kenneth bodenstein,used two methods to value the community interest in at nearly comparable public company sales and comparable sales of public and private companies.the court rejected both methods because they included sales of publicly traded companies and thus were not comparable.see in re marriage of hewitson,supra,d at.in re marriage of lotz d.
william expert,donald gursey,used three different valuation methods gross revenue multiplier,agreement,and comparable sales of privately held companies.in his comparable sales analysis,gursey found the value of to be between million and million and the community interest to be between million and million.however,gursey hypothesized a efforts adjustment to reduce the appraised value of the community interest in to a range of million to million.gursey explained the value calculated using the comparable sales method was derived from comparisons with several private company stock transactions,al
