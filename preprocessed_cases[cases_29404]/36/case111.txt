introduction 
this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment by the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,to,robert and clara morenz the morenzes.the morenzes sued,patricia,the commissioner of the connecticut department of social services dss,for declaratory and injunctive relief,after the dss denied morenz application for medicaid.the dss rejected the application on the ground that the morenzes combined assets exceeded the threshold for medicaid eligibility.the morenzes contended that morenz could not be deemed ineligible on account of his spouse assets because he had effected a valid assignment of spousal support rights to the state of connecticut.the district court ruled in favor of the morenzes on for summary judgment.we affirm.
ii.factual background 
morenz has lived at the wilton meadows nursing home in wilton,connecticut,since october.morenz,his spouse,lives at the family home,also in wilton.for the purposes of the federal medicaid statutes,therefore,morenz is an institutionalized spouse,and morenz is a community spouse.h.a medicaid application in morenz name was filed in january with the dss,the connecticut agency responsible for administering the state medicaid program.as part of morenz application,an assignment of spousal support rights was submitted by morenz,through morenz,who held his power of attorney.the assignment purported to transfer to the state of connecticut any rights to support that morenz had from morenz.in addition,morenz submitted a signed spousal refusal statement to the dss declaring that she decline s to further contribute to the financial support of morenz.
on march,the dss denied morenz medicaid application on the ground that the morenzes combined resources exceeded the statutory eligibility amount.the countable assets in morenz name fell within the personal resource allowance permitted for medicaid eligibility.with certain enumerated exceptions discussed below,however,a state medicaid participant must deem a community spouse resources as available to the institutionalized spouse in determining the institutionalized spouse initial medicaid eligibility c a.although a community spouse is permitted to retain a sizeable community spouse resource allowance csra beyond that permitted to the institutionalized spouse,c,the assets in morenz name exceeded this allowance by approximately.compl.under the dss uniform policy manual upm,the sole exception to considering the combined assets of both spouses in determining an institutionalized spouse initial medicaid eligibility is when undue hardship exists.upm b.
the morenzes concede that,at the time of morenz application,their circumstances did not qualify as undue hardship under dss regulations.compl.they contend,however,that the dss is required to honor their assignment of morenz support rights to the state.and they argue that,pursuant to the provisions of the medicare catastrophic coverage act of mcca,c a,such assignment immunizes the community spouse assets from consideration in calculating the institutionalized spouse initial medicaid eligibility.
on february,the morenzes moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prohibit the dss from including morenz assets in determining morenz medicaid eligibility.the district court denied that motion without prejudice in favor of a summary judgment hearing.both the morenzes and moved immediately for summary judgment.in an opinion dated june,the district court granted summary judgment to the morenzes.morenz,d.the court enjoined from denying morenz medicaid application.pursuant to the medicaid statute retroactive benefits provision the court also ordered that morenz eligibility become effective three months prior to the court decision.filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.singer fulton county sheriff,cir.summary judgment is mandated if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
the district court addressed three basic questions raised in this appeal whether the mcca prohibits a state from deeming a community spouse assets as available to an institutionalized spouse in determining the institutionalized spouse initial medicaid eligibility,when the institutionalized spouse has assigned to the state all rights to support from the community spouse whether connecticut law permits an institutionalized medicaid applicant to assign support rights to the state only when such applicant spouse is unwilling or unable to provide the financial information needed to determine medicaid eligibility and whether a federal court order that eligibility begin three months before the date of the order violates the eleventh amendment.
mcca support rights provisions 
the mcca governs the extent to which a community spouse assets may factor into an institutionalized spouse initial medicaid eligibility determination.paragraph of the mcca rules for treatment of a community spouse resources states that,aside from the csra,all the resources held by either the institutionalized spouse,community spouse,or both,shall be considered to be available to the institutionalized spouse in calculating the institutionalized spouse resources at the time of application.see c.the next paragraph,however,provides that 
the institutionalized spouse shall not be ineligible by reason of resources determined under paragraph to be available for the cost of care where 
a the institutionalized spouse has assigned to the state any rights to support from the community spouse 
b the institutionalized spouse lacks the ability to execute an assignment due to physical or mental impairment but the state has the right to bring a support proceeding against a community spouse without such assignment or 
c the state determines that denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship.
c.the district court found that,under these provisions,if morenz assigns rights to support from morenz to the state of connecticut he shall not be ineligible for medicaid because of excess resources.morenz,d at.
we see no reason to disturb this holding.this court has held it to be a fundamental principle of statutory construction that the starting point must be the language of the statute itself.rose long island pension plan,cir.absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,as the district court noted,the language of the statute could not be less ambiguous.a community spouse resources can not be included in making an institutionalized spouse initial eligibility determination if the institutionalized spouse has assigned support rights to the state or undue hardship is present.
would,in effect,have us read this disjunctive or as a conjunctive and.appellant brief at o nly if the denial of benefits will lead to undue hardship does c a preclude the state from denying eligibility.notes that,under federal law,a state medicaid plan must always condition aid upon the assignment to the state of an applicant rights to support.a a.to provide an exemption from the general requirements for precisely the same assignment of support rights,argues,would be bizarre.even if we were to assume that these two assignment of support rights provisions can not live comfortably we do not,see note,has,at most,demonstrated poor drafting.without more,textual inconsistency within a complicated federal statute falls short of demonstrating the kind of clearly expressed legislative intention that would lead us not to apply the language of the statute as written.
we note,moreover,that the state medicaid manual of the centers for medicare medicaid services cms,to which the secretary of health human services has delegated full rulemaking authority under the medicaid statutes,see.dep t of health family servs.blumer,d,supports the district court reading of the statute we have hel
