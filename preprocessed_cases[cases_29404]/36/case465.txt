bina shahani appeals the district court order granting john navani petition that their son be returned to england,the child country of habitual residence,pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction and its implementing legislation,the international child abduction remedies act.the district court concluded that shahani wrongfully retained the boy in the united states without navani consent in violation of his rights of custody over the child as defined under english law,and that no exception to the mandatory return remedy under the treaty and statute applied.
during the pendency of this appeal,the english family court with jurisdiction over the child custodial arrangements issued a new custody order concerning each parent custodial rights.navani argues that the new custody order moots shahani appeal because it effectively strips shahani of her custodial rights over the child.we agree with navani that the new custody order prevents us from granting shahani any effectual relief and therefore we dismiss her appeal because it fails to present a live case or controversy.
a.the hague convention 
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,the hague convention seeks to deter parents who are dissatisfied with current custodial arrangements from abducting their children and seeking a more favorable custodial ruling in another country.shealy shealy,cir.generally,it creates an international legal mechanism requiring contracting states to promptly return children who have been wrongfully removed to,or wrongfully retained in,their jurisdiction,without deciding anew the issue of custody.de silva pitts,cir.a removal or retention is wrongful under the treaty when the removal or retention is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention hague convention.
the international child abduction remedies act,icara,implements the hague convention in the united states and grants federal and state courts concurrent original jurisdiction of actions arising under the convention.a.a petitioner who seeks an order returning a child to his country of habitual residence must show that the child was habitually resident in a given state at the time of the removal or retention the removal or retention was in breach of petitioner custody rights under the laws of that state and petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of removal or retention.shealy,at citation omitted.
factual and procedural background 
navani and shahani were married in london,england,on december.born on august,jivan is the couple only child.navani and shahani marriage ended in divorce on february.as part of the divorce proceedings,an english family court issued a custody order the original custody order concerning jivan,which stated in relevant part 
the court orders that 
the child jivan navani shall reside with the mother bina shahani 
the father john navani shall 
i be entitled to all information provided to parents with parental responsibility by rosemary works school or any other school attended by the child jivan navani 
ii in particular john navani shall be entitled to have access to the child jivan navani attendance records held by rosemary works school or any other school the said child attends 
the mother bina shahani and the father john navani are prohibited from removing the child jivan navani from the jurisdiction of the court,namely england and wales,without the written consent of the other or order of the court 
the child jivan navani shall not be removed from rosemary works school without the written consent of the father john navani or order of the court 
the father john navani shall have contact with the child jivan navani as follows 
i during school terms,on alternate weekends,staying contact from the end of the school day on friday to the start of the school day on monday 
ii half of each school holiday,including school,in the absence of agreement for the first half of each holiday,where the first half if half term does not fall on a term time contact weekend,the holiday arrangement shall prevail if there is a conflict 
on august,shahani made a written request to navani,pursuant to the original custody order,asking for his consent to allow the mother and the boy to take a holiday in the united states.after navani consented,and shahani failed to return to england on the agreed upon date,navani contacted english law enforcement.navani did not see his son again until he located shahani and jivan in new mexico more than a year later.
on march,navani filed a hague convention petition in the district of new mexico asserting that jivan had been wrongfully retained in the united states in violation of navani custody rights as established by english law.navani asked the court to order the boy return to england under the hague convention and icara.after a trial,the district court granted navani petition on march,finding that shahani had breached navani rights of custody under english law by retaining him in the united states,thereby warranting the child repatriation to england.the district court ordered jivan return to england by june,where he now lives.separately,navani moved for an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to.in two orders issued on may,and december,the district court partially granted navani two motions for fees and costs and awarded him a total of.
shahani thereafter filed a notice of appeal concerning the district court march,order granting navani petition for an order of return and the district court may,order denying shahani motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment in her opening brief,shahani generally argued that navani failed to satisfy his burden under the hague convention and icara to show that he possesses rights of custody over jivan,that the trial violated her right to due process of law,and that the district court order of return was technically deficient because it ordered the child returned to navani personal custody rather than to england.navani disputed each of these contentions.
on april,a week before the scheduled may,oral argument in this case,navani filed a motion to dismiss shahani appeal as moot based on an order issued by the english family court on march,the new custody order.in pertinent part,the new custody order provides 
i the mother wrongfully and unlawfully,without the father consent or leave of the court,failed to return jivan navani to the jurisdiction of england and wales on the september,and thereafter wrongfully and unlawfully retained jivan navani in the united states of america without the father consent or leave of the court,contrary to the terms of the child abduction and custody act.
v by virtue of his having parental responsibility together with an order for contact the latter made by justice hedley on january the first respondent father has and had at all material times equal rights of custody together with the mother in relation to jivan,including at the time of his wrongful retention in the united states in september.
it is ordered that 
the residence order in favour of the mother,together with all other orders made by the honourable justice hedley on the january and november be,for the avoidance of doubt,discharged.
the child jivan navani shall reside with the father john kishin navani.
the applicant mother be forbidden to remove the child jivan navani from the care of the first respondent father and from the jurisdiction of this court.
the applicant mother applications for a residence order and an order permitting her to remove the child jivan navani from the jurisdiction of england and wales be dismissed.
there shall be by way of prohibited steps order no direct contact between the applicant mother and the child jivan navani outside the jurisdiction of england and wales.
the mother shall have indirect contact with the child jivan navani as follows 
i telephone contact once per week for a period of thirty minutes at dates and times to be agreed,together with such other indirect contact by telephone letter and presents as is agreed between the parties.
ii direct supervised contact within the jurisdiction as may be agreed in writing between the parties.
the applicant mother shall deliver up to the father solicitors all travel documents,passports and applications for the same relating to jivan navani as may be in her possession.
the mother shall be forbidden to apply for any passport or travel document or for the grant of united states citizenship or rights of abode for jivan navani.
mot.to dismiss,ex.a at.navani argues that the new custody order moots shahani appeal because it grants primary physical custody to navani and prohibits returning the child to shahani custody.in her response brief to the motion to dismiss and at oral argument,shahani opposed the motion to dismiss,contending that the new custody order conflicts with english family law,the english family court issued the new custody order without hearing argument from her counsel,and the issue of fees and costs is sufficient in itself to keep her appeal alive.
before turning to the merits of shahani appeal,we must first address navani argument that the new custody order moots her appeal.the mootness question necessarily constitutes our threshold inquiry,because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.in re jennings oil,cir citation omitted.we have no authority to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.church of scientology united states,d quoting mills green.a case or controversy must remain alive throughout the litigation,including on appellate review.thournir buchanan,cir citing wiley collegiate athletic ass n,cir en banc.i f an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,the appeal must be dismissed.church of scientology,at.quoting mills,at.the central question in determining whether a case has become moot is whether the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.phelps hamilton,cir quoting powell mccormack,d internal quotation marks omitted.
in the event that we would conclude that the district court erred in granting navani hague convention petition and in ordering jivan return to england,navani argues that the new custody order nonetheless precludes us from granting shahani any effectual relief and therefore moots her appeal.navani argues that the new custody order renders shahani appeal moot in two ways.first,the english family court concluded in the new custody order that shahani wrongfully retained jivan in the united states in violation of navani rights of custody.navani contends that the english family court ruling on wrongful retention settles the issue that shahani raises in this appeal whether navani had rights of custody over jivan sufficient to trigger the hague convention mandatory return remedy.second,navani argues that jivan can not be ordered to return to shahani custody because the english family court has determined that custody should now be with navani,not shahani.
we agree with navani that the new custody order prevents us from ordering any effectual relief in this appeal.if we conclude that the district court should not have ordered jivan return to england because navani failed to make his threshold showing that he possesses rights of custody over jivan,the only way to remedy the error would be to order jivan return to the united states to be reunited with navani.yet the new custody order implicitly prohibits jivan return to the united states to live with his mother by forbidding direct contact between the applicant mother and the child jivan navani outside the jurisdiction of england and wales.mot.to dismiss,ex.a at.the new custody order forbids shahani from removing jivan from his father care and the jurisdiction of the english family court.id.shahani can not even possess the travel documents,such as jivan passport,that would be necessary for international travel.id.at.further,for us to decide shahani appeal we would have to determine whether navani possessed rights of custody under the original custody order.but interpreting the rights of custody that the parties possessed under the original custody order would be a futile exercise because the new custody order discharges all prior custody orders.id.at.finally,the new custody order makes clear that contrary to shahani argument before the district court and on appeal that navani had no rights of custody at the time of the alleged wrongful retention,navani has and had at all material times equal rights of custody together with the mother in relation to jivan,including at the time of his wrongful retention in the united states in september.id.at.
although the full faith and credit clause does not require us to recognize judgments,such as the new custody order,which are rendered in foreign countries,soc y of lloyd reinhart,cir,the new custody order should be given effect in american courts for two reasons.first,general principles of comity normally counsel giving considerable deference to a foreign judgment.see miller miller,cir diorinou mezitis,cir see also hilton guyot.the extent to which the law of one nation,as put in force within its territory,whether by executive order,by legislative act,or by judicial decree,shall be allowed to operate within the dominion of another nation,depends upon what our greatest jurists have been content to call the comity of nations.the english family court interpretation of its domestic navani has always possessed rights of custody over jivan and that shahani breached those rights of custody by wrongfully retaining jivan in the united therefore entitled to our respect.see shealy,at declining to second guess a german regional court interpretation of german domestic law in finding that a parent removal of a child from germany was not wrongful because there was a military necessity.
second,and more fundamentally,factors unique to the hague convention suggest that the english family court should be given the final word,through the new custody order,in this matter.while shahani believes that we can review the merits of her appeal without taking the new custody order into account and that the district court can order jivan return to the united states in spite of the new custody order provisions holding otherwise,aplt.supp.response br.at,both the letter and spirit of the hague convention suggest that the new custody order ends this matter.
as we and our sister circuits have repeatedly explained,the hague convention attempts to prevent an international version of forum shopping,wherein a parent dissatisfied with current custodial arrangements flees with the child to another country to the merits of custody and to obtain a more favorable custody order.shealy,at describing a parent removing a child from a country in order to avoid the jurisdiction of local courts as what the hague convention was created to prevent hanley roy,cir friedrich friedrich,cir.the hague convention rests implicitly upon the principle that any debate on the merits of custody rights,should take place before the competent authorities in the state where the child had its habitual residence prior to its removal because courts in the country of the child habitual residence are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access.elisa,explanatory report hague conference on private international law,in acts and documents of the fourteenth session child abduction,explanatory report see also de silva,at t he basic purpose and function of the hague convention and icara are to ensure that the home country should make the custody determination whenever possible.citation omitted alterations and emphasis in original croll croll,cir.to defeat attempts to custody matters in a foreign country,the hague convention requires contracting states to respect custody orders issued by the country of the child habitual residence and forbids contracting states from dec
