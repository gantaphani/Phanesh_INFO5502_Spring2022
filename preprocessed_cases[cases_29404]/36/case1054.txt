introduction 
silvia mother appeals from a disposition order as to her daughter,also named silvia silvia.mother contends that the juvenile court did not have jurisdiction to include in the disposition order a requirement that silvia stepfather and her adult brother,both of whom sexually abused silvia,participate in sexual abuse counseling for perpetrators.
disagreeing with in re venus d.venus,we hold that when the child is removed from the parent home,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,does not authorize the juvenile court to order other relatives with whom the child is not placed to participate in counseling or education programs.rather,section,subdivision c,authorizes the court to impose on the parent,as a condition of the disposition plan for reunification with the child,that the parent demonstrate to the court satisfaction that the parent can protect the child,subd.c.further,when the child has been the victim of sexual abuse by other relatives,the court has the authority to order that the parent must reside separately from the perpetrators,or must demonstrate that the perpetrators voluntarily participated in counseling and satisfactorily addressed the issues involved,such that the child may safely reside with them.
based on our holding,we reverse those portions of the disposition order directing the stepfather to participate in a parenting program and counseling,and directing the adult brother to participate in counseling.in all other respects,the disposition order is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs filed a welfare and institutions code section petition on october,regarding silvia born in july dcfs alleged that silvia stepfather,felix,and her brother,kevin,had sexually abused her,and that mother failed to protect her from their abuse,subds.b,d,i.
silvia stated that kevin had been touching her in a sexual manner since she was years old.she did not tell anyone because she thought it was normal for brothers and sisters to have sexual contact.in,she and kevin moved to the united states from el salvador to live with mother.shortly thereafter,her stepfather began to caress her thighs and breasts,and to force hugs on her.she complained to mother about kevin and stepfather,but mother refused to help her.on september,kevin played a pornographic movie and told her,let do it.when she refused,he pulled her pants down and attempted to rape her.she told mother,who did not believe her.
on september,silvia and her family had a meeting,during which she discussed all of the abuse.the family blamed her,and instead discussed her behavior.she went to the sheriff department in lennox the following day and reported the abuse.she told the deputies she had been having suicidal thoughts as a result of the abuse.dcfs was contacted,and she was taken to gateway hospital for psychological evaluation and treatment.see.
mother denied all of the allegations and said silvia was being influenced by her lesbian lover,ilsy,who wanted silvia to live with her.mother denied that silvia had ever reported any abuse to her,said that dcfs had no proof of anything,and refused to have stepfather and kevin leave the house without having physical evidence they had molested silvia.dcfs had proposed a safety plan whereby stepfather and kevin would leave the home and silvia could be returned to mother custody,but mother refused.
silvia told her foster mother and the social worker that ilsy,who was a relative of stepfather,had been stalking her,and silvia had become fearful of her.silvia had initially confided in ilsy regarding the sexual abuse,and ilsy had encouraged silvia to report the abuse to the police.silvia acknowledged that ilsy wanted stepfather and kevin to get in trouble so silvia could stay with ilsy.silvia preferred to remain in her current placement some distance from her home and school,in order to avoid contact with ilsy.
the adjudication hearing began on november,but,for reasons not relevant here,it was not concluded until march.the court sustained counts in the section petition brought pursuant to subdivisions b and d,as amended,and found silvia to be a person described by section.
the court proceeded to disposition,declaring silvia to be a dependent of the court.it found by clear and convincing evidence that substantial danger existed to silvia physical or emotional,removed her from mother physical custody,and ordered her suitably placed.dcfs was ordered to provide family reunification services.mother was ordered to complete a parenting program,conjoint counseling with silvia when deemed appropriate,and sexual abuse awareness counseling.mother was granted monitored visitation.silvia biological father,oscar,was not present,but was ordered to complete a parenting program silvia was ordered to participate in individual counseling,and conjoint counseling with mother when recommended by her therapist.
in addition,the court ordered stepfather to attend a parenting program and sex abuse counseling for perpetrators.the court also ordered kevin to participate in sex abuse counseling for perpetrators.mother attorney objected to the disposition orders directed to stepfather and kevin,noting that they were not present in court or represented by counsel.she argued that the orders placed an undue burden on mother and the family.counsel requested that the court instead fashion the order to direct that the mother must participate in counseling and must make a determination as to how she would structure her family life according to the court order.
the court responded that,in an effort to provide a meaningful reunification plan for mother,in the event these other individuals are in the home,certain conditions would need to take place in order for silvia to reside with the mother,so the court will make those counseling orders at this time.
mother filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
mother standing to appeal 
respondent contends mother does not have standing to challenge on appeal the orders directed toward stepfather and kevin because she is not an aggrieved party as to those portions of the order.respondent argues that mother arguments as to the injurious nature of the order are entirely speculative to wit,if stepfather and kevin do not comply with the counseling orders,as is likely,mother will not be able to reunify with silvia,even if mother complies fully.
mother argues that she has a legally cognizable,immediate and substantial interest in the disposition orders made because her child was declared a dependent and removed from her physical custody.her immediate and substantial interest is her liberty interest in parenting her daughter,with which the state has now substantially interfered.in re kieshia cal th,d.in addition,mother argues that her substantial interest in the proceedings may suffer some injury,actual or threatened as a consequence of the court directing disposition orders to two.see clifford superior court th,d.she asserts that even if the injury to her interests is only threatened,that is enough to trigger standing.
t he parent must establish he or she is a party aggrieved to obtain a review of a ruling on its merits.citations.to be aggrieved,a party must have a legally cognizable immediate and substantial interest which is injuriously affected by the court decision.a nominal interest or a remote consequence of the ruling does not satisfy this requirement.in re carissa th,d.
we conclude that mother has standing to obtain appellate review of the portions of the disposition order which purport to order stepfather and kevin,who are not parties and have not appeared in the matter to participate in counseling.those orders are an integral part of mother disposition plan,and they directly impact her prospects for reunifying with silvia.while stepfather and kevin conduct created the situation which led to the court assumption of jurisdiction,mother failure to protect silvia is the matter to be addressed by the disposition plan as it relates to mother.the manner in which she is ordered to address that problem,and the validity of the orders encompassed within her disposition plan,are issues which mother necessarily has standing to address.
ii.statutory authority to enter orders regarding 
mother contends that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to order stepfather and kevin to participate in counseling.we agree,and hold that when a child is removed from the parent home,the juvenile court is not authorized by section,subdivision c,to order other relatives with whom the child is not placed to participate in counseling or education programs.however,under section,subdivision c,the court may impose on the parent,as a condition of the disposition plan for reunification with the child,that the parent demonstrate to the court satisfaction that the parent can protect the child,subd.c.when the child has been the victim of sexual abuse by other relatives,the court may order that the plan for protection requires the parent to reside separately from the perpetrators,or to demonstrate that the perpetrators voluntarily participated in counseling and satisfactorily addressed the issues involved,such that the child may safely reside with them.
in dependency proceedings,a superior court convened as and exercising the special powers of a juvenile court is vested with jurisdiction to make only those limited determinations authorized by the legislative grant of those special powers.in re lisa cal d,see e ach superior court shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this chapter in the absence of such specific statutory authorization,a juvenile court is vested with authority to make only those determinations which are incidentally necessary to the performance of those functions demanded of it by the legislature pursuant to the juvenile court law.ibid.in re jody d.jody.
the purpose of dependency law is twofold to protect the welfare of children by the state acting as parens patriae and to safeguard the parents or guardians rights to raise their children by providing services to help them overcome problems which created the need for a dependency adjudication.id.at.the implementation of these goals is achieved through the statutorily prescribed dependency procedures.
after a section petition is sustained,the juvenile court proceeds to a disposition hearing.if the child is adjudged a dependent,the court must then determine whether to remove the child from the custody of the parent or guardian.in addition,the court is required,in the majority of cases,to order the parent or guardian to participate in services designed to overcome the problems which created the need for the dependency,subd.a,subd.a,subd.b.if the child is removed from the custody of a parent or guardian,the court must,in most cases,order the parent or guardian to participate in a reunification plan.ibid.
the court authorization to order participation in child welfare and reunification services is set forth in sections,and.see id.at.section,subdivision a directs the juvenile court,when applicable,to consider placing a dependent child who has been removed from his or her custodial parent with a noncustodial parent,and authorizes the court to order that reunification services be provided to either parent,or both,subd.b.
section provides in relevant part w henever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.upon a finding and declaration of paternity,the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father,if the court determines that the services will benefit the child,subd.a.when counseling or other treatment services are ordered,the parent or guardian shall be ordered to participate in those services,unless the parent or guardian participation is deemed by the court to be inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the child,subd.a.
section,subdivision a authorizes the juvenile court to make any and all reasonable orders for the care,supervision,custody,conduct,maintenance,and support of the child,including medical treatment,subject to further order of the court.subdivision c provides the juvenile court may direct any and all reasonable orders to the parents or guardians of the child who is the subject of any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this section that order may include a direction to participate in a counseling or education program,including,but not limited to,a parent education and parenting program a foster parent or relative with whom the child is placed may be directed to participate in such a program in cases in which the court deems participation is appropriate and in the child best interest.the program in which a parent or guardian is required to participate shall be designed to eliminate those conditions that led to the court finding that the child is a person described by section.
taken together,the plain meaning of these statutes limits the persons for whom reunification and welfare services may be ordered parents and guardians of the dependent child may be ordered to participate in reunification and child welfare services and foster parents and adult relatives with whom the child has been placed may be ordered to participate in certain designated services.jody,supra,d at.this is the conclusion reached in jody,where the court reviewed the foregoing statutes in the context of the juvenile court forced joinder of a mother companion,in order to secure his compliance with counseling orders directed toward his physical abuse of the children,who had been declared dependents of the court.id.at.the court concluded that because the mother companion was not the parent,guardian,relative or foster parent of the children,the juvenile court had no authority to order his participation in reunification services.id.at.accordingly,the court reversed the order joining the companion as a party to the dependency proceedings.id.at.
extended by analogy to the instant case,the holding of jody would dictate that the juvenile court had no authority to order stepfather and kevin to participate in sexual abuse counseling.neither stepfather nor kevin is a parent or guardian,and neither is a foster parent or adult relative with whom silvia has been placed.respondent contends,however,that the holding in jody is inapposite,as it involved a companion rather than a stepparent.respondent relies instead on the construction given to a portion of section,subdivision c by the court in in re venus,supra,d,to argue that the court here was authorized to make disposition orders directed toward stepfather and kevin.
the relevant portion of section,subdivision c states that a foster parent or relative with whom the child is placed may be directed to participate in such a program in cases in which the court deems participation is appropriate and in the child best interest.italics added.in venus,the juvenile court ordered a mother and stepfather to participate in joint and individual counseling to address child sexual abuse.mother and the stepfather appealed,contending that the court did not have jurisdiction to make the orders directed toward the stepfather.after recognizing the holding as to companions reached by the court in jody,supra,the court in venus stated w hether or not welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c applies to companions,it clearly and explicitly applies to a relative with whom the child is placed if family reunification takes place,the minor will be placed with her mother and stepfather for the purposes of section,subdivision c,we hold that both are relatives.venus,supra,d at,fn.omitted.the court continued given the purposes of the juvenile court law,we can not imagine that the legislature intended that stepfathers with whom the minor resides,and who were found to have abused their stepchildren,could in effect force the minor parent to choose between the stepparent and the child rather than require counseling as a reasonable condition precedent to family reunification.id.at.
we disagree with the venus court interpretation of the relevant portion of section,subdivision c,because it contradicts th
