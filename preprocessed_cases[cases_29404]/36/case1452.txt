in appeal no,monica appeals from an order terminating her parental rights with respect to three of her children,asia,james,and joel.in appeal no,robert appeals from the same order terminating his parental rights with respect to his child asia.the appeals have been consolidated and robert and monica raise overlapping arguments.
specifically,robert and monica contend there is insufficient evidence to support the court finding that there is a likelihood that the children will be adopted that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the termination of parental rights would not substantially interfere with sibling relationships and that the trial court further erred in failing to consider the wishes of the children prior to terminating parental rights.in addition,the parents contend that the trial court failed to secure compliance with the indian child welfare act icwa or the act.in a prior appeal from the dispositional order regarding joel in re joel may,wl nonpub.opn,this court determined that there had not been adequate compliance with icwa,and reversed,subject to reinstatement of the order upon compliance with the act and consideration of the requirements of welfare and institutions code section we conclude here that the court still has not properly secured compliance with icwa.moreover,the record does not reflect a likelihood of adoption sufficient to support the termination of robert and monica parental rights accordingly,we must again reverse.
factual and procedural history 
in march,the contra costa county department of social services the department filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that then james and then asia came within subdivisions g and i of section based upon monica drug use.monica admitted certain of the allegations in the petition and the children were placed in the care of her mother.robert has been in and out of prison throughout the dependency proceedings,and when released on parole his whereabouts have generally been unknown.
on august,the department filed a petition alleging that joel,then three days old,came within the meaning of section,subdivisions b,g and j,based upon monica drug use and joel positive test for drug exposure at birth.on september,monica admitted to an amended petition alleging only a subdivision b cause of action.throughout the next year,monica made substantial progress in drug treatment and,in december,joel was placed in her care.in june,asia and james were also placed in her care.
in february,however,a supplemental petition was filed alleging that the previous disposition had been ineffective in that monica had failed to keep her appointments and had been absent from the program for two days without making arrangements for the care of her children.all three children were removed from her care.on june,the court sustained the allegations in the supplemental petition and denied monica reunification services.the court also set a section hearing for james and asia.monica appealed the dispositional order on the supplemental petition regarding joel and argued,in addition to other contentions,that the court had failed to secure compliance with icwa.
the section hearing,originally set for october,was continued twice to permit the department to assess the adoptability of asia and james and was ultimately set for april.on december,the court set a section hearing in joel case,also to be heard on april.in the meantime,the department was authorized by the court to place asia and james with a foster family in stanislaus county because no suitable placement could be found within contra costa county.joel was placed for a portion of this time with his paternal grandmother,but was ultimately removed when his grandmother had financial difficulties and was unable to care for him.he was then placed in an emergency foster home.
at the permanency planning hearing held on april,the children social worker,rachel foster,testified regarding the notice she had given to various indian tribes as icwa admittedly required,and the responses she had received.the court concluded that proper notice had been given under icwa,and terminated parental rights to all three children,consistent with the department recommendation.robert and monica each filed timely notices of appeal.
on may,this court issued its opinion in in re joel,supra,in which it reversed the june,dispositional order as it related to joel,subject to reinstatement upon compliance with the icwa notice requirements.on october,the trial court conducted a further dispositional hearing and set a section hearing for january.in light of the ongoing proceedings in joel case,the department filed a motion to dismiss this appeal as it pertained to joel only.the motion was denied.
discussion 
initially,the department requests that we dismiss monica appeal on the ground that the appeal has not been authorized by monica.monica attorney signed the notice of appeal.in the absence of a satisfactory showing that the party did not authorize counsel to sign the notice of appeal,we presume that her counsel had the necessary authority to do so.in re malcolm th,d.
a lack of consent is shown when a parent,through his or her actions,demonstrates no true interest in preserving parental rights.in re sean th,d.here,monica has actively participated in the dependency proceedings.she attended the hearing on april.while she left the hearing early without explanation,she left her papers,book and water behind,indicating that she intended to return.contrary to the department assertion,her early departure from the hearing does not necessarily demonstrate a sufficient lack of interest in preserving her parental ties.nor can any reasonable inference be drawn regarding monica level of interest in her children from the fact that her attorney did not sign and file the notice of appeal until two days before the filing deadline.
monica conduct is markedly different from that of the parents in the cases relied upon by the department,in re sean,supra,th,d in re alma th,d.in sean,the court held that the department made a sufficient showing that the appeal was not authorized where the parent was properly notified of the selection and implementation hearing and could have attended but instead telephoned her attorney and told him she was not going to appear.th at,d.likewise,in alma the court found a sufficient showing of disinterest in the proceedings where the parent was not present at the hearing and neither the department nor her counsel knew her whereabouts.th at,d.
moreover,in opposition to the department motion to dismiss,monica appellate counsel has submitted a declaration stating,i have spoken with appellant numerous times during the pendancy of both her appeals s ince the filing of the notice of appeal in this case,appellant has once again made it extremely clear that she is most desirous of regaining custody of her children and pursuing this matter on appeal.accordingly,we deny the department request to dismiss the appeal,and we turn to the merits of the challenges to the order terminating parental rights.
icwa compliance 
monica and robert question whether the trial court made the necessary determination that icwa did not apply to the children and reassert that substantial evidence does not support the conclusion that notice had been given in compliance with icwa.initially,we reject the contention that the trial court was required to make an express finding that icwa did not apply.while the record must reflect that the court considered the issue and decided whether icwa applies,its finding may be either express or implied.in re jennifer th,d in re levi th,d.here the trial court expressly found that notice had been given pursuant to icwa and then proceeded to terminate appellants parental rights under the usual rather than the heightened icwa standards.thus,the court implicitly found that icwa was not applicable.nonetheless,the record does not support the finding that the notice given by the department to the tribes satisfied the requirements of icwa.
title united states code section a provides in relevant part in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.california rule of court,rule g provides that the juvenile court hearing shall not proceed until at least days after those entitled to notice under the act have received notice.finally,the california department of social services,child welfare services manual of policies and procedures,regulation,requires that the notice given to the indian child parent and to the child tribe be sent on form soc entitled notice of hearing and be received by the indian child parent and tribe no later than days prior to the hearing date.
at the april,hearing,foster testified that she sent off completed and forms to the bureau of indian affairs bia as well as a list of all apach√© and cheyenne tribes within the united states and that she received a number of responses from the tribes o f those responses,they all indicated that neither parent nor child is registered nor eligible to be registered.the ones that i have not received a letter from the tribe directly,i do have the green certified cards that they did,in fact,receive the and forms but have not received an official response from them.she indicated that she received certified mail receipt cards from all the tribes,as well as from the bia and monica,which showed receipt between march and.however,neither copies of the completed forms,return receipt cards nor any other correspondence was received into evidence.
monica and robert contend that foster testimony is insufficient to demonstrate compliance with icwa because the forms were mailed to the wrong addresses,and that without reviewing copies of the forms,the court could not and did not verify that the information submitted to the tribes was accurate and complete in in re marinna th,footnote,d,the court set out the necessary steps for ensuring compliance with icwa to satisfy the notice provisions of the act and to provide a proper record for the juvenile court and appellate courts,a social service agency should follow a procedure.first,it should identify any possible tribal affiliations and send proper notice to those entities,return receipt requested.rule f.second,the agency should provide to the juvenile court a copy of the notice sent and the return receipt,as well as any correspondence received from the indian entity relevant to the minor status.this procedure was emphasized in two recent cases.in re th,d in re jennifer,supra,th at,d.in jennifer,the court reversed the trial court jurisdictional and dispositional orders,holding that the record did not support the court finding of icwa compliance where the only evidence received was the social worker testimony that she had sent notice to the relevant tribe and to the bia.in re jennifer,supra,th at,d.the court emphasized that the procedure set forth in marinna had not been followed and held that presentation of the required documents to the appellate court by request for judicial notice was not an available solution.id.at,d.the court noted that without the required documents the court did not have a sufficient record from which to make a determination whether there had been compliance with the notice provisions of the icwa,or whether further inquiry was needed.id.at,d.the court concluded that the error was not harmless,even though the department had presented to the appellate court a letter from the tribe sent two months after the hearing stating that the child was not an indian child within the meaning of the act.id.at,d.the court reasoned that the notice sent to the tribe,of which the court did take judicial notice,omitted family information that seemingly was available and incorrectly related other information,so that it was necessary for the trial court to review the information in the first instance to make the necessary determination of compliance.ibid.similarly,in,the court warned we hold that a party,such as the department here,who seeks the foster care placement or termination of parental rights to a child who may be eligible for indian child status,must do the following or face the strong likelihood of reversal on appeal to this court.first,the department must complete and serve,pursuant to the terms of united states code section a the notice of involuntary child custody proceeding involving an indian child along with a copy of the dependency petition.second,the department must file with the superior court copies of proof of the registered mail or certified mail and the return receipt s,the completed notice of involuntary child custody proceeding involving an indian child that was served,and any responses received.in re,supra,th at,d.in,the department failed to use the proper form and had not sent the notice by registered mail.the department argued that the error was harmless since it had received a response from the relevant tribe stating that the children were not affiliated with it.the court disagreed,pointing out that although the bia periodically publishes a current list of designated tribal agents for service of process,the department had not sent the notice to the tribe chairperson or to its designated agent for service of process.id.at,d.the court concluded that because there was no showing in the record that the response was from the proper person,the court could not rely on that letter as evidence of the tribe lack of interest in the proceedings.id.at,d.
here,the department failed to comply with the second step in in re marinna th,d by failing to submit the required documentation to the court for its review.while foster testimony provides evidence that she did use the correct form and served the notices by registered mail,copies of the forms were never submitted to the court.hence,the court was unable to evaluate the sufficiency of the notices sent.the department argues that it was unnecessary to submit the form to the court as there is no evidence to suggest either that foster was untruthful or that the notices were in some fashion defective.absent the ability to review the forms,however,neither the trial court nor this court has the ability to evaluate whether the forms were defective.moreover,the record does provide reason to question whether there was a defect in the notice given to several of the tribes because the department failed to serve the notice on the chairperson or designated agent for service of process as required by statute.rule e,specifically directs that n otice to the tribe shall be to the tribal chairman unless the tribe has designated another agent for service.foster testified that she sent notice to the apache business committee in anadarko,oklahoma,rather than the apache tribe of oklahoma,chairperson as listed in the most recent federal register.similarly,notice was addressed to the cheyenne arapaho business committee rather than the cheyenne arapaho tribes of oklahoma,chairperson the fort sill apache business committee rather than the fort sill apache tribe of oklahoma,chairperson and the northern cheyenne tribal council in lame deer rather than the northern cheyenne tribe of northern cheyenne reservation,director,tribal social services.absent some evidence that the various business committees had authority to speak for the tribes or that the responses received by foster came from an authorized agent,the failure to submit the necessary documents to the court can not be considered harmless.in re,supra,th at,d no evidence that enrollment committee chairman for the santa ynez band of mission indians had authority to speak for tribe when designated agent for service of process under the federal register was santa ynez band of mission indians,icwa coordinator.accordingly,the matter must be reversed for further compliance with icwa 
clear and convincing evidence of adoptability 
robert and monica also appeal from the order terminating their parental rights on the ground that there is insufficient evidence of the children adoptability.in order for a juvenile court to terminate parental rights under section,the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely that the child will be adopted,subd.c.we review the juvenile court order to determine whether the record contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find clear and convincing evidence that asia,james and joel were likely to be adopted,subd.c in re lukas th,d.clear and convincing evidence requires a finding of high probability.the evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.in re jerome th,d.
the issue of adoptability requires the court to focus on the child,and whether the child age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt.citations.it is not necessary that the child already be placed in a preadoptive home,or that a proposed adoptive parent be waiting.citations.however,there must be convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will take place within a reasonable time.citation.in re brian th,d.usually,the fact that a prospective adoptive parent has expressed interest in adopting the minor is evidence that the minor age,physical condition,mental state,and other matters relating to the child are not likely to dissuade individuals from adopting the minor.in other words,a prospective adoptive parent willingness to adopt generally indicates the minor is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time either by the prospective adoptive parent or by some other family.in re sarah th,d.alternatively,evidence of approved families willing to adopt a child of this age,physical condition,and emotional state can be used to evaluate the likelihood of the child adoption.in re jerome,supra,th at,d in re jennilee th,d finding a likelihood of adoption where the social worker had identified one family within the foster care system and three families outside the system,in addition to a potential relative,who were all willing to adopt a child with potential neurological problems and all the attendant risks.
the evidence regarding the likelihood that james and asia will be adopted is as follows.in anticipation of the initial october permanency planning hearing,foster submitted a report that indicated that although james suffered from asthma and early exposure to lead,he was a healthy child and that,while he appeared to be physically developing normally,he lacked appropriate socialization skills.at the time of that report,james attended a regular first grade class,and his teacher reported that while he was a bright and energetic child,his behavior prevented him from accomplishing what he was capable of doing.he needs constant supervision and is often out of control in the classroom to the point that he may not be able to be maintained in the classroom.james therapist reported that james was a bright child who is highly responsive to positive attention but that he was also extremely hyperactive and in need of medication he is the most hyperactive child she has ever seen.she said that james requires a great deal of limit setting and containment as he has a poor attention span and impulse control,has a low frustration tolerance,and makes abrupt changes.in her report,foster stated that james has a probability for adoption but it is difficult to place based on the fact that,at this time,there is no identified prospective parent.she requested and was granted a day continuance to further assess james adoptability.
foster also prepared a report on asia in anticipation of the october hearing.she indicated that while asia suffers from enuresis,she was overall a healthy child and was on target developmentally.while the report states that asia is a super bright child,her teacher also reported that she has a problem with not listening,staying still,and stealing.asia therapist reported that she is hyperactive,steals,lies,hoards material items not food,aggravates other children,and pulls her braids out of her head when upset.the report states that the department believes an ideal home for asia would be a specialized placement where she is the youngest child where the parents are experienced and capable of dealing with and providing structure to a hyperactive child one where the primary parent stays home and one that will advocate for,participate in,and on all physical,mental health,and school related appointments.the report does not reach a conclusion regarding the likelihood of adoption and requests a day continuance to further assess asia adoptability.the hearing was continued until january.
in a supplemental report prepared for the january hearing,foster indicated that james was undergoing a full assessment and that he had been taking ritalin with mixed results.she also reported that asia,while in therapy,was acting out confusion and distress in her play.foster stated that the department has determined that the children are adoptable but are in need of specialized placements and requested a continuance to enable them to review a number of interested families home studies.in preparation for the april hearing,foster submitted an additional report,indicating that in the approximately two to three months since james and asia were placed with a foster family agency in stanislaus county,they have continued to reciprocally connect with the foster parents and older foster brother and a lthough james and asia foster parents have indicated that they are willing to explore adoption of the children,it is too soon for them to make such a permanent and life changing decision.regarding the likelihood of adoptability,foster concludes although there is no identified prospective adoptive parent at this time,children and family services is confident that a prospective adoptive family can be located for james and asia.
while the age and physical health of james and asia weigh in favor of adoptability,their emotional and psychological development present a potential obstacle to adoption.the department recognized that james and asia would require specialized placement which at least initially was not available within contra costa county yet the department failed to provide evidence of approved families willing to adopt children with the developmental problems faced by james and asia.moreover,unlike the situation in in re sarah,supra,the foster parents willingness to explore the option of adopting james and asia is too vague to be considered evidence that some family,if not this foster family,would be willing to adopt these children.in re jerome,supra,th at,d stepfather willingness and desire to adopt child were not sufficient to support the adoptability finding in re amelia d.permanency hearing report indicating that a few foster parents were considering adoption is a far cry from the clear and convincing evidence required to establish the likelihood of adoption.likewise,the social worker conclusion alone is insufficient to support a finding of adoptability.in re brian,supra,th at,d.this evidence simply fails to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that there is a likelihood that asia and james will be adopted within a reasonable time.
the evidence regarding joel adoptability is similarly weak.foster prepared a report for joel in preparation for the april,hearing.in it she described joel as a cute,smart,hyperactive child.the report indicates that although joel tested positive for drug exposure at birth and has asthma,he is generally healthy.he is developmentally on target and presents as a happy child although he has a temper when angered or does not get his way.regarding the likelihood of adoption,the report concludes that children and family services is confident that an adoptive home can be located for joel.again,however,the department failed to provide evidence that there were approved families interested in adopting a child similar to joel.foster suggests that the department would consider joel with his nonbiological paternal grandmother if she got back on her feet financially,and alternatively,that the current caretakers for james and asia have expressed an interest in having joel placed in their care.these suggestions,however,are too vague and specula
