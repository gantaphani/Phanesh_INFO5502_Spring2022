ramadan sabbah challenges the court denial of both his new trial motion and his application under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,for relief from a restraining order against him he contends his wife,doreen sabbah failed to carry her burden of proving he committed domestic violence,and the court erred by failing to give him notice under family code section that a domestic violence finding against him would adversely affect him in custody determinations.the latter argument requires us to interpret family code section to determine when and under what circumstances the statutory notice is required.under our interpretation of the statute,we affirm the court judgment and its order denying his application to set aside the restraining order.
in december,doreen obtained a domestic violence temporary restraining order against ramadan seeking,inter alia,custody of their children,and noticed a hearing on her request for a restraining order.her subsequently filed supplemental declaration stated,inter alia december,ramadan,came into the kitchen and i was backed to the wall and he grabbed me by the throat and then grabbed a potato peeler and held it up as a weapon.december,i left the apartment to take the children to school when i returned ramadan had locked me out.he told me i could not come in and to go to hell.she alleged she was locked out of their apartment for several days.
in his answer to the temporary order,ramadan agreed to doreen requested custody order,with the notation please see attached dissolution of marriage,but contested all other requests,other than visitation which he left blank.in his attachments,ramadan stated,as for the incident she spoke of,the entire agony and argument came as soon as she heard me saying to her i will be moving out of the bedroom i went to the kitchen to peel a sic,and as soon as she came to the kitchen,i started to have pain in my chest,so i told her not to insult me again you ungrateful bitch,after i fed,clothe,shelter and put you through a law school by morning i started to feel heavy pain going thru my chest and my left arm as said to myself if she start s to babble like last night i might drop dead,so she came home two hours after dropping the kids to locked the door from i told her to go away,i not gon na have three heart attacks in one year ramadan asked the court to enforce the dissolution of marriage signed on as to child and spousal support and requested that if the children want to see me and have a relationship with ask the court to facilitate such request.ramadan attached a copy of the dissolution of marriage agreement in which the parties agreed,inter alia,that doreen would have full and legal custody of their five children 
at the january,hearing,both parties acted in propria persona.doreen is a california licensed attorney.the court summarized,and doreen confirmed,that her allegations generally were ramadan grabbed her throat and threatened her with a potato peeler,and he locked her out of the apartment.doreen testified that after ramadan locked her out of the apartment,the police advised her to find a place to stay near the court so she could file the temporary restraining order paperwork the next day.ramadan testified w hen i locked her out i did experience the symptoms of a severe heart attack on the,which is the next day after she had the fight with me.so the best thing i thought to protect my life is just to close the door and for her to go somewhere else until the kids come home.i did that.the second thing about the kitchen instance w e had a dissolution of marriage in she wanted me out of the kids life completely.i signed this letting her have custody of the children,but now she does want me to have any relationship with the children.
the court found ramadan had perpetrated domestic violence against doreen and granted a restraining order against him.the court also awarded doreen sole custody of the children with monitored visitation rights to ramadan.
ramadan then retained counsel who filed a motion for a new trial and to set aside the restraining order pursuant to code of civil procedure section.ramadan asserted he did not understand nor realize the impact of the domestic violence action on child custody and related issues on the other hand,doreen,as an attorney previously employed by a family law firm and knowledgeable regarding the import of a domestic violence action,knew exactly what she was doing to obtain custody of the children 
doreen retained counsel and argued ramadan reliance upon family code section section to support his motion is misplaced although ramadan motion did not expressly mention section,doreen apparently inferred from his reference to her seeking custody that he was relying on the statute,because section creates a rebuttable presumption that an award of custody to a domestic violence perpetrator is not in the child best interest.section,subdivision f section f requires a court under certain circumstances to inform the parties about the statute,as discussed in more detail post.doreen argued section is predicated upon the party accused of domestic violence seeking custody of the children,and further contended section f only requires notice prior to custody mediation she asserted ramadan motion must fail because he never requested custody.
at the hearing on the motion,ramadan counsel argued he was not aware of section and the court should have given him notice of that before any proceeding occurred in this case.the court denied ramadan motion,finding section is inapplicable,and the criteria necessary for setting aside the court orders under code of civil procedure,section were not met.
discussion 
substantial evidence supported the court finding ramadan committed acts of domestic violence 
ramadan asserts doreen failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he perpetrated domestic violence,contending this was a classic liars contest with one party arguing that events occurred while the other party argue d that they did not.thus,ramadan essentially challenges the court factual finding he committed the alleged acts of domestic violence 
a reviewing court applies the substantial evidence standard of review to a trial court factual findings,regardless of the burden of proof at trial.in re marriage of murray th,d see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.our sole inquiry is whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supporting the court finding.howard owens corning th,d.we must accept as true all evidence tending to establish the correctness of the trial court findings,resolving every conflict in favor of the judgment.ibid.
contrary to ramadan assertion that he denied doreen domestic violence allegations,he admitted locking her out of their apartment.moreover,even if he had denied all her allegations,it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of a witness lenk,th,d.the court evidently found credible doreen testimony about the potato peeler and incidents.the testimony of a single witness may provide sufficient evidence.in re marriage of mix cal d.in sum,substantial evidence supported the court finding ramadan committed the alleged acts of domestic violence.
the court properly ruled section was inapplicable 
ramadan contends the court erred by ruling he was not entitled to notice under section f of the rebuttable presumption against an award of custody to a domestic violence perpetrator.he implies he would have more vigorously contested doreen abuse allegations if he had known a domestic violence finding against him would trigger the presumption that his gaining custody of the children would be detrimental to them.according to ramadan,the purpose of section f is to mandate notice to the parties to restraining order applications of the significance of a finding of domestic violence.in his view,a person accused of domestic abuse must be given the section f notice before any decisions are made regarding domestic violence,while the accused can still defend against the accusation.
the court ruled section f did not apply at the point in time of a domestic violence underly
