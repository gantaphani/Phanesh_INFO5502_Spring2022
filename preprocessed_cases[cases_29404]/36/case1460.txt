taylor has filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the juvenile court dismissal of her dependency petition.she contends she was denied due process because the court dismissed the petition without notice,a hearing,and a statement of legal authority and insofar as the dismissal was pursuant to the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,et,the uccjea is inapplicable.taylor mother,vanessa mother and alleged father,marcus,marcus,agree with taylor position.the san diego county health and human services agency the agency asserts that the dependency petition was properly denied,as does family to family adoptions family to family,a private texas adoption agency.we agree with taylor that the juvenile court improperly dismissed the dependency petition without an adequate hearing and accordingly issue a writ of mandate.
background 
taylor was born in june and immediately placed on a hold in the hospital,where she remained in intensive care for the first few weeks of her life.on june,the agency filed a dependency petition alleging that mother had tested positively for amphetamine and methamphetamine at the time of taylor birth.mother admitted a history of drug use,including during pregnancy she had had no prenatal care and the identity of taylor father was unknown.the petition listed curtis as an alleged father.mother said that marcus,might also be the father.marcus,whereabouts were unknown.
marcus,and mother have two older children,marcus,and cheyenne,who are placed with dawn marcus mother and mother stepmother mother and marcus,parental rights to marcus,and cheyenne were terminated in,apparently due to neglect and drug use.the agency conducted home studies of dawn and a san bernardino or riverside county couple to clear both households for the of marcus,and cheyenne.before taylor birth,mother promised her to dawn and the san bernardino or riverside county couple as parents.
around the time of taylor birth,mother told a hospital social worker that she was in the process of having taylor adopted.this was confirmed by catholic charities,which was handling the matter for mother,and which reported that the prospective adoptive parents were a canadian couple.a home study of the canadian couple had been conducted in march on june,in san diego county,mother and curtis signed relinquishments of parental rights through catholic charities family to family,the texas adoption agency,was handling the matter for the canadian couple,who had traveled to san diego to complete the adoption catholic charities had initiated interstate compact on placement of children icpc proceedings with texas.
taylor detention hearing took place on june.a juvenile court referee found there was a prima facie showing she was a child described by welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b detained her in foster care and ordered paternity tests.while the tests apparently showed that marcus,was taylor biological father,the referee never made a paternity finding,although marcus,requested one.on september,the referee found that curtis was not taylor biological father.
on june,marcus,reported to the agency that mother had not told him that she had contacted an adoption agency he was opposed to the canadian couple adoption and he wanted dawn to care for taylor.however,on june,in san diego county,he signed a relinquishment through catholic charities.on july,he said that he had changed his mind and wanted the canadian couple to adopt taylor.he subsequently expressed a desire to revoke his relinquishment.
in addition to the relinquishments,mother marcus,and curtis all signed agreements to submit to texas jurisdiction.mother and curtis agreements bear the date july.marcus,agreement lists the date july just under his signature,but just above the notary public signature lists the date june.all three documents were executed in california.
at a july,special hearing,the referee authorized visitation for the canadian couple.they began visits soon after.unnamed paternal relatives apparently began visits later in july.on july,catholic charities notified the agency that the texas department of protective and regulatory services had approved the icpc.the approval allowed taylor to be placed with family to family.
at the july,jurisdictional hearing,the referee continued the matter to july to allow counsel to research whether texas or california law applied whether the relinquishments were valid and whether motions to withdraw the relinquishments should be filed.
at a july,special hearing set by mother,the canadian couple,and family to family,family to family moved to dismiss the dependency proceeding on the ground that the relinquishments were valid and irrevocable,a proceeding to terminate parental rights had been filed in texas on july,all requirements under texas law for the family to family adoption had been met,and family to family was prepared to take custody of taylor immediately.following a discussion about standing,the validity of the relinquishments,and whether california or texas had jurisdiction,as well as other issues,the referee changed the july hearing to a special hearing on those issues and the issues of paternity the request by counsel for marcus,for a guardian ad litem for his client and whether dawn home should be inspected for detention and placement and her visits be unsupervised.the court continued the jurisdictional hearing to august.
at the july,special hearing,the referee outlined the issues discussed the matter by telephone with the texas judge stayed the dependency proceedings set an evidentiary hearing for august on the validity,under texas law,of the relinquishments and appointed a guardian ad litem for marcus.
at an august,special hearing set by the agency,the referee again spoke to the texas court stated he was exercising emergency jurisdiction under the uccjea and decided that the texas court would hear the relinquishment issue.
on august,the referee told marcus,to file an action to set aside his relinquishment in texas within three weeks or he would dismiss the dependency case and the adoption would proceed vacated the august hearing date relieved marcus,guardian ad litem suspended the dependency proceedings and continued the matter to september.
on september,marcus,attorney told the court that marcus,had filed paperwork in texas.taylor attorney noted that the matter in texas could be continuing indefinitely and requested that the stay of the dependency proceedings be lifted and jurisdictional and dispositional hearings be set.the attorney appearing for the agency asked that the matter be continued for a brief time so that the agency attorney who was most familiar with the case could respond.the referee stated that he had telephoned the texas judge on august and intended to call again to ask how long the texas proceedings might last.the referee continued the matter to september.
at the outset of the september,hearing,the referee said that on september,the texas judge had stated that after a party in the texas action requested an evidentiary hearing,the matter would be calendared within days.the referee said that in light of this statement,he would probably not dismiss the dependency case unless and until the relinquishment issue were resolved in family to family favor.
family to family counsel then reported that a hearing on marcus,motion to transfer the case from texas to california and on other matters had been set for september,in texas.family to family renewed its motion to dismiss the dependency petition,joined by the canadian couple and mother.marcus,counsel argued that dismissing the petition would be premature in view of the pending texas proceedings and that there was still a protective issue.the agency submitted on the dismissal issue,noting that it was opposed to dismissal but that in view of the relinquishments,technically there was no protective issue unless marcus,relinquishment were held to be invalid,and that the parents lacked standing.the agency asked that if the referee did dismiss the petition,he order taylor released to family to family.taylor counsel renewed her request that the stay of the dependency proceedings be lifted and jurisdictional and dispositional hearings be set.
the referee denied taylor counsel request,found there was no protective issue,dismissed the petition,and invoked uccjea emergency jurisdiction to place taylor in family to family custody.taylor counsel asserted that she had a right to a contested hearing before dismissal and alternatively asked for a stay of the dismissal order so she could file a writ petition.the referee denied the request.
after taylor counsel asked for a rehearing,the juvenile court issued a stay restricting taylor travel out of the county pending receipt of a reporter transcript of the september,hearing.on october,the court denied the rehearing request and stayed the dismissal of the dependency petition until the close of business on october.
on october,taylor counsel filed this petition for writ of mandate.on october,we stayed the dismissal of the dependency petition until further order and directed the parties to respond to the petition.on october,the texas judge denied marcus,request to transfer the matter to california and held that his relinquishment was valid.on october,we denied the agency motion to deny the writ petition as moot on november,we issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
the initial question here is one of standing.while the canadian couple who wish to adopt taylor are not parties to this writ proceeding,they participated in the hearings below and presumably will want to do so again upon remand.family to family participated in the hearings in juvenile court,has filed pleadings in this writ proceeding,and presumably will also wish to continue its participation.
the canadian couple and family to family lack the standing accorded to parents and de facto parents.seiser kumli,california juvenile courts practice and procedure ed.a,a.a de facto parent is one who has been found by the court to have assumed,on a basis,the role of parent,fulfilling both the child physical and psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period.cal.rules of court,rule a.it is clear that the canadian couple and for that matter,family to family lacks the close relationship with taylor such that the court would profit by hearing their views as to her best interests.in re cal d,fn.indeed,while the canadian couple began visiting taylor in early july,the record fails to disclose the quantity and quality of that visitation.furthermore,as discussed below,the relinquishments are invalid they therefore do not confer standing on either the canadian couple or family to family.
in addition to the lack of standing of family to family,the entity that requested dismissal of the dependency petition,there are two other factors bearing on the propriety of the dismissal whether taylor was entitled to and denied an evidentiary hearing and whether a protective issue remained.
we first consider whether taylor was entitled to an evidentiary hearing before dismissal of the dependency petition.in guadalupe superior court d,at the review hearing,at the close of the department of social services case,the juvenile court made a sua sponte motion under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c on the ground that the department had not met its burden of proving that it would be detrimental to return the dependent child to her mother.guadalupe superior court,supra,d at.the child counsel objected,arguing that she should have an opportunity to present her case.id.at.the juvenile court granted the motion without taking further evidence and ordered that the child be returned to her mother.id.at.the reviewing court reversed and remanded,holding that while the juvenile court refusal to let the child counsel present evidence before ruling on the motion was consistent with the existing version of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c,the refusal constituted prejudicial error because it was inconsistent with the mandate to fully protect the interests of the minor.guadalupe superior court,supra,d at.
in allen superior court th,d,this court held that when the department of social services wishes to dismiss a dependency petition over the child objection,the juvenile court must determine whether dismissal is in the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor.id.at,d.the department of social services had filed two dependency petitions,one alleging sexual abuse by the father and one alleging domestic violence and alcohol abuse,then,at the readiness hearing,moved to dismiss the sexual abuse petition due to insufficient evidence and the parents willingness to admit the other allegations.ibid.the children counsel objected to the dismissal for evidentiary and other reasons.id.at,d.the juvenile court denied the dismissal motion and set a contested jurisdictional hearing.id.at,d.the father sought a writ of mandate.ibid.in denying the writ petition,this court stated we conclude that when the department wishes to dismiss a petition it must notify all interested persons in order to afford each the opportunity to object and be heard.if a parent or minor does object,resolution of the matter is properly by an order to show cause hearing requiring the department to establish why the petition should be dismissed although the court may accord great deference to the department expertise,the primary focus of the court is the determination of whether dismissal is in the interests of justice and the welfare of the minor.on that basis the court may either grant the dismissal or order the department to proceed with the petition.id.at,d.
in kimberly superior court th,d,this court determined that the agency may not unilaterally dismiss a supplemental petition it filed to remove a dependent child from a parent physical custody over the objection of minor counsel.id.at,d.rather,the agency must show that dismissal is in the interests of justice and welfare of the child.ibid.while this court concluded that the juvenile court should have required the agency to show cause why the supplemental petition should be dismissed,the error was harmless the mother did not claim a due process denial and the court admitted the agency various reports and the many witnesses were thoroughly examined in the course of a full evidentiary hearing.id.at,d.
based on the above case law,we conclude that taylor was entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the referee dismissed the dependency petition.she did not receive one.the dismissal issue was first raised on july,and the discussion continued during the next five hearings,including the september hearing when the referee ultimately dismissed the petition.during those hearings,the referee expressed various points of view on the issues,as did the parties and taylor counsel objected to dismissal and asked that the court set a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.
the error in denying taylor an evidentiary hearing was not harmless.the only items of evidence adduced were the relinquishments and related documents attached to the dismissal motion.in that there was little if any other information concerning the continuing existence of a protective issue,the dismissal was inconsistent with the juvenile court duty to protect taylor welfare and act in the interests of justice.guadalupe superior court,supra,d at.allen superior court,supra,th at,d kimberly superior court,supra,th at,d welf,subd.c.
we conclude that the dismissal order must be vacated and the matter remanded.for the guidance of the juvenile court on remand,we discuss whether a protective issue may remain,necessitating the continuation of the dependency proceedings rather than dismissal of the petition.in this case,the existence of a protective issue appears to depend,at least in part,on the status of the relinquishments by mother and marcus.
in teresa superior court th,d,after the child was declared a dependent,his mother relinquished him to a private adoption agency.id.at,d.the juvenile court determined that the relinquishment was invalid,holding that a dependent child can be relinquished only to the state department of social services or a local public adoption agency.id.at,d.the reviewing court disagreed,c
