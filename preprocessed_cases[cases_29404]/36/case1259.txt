in dwayne superior court th,d dwayne,this court held in a first review pertaining to notice under the indian child welfare act icwa et that the parents failure to object at the juvenile court did not constitute waiver or otherwise preclude appellate review.we relied on the court continuing sua sponte duty throughout dependency proceedings to ensure the requisite notice is given and the protections the icwa affords indian tribes and indian children.in a previous appeal in this case,in accordance with dwayne,we conditionally reversed a judgment terminating the parental rights of anthony and nancy to their daughter,and remanded the matter to the juvenile court for the limited purpose of complying with icwa notice requirements.in re,wl,nonpub.opn.
the principal question here is whether the their failure to raise any objection at the special hearing on remand devoted to the adequacy of icwa notices to the bureau of indian affairs bia and numerous indian raise the issue again on appeal.we hold as an apparent matter of first impression that forfeiture principles preclude a second appellate review in such a case,as further delay harms the paramount interests of dependent children in permanence and stability.the purposes of the icwa are indeed commendable,but we do not believe congress envisioned or intended successive or serial appeals on icwa notice issues when,given a proper objection,they could easily be resolved during proceedings on remand for the specific purpose of determining whether proper notice was given.
on the parents appeals,we affirm the judgment of termination of their parental rights to to the extent anthony purports in his appeal to challenge the judgment terminating parental rights to his son,we dismiss the appeal for untimeliness.we also deny the parents petition for habeas corpus 
factual and procedural background 
in april the agency took,then five months old,into protective custody and filed a petition on her behalf under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a and b.the petition alleged was at risk because she witnessed domestic violence between the parents and they have a history of drug abuse.anthony advised the agency he had sioux and blackfeet heritage but was not a registered member of a tribe.the agency did not notify the bia or any indian tribe of the proceedings,but at the detention hearing the court nonetheless found the icwa inapplicable.
in may the court made a true finding on the petition,removed from parental custody and ordered family reunification services.in august nancy gave birth to a boy.she was incarcerated at the time for spousal abuse and assault with a deadly weapon.the following month,the court declared a dependent child and placed him in foster care.
in case,the court terminated reunification services at the date in october and scheduled a permanency planning hearing under section.anthony had tested positive for drugs,but denied substance abuse,and nancy was unwilling to live separately from him.
in april the court terminated the parents rights to and selected adoption as the preferred permanent plan.nancy appealed the judgment,and she,and the agency stipulated to reversal because the agency did not comply with icwa notice requirements.we conditionally reversed the judgment and instructed the court to direct the agency to provide proper icwa notice to the bia and any appropriate tribes.we also ordered the court to reinstate the judgment if,after receiving notice,no tribe intervened.in re,wl,nonpub.opn.
at a hearing in october the court ordered the agency to provide proper icwa notice.an agency social worker interviewed the paternal grandmother,and she reported possible cherokee,sioux and blackfeet heritage.the agency sent separate notices for each child to the bia,fifteen sioux tribes,three cherokee tribes,the prairie island community and the blackfeet tribe.
on november,the court held permanency planning hearing.the court found icwa notice was given as required by law,is not an indian child and icwa is inapplicable.the court terminated parental rights to.the parents did not attend the hearing or raise any objection through their counsel to the icwa findings.further,they did not appeal the judgment.
on december,the court held a special hearing on the icwa issue in case.the parents did not attend,but they were each represented by counsel.the paternal grandmother,maternal grandparents and other relatives attended.four tribes had responded that was not eligible for enrollment,and the bia stated it could not determine on the information provided that is an indian child within the meaning of the icwa.the court found notice was given in accordance with the icwa,is not an indian child and the icwa is inapplicable.the court asked whether there was any objection to the findings,and counsel and nancy counsel stated they had no objection.anthony counsel said nothing at the hearing.the court reinstated the previous judgment terminating parental rights to 
discussion 
ijurisdictional issue 
preliminarily,we note that in his appeal anthony purports to challenge the termination of his parental rights to both and anthony,however,did not timely appeal the november,judgment terminating his rights to.he appealed the december,judgment,naming both and,but it pertains only to the termination of parental rights to 
a judgment terminating parental rights is appealable under section,and our jurisdiction to review such a judgment is contingent on a timely notice of appeal.in re jonathon th,d.accordingly,we lack jurisdiction to review the court judgment terminating parental rights to and we dismiss anthony appeal as to him.
icwa noticea 
anthony and nancy contend in their appeals that the termination of their parental rights to must be reversed because of irregularities in the icwa notices.the record on appeal does not reveal the problems,and thus the parents also petition for a writ of habeas corpus pertaining to both and and submit supporting evidence 
anthony submitted a declaration by the paternal grandmother,which stated she told the social worker in september that her mother,velia,told her she had blackfeet,sioux and cherokee indian heritage from her father,jesus mendoza.the paternal grandmother further stated she told the social worker that her paternal,trudy little,was half cherokee.the agency icwa notices,however,referred to velia as delia and to jesus mendoza as jesse mendoza,and as to little stated the family believes she was cherokee.
the printed form the agency used to send notice to the indian tribes stated that if cherokee ancestry from oklahoma was alleged,the name of a relative must be provided who might have been enrolled in the final roll prepared in by the dawes commission referred to as the final roll,and if cherokee ancestry from another state was alleged,to prove descendency one must be related to a person listed on the roll of for the eastern band of cherokees.the form asked,do you know the name of any indian relative that was alive in or and might have been listed on either the final roll or the roll of,to which the agency checked the box marked unknown.the paternal grandmother declaration stated the social worker did not ask her whether any of the relatives she mentioned were alive in or.
the agency contends california courts should draw the line someplace,and thus the parents may not challenge the adequacy of icwa notice a second time when they failed to raise any objection at the special hearing on remand.whether the parents may raise the issue again at this stage of the proceedings is a question of law.
in congress enacted the icwa to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.the icwa recognizes that the tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.citation.the icwa presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations,a most important resource.citation.congress has concluded the state courts have not protected these interests and drafted a
