in this postdissolution proceeding,the california child support services department cssd filed a motion to determine whether the husband owed arrearages on spousal and child support under a september judgment of dissolution,and,if so,the amount due.the husband argued that all issues as to arrearages had been resolved by way of a may agreement between the parties.the wife asserted that there was no enforceable agreement.the trial court found in favor of the wife.
after the judgment of dissolution,the husband did not make any support payments for nearly eight years.in may,he offered to pay less than of the arrearages then due in exchange for a release as to the remaining arrearages and a waiver of all future child and spousal support,with the exception of an unspecified amount of child support warranted by the child or the wife financial situation.the husband offered to pay about of the more than in arrearages.
the principal question on appeal is whether the parties could lawfully forgive the husband agreed to pay only a portion of what he owed.we conclude that such an agreement is unenforceable where it does not resolve any bona fide disputes between the parties and is offered on a basis.we also conclude that the agreement did not waive future support.we therefore affirm.
background 
the following facts are taken from the evidence submitted in connection with the cssd motion.
toshio and sabine,both japanese citizens,were married in the united states in april.they had a daughter,in october.in april,sabine filed a petition in the trial court to dissolve the marriage.toshio moved back to japan one month later.
trial in the matter was set for july.toshio was not present or represented at trial.on september,the trial court entered a judgment dissolving the marriage.on september,the trial court issued a further judgment on reserved issues judgment,setting child support at a month and spousal support at a month.toshio was also ordered to maintain a policy of health insurance on and pay of her unreimbursed medical expenses or,alternatively,to pay all of medical expenses.the judgment recited that,pursuant to the trial court prior temporary order,toshio owed a total of in arrearages on child support,spousal support,and medical insurance and related expenses.
as of,sabine had not received any payments from toshio.she asked the cssd to pursue the matter but was told that the department could not do anything because toshio lived in japan.toshio did not make any payments for the next several years.
in,sabine attempted to get paid by hiring a collection agency in japan.in may,toshio offered sabine approximately and sent her a proposed settlement agreement written in japanese agreement.was years old at the time.according to a translation filed by sabine,the agreement stated 
recognition of claim liability 
in order to resolve all existing legal matters between sabine and toshio,toshio recognizes liability to pay to sabine a settlement sum of yen million,whereas sabine agrees to hereafter abandon all and every legal claim against toshio.
method of payment 
toshio disburses the settlement sum of yen million within one month after signing the settlement agreement to a bank account designated by sabine.the bank account will be designated by sabine at the end of this settlement agreement.
child support for 
in respect to monies needed to support,sabine and toshio agree that according to the terms of this settlement agreement,toshio incurs no liability and sabine makes no claims.
however,in view of the fact that is his own child,toshio affirms his intention to grant her financial assistance depending on her or sabine financial circumstances.
liquidation clause 
sabine and toshio agree that all judgments and orders of the superior court of los angeles are made null and void by the terms of the settlement agreement and that according to said agreement toshio incurs no liabilities and sabine makes no claims.
application and jurisdiction 
the settlement agreement between sabine and toshio is recognized as entirely in accordance with japanese law and that the tokyo district court has exclusive jurisdiction.
signature clause 
in order to certify the validity of the settlement agreement,the document will be drawn up in duplicate and signed or a seal affixed,but sabine will attach a certificate by the japanese embassy or consulate in the usa verifying her signature,whereas toshio will verify the settlement agreement with a certificate of seal registry.
when sabine received the settlement offer,she was desperate and under duress.two years earlier,had been abducted by a pedophile and was later rescued by the federal bureau of investigation.after the rescue,was detained at the sacramento child psychiatric ward and placed on a suicide watch.eventually,testified before a grand jury in sacramento.the pedophile was charged with several counts,most of them related to child pornography,and pleaded guilty.
had severe emotional and physical problems.she had seen several therapists and weighed about pounds.although the department of children and family services recommended that continue to receive therapy two or three times a week,sabine could not afford it.as sabine put it,we were out of money toshio had not paid me in years.i accepted the settlement offer on the sole basis and requirement that the funds would be in my hands within the period stipulated in the document.boldface omitted.
sabine signed the agreement and had it notarized.on may,she gave the executed agreement to an intermediary at the collection agency,together with written information describing how to wire the money to her from suruga bank in japan.toshio contends he did not receive the wire instructions instead,the intermediary insisted that the money be given directly to him in accordance with a note signed by sabine.toshio refused that demand because the agreement required that the funds be wired to sabine,and he did not trust the intermediary.
as the end of the period approached,sabine spoke by telephone with toshio attorney in japan,takahiro yuyama,and asked when the money would arrive.yuyama said he was having problems.in particular,toshio relatives were funding the settlement,and they were balking because the release did not include a claim against toshio by sabine mother.sabine replied that she could not and would not agree to a release on her mother behalf and that the settlement was now null and void.for his part,yuyama disputes the substance of this conversation.
sabine did not receive any money from toshio during the period.it would take another year and a half before she would receive any money from him.
in june,sabine retained an attorney in japan,mikiko otani,to pursue the recovery of arrearages.on september,otani met with yuyama in family court in japan.according to otani,yuyama said the parties had attempted to settle the matter in may,but the agreement was canceled,or floated away,and had been forfeited.yuyama handed otani a new settlement agreement,proposing that toshio pay to million yen in exchange for a release of all claims by sabine and her mother.otani contacted sabine that day,and sabine immediately rejected the offer.otani relayed that response to yuyama while they were still at the courthouse.yuyama denies making these statements but admits drafting the revised settlement agreement.he states that the terms of the new proposal came from sabine collection agency.
otani claims that,on october,yuyama contacted her,saying toshio wanted to send sabine million yen about in an uncharacterized payment and to pay yen a month in child support.otani said she would talk to sabine but expressed concern that sabine receipt of the money might be considered an acceptance of the agreement.yuyama replied that sabine should view the money as a deposit and that its acceptance would not be to sabine disadvantage.again,yuyama denies making these statements.
arrangements were made to wire the money to sabine attorneys in california.on december,yuyama told otani that toshio intended to write settlement money on the wire transfer form.otani said sabine was accepting the funds on the condition that the purpose would be unspecified.by facsimile to yuyama of the same date,otani confirmed their conversation,stating that sabine receipt of the money would not constitute,or be evidence of,a settlement of the judgment.three days later,otani sent yuyama a certified letter to the same effect.
from december until june,toshio wired a month in child support to the same bank account.
meanwhile,sabine was able to enlist the assistance of the cssd in attempting to collect arrearages,apparently because toshio,although living in japan,was working for a subsidiary of a california company.the cssd determined that toshio arrearages,plus interest,as of september consisted of in child support,in spousal support,and medical expenses of,for a total of.sabine asserts that the cssd calculations contained some errors medical expenses were actually and the child and spousal support numbers were each too low.using sabine figures,toshio owed approximately in arrearages.
on september,sabine renewed the judgment.a notice to toshio stated,this renewal extends the period of enforceability of the judgment until years from the date of the application for renewal was filed.see,subd.b,former,subds.a,b all section references are to the family code unless otherwise indicated.
on october,the cssd filed a motion in the trial court,requesting the court to decide whether the parties had settled the arrearages matter in may and,if not,to determine the amount of arrearages.see et local child support agency shall enforce support obligations.the motion was addressed to the parties and requested that they submit evidence to the court on those issues.
in support of her position,sabine filed a declaration of her own,one by otani,and exhibits.for his part,toshio filed his own declaration,two by yuyama,and exhibits.toshio and yuyama stated that the settlement money was not wired to sabine within days of the agreement because she did not provide the requisite wire instructions until december,at which time the funds were promptly sent to her attorneys.yuyama denied making any statements to sabine or otani in which he questioned the validity of the agreement or referred to problems in getting the money.toshio and yuyama asserted they had consistently maintained that the agreement was valid and enforceable.
in her memorandum of points and authorities,sabine argued that the agreement was not enforceable,primarily because she did not receive the funds within days,and a waiver of arrearages is void as against public policy.in his papers,toshio contended that the parties had entered into a valid,enforceable agreement he owed nothing for the period preceding the filing of the cssd motion and,thereafter,he was responsible only for child support in accordance with the agreement.
at the hearing on the motion,the trial court stated on the record that the agreement was too vague,ambiguous,and unclear to constitute a release of arrearages.in a subsequent written order,dated april,the court recited that t here was no enforceable settlement agreement concerning arrears under the judgment and t he cssd shall perform an audit,and calculate arrears owed by toshio to sabine under the judgment from september,to the present.there was no statement of decision.none was requested.toshio appeals from the order.
discussion 
as a preliminary matter,the agreement seems to require that its validity and effect be determined under japanese law.the parties have cited only california authority.we therefore apply state law.see nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,fn,d.
for purposes of our analysis,we first determine whether the parties could lawfully forgive payments that accrued before the agreement was executed in may.we then address whether,after its execution,the agreement effectively modified or terminated future support and medical expense payments.we answer both questions in the negative.
release of arrearages 
when sabine signed the agreement in may,the arrearages,not including interest,totaled about in arrearages as set forth in the judgment,in child and spousal support incurred after the judgment,and for medical expenses as calculated by sabine.toshio offered in exchange for,among other things,a release as to the remaining amount owed.toshio contends that the parties could lawfully contract to forgive the past due payments.but the law is to the contrary.
because the pertinent evidence on this issue is not in dispute,we review the trial court order de novo.see asp properties group,fard,th,d fittante palm springs motors,th,d.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons for its ruling as we only review the ruling and not its rationale.rinehart boys girls club of chula vista th,d.
as applicable here,section,subdivision c section c,states a support order may not be modified or terminated as to an amount that accrued before the date of the filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or terminate.this statute applies whether or not the support order is based upon an agreement between the parties,subd.e.accrued means past due.see taylor superior court d.
section c former subdivision b became effective in.see stats,ch.it replaced civil code section,subdivisions a and b,enacted in.see stats,ch,cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
as originally enacted,civil code section provided a all orders for child support,even when there has been an agreement between the parties on the subject of child support,may be modified or revoked at any time at the discretion of the court,except as to any amount that may have accrued prior to the date of filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or revoke.b the provisions of any agreement or order for the support of either party shall be subject to subsequent modification or revocation by court order except as to any amount that may have accrued prior to the date of filing of the notice of motion or order to show cause to modify or revoke stats,ch,italics added.although this language differs somewhat from that of section c,no substantive change was intended.see cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.at.
several courts of appeal have held that section c precludes a trial court from modifying or forgiving accrued support.see county of santa clara wilson th,d retroactive modification of accrued child support arrearages is statutorily barred in re marriage of cordero th,fn,d trial courts lack authority to waive or forgive interest on past due child and spousal support for same reason courts can not retroactively modify or terminate arrearages themselves in re marriage of perez th,d trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in reducing child support arrearages from to.one court of appeal has concluded that,just as a trial court can not modify or forgive arrearages,the parties can not waive arrearages by agreement or other conduct.see in re marriage of hamer th,d.
as our supreme court made clear long before any state statute addressed the subject a decree for alimony may be modified as to installments to become due in the future.as to accrued installments it is final.citations.
a subsequent order which relieves the husband from paying accrued alimony,and discharges said alimony by offsetting it against an indebtedness of the wife to the husband existing at the time of entry of the divorce decree is a modification as to past due installments,as is an order requiring the wife to accept in full settlement of accrued alimony less than the full amount due.
to hold that alimony decrees may be modified retroactively in the manner contended for herein would be contrary to the rule of finality as to past due installments keck keck cal,italics added.
more recently,another court has explained t he current state of the law is that a judgment for child or spousal support,once entered,is per se enforceable until paid in full,and is not retroactively modifiable either as to accrued arrearages or any interest due thereon.in re marriage of hamer,supra,th at,d.and according to a leading treatise the trial court,in its discretion,may craft a schedule or plan for payment of support arrearages,but it has no discretion to waive or forgive any part of a support arrearages debt.suppor
