in consolidated appeals nos.and in this ongoing child custody proceeding,michael newdow father,in propria persona appeals from trial court orders requiring him to pay a portion of the attorney fees of the child mother,sandra banning mother,pursuant to family code section father contends section a part of the uniform parentage act is unconstitutional on its face and as applied.we shall conclude the statute is constitutional on its face,and father has waived his as applied challenge by failing to present a factual analysis supported by citation to the record.
father also seeks review of other orders,but they are nonappealable interim orders.
pursuant to an order to show cause issued by this court,directing father to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed against him for filing in this court a confidential child custody evaluation report,we shall deny mother request for sanctions which is unsupported in this appeal by any citation to legal authority 
factual and procedural background 
in,mother and father,who never married,had a baby girl.mother and father had no formal custody arrangement,and mother was the primary caregiver.
in,mother and father ended their relationship,and mother initiated custody proceedings.the trial court ordered joint legal custody,with mother having sole physical custody.
in april,father moved to modify the parenting plan,arguing he is entitled to a joint physical custody arrangement.that matter is still pending in the trial court.
during the course of these proceedings,the trial court has made various orders for father to pay a portion of mother attorney fees.
on april,father filed a notice of appeal case no.from trial court orders dated february and march.the record on appeal contains only minute orders for those dates.the february,minute order bore illegible handwritten notes.father indicates the order of february,directed the transmission to mother attorney of of a advance he previously deposited pursuant to a july,court order which is not the subject of this appeal 
the march,minute order stated the court ordered father to pay in attorney fees to mother.
on october,father filed a second notice of appeal case no.purporting to appeal from orders entered by the trial court on four dates in,august,september,and september.the minute orders from those dates bore some illegible handwritten notations.it appears father is challenging orders requiring him to pay mother attorney fees,as follows an august,order in the amount of and a september,order in the amount of.however,the september,minute order called for preparation of a formal order,which apparently was not done.consequently,there is no appealable order for september,as we conclude post.
father is also challenging the trial court determination that father must remove the child as an unnamed plaintiff in a federal lawsuit filed by plaintiff to challenge the pledge of allegiance as violative of the establishment clause.we shall explain father fails to show an appealable order.other orders challenged by father are also nonappealable interim orders.
we consolidated the two appeals,nos.and.
discussion 
attorney feesa.standard of review and appealability 
the orders directing father to pay mother attorney fees are appealable orders.in re marriage of weiss th,d.
father presents questions of law,which are subject to de novo review.trinkle california state lottery th,d.
father appeals of the attorney fees orders are not barred 
we first argument that father is barred from challenging the constitutionality of the attorney fee awards by his failure to appeal from three prior awards of attorney fees in this case entered on or before july,in amounts of,and,which are now final.mother argument is not well taken.
she cites case law for the proposition that final orders are conclusive and bar further litigation of all factual or legal issues that were litigated or might have been litigated,including constitutionality of statutes giving the court jurisdiction to award attorney fees.chicot.drainage dist.baxter state bank.chicot rescue army municipal court cal d,rescue army in re marriage of mason th,d mason peery superior court d.peery bank of america department of mental hygiene d.bank of america.
the principle described by mother barring claims that might have been litigated is res judicata,pursuant to which a former judgment operates as a bar against a second action upon the same cause.bank of america,supra,d.we do not have to decide whether any of the prior orders constitutes a judgment for purposes of res judicata because here there is no same cause.father is not attempting to relitigate prior fee awards that have become final.rather,father is challenging new fee awards.each award of attorney fees is separate.
mother fails to discuss any of the cases she cites.none assists her case.the cited cases are distinguishable,they involved attempts to reopen matters already decided and final,whereas here father is challenging new orders awarding new amounts of attorney fees.thus,chicot,supra,held that bondholders who,as parties in a bankruptcy proceeding for readjustment of a drainage district debts,had full opportunity to object to the constitutionality of the statute providing for such readjustments,were bound by the decree in that proceeding and could not afterwards seek to recover on their bonds upon the ground that the decree was rendered void by a subsequent court order in a subsequent case declaring the statute unconstitutional.
rescue army,supra,cal d,allowed a party to pursue a writ of prohibition to try to restrain a third trial for violation of an ordinance regulating solicitation of charitable contributions though the supreme court ultimately concluded the ordinance was constitutional.
mason,supra,th,d,held the trial court denial of a husband motion to set aside a stipulated judgment dividing community property was res judicata and barred a subsequent order to show cause by the husband seeking to invoke the trial court continuing jurisdiction over omitted community assets.id.at,d.res judicata barred the husband from resurrecting a fraud claim based on a new theory that business goodwill was an omitted asset.he could not withhold issues and litigate them in consecutive actions.ibid.
peery,supra,d,denied a husband petition for a peremptory writ of mandate to compel a trial court to relinquish jurisdiction and enforce a louisiana custody decree that conflicted with an earlier california custody decree.there were no circumstances which would permit the husband to attack the california judgment collaterally on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction,so as to render the louisiana decree res judicata.
bank of america,supra,d,held a decree of final distribution approving an executor settlement of an estate with the department of mental hygiene was res judicata in a later action by the executor to recover the money,where,though the statute was held unconstitutional in an unrelated case shortly before this decree was entered,no appeal was taken.
mother fails to show how any of these cases apply here to bar father from challenging the new awards of attorney fees.
section is constitutional 
father contends section is unconstitutional on its face because it forces him to pay his adversary attorney fees irrespective of the merits of his case and even if he prevails,solely because he has more money than mother.
we shall conclude section is constitutional because,even if it implicates fundamental rights,it serves a compelling state interest of promoting the best interests of the child.
we shall also reject father contention that the statute was unconstitutionally applied in this case.
facial challenge 
in considering a facial constitutional challenge to a statute,we uphold the statute unless its unconstitutionality plainly and unmistakably appears all presumptions favor its validity.city of los angeles superior court cal th,d,pryor municipal court cal d.
it has been said that a facial challenge can succeed only if the statute inevitably poses a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.people gallegos th,d.however,in american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d,which held invalid a statute requiring a pregnant minor to secure parental consent or judicial authorization for an abortion,the california supreme court said 
a statute that imposes substantial burdens on fundamental privacy rights with regard to a large class of persons may not be sustained against a facial constitutional attack simply because there may be a small subclass of persons covered by the statute as to whom a similar but much more narrowly drawn statute constitutionally could be applied.thus a facial challenge to a statutory provision that broadly impinges upon fundamental constitutional rights may not be defeated simply by showing that there may be some circumstances in which the statute constitutionally could be applied,when there is nothing in the language or legislative history of the provision that would afford a reasonable basis for severing the asserted constitutionally permissible applications of the statute from the provision unconstitutional applications.american academy of pediatrics lungren,supra,cal th,d.
we shall conclude that,even under the standard announced in american academy of pediatrics lungren,supra,cal th,d,section is constitutional on its face.
here,section is part of the uniform parentage act et,and its application is limited to cases involving matters of parenting and child custody.the statute does not apply to marital dissolution or any other matter unrelated to children.section requires the trial court to determine what amount of fees is reasonable,see fn,ante and section requires the court to determine that the party being ordered to pay has or is reasonably likely to have the ability to pay.
by fathering a child,father has assumed responsibilities for that child even where those responsibilities may conflict with father own needs or desires.american academy of pediatrics lungren,supra,cal th,d,parents during a child minority have the legal right and obligation to act on behalf of their child to protect their child rights and interests ibid.child fundamental interests may diverge from parent interests.
the principle of the best interests of the child is the sine qua non of the family law process governing custody disputes.although a parent interest in the care,custody and companionship of a child is a liberty interest that may not be interfered with in the absence of a compelling state interest,the welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right,but a duty,to protect.citations.in re marilyn cal th,d,rejecting mother contention that due process was violated to the extent that dependency statutes restricted juvenile court dispositional options in dependency proceeding.it is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a state interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological of a minor is compelling.new york ferber,d.
the importance of the policy protecting the children welfare was expressed in a different context in in re marriage of joseph d,which held that,in child custody proceedings,the father could not enforce against the mother a provision of a marital settlement agreement waiving any right to attorney fees.p arties to a divorce can not abridge the court ability to act on behalf of the children,either by direct attempts to terminate the court power,or by attempts to deny attorney fees where needed to institute or defend against actions for modification of child custody or support orders.in re marriage of coleman d.if the wife is unable to afford counsel fees,it is also consistent with the interest of the children that she be awarded counsel fees in order to represent the children interests in re marriage of ayo d.rights of contracting parties must yield to the welfare of the children.id.at.the parties could by contract waive attorney fees in disputes unrelated to the children welfare,spousal support,but could not do so in matters affecting the children welfare.ibid.
father asserts section violates the following constitutional rights the right of parenthood freedom of association freedom of speech the right to petition government for redress of grievances the rights against,cruel and unusual punishment,and excessive fines and the right to be protected against unconstitutional takings.
even assuming these matters have been preserved for appeal a point disputed by mother,some of the asserted rights are not shown to have any bearing on the question of the constitutionality of section.thus,father argument about the right of association relates to the nonappealable interim custody orders.orders to pay an opposing party attorney fees do not constitute interference with free speech or compelled subsidization of an opponent speech.board of regents southworth,d,government may compel payment of money through taxes and other forms of compulsion and use the funds to pursue programs that are contrary to the beliefs of the payors without violating first amendment held public university could charge students mandatory fee to fund extracurricular student speech where there was viewpoint neutrality in allocation of funding to student groups miller california com.on status of women d.rejected taxpayer challenge to activities of commission on the status of women because first amendment was not infringed by government use of citizen taxes to propagate messages that the citizen considered odious.the cases cited by father are distinguishable,because they involved compelled assessments,the only purpose of which was to support the offensive speech.united states united foods,d compelling mushroom producers to subsidize a mushroom advertising program with which they disagreed violated first amendment pacific gas california,d california could not compel pg e to mail customers,in pg e envelopes,messages from a public interest group that opposed pg e practices.here,the purpose of the fee award is to ensure that a child best interests are represented.we reject father argument that rights afforded in criminal proceedings the rights against,excess fines,and cruel and unusual punishment should apply here because removing a child from a parent is a penalty greater than a criminal penalty.moreover,this contention relates to the interim custody order,which,as we shall explain,is nonappealable,and not to the attorney fees awards that are the subject of this appeal.
despite the overreaching of father position,we shall assume for purposes of this appeal that section imposes significant encroachment upon fundamental constitutional rights.father acknowledges such infringement may be permissible if the law is narrowly tailored and justified by a compelling state interest.bates little rock,d.we shall conclude section is justified by the compelling state interest in promoting the best interests of children involved in custody proceedings thus,our system of justice depends on the presentation of evidence by opposing sides,recognizing that,most often,one side will not have exclusive possession of the truth.the requirement that father pay attorney fees,even where he prevails on a legal issue,is necessary to insure that the welfare of the child he fathered is protected by a presentation of all evidence bearing on the various issues that arise in a custody dispute.the employment of an attorney is essential to allow laypersons,like mother,to present evidence bearing on the best interests of the child.this is a compelling state interest.
as indicated,section says the trial court may order reasonable attorney fees to be paid by the parties in proportions determined by the court.
father claims the statute violates the due process guarantee of the fourteenth amendment,which requires a state to treat individuals with fundamental fairness when its actions infringe on their protected liberty or property interests.father also claims section violates equal protection.father attempts to bolster his claims of unconstitutionality by ignoring the fact that there are constraints on the trial court in awarding attorney fees.thus,he argues mother attorney can run up her charges in revenge,and due process is violated because section gives the trial court unbridled discretion.
however,as indicated,section requires the trial court to determine what amount of fees is reasonable.this would exclude attorney fees incurred for the purpose of revenge.additionally,section provides if a court orders a party to pay attorney fees or costs under this code,the court shall first determine that the party has or is reasonably likely to have the ability to pay.in his reply brief,father argues the reasonable standard is too vague to defeat his argument about unbridled discretion.yet father opening brief,under the heading unbridled discretion,did not even acknowledge the statute imposed a standard of reasonableness.we may disregard arguments made for the first time in a reply brief.garcia mccutchen cal th,fn,d,neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.moreover,we consider a reasonableness standard sufficiently specific to meet constitutional requirements.
father claims section violates the public policy against protracted litigation by giving financial incentive to prolong litigation.we disagree.fees incurred simply to prolong litigation would not be reasonable and would be excluded by section.additionally,section allows the court to impose an order to pay attorney fees as a sanction on a party who engages in conduct to prolong litigation.
cases cited by father involved contexts other than child custody thus,they are distinguishable and not controlling.father quotes a dissenting hence not authoritative opinion from troxel granville at page,d dis.opn.of scalia,d,which said,if a single parent who is struggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from a third party,the attorney fees alone might destroy her hopes and plans for the child future.our system must confront more often the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that constitutional protection may be required.father case is not assisted by this citation to a dissenting opinion in a case that held application of a child visitation rights statute to allow visitation rights to parental grandparents violated the mother due process right to bring up her children.
father says the united states supreme court has already spoken on this issue by explicitly stating the wealth of litigants is an impermissible factor to use in awarding attorney fees.he cites gulf,ellis at page,which held invalid on equal protection grounds a statute imposing attorney fees not to exceed upon railway corporations,but not any other corporations or individuals,for failing to pay certain claims within a certain time after presentation.on the page cited by father,the gulf court said classifications can not be made arbitrarily t he state may not say that all white men shall be subjected to the payment of the attorney fees of parties successfully suing them,and all black men not.it may not say that all men beyond a certain age shall be alone thus subjected,or all men possessed of a certain wealth.these are distinctions which do not furnish any proper basis for the attempted classification.that must always rest upon some difference which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect to which the classification is proposed,and can never be made arbitrarily and without any such basis.id.at.
in the case before us,there is a reasonable and just indeed,compelling reason to impose attorney fees on the wealthier ensure that both sides of the custody dispute are represented and are able to present evidence bearing on the best interests of the proceedings where a court is determining who gets custody of a child.
other cases cited by father are similarly distinguishable because they did not involve payment of attorney fees to ensure that opposing viewpoints are presented to the family court in making determinations implicating the best interests of a child in custody proceedings.
the state may legitimately impose a requirement that one parent pay the attorney fees of the other parent in order to assure that the best interests of the child are vindicated in the legal proceedings.in re marilyn,supra,cal th,d,welfare of child is a compelling state interest.
we recognize father in the case before us thinks he represents the child best interests and mother position does not.however,reasonable minds could differ on that point.the statute in this case,section,requiring father to pay fees even though he prevails,is the best way of making sure that opposing points of view may be heard,so that the best interests of the child are vindicated,regardless of which parent wins or loses.
in his reply brief,father develops an argument that the best interests of the child can not overcome a due process challenge to section,because the best interests of the child standard is itself unconstitutionally vague.we decline to consider this argument,which was not presented in father opening brief under the headings devoted to challenging section.garcia mccutchen,supra,cal th,fn,d,neighbours buzz oates enterprises,supra,d,fn.
father argues that,even if there is a compelling state interest supporting section,the law is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest.however,in this portion of his argument,father misdefines the compelling state interest as merely level ing the playing field between him and mother.he says there is no compelling interest in providing mother with attorney fees to fund her exercise of her personal liberties.he cites lassiter department of social services,d,which held refusal to appoint counsel for a mother in a proceeding to terminate parental rights did not violate due process.however,in that case the discussion focused on the mother interests,not the child interests,since the child was provided with an attorney to act as guardian ad litem.id.at.here,the compelling interest is not the mother personal liberties,but the child best interests,and the burden of paying attorney fees is being placed not on the taxpayers but on a parent,who assumed responsibility for the child by becoming a parent.
father contends the best interests of the child is a pretense,because the money is going to an attorney who represents mother,not the child.however,the statutory scheme,by allowing the trial court the discretion whether to order fees and by allowing only reasonable attorney fees,allows a parent to argue,and the trial court to find,that fees should not be awarded in a particular case if the attorney services were not for the benefit of the child.in re marriage of behrens d.court may refuse to award fees for services that have no apparent effect other than to prolong litigation.that father can not recover fees for representing himself does not render a fee award in favor of mother unconstitutional.thus,father argument does not support his facial challenge to section,and as we discuss post,he has not adequately presented an as applied challenge.
father argues the law is not narrowly tailored because it allowed mother to spend times more on attorneys than father.however,we need not consider this argument,because father cites no evidence in the record on these matters.he merely cites his own argument to the trial court,not any evidence supporting his argument 
father argues there are less burdensome ways of satisfying the state compelling interest in children welfare,such as paying for mother attorney with general tax funds,encouraging more pro bono work,giving tax credits,and funding family law legal clinics.none of these suggestions renders the statute unconstitutional.the state may properly require the parent of a child to bear attorney fees caused by a custody dispute between father and mother.
father claims a statute similar to section was invalidated in california teachers association state of california cal th,d,cta.we disagree.the statute at issue there was education code section,which required teachers to pay to the state the costs of an administrative law judge if a teacher exercised his or her constitutional right to a hearing regarding a suspension or dismissal from employment.the supreme court has subsequently said cta did not render unconstitutional statutes requiring litigants to pay attorney fees but was limited to its unique context of a virtually unprecedented statute requiring an employee who loses a
