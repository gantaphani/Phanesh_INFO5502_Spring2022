pursuant to family code section plaintiffs sterling fenn and jan fenn grandparents petitioned for a court order allowing them visitation with their grandchildren,andrew and benjamin,following the death of their daughter,kathryn sherriff.all further section references are to the family code unless otherwise noted.the children father,defendant robert sherriff father,opposed the petition and moved for summary judgment on the ground he and his new wife,who had adopted the children,both objected to visitation.among other things,father argued section is unconstitutional as applied if it is construed to provide grandparent visitation over the objection of both parents.the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground grandparents had failed to allege father was an unfit parent and,in any event,had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to father fitness as a parent.
we conclude section is constitutional even though it may allow for grandparent visitation over the objection of two fit parents.although the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the care,custody,and control of their children requires the court to give the decisions of fit parents special weight,it does not necessarily preclude a court from ordering visitation over the parents objection.
we further conclude summary judgment was improper in this case because father motion was based solely on the asserted facts that he and his wife were fit parents who objected to visitation.those facts were not legally sufficient to carry father initial burden of showing that grandparents petition for visitation had no merit.because father did not meet his initial burden of showing grandparents petition had no merit,the burden never shifted to grandparents to show a triable issue of fact.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
andrew and benjamin sherriff are the natural children of robert and kathryn sherriff.the fenns are the children maternal grandparents.
kathryn sherriff died in august while she and father were in the process of getting divorced.two months later,grandparents filed a petition for visitation under section,alleging father was denying them visitation with the children.the parties agreed to undergo psychological evaluations and to allow grandparents supervised visitation with the children during the evaluation period.
in august,after the case was transferred from shasta county to yolo county,father filed his response to the petition,alleging he had allowed grandparents to visit with the children at his discretion,in accordance with the recommendation of the children counselors.he also alleged section was unconstitutional and that grandparents were unfit to have visitation with the children.
in september,father remarried.in november,grandparents caused an order to show cause to issue,seeking increased,unsupervised visitation with the children.father opposed any additional visitation.the matter was set for trial in april.meanwhile,in december,father new wife adopted the children.
in february,father moved for summary judgment on the ground he and his wife,who were both fit parents,opposed visitation.father argued section,which was enacted after section,takes precedence over section,and section does not allow visitation over the objection of both parents.he also argued section was unconstitutional as applied if interpreted to allow grandparent visitation after an adoption.finally,he argued that for a grandparent visitation petition to succeed over the objections of both parents,both parents would have to be unfit,and he and his wife were both fit parents.
in opposition,grandparents argued section did not supercede section,section is constitutional,and there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding father fitness as a parent.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of father because grandparents had failed to allege in their petition that father was an unfit parent and because,even if unfitness had been alleged,grandparents had failed to raise a triable issue that father was unfit.

grandparent visitation after a stepparent adoption 
father sought summary judgment on the ground that he and his wife,who has adopted the children as her own,are both fit parents who oppose visitation between the children and grandparents.father contends the courts have no power to award grandparent visitation over the objection of both parents living together in a family unit.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
statutory analysis of section and section 
sections,and are the three statutes in the family code that specifically provide for grandparent visitation,each addressing different situations.section allows grandparents and certain other relatives to seek visitation with their grandchildren when one of the children parents is deceased.section allows grandparents to seek visitation with their grandchildren in a pending dissolution proceeding or other family law proceeding in which custody of the children is already at issue.section allows grandparents to seek visitation with their grandchildren in other circumstances.
here,grandparents sought visitation under section,which on its face allows the court to order grandparent visitation when one of the parents is deceased upon a finding that the visitation would be in the best interest of the minor child,subd.a.subdivision c of the statute specifically addresses what happens when an adoption occurs following the parent death this section does not apply if the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent of the child.any visitation rights granted pursuant to this section before the adoption of the child automatically terminate if the child is adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent of the child.thus,under the plain language of section,a stepparent adoption like the one that occurred in this case has no effect on the grandparents right to seek visitation with their grandchildren under that statute.
father contends,however,that section must be read together and harmonized with section,which compels a different conclusion.under section,while the natural or adoptive parents are married,a grandparent can seek visitation only if t he parents are currently living separately and apart on a permanent or indefinite basis o ne of the parents has been absent for more than one month without the other spouse knowing the whereabouts of the absent spouse o ne of the parents joins in the petition with the grandparents or t he child is not residing with either parent,subd.b.in addition,a t any time that a change of circumstances occurs such that none of these circumstances exist,the parent or parents may move the court to terminate grandparental visitation and the court shall grant the termination.ibid.in lopez martinez th,d,the court held a stepparent adoption constitutes a change of circumstances requiring the termination of visitation under section,at,d.
according to father,section b preempted the field of grandparent visitation when both parents are married and therefore the limitations set forth in section apply even when the grandparents seek visitation under section following their child death.we disagree.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.citation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision citation.citation.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute citation.citation.we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.people murphy cal th,d.
as we have already noted,by its terms section excepts from its application any case in which the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent of the child,subd.c,italics added.the plain import of this language is that a court may order grandparent visitation under section following the death of a parent even when a stepparent adoption has occurred 
section addresses an entirely different situation than section and contains its own exceptions.under section,the court may order grandparent visitation when both parents are living unlike section,and when no custody proceeding is pending unlike section under section,however,if the natural or adoptive parents are married,visitation can be ordered only in limited circumstances.stated succinctly,if the natural or adoptive parents are married and living together with the child,and neither parent joins in the petition with the grandparents,a petition for visitation may not be filed,subd.b.
there is nothing in section to suggest the legislature intended the limitations set forth in subdivision b of that statute to apply to petitions for visitation under section.on the contrary,by the plain terms of section,the limitations described in subdivision b of the statute apply only to a petition for visitation under this section,subd.b,italics added.
the legislative history of section confirms that its enactment was not intended to affect or limit the right to seek visitation conferred by section.at the time section was proposed,the legislature recognized the existence of section and understood that a petition for visitation under that statute could be filed even when there had been a stepparent adoption.an early analysis of the bill proposing section enactment specifically noted that under existing law,if the grandparents adult child dies and leaves a minor child,the grandparents can request that they be allowed to visit with the child.this section is not applicable if the unmarried minor is adopted by strangers.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,italics added.the express purpose of the proposed section was to expand the situations in which grandparents may come into court to seek a visitation order with their grandchildren.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,italics added.the bill analysis commented that the proposed section would authorize grandparents to petition the court for visitation rights in any situation,thereby creating a right to an independent action however,that right was to be limited in that a petition may not be filed while the parents are married,unless one or more of the circumstances ultimately included in subdivision b of section existed.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,italics added.
it appears from both the language of section and its legislative history that the legislature did not intend the limitations set forth in section to apply when the grandparents seek visitation under section.it follows,therefore,that father statutory argument is only partly correct courts have no power to award grandparent visitation over the objection of both parents living together in a family unit under section.the legislature imposed no such limitation on a petition for visitation under section,when one of the natural parents is deceased.
father reliance on the decision in lopez martinez,supra,to support his argument that the limitations in subdivision b of section apply to a petition for grandparent visitation under section is misplaced.lopez involved a petition for grandparent visitation under section,and at no point in the opinion did the appellate court discuss or even mention the application of section.an opinion is not authority for a proposition not considered.city and county of san francisco sainez th,d.thus,lopez provides no support for father position.
constitutional analysis 
father contends that if section is applied to allow grandparent visitation over his and his wife objections,the statute infringes upon their constitutional right to raise and nurture their children without undue interference by the state.on the record now before us,we disagree.
federal due process 
under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,parents have a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.troxel granville,d plur.opn.of,conc.opn.of souter,troxel.in troxel,which,like the present matter,was a grandparent visitation case,the united states supreme court held that a washington statute authorizing visitation by a nonparent with a child was unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of that case.kyle donald th,d.according to the troxel plurality,that conclusion was compelled by the combination of several factors namely the absence of any allegation or finding by the court that the parent was unfit the absence of any allegation that the parent had sought to cut off visitation entirely and the slender findings on which the washington trial court rested its award of visitation rights to the grandparents.troxel,supra,at,plur.opn.of,as the plurality explained t he superior court made only two formal findings in support of its visitation order.first,the grandparents are part of a large,central,loving family,all located in this area,and the grandparents can provide opportunities for the children in the areas of cousins and music.citation.second,t he children would be benefitted from spending quality time with the grandparents,provided that that time is balanced with time with the childrens sic nuclear family.citation.these slender findings,in combination with the court announced presumption in favor of grandparent visitation and its failure to accord significant weight to the mother already having offered meaningful visitation to the grandparents,show that this case involves nothing more than a simple disagreement between the washington superior court and the mother concerning her children best interests as we have explained,the due process clause does not permit a state to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make child rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a better decision could be made.id.at.
following troxel,at least four california appellate opinions have found section unconstitutional as applied to the specific facts before the courts in those cases.zasueta zasueta th,d herbst swan th,d punsly ho th,d kyle donald,supra,th at,d.for example,in kyle this court reversed a grandparent visitation order under section where the trial court did not make any finding that the father was an unfit parent the father agreed that visitation was appropriate,agreed that the child needed a relationship with the grandparents,and agreed to allow visitation with them and the father simply wanted the child to have a more flexible and spontaneous relationship with her maternal grandparents,such as she had with her paternal grandparents.kyle donald,supra,th at,d.the court concluded in light of the fact the father was a fit parent who had not sought to cut off grandparent visitation completely,and in light of the absence of substantial evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a fit parent parenting decisions,the application of section to establish a schedule of visitation over the father objection unduly infringed upon his fundamental parenting right to make decisions about the care,custody,and control of his daughter.id.at,d.
we turn now to the application of troxel and its progeny to the facts of the present case.here,father sought summary judgment on grandparents petition for grandparent visitation based on a very narrow set of facts he claimed were undisputed.in essence,father asserted in his separate statement of undisputed facts that he was entitled to summary judgment because he and his wife are married his wife has adopted the children both he and his wife oppose visitation with plaintiffs and he and his wife are fit parents.
for father to prevail on his argument that he was entitled to summary judgment because section is unconstitutional as applied,we must be able to conclude that any grandparent visitation ordered by the court under the facts father presented in support of his motion would be unconstitutional.that leads us to frame the following dispositive question does the fundamental due process right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children preclude the state from ever ordering grandparent visitation over the objection of two fit parents based on troxel,we conclude the answer is no.
in troxel,the plurality opinion of justice explained that a parent fitness does not insulate the parent decisions concerning his or her children from state intervention.the fitness or unfitness of a parent is important because there is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.troxel,supra,at,italics added.s o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children,is fit there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent children.id.at,italics added.i f a fit parent decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review,the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent own determination.id.at.
giving the parent determination special weight is different than insulating the parent determination from any court intervention whatsoever.troxel does not support defendant suggestion that a fit parent decisions are immune from judicial review.nor can we discern any basis in the law for reaching a different conclusion when there are two parents rather than one.the decision of father and his wife about whether and under what conditions grandparents should have visitation with their grandchildren is entitled to special weight under both are fit no more 
although father has not specifically requested that we consider any evidence beyond that cited in his separate statement of undisputed facts,we recognize there was undisputed evidence submitted in connection with the summary judgment motion showing that father and his wife had been allowing the grandparents some visitation with the children father asserted in his declaration in support of the motion that he and his wife had provided reasonable visitation with the children to grandparents in accordance with the recommendations of ray carlson,gail winslow,and richard powell.in their declarations in opposition to the motion,grandparents acknowledged they had been allowed to visit the children but complained their visits had been restricted to a maximum of one hour visitations which have averaged once every months.grandparents also complained because father,among other things,required the visits to be supervised by a person selected by him demanded they pay various sums connected with the supervised visits amounting to approximately per minute for a one hour visit prohibited them from giving to the children any gifts during the visits and from taking photographs or videotapes of them with the children and instructed them not to talk to the children about their mother.
the existence of the foregoing the fact that the united states supreme court decision in troxel rested at least in part on the fact that the parent opposing the visitation petition in that case had not cut off visitation the question of whether we should look beyond the separate statement of facts filed by father in determining whether summary judgment was proper in this case on federal constitutional grounds.for the reasons that follow,we decline to do so.
there is much authority for the proposition that all facts on which a moving party relies in seeking summary judgment must be included in the mandatory separate statement of undisputed facts filed in support of the motion.the summary judgment statute itself provides that t he supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are undisputed the failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denial of the motion.code civ,subd.b,italics added.as for case law,this court has explained that w hen a party applies for summary judgment,it must present a statement of undisputed facts specifying each fact necessary for the relief it seeks.city of south pasadena department of transportation th,d,italics added.to support this rule,we relied on an passage from united community church garcin d.as judge zebrowski explains,all material facts must be set forth in the separate statement.this is the golden rule of summary adjudication if it is not set forth in the separate statement,it does not exist.both the court and the opposing party are entitled to have all the facts upon which the moving party bases its motion plainly set forth in the separate statement.id.at,quoting zebrowski,the summary adjudication pyramid.as the court explained in united community church,the reason for this rule is a pragmatic one,with constitutional underpinnings separate statements are required not to satisfy a sadistic urge to torment lawyers,but rather to afford due process to opposing parties and to permit trial courts to expeditiously review complex motions for summary judgment to determine quickly and efficiently whether material facts are disputed.unity community church,supra,d at.
recently,division three of the court of appeal,fourth appellate district held that the golden rule from united community church can not be deemed an absolute prohibition against consideration of evidence not referenced in the separate statement.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank th,d.according to that court,the summary judgment statute demands a rule composed of a baser metal w e may not mechanically conclude,as the golden rule would have us do,that the trial court should never consider evidence not referenced in the separate statement.the statute is permissive,not mandatory whether to consider evidence not referenced in the moving party separate statement rests with the sound discretion of the trial court,and we review the decision to consider or not consider this evidence for an abuse of that discretion.id.at,d.
here,it appears from the record that in granting summary judgment to father the trial court neither exercised nor declined to exercise its discretion to consider evidence not referenced in father separate statement.this is so because the court found the evidence that father and his wife were fit parents,which was referenced in father separate statement,sufficient to require judgment in their favor.because the trial court was never called upon to look beyond father separate statement,we are not called upon to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in this regard.nevertheless,because an appellate court reviews a trial court decision on summary judgment de novo merrill navegar,cal th,d,and because we must affirm the judgment if it is supportable on another basis which establishes father must prevail as a matter of law lopez tulare joint union high school dist.th,d,we undoubtedly have the same discretion as the trial court to consider evidence not referenced in the moving party separate statement in determining whether summary judgment was proper.whether we should exercise that discretion,however,is another matter.
the court in san diego watercrafts,suggested factors that should be considered in deciding whether to look beyond the moving party statement of undisputed facts.where the facts before the court are relatively simple,the evidence that compels affirming the summary judgment was clearly called to the attention of court and counsel,and the moving party entitlement to judgment in its favor is obvious to the court and to the opposing party,it would be an abuse of discretion to reverse a summary judgment because of a mere procedural failure by the moving party in failing to include the dispositive fact in its separate statement.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank,supra,th at,d.of course,i n exercising its discretion whether or not to consider evidence undisclosed in the separate statement,the court should also consider due process implications noted in united community church.ibid.d ue process requires a party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail.ibid.
under the circumstances of this case,we conclude the relevant factors weigh in favor of declining to exercise our discretion to look beyond father separate statement of facts in determining whether summary judgment was proper.first and foremost,father did not ask the trial court to look beyond his separate statement,and he has not asked this court to do so.in fact,father expressly seeks to have the summary judgment affirmed regardless of whether he and his wife are allowing grandparents to visit with the children.
despite his assertion in his declaration that he and his wife were providing reasonable visitation to grandparents,father never attempted to rely on that fact to support his motion for summary judgment in the trial court.instead,father sought summary judgment based solely on the ground that he and his wife objected to visitation.father specifically invited the trial court to hold that allow ing grandparent visitation over the objections of both parents would be an unconstitutional application of section.
father takes the same position in this court.although the factual summary in father brief refers in passing to the fact that he and his wife had been providing some visitation to grandparents,nowhere in his brief does father request that we consider this voluntary allowance of visitation in determining whether to affirm the summary judgment in his favor.on the contrary,father specifically contends it is not necessary for a fit parent to provide any visitation to a grandparent in order to defeat a petition for grandparent visitation rights.italics added.further,in the conclusion to his brief,father specifically asks us to find that he and his wife have the right to deny grandparents visitation with the children.thus,it is quite apparent father does not want us to affirm summary judgment in his favor based on the fact,unreferenced in his separate statement,that he and his wife were voluntarily providing some visitation.
under these circumstances,it seems that father omission of the allowance of some visitation from his separate statement of facts was not a mere procedural failure.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank,supra,th at,d.instead,father has made a conscious,tactical choice to seek summary judgment based solely on the asserted facts that he and his wife are fit parents who object to visitation.we should not reach beyond the moving party separate statement and affirm a summary judgment based on consideration of a fact that the moving party does not even want us to consider.
another reason for not looking beyond father separate statement is that the facts here are not relatively simple and father entitlement to judgment in his favor is far from obvious,even if we were to take into account the fact that he and his wife have voluntarily provided some visitation to grandparents.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank,supra,th at,d.it is true that in their analysis of the federal constitutional question presented here,troxel and at least two of the california cases that followed it placed significant emphasis on the fact that the fit parents who opposed visitation in those cases had voluntarily allowed some grandparent visitation.see troxel,supra,at.kyle donald,supra,th at,d punsly ho,supra,th at,d.it does not follow,however,that the decision of a fit parent to allow some amount of grandparent visitation,however small and under whatever circumstances,necessarily renders imposition of any visitation unconstitutional as a matter of law regardless of any other attendant facts or circumstances.
in troxel,the evidence showed that the mother believed grandparent visitation wa s in the best interest of the children,and she wanted grandparents to have one day of visitation per month with no overnight stay and participation in the mother family holiday celebrations.troxel,supra,at.the grandparents,on the other hand,wanted two weekends per month and two full weeks in the summer.ibid.on this evidence,the plurality found the visitation order unconstitutional in part because the trial court fail ed to accord significant weight to the mother already having offered meaningful visitation to the grandparents.id.at,italics added.
in kyle,the evidence showed that the father agreed the grandparents needed to be involved in the child life and thought the grandparents should be able to see the child in the same fashion that his family saw her,which depended upon his and the child schedule.kyle donald,supra,th at,d.at trial,the father testified that he would allow the grandparents to have spontaneous visits with the child and that the child could continue to see the grandparents even if visitation were left completely to his discretion.ibid.based on this evidence,this court found the visitation order unconstitutional in part because the father agreed that visitation was appropriate,agreed that the child needed a relationship with the grandparents,and agreed to allow visitation with them he only contested their right to specify the amount and timing of the visitation.id.at,d.
in punsly,the evidence showed that the mother,who lived in san diego,had offered the grandparents,who lived in los angeles,visits with the child in san diego once every three months on sundays,along with telephone calls,in order to minimize the long drives to los angeles and to require more of an effort by the grandparents to visit the child in san diego.punsly ho,supra,th.at,d.in finding the visitation order which provided for visits once every other month unconstitutional,the court relied in part on the mother willingness to voluntarily schedule visitation.id.at,d.
we do not discern from these opinions that the voluntary provision of some visitation by a fit parent,however small and under whatever conditions,necessarily renders any visitation unconstitutional.rather,in the words of the troxel plurality,an offer of meaningful visitation to the grandparents is entitled to significant weight in determining whether intervention by the court would be constitutional.troxel,supra,at.
on the record before us,which we must view in the light most favorable to grandparents,it is far from obvious that father has offered them meaningful visitation with the children by allowing them supervised visits on an average of once every two and months,which cost them approximately per minute and during which they are prohibited from giving the children any gifts,from taking photographs or videotapes of themselves with the children,and from talking to the children about their mother.moreover,in contrast to the parents in troxel and kyle,it appears father does not believe visitation,at least with grandfather,is in the children best interests and does not agree grandfather needs to be involved in the children lives.on the contrary,he specifically stated in his declaration in support of the summary judgment motion i do not believe contact with grandfather is good for our two children.
we need not decide,however,what bearing these facts might have on the summary judgment in father favor.for our purposes,it is sufficient to conclude that the facts regarding father voluntary provision of some visitation which he chose to omit from his separate statement are not relatively simple,and father entitlement to judgment in his favor is far from obvious based on those facts.taken together with the inescapable conclusion that father does not want us to consider his voluntary provision of some visitation in determining whether summary judgment was proper,these factors lead us to decline to exercise our discretion to look beyond father separate statement in reviewing the summary judgment.
accordingly,we limit ourselves to the question we framed above does the fundamental due process right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children preclude the state from ever ordering grandparent visitation over the objection of two fit parents as we have explained,the answer to that question is no.the decision of fit parents regarding grandparent visitation is entitled to special weight,but not necessarily immunity from judicial review.it follows,therefore,that the facts presented by father in support of his summary judgment motion,even if undisputed are insufficient to compel the conclusion that any visitation in this case would necessarily be an unconstitutional infringement on the due process right of father and his wife to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.it may be that ultimately,based on a more detailed record following an evidentiary hearing,section can not be constitutionally applied to allow visitation in this case.we express no opinion on that point.for our purposes,on appeal from the summary judgment in favor of father,it is sufficient to conclude that visitation would not necessarily be unconstitutional based solely on the limited facts set forth by father in support of his motion.
state parenting right 
father contends a parent fundamental liberty interest to raise his or her children without undue state interference is also protected by article sic,section of the california constitution.accordingly,we must analyze father constitutional argument under the state constitution as well.
article i,section of the california constitution provides all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.it has long been held in california,although not necessarily with specific reference to this constitutional provision,that parents have a fundamental right to the care,custody,and control of their children.our supreme court has explained that the interest of a parent in the companionship,care,custody,and management of his children is a compelling one,ranked among the most basic of civil rights.in re cal d,see also in re carmaleta cal d,parenting is a fundamental right.it has also long been held,however,that the rights of parenthood are not absolute,but subject to the superior right of the state to intervene and protect the child against abuse of parental authority.odell lutz d,see also in re angelia cal d.the fundamental right of parents to the care,custody,and control of their children do es not exist in a vacuum wholly devoid of legitimate competing interests.in re angelia,supra,cal d at.children have constitutional rights also in re roger cal d,and t he interest of parents in maintaining their relationship with their children must be balanced with the interests of the child in secure and sufficient parenting.in re albert d.in some circumstances,the parenting right may be forced to yield to rights inherent in the child.in re d,italics omitted.
with these principles in mind,the question we address under the state constitution is the same one we addressed under the federal due process clause does the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children preclude the state from ever ordering grandparent visitation over the objection of two fit parents again,we conclude the answer is no.
as we have explained,the right of parents to the care,custody,and control of their children is not absolute,and this is true even when the parents are deemed fit.under california law,a finding of parental unfitness is not necessary for a court to award custody of a child to a nonparent against the claim of a parent.in re,supra,cal d at.instead,a court can award custody to a third party based on a clear showing that such award is essential to avert harm to the child.id.at.
if a court can deprive fit parents of the custody of their children without violating the parents fundamental right to the care,custody,and control of their children,then certainly a court can order grandparent much more limited form of interference with the parents custodial necessarily causing such a violation.
there is some authority for the proposition that the same test which applies to a custody award to a nonparent should apply to a visitation award to a is,that judicially compelled visitation against the wishes of both parents must not be allowed unless it is clearly and convincingly shown that denial of visitation would be detrimental to the child.in re marriage of gayden d.involving a motion for visitation by a biologically unrelated person under former civil code section now.in the procedural posture of this case,we have no occasion to express either agreement or disagreement with that authority.for our purposes,it is sufficient to conclude that because the fundamental parenting right recognized by california courts is not absolute,the opposition of two fit parents to grandparent visitation does not,by itself,preclude the court from ordering visitation.accordingly,father was not entitled to summary judgment on state constitutional grounds based on the limited facts he presented in support of his motion.
equal protection 
one further constitutional argument remains to be addressed.as we have previously explained,if a stepparent adoption occurs the natural parent,stepparent,and child are living together and both parents object to visitation,no petition for grandparent visitation is permitted under section.under section,on the other hand,if one of the natural parents is deceased,a grandparent visitation petition may be filed notwithstanding a stepparent adoption,even if the surviving natural parent and the stepparent live together with the child and object to visitation 
father contends this distinction between section and section violates the equal protection clauses of the united states and california constitutions.he hypothesizes that if kathryn sherriff were only missing,instead of deceased,her parents would have no right to petition for visitation with the children,and t here is no reason to afford greater grandparent visitation rights to the parents of a deceased child as opposed to parents of a missing child.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the concept of the equal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.purdy fitzpatrick state of california cal d.as a foundational matter,all meritorious equal protection claims require a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.people wutzke cal th,d,quoting in re eric cal d,italics omitted.there is no requirement that persons in different circumstances must be treated as if their situations were similar.people mccain th,d.
of course,t here is always some difference between the two groups which a law treats in an unequal manner since an equal protection claim necessarily asserts that the law in some way distinguishes between the two groups.thus,an equal protection claim can not be resolved by simply observing that the members of group a have distinguishing characteristic x while the members of group b lack this characteristic.the similarly situated prerequisite simply means that an equal protection claim can not succeed,and does not require further analysis,unless there is some showing that the two groups are sufficiently similar with respect to the purpose of the law in question that some level of scrutiny is required in order to determine whether the distinction is justified.people nguyen th,d.
here,father equal protection argument posits the existence of two similarly situated groups natural families where the other natural parent is deceased and natural families where the other natural parent is missing.it is important to note,however,that a stepparent adoption can not occur simply because one of the natural parents is missing.generally,the consent of a living natural parent is required for an adoption unless the natural parent has deserted the child,had his or her parental rights terminated,surrendered those rights,or relinquished the child for adoption.see.thus,for purposes of father equal protection argument,the two groups subject to unequal treatment under sections and are more accurately described as natural families where the other natural parent is deceased and natural families where the other natural parent is alive,but has surrendered,lost,or forfeited his or her parental rights.
with the relevant groups properly understood,we conclude father has met his initial burden of showing a classification that affects two similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.the two groups at issue are similar because the members of each group consist of nuclear families made up of one natural parent and one adoptive stepparent living together with their child or children.the primary difference between the two groups is whether the other natural parent is alive or dead.it is this difference,however,which is challenged as not justified by the purpose of the statutes at issue.people nguyen,supra,th at,d.in our view,these two groups are sufficiently similar to merit application of some level of scrutiny to determine whether distinctions between the two groups justify the unequal treatment.ibid.
the next step in analyzing an equal protection challenge is a determination of the appropriate standard of review.people nguyen,supra,th at,d.in reviewing an equal protection challenge,the courts generally apply one of two rational relationship test or the strict scrutiny test.warden state bar cal th,d.the more stringent strict scrutiny test generally applies to cases involving suspect classifications or touching on fundamental interests.id.at,d.
father suggests we should apply the strict scrutiny test here because the challenged classification involves matters concerning the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.not every classification involving a fundamental right warrants strict scrutiny,however.
although a fundamental interest may be involved,both the united states supreme court and the california supreme court have recognized that not every limitation or incidental burden on a fundamental right is subject to the strict scrutiny standard.when the regulation merely has an incidental effect on exercise of protected rights,strict scrutiny is not applied.citations.it is only when there exists a real and appreciable impact on,or a significant interference with the exercise of the fundamental right that the strict scrutiny doctrine will be applied.fair political practices com.superior court cal d.
we conclude the classification father challenges does not warrant strict scrutiny.in essence,father complains that because the other natural parent of his children is deceased,rather than simply missing,he and his wife are subject to a petition for grandparent visitation under section.the mere fact that defendant and his wife are subject to a visitation petition,however,is not a real and appreciable impact on,or a significant interference with the exercise of their fundamental right to make parenting decisions.fair political practices com.superior court,supra,cal d at.the trial court may ultimately determine that no visitation is warranted under the circumstances presented,in which case the classification of which father complains will have had no real and appreciable impact on the fundamental right of father and his wife to make parenting decisions.moreover,in determining whether visitation is warranted in this particular case,the trial court will have to take into account the fundamental parenting right of father and his wife under both the state and federal constitutions.at the very least,under troxel,the trial court will have to accord special weight to the decision of father and his wife regarding visitation assuming they are found to be fit parents.because the fundamental right at issue here will be adequately protected by the trial court in its determination of the petition,we conclude strict scrutiny is not warranted in determining whether the legislature violated the equal protection clause by subjecting certain natural families to the possibility of grandparent visitation.
we therefore apply the rational relationship test to father equal protection challenge.under that test,father bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged classification is invalid because the classification bears no rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.board of medical examiners cal d.we conclude father has failed to carry that burden.
father contends t here is no basis,rational or otherwise,for allowing an adopting stepparent full rights to control visitation if the natural parent is missing,but not if the natural parent is deceased.we disagree.
as we have explained,the classification the legislature created in section and section distinguishes between natural families where the other natural parent is deceased,and natural families where the other natural parent is alive,but has surrendered,lost,or forfeited his or her parental rights.we perceive a rational basis for this distinction.when a child is deprived of a natural parent by that parent death,the parent family may be the only means of maintaining the child link with his or her paternal or maternal family,including their ancestry,heritage,culture,traditions,and medical history.the legislature reasonably could have determined that in such circumstances,members of the deceased parent family should have the opportunity to demonstrate to a court that visitation with the child will further this legitimate state interest.that is exactly the opportunity that section provides by allowing the children,siblings,parents,and grandparents of the deceased parent to petition for visitation rights,subd.a.
on the other hand,when the natural parent is alive,but has surrendered,lost,or forfeited his or her parental rights,the interest in maintaining the child connection to his or her extended paternal or maternal family is not so compelling.the legislature reasonably could have determined that when a living parent no longer has any parental rights,and a new nuclear family has been created by a stepparent adoption,the importance of honor ing the integrity of the nuclear family unit and the ability of married,cohabiting parents to make decisions free from state interference lopez martinez,supra,th at,d outweighs any interest in preserving the child connection to the extended family of the parent whose rights were lost.
because we find a rational basis for the classification father challenges,we reject father equal protection argument.
