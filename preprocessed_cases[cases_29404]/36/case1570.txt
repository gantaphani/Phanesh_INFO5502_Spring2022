the question raised by this appeal is whether a wife consent to the use of community funds to improve her husband separate real property raises a presumption that the funds were a gift of the funds to the husband.we conclude that it does not.in so holding,we agree with in re marriage of wolfe th,d wolfe,which recently held that where a wife uses community funds to make improvements to her husband separate property,the community is entitled to reimbursement of the funds.
contentions 
judith lorraine allen appeals from a further judgment on reserved issues in a marital dissolution action in which the trial court ruled that community expenditures toward capital improvements on thomas allen separate property residence were presumptively a gift to him from the community.judith contends that the trial court erred in failing to apply the moore marsden rule in re marriage of moore cal d,moore and in re marriage of marsden d.marsden in this case.judith also asserts that the trial court erred in finding that she consented to the expenditures.thomas,contending that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for attorney fees.
procedural and factual history 
judith filed her petition for dissolution of marriage in september.the principal disputed issue in the case was whether the family home,which thomas owned prior to the marriage,had been transmuted to community property.the trial court bifurcated that issue and heard the matter during september.thomas contended the property remained his separate property throughout the marriage.judith took the position that the property was transmuted to community property either by oral agreement prior to or by written deed in.on september,the court ruled that the real property had been transmuted to community property on january.it certified the issue for immediate appeal.no appeal was taken.
the remaining issues in the case were then heard.they included child support,attorney fees,and whether the community was entitled to reimbursement or a pro tanto interest in the family residence based upon pre community contributions to improvements in the home.judith took the position that approximately in community funds had been used improving the family home prior to.thomas contested both the fact that any community funds had been used and the amount spent on the alleged improvements.the trial court granted thomas motion in limine,however,precluding judith from presenting evidence of the cost of,or value added by,the alleged improvements.the remaining issues were tried.
the trial court issued a statement of decision on october.it stated in connection with thomas in limine motion the court finds that it is constrained by the holdings in in re marriage of jafeman d.and in re marriage of camire d,which held that the expenditure of community property funds upon a spouse separate property residence did not give rise to a claim for reimbursement,because of a presumption that the community had made a gift to the separate property owning spouse.although both cases predate in re marriage of moore cal d,and in re marriage of marsden d,which established that community property paydowns on mortgage principal on a separate property asset give rise to a pro tanto interest in favor of the community,neither moore nor marsden specifically address the issue of improvements,and no reported case has heretofore expanded the reasoning to include enhancement in value of separate property through capital improvements financed with community funds.the court believes that jafeman and camire are therefore still controlling in a situation such as the case at bar involving alleged community property funds expended upon improvements to respondent residence prior to its transmutation to community property.therefore,any evidence which petitioner might present relating to the cost or value of the improvements made upon respondent separate property residence from through would be irrelevant and respondent motion in limine was granted on that basis.the trial court found that judith had consented to the use of any community property funds expended on the residence prior to.
the court ordered thomas to pay toward judith attorney fees based upon findings that thomas had superior ability to make contributions,and that his contesting the validity of a deed placing the family residence in joint ownership required significant attorney work exacerbating the fees and costs incurred in the matter.the court found that judith advocating a right of reimbursement or a pro tanto interest in the family home in favor of the community was not so unreasonable as to require that she be sanctioned.the court entered a further judgment on reserved issues on may.both parties appealed.
the evidence shows the following.judith and thomas were married in.they have three children together,born in,and.prior to their marriage,in,thomas purchased a home on the strand in hermosa beach,subject to a life estate in the prior owner.during their marriage,judith and thomas cared for the life estate owner,who forgave thomas existing mortgage as a testamentary bequest,until her death in.thomas was committed to restoring the house,and the couple devoted considerable effort and expense toward its restoration and renovation.
throughout the marriage,the issue of ownership of the residence was a volatile one.in,thomas stated that he did not intend to place judith on title to the residence.judith testified that in,when she was pregnant with their first child,thomas told her that they owned the home together.she said that thomas told her in that he would change title to reflect her equal ownership.thomas testified that judith repeatedly brought up the issue,but that he only told her that his estate plan provided for her to remain in the home for the rest of her life,should he predecease her.according to thomas,title to the residence was to go to their children.
in,thomas drafted and executed a deed conveying the property to thomas and judith in joint tenancy.thomas told judith that he had finally executed the deed confirming her interest in the house,which she reviewed.thomas did not,however,record the deed,and he subsequently destroyed the original and a copy in or.
prior to marriage,judith was a dental hygienist working approximately four days a week.after the birth of their children,judith devoted herself to the remodeling project,and caring for the life tenant until her death.thomas remained a successful attorney throughout.using community assets,thomas established three irrevocable trusts for the children,with himself as sole trustee.at the time of trial,each trust held assets of approximately.judith testified that she agreed to fund the trusts with community assets after she was assured that the family home was joint property,and that she would not have agreed to that use of community funds if she had not believed she had an interest in the house.
the court found that the fair market value of the strand residence was,and that it was not subject to any liens or encumbrances.the court determined the community property interest in the home to be,based upon the transmutation.
discussion 
judith appeal 
the trial court found consent based upon judith knowledge that the family home was thomas separate property.there was no proof,however,that judith intended the couple use of community funds to result in a permanent gift to thomas.to the contrary,her frequent complaints about the manner in which title was held militates strongly against such a conclusion.the present case is not an aberration.a spouse who consents to the use of community funds to improve the other spouse separate property does not necessarily intend a gift.few spouses anticipate dissolution of their marriage.the consenting spouse who considers the consequences may well assume that a community share will be reimbursed when the community estate is divided.in this case,the separate property house was also the family home in which judith believed at the least she had an interest for life.we agree with wolfe,which holds that where community funds are consensually used to improve one spouse separate property,the community
