the regents of the university of california regents and various pension plans administered by them filed a complaint seeking a declaration that certain antialienation provisions in these pension plans prohibit a nonemployee spouse who predeceases the working spouse from bequeathing his or her community property interest in the plans.the trial court entered summary judgment against defendants,the executor of decedent estate and decedent children,ruling the antialienation provisions as a matter of law prevent defendants from obtaining an interest in the plans.defendants appeal the judgment,contending family code sections and prohibit termination of decedent interests in the plans on her death.defendants further contend sections and take precedence over contrary regulations adopted by the regents despite the grant of autonomy provided under the california constitution,because the statute was enacted under the legislature general police powers,addressed a matter of statewide concern,and did not pertain solely to internal university affairs.see cal.const.art.ix.
we disagree with defendants because the antialienation provisions do not operate as a gift of community property under section and section is inapplicable when the nonemployee spouse dies before the property has been divided in a divorce or legal separation.because the regulations do not conflict with either of the two sections,we do not address any issue concerning the scope of the regents constitutional autonomy.
factual and procedural background 
decedent,joan benford,was married to benford from august until her death in march,and resided continuously in california during the marriage.in december,the university of california hired benford as a professor,a position he occupied at the time of the lawsuit.after being hired,benford participated in the university of california retirement plan ucrp,tax deferred b plan b plan,and a defined contribution plan dc plan collectively,the uc plans.in,decedent and benford commenced marital dissolution proceedings.decedent dissolution attorney on two occasions obtained information from the uc plans concerning the value of benford benefits to use in obtaining a qualified domestic relations order qdro dividing the couple community property interests in the plans.no qdro,however,was ever obtained.at the time of decedent death in,the dissolution proceedings were not finalized and no decree of legal separation or divorce had been entered.in various testamentary instruments,decedent purported to bequeath her community property interest in the uc plans to the joan benford trust,of which the sole beneficiaries are mark benford and alyson benford,children from her marriage to benford.defendants joan benford and mark benford,the latter in his personal capacity and as executor and personal representative of decedent estate,filed a petition for an assignment of these interests under probate code section in a separate probate proceeding.
plaintiffs,the regents and the uc plans,filed a complaint against defendants seeking a declaration that the antialienation provisions in the uc plans preclude payment of any benefits to defendants.the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and defendants now appeal.
standard of review 
we review a trial court grant of summary judgment de novo.romero american president lines,th,d.defendants do not contend there exist any disputed issues of material fact,but argue the trial court erred in ruling,as a matter of law,the antialienation provisions of the uc plans prevent the transfer of decedent community property interest in the plans.
discussionthe california constitution grants broad autonomy to the university of california 
the parties view this case as a clash between two venerable legal policies.the first,championed by plaintiffs,is that p ensions are designed for the benefit of the living,to ensure that both spouses would receive sufficient funds to afford them security during their lifetimes,not to arrange for an opportunity for a predeceasing spouse to leave a part of her surviving husband pension rights to others.see ablamis roper cir,ablamis.the second,urged by defendants,is that termination of a nonemployee spouse pension plan interests upon death represents a windfall profit to the employee spouse and his or her new spouse.see in re marriage of powers d.powers.our task,however,is not to weigh the respective wisdom of these competing policies,nor decide how legislators should have implemented them.see willis state of california th,d it remains a legislative,and not a judicial,prerogative to assess the competing interests and to determine public policy.we therefore content ourselves to interpreting the laws enacted in light of these policies given the undisputed facts at issue.
we begin our analysis with the pertinent provisions of the uc plans.section of the ucrp states no benefit payable from the fund to any person including a member or beneficiary shall be subject in any manner to anticipation,alienation,sale,transfer,assignment,pledge,encumbrance,or charge,and any attempt to anticipate,alienate,sell,transfer,assign,pledge,encumber,or charge the same shall be void and no such benefit shall in any manner be liable for,or subject to,the debts,contracts,liabilities,engagements,or torts of any such person,nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such person,except to such extent as may be required by law.similar provisions are found in the other two plaintiff uc plans.the uc plans,however,provide an exception to the antialienation provisions in the case of any property settlements upon marital dissolution or legal separation which are made in accordance with a qualified domestic relations order qdro issued in accordance with state domestic relations law.
defendants do not dispute these provisions purport to prevent decedent testamentary transfer of her community property interest in the uc plans.rather,defendants contend the uc plans conflict with california statutes providing for the testamentary disposition of decedent community property interests in the uc plans,and must yield to those statutes.
the california constitution grants broad autonomy to the university,subject to limited legislative interference.tafoya hastings college d.under article ix,section,of the california constitution the university constitutes a public trust possessing full powers of organization and government and all the powers necessary or convenient for the effective administration of its trust the regents have the general or power in regard to the university citation,and are with exceptions not material here fully empowered with respect to the organization and government of the university citation.as a consequence,policies established by the regents as matters of internal regulation may enjoy a status equivalent to that of state statutes bunnett regents of university of california th,fn,d.thus,the uc plan provisions have the force of law.see id.at,d.
this broad grant of autonomy,however,is not boundless.in addition to specific provisions set forth in article ix,section,cases have recognized three general areas in which the legislature own extensive powers may limit university autonomy authority over the appropriation of state monies citations exercise of the general police power to provide for the public health,safety,and welfare citations and legislation on matters of general statewide concern.coutin lucas d.
the uc plans do not conflict with family code section in the present case 
defendants principally argue the uc plans directly conflict with section,and assert section controls because it was enacted under the legislature general police powers and addresses a matter of statewide concern.section,subdivision a,provides,in relevant part except as provided in subdivision b,the court shall make whatever orders are necessary or appropriate to ensure that each party receives the party full community property share in any retirement plan,whether public or private,including all survivor and death benefits,including,but not limited to,any of the following order the disposition of any retirement benefit
