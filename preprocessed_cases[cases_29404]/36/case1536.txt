in this international child custody case,the trial court granted the petition of esther lasich mother to move with the parties minor children from sacramento county to barcelona,spain.david lasich father appeals from the court order we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
mother,a native of barcelona,and father,a native of sacramento,married in august.they had two children sandra,born in,and monica,born in.
the parties separated in september.they executed a marital settlement agreement which was entered as a judgment in april 
as relevant,the judgment provides the parties will have joint legal custody and joint physical custody of the minor children.mother will be the primary caretaker of the children,and her home will be the primary home of the children for the purposes of determining eligibility for public assistance.mother will be the custodial parent of the children for tax purposes.father will have parenting time with the children on tuesdays and thursdays from to and on alternate weekends.mother will have four weeks of parenting time in the summer father will have two weeks in the summer of and three weeks in subsequent summers.
on december,mother filed a motion for modification of the judgment as to custody and visitation so that she could move from sacramento county to barcelona with the minors.in supporting points and authorities,mother discussed in re marriage of burgess cal th,d,burgess,the leading california case.burgess holds that a custodial parent is presumed entitled to move away with his or her minor child,absent a showing of prejudice to the child rights or welfare.however,if parents share joint physical custody of the minor children under an existing order and in fact,a parent request requires de novo custody review.burgess,supra,cal th at,fn,d,second italics added.mother argued that because she was the minors primary caregiver,the parents did not have a true joint custody parenting plan as defined in burgess.therefore,father was not entitled to a de novo custody hearing,but rather had the burden of showing that any custody change which would keep the children in sacramento county would be in the minors best interest.
father responsive declaration requested that the court grant him physical custody of the minors if mother moved to spain,or restrain mother from moving.in his supporting points and authorities,father argued the court must review custody de novo because the parties had a true joint custody plan within the meaning of burgess.he also demanded a parental fitness evaluation under evidence code section before the court made any decision.
family court services mediator patrick peralta recommended in a written report to the trial court that it would be in the minors best interest for mother to stay in the sacramento area and continue as the primary caregiver,because the minors would suffer from the loss of frequent and continuing contact with father.however,if the court approved mother move,father should have substantial parenting time eight weeks in the summer and alternating periods during other vacations,plus additional time in spain at mother expense,as mother had agreed to offer him.peralta noted father demand for physical custody if mother moved,but did not recommend that option.
before trial began,the trial court orally ruled that mother had primary physical custody of the minors therefore,father would have to show detriment to the minors to defeat mother request in re marriage of edlund hales th,d edlund.however,mother would have to show that father parenting rights could be preserved in light of the cultural,transportational,and financial problems posed by an international.in re marriage of condon th,d condon.
at trial,both parties testified,as did peralta all agreed the parties had adhered to the custody and parenting plan set out in the judgment.father also presented an expert witness,psychologist douglas liebert.
mother testimony 
mother had lived in barcelona for most of her life aside from her marriage.her family are all still there.she had returned there frequently throughout the marriage,sometimes with and sometimes without father.she had always made clear she hoped to return permanently at some point,and he had indicated he was willing to relocate with her.during their courtship he lived there for nine months,but could not find work to suit him.
before marrying,mother had been an executive secretary at ibm in barcelona.once the couple first child was born,she did not work.since the separation,she has worked at jobs,making an hour.she can not find better employment here because her spoken english is too poor,despite her attempts to improve it.however,she has been offered a job as an import manager with a company in barcelona,which will pay much better and still enable her to spend time with the minors.
mother is the minors caregiver.she has always done all the work of parenting father did little of it either before or after the separation.the minors love him as their father,but look to her as a mother.they are happy,popular children sandra,the older,is completely bilingual.
mother lives with the minors in the family residence,for which she pays a month in rent she also has sandra enrolled in a private school,for which she pays the tuition.she receives a month in spousal support,plus rental income from inherited commercial properties she owns in spain,but even with this income and her jobs she is running out of money.
in barcelona,mother owns a large inherited apartment free and clear,as well as her commercial properties.she also has all her family and close friends,whereas here she has little support from father family or anyone else.her parents,who had helped care for the minors before,live very near her flat she can also hire others to help.
mother will enroll the minors in an american bilingual school in barcelona near her residence because she wants them to retain their american heritage.she will pay for them to visit father in sacramento twice a year.she will also finance father trips to spain to visit the minors as often as he likes he can stay in family residences during his visits.she will encourage the minors to call father and communicate with him by internet as much as possible she will buy a computer with a web camera for that purpose.finally,she will continue to recognize the jurisdiction of the california courts over custody and visitation.
father testimony 
according to father,he played an equal role in parenting throughout the marriage.since the separation,he has regularly helped sandra with schoolwork in his parenting times during the week.he helped monica through on a recent vacation.on weekends when he has the minors,he cooks dinner,watches videos with them,takes them to marine world or the state fair or to play with their cousins,and just spend s time together with them.he had wanted more time with them than he got under the parties agreement,but accepted that plan because he could not pay an attorney to fight over it and feared a judge would rule for the parent.
father has a large extended family in sacramento,including parents who had cared for the minors and cousins close to their ages.the family regularly gets together for holidays and camping trips contrary to mother testimony,they had always included her in these activities.
father is an aerospace engineer employed by a manufacturing company he has two weeks of paid vacation a year and will eventually have three.however,due to the nature of his work,he can seldom take two consecutive weeks off,and unpaid vacation is frowned on therefore,he can go to spain for only a week at a time.given the flying time between sacramento and barcelona and the inevitable jet lag,this would leave him only a few days of good parenting time per visit.
father thinks the minors lives would be worse in barcelona instead of living in a quiet suburb,they would be in a huge,noisy,polluted city.he also fears mother will try to alienate the minors from him if he loses regular contact with them.when negotiating the settlement agreement she lied about her intent to relocate,and she recently said when she got the kids to spain,she would finally be rid of him and she would have to deal with him any more.
father thinks it would be a reasonable compromise for the minors to remain here with him,with mother taking them along on trips back home as she did throughout the marriage.if she moves back,that is the only way the minors can have frequent and continuing contact with both parents.
patrick peralta testimony 
after interviewing the parties and sandra but not monica,as she was too young,studying court records,and consulting another mediator,patrick peralta concluded it would be in the minors best interest to make no change mother should stay in sacramento and remain the minors primary custodial parent under the current plan.however,if mother is allowed to move,the next best option would be for her to take the minors and to give father ample parenting time in both countries during summers and vacations mother had said she would accept that plan and pay for the minors and father trips.it would not be in the minors best interest to give father custody if mother moved,because mother was the primary caregiver.
the minors had close and loving relationships with both parents.the parents argued frequently and made charges against each other,but peralta knew of nothing to substantiate those charges.if not for mother proposed move,peralta would see no reason to modify the current parenting plan mother had not tried to frustrate father contact with the minors,and father had expressed no discontent with the existing setup.
sandra was completely bilingual and bicultural.putting the minors in a bilingual and bicultural school in spain would help their adjustment mother plan to do so showed she was sensitive to the minors needs to maintain their american ties.
sandra said she hoped to move with mother to spain and that father would also move there.she had formed a primary attachment to mother,but was also very attached to father.sandra told peralta that mother had said she would die if sandra did not relocate with her,but peralta could not recall anything more about that statement he did not remember discussing it with mother.he found no evidence mother was using sandra to take care of mother emotional needs.he also found no evidence either parent had coached sandra.
aside from the loss of contact with father,peralta believed the minors would do very well with mother in spain because of their close bond with mother and her family and the plan for bilingual,bicultural schooling.the problem of loss of contact could be alleviated not only by the visitation schedule mother had agreed to,but also by technological means for the minors to keep in touch with father.
douglas liebert testimony 
douglas liebert,an expert in child development,testified in general terms that young children bond with both parents.thus,rupturing a bond with either can have severe consequences.
in general,children aged two or three like monica have great difficulty maintaining bonds to parents they do not see regularly and frequently such a separation would be pathologic and really bad for such a child.for a old to see her father only in summer and on vacations could result in a functional severing of her relationship with her father with potentially bad consequences.
for a like sandra,the consequences of such a separation could be even worse.children of that age will feel guilt and about the separation,along with rejection and confusion.their sense of loss is more profound than that of younger children and leads to more behavioral problems.a custody plan which would permit a to see her father only in the summer and during vacations would have pretty horrible consequences,b ecause you basically asking her to essentially give up her relationship with one of her parents.any such plan could work only with children at least to years old.
liebert had spoken with father,but not with mother or the minors.he had no opinions about the bonding of these parents and children.he admitted i certainly ca testify about these specific kids,because i not conducted that kind of assessment.i can only talk in terms of the literature in general about kids these ages.he could offer no specific evidence that the proposed move would be pathological for these minors.
the trial court statement of decision 
the trial court ruled in favor of mother relocation request.in a lengthy statement of decision,the court found the following 
the parties executed a marital settlement agreement,entered as a judgment of dissolution,which on its face provides for joint legal custody and joint physical custody of the minors.the court was not modifying the judgment of dissolution in that respect.however,notwithstanding the judgment joint physical custody label,the evidence shows that mother is the custodial parent and the one who has primary physical custody of the minors.she has had the minors percent or more of the time since the parties separation.under the parties de facto weekly physical custody plan,mother provides physical care and custody more than percent of the time.father has physical custody on alternating weekends and for two dinners,a total of hours per week.the parties de facto arrangement determines whether purported joint custody is truly so,or whether in fact one parent has sole physical custody with visitation rights to the other.in re marriage of biallas th,d biallas.
because mother is the primary physical custodian,the presumption of family code section applies further statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise indicated.thus she is entitled to change the children residence unless the court restrains her removal because it would prejudice their rights or welfare.under burgess,father has the burden of proving the relocation would cause detriment to the minors and a different custody arrangement would be in their best interests.this means it must be essential or expedient for the welfare of the child that there be a change.burgess,supra,cal th,d.father has not met this burden of proof.
father offered his own testimony and that of his mother about his ties to the minors and their ties to other members of his family.however,by implication,that evidence did not show the minors would suffer detriment from relocating.he also offered liebert testimony,but that testimony,though interesting,provided no evidence of detriment to the minors in this case.
relocation alone can not prove detriment because no request could succeed under that standard.edlund,supra,th at,d.there is no evidence mother request was made whimsically or in bad faith or with the intent to frustrate father contact with the minors.absent such evidence,t he paramount need for continuity and stability in the children custodial relationship with m other,accomplished in a manner which best serves the children interests,is the weightier consideration in this case.
this paramount need can best be satisfied by permitting mother to move to barcelona with the minors and providing extensive parenting time for father.he will get eight weeks every summer,plus one week at christmas and one week at spring break the parents will alternate the christmas holiday.father will also have,at his choosing,up to two weeks parenting time,which may be exercised in two periods,in spain.mother will pay for and purchase father air fare between sacramento and barcelona.mother will also deposit all child support payments into a trust account to finance father other expenses for parenting time in spain.in addition,mother will furnish both father and the minors with computer equipment,software,internet service,and training for father and the minors to at least twice a week.
because this is an international,the factors of distance,culture,and jurisdiction,identified as relevant in condon,supra,th,d,figure into the analysis.given the court specific orders,these factors do not weigh against mother move.in this instance,relocation is not tantamount to an order terminating a parent custody and visitation rights.id.at,d.
as to distance,the family are experienced international travelers.mother can and will fully fund father travel expenses.the parties have undertaken shared counseling to strengthen their parenting communication skills.
as to culture,there is significant evidence the minors are bilingual and bicultural.they have spent much time in spain.their maternal grandparents have frequently visited them in california.mother,a native of spain,has inculcated her heritage in the minors since birth.father speaks spanish and has not only visited spain,but has lived and worked there.the minors will attend an american school in barcelona if monica is placed in day care,she should have an caretaker.there is no evidence that a relocation to spain will deprive the minors of important protections and advantages.condon,supra,th at,d.
as to jurisdiction,mother shall register this court custody order under the convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction the hague convention,to which spain and the united states are parties,at least annually,and shall provide proof to father that she has registered the order before the minors may move to spain.this order shall specify that due to the minors residence weeks or more a year in california,the minors are habitual residents of california.mother shall file at least annually in the courts of barcelona a declaration acknowledging the minors status and shall furnish proof of such filing to father.mother concedes that california retains exclusive jurisdiction over custody and consents to the california courts exercise of jurisdiction to make any order pertaining to custody.mother shall post an annually renewed bond,forfeitable if she seeks to modify this court order in any other country she shall provide proof to father that she has posted bond before the minors may move to spain.mother consents to an order that should she violate any of these conditions her action shall be deemed a substantial change of circumstances and not in the minors best interests.mother consents to an order that she shall retain an attorney in barcelona at her sole cost and shall cause to be filed a translated copy of the california order,which shall be entered and made an order of the spanish court,specifying that only the california court has jurisdiction to modify the order,that spain has jurisdiction only to enforce the california order as outlined therein,and that the minors are habitual residents of california mother will file this order and provide proof she has done so before the minors may move to spain.mother acknowledges that united states code title,section,pertaining to parental kidnapping,applies to her,that if she violates this court order she may be arrested pursuant to that provision,and that she will waive extradition on the arrest warrant.
mother conduct to date shows that she may be expected to adhere to the court orders.she has consistently adhered to orders regarding parenting time.she returned to california from spain with the minors and filed her motion seeking the court permission to relocate the minors residence.after the parties divorce,she completed the process of becoming an american citizen.
mediator peralta testified that the best option from the minors perspective would be for both parents to remain in sacramento with the present custody plan.however,if he had to choose between the minors remaining in mother physical custody in barcelona and being placed in father physical custody,their best interests dictate that they remain with mother and relocate.
father oral request for appointment of an expert under evidence code section to conduct a custody evaluation was untimely and no evidence warranted such an evaluation.
the court order 
the trial court thereafter entered an order which permits mother to relocate the minors residence to barcelona,conditioned on observance of all the custodial and jurisdictional provisions spelled out in the statement of decision and repeated in the order.the order further specifies mother shall not move the minors residence to any country other than spain or the united states mother shall enroll the minors in the benjamin franklin american school in barcelona at her sole expense monica shall be placed with an caretaker if she is enrolled in day care the maternal grandmother shall not be designated as the minors primary child care provider mother shall provide father a home and a car for his use when he visits spain mother shall furnish father and the minors with a specified set of items of computer equipment and mother shall designate an agent for service of process in california before the minors depart for spain.
discussion 
father contends the trial court erred by treating the award of joint physical custody in the parties judgment as if it conferred sole physical custody on mother.the trial court erred in its application of the detriment standard.we disagree with both contentions.
the trial court did not err in basing its order on the current actual custody arrangement of the.this court reviews the order of the trial court for abuse of discretion.
father contends the trial court order is subject to de novo review by this court.this is incorrect.it is well settled that the standard of review for custody and visitation orders,including orders,is whether the trial court abused its discretion.burgess,supra,cal th at,d,edlund,supra,th at,d biallas,supra,th at,d.no different standard applies to international orders.condon,supra,th at,d.we shall apply the abuse of discretion standard of review in this case.
b.the trial court correctly looked to the current actual custody status of the parties.
father contends the trial court erred by refusing to conduct a de novo review of the parties custody situation and by placing the burden on father to show the extant custody arrangement was detrimental to the children.father argues the trial court failed to pay proper deference to the prior judgment awarding joint physical custody to father.
the trial court did not err.burgess says that a custody arrangement gets the de novo review sought by father when parents share joint physical custody of the minor children under an existing order and in fact.cal th at,fn,d,second italics added.
t he term primary physical custody has no legal meaning.biallas,supra,th at,d.therefore,to decide whether a parent seeking to move has sole or joint physical custody,the trial court looks at the existing de facto arrangement between the parties to decide whether physical custody is truly joint or whether one parent has sole physical custody with visitation rights accorded the other parent.id.at,d.
sole physical custody means that a child shall reside with and be under the supervision of one parent,subject to the power of the court to order visitation.joint physical custody means that each of the parents shall have significant periods of physical custody.
the family code does not define significant in this context.however,case law has established guidelines on the point.biallas,supra,th at,d.where children shuttle back and forth between two parents in re marriage of whealon th,d so that they spend nearly equal times with each parent,or where the parent with whom the child does not reside sees the child four or five times a week,this amounts to joint physical custody.biallas,supra,th at,d brody kroll th,d in re marriage of battenburg th,d in re marriage of mcginnis th,d disapproved on another point in burgess,supra,cal th at,fn,d.but where,as in this case,a father has a child only percent of the time,on alternate weekends and one or two nights a week,this amounts to sole physical custody for the mother with liberal visitation rights for the father.biallas,supra,th at,d whealon,supra,th at,d in re marriage of selzer th,d disapproved on another point in burgess,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
father tries to distinguish the cases factually similar to this case where courts have not found joint physical custody,asserting that in those cases there was either no existing custody order or an order which specified an arrangement other than joint physical custody.edlund,supra,th at,fn,d biallas,supra,th at,d whealon,supra,th at,d brody kroll,supra,th at,d.but the results in those cases did not turn on prior custody orders existence or wording.as biallas makes clear,when a trial court must decide whether a case re
