middletown house valuation 
ii.breach of fiduciary duty 
wife contends the court erred in finding she breached her fiduciary duty owed to husband by not disclosing the depletion of funds in the morgan stanley ira.she argues the morgan stanley ira was husband separate property,and therefore her management and control thereof were not subject to a statutory breach of duty under family code sections and.alternatively,she argues she had no duty to disclose to husband the amount in the morgan stanley ira absent his request.
background 
there was no evidence that the contributions husband made during the parties marriage to the keogh retirement he had established before the marriage were not from community property funds.when the keogh retirement was rolled over into the morgan stanley ira worth after husband retirement,the ira was set up with an accompanying checking account the ira checking account.husband set up the morgan stanley ira so that percent was to stay and grow as an investment and percent was in the liquid asset checking account,which could be used as an emergency fund.every year the brokerage company automatically transferred a certain amount from the morgan stanley ira into the ira checking account to comply with internal revenue service requirements governing iras.husband thought the automatic annual distribution was probably around,but no documentary evidence was offered to establish it.
wife was the parties family bookkeeper during the marriage and handled all family finances in their home office because husband did not want to do so.she was an authorized signatory on the ira checking account and frequently wrote checks to herself from the checking account,which she then deposited into the parties west america bank joint checking account in order to pay bills.she also reviewed the morgan stanley ira statements that came to the house,although they were addressed to husband.husband never asked her for the morgan stanley ira statements she did not know whether he looked at them on his own.
if the parties wanted to transfer funds from the morgan stanley ira to the ira checking account in amounts greater than the funds that were transferred automatically,they had to make a special request.wife made such additional withdrawals,and she knew that they created a tax liability.she arranged for them by telephoning the stockbroker.she was unaware of husband ever instructing the stockbroker to act on her request for additional withdrawals.she acknowledged that in october she signed husband name on a written request for a supplemental withdrawal that she submitted to the brokerage company.
in the years between husband retirement and the parties separation,he never withdrew funds from the morgan stanley ira,nor did he write checks on the ira account.
when the parties separated in november,the value of the morgan stanley ira was between and 
there was conflicting testimony regarding wife authority to obtain additional withdrawals from the morgan stanley ira,husband knowledge that she arranged for these withdrawals,and the causes of the decline in the value of the morgan stanley ira.
husband testified that the parties had no agreement that wife could withdraw additional funds from the morgan stanley ira,he never authorized her to do so,nor did he know during the marriage that she had done so.he learned of the withdrawals after their separation,when he had to review the parties financial documents.he found statements from the brokerage company showing that wife wrote monthly checks to herself in and.when husband asked wife after their separation about these withdrawals,she explained she used them to pay taxes and bills.she had never expressed concern to him during their marriage that they were living beyond their means.
husband also testified that the morgan stanley ira depletion between and was not the result of any volatility in the stock market because the ira was invested in mixed funds.he further testified that he had not examined any documents to determine that the depletion was not due to a decline in the stock market.however,his broker of years standing had informed him several months before trial that the market had no effect on the set up of his morgan stanley ira.
wife testified that at least once she and husband discussed having an extra deposit transferred to the ira checking account he agreed to the transfer and signed his okay.she testified that the parties used the additional withdrawals from the morgan stanley ira for several trips to britain and hawaii,for taxes,and for household expenses,and that they lost some of the ira when the stock market dropped.wife did not know how many years the morgan stanley ira withdrawals were used for taxes,how much of these withdrawals was used for household expenses,or how much the morgan stanley ira declined due to stock market declines.
neither party offered documentary evidence regarding the effect of the stock market on the value of the morgan stanley ira.
wife contentions at trial 
in her posttrial brief wife rebutted husband argument that she had breached her fiduciary duty by depleting the morgan stanley ira without his knowledge or consent on two grounds.first,she asserted that the morgan stanley ira was not subject to an allegation of mismanagement under family code sections and because it was husband separate property,and the two statutes apply only to breaches of fiduciary duty regarding community property.alternatively,she argued that,even if a portion of the morgan stanley ira was community property,there was insufficient evidence that she had mismanaged any community funds or breached any fiduciary duty owed husband.
statement of decision and judgment 
the trial court rejected wife argument that a separate property asset was not subject to a breach of fiduciary duty.it concluded that the broad language of family code section extended to the other party separate property because i t does make any sense that a spouse is prohibited by statute from squandering community property but not from steal ing separate property.this conclusion was essentially dicta,because the court found that the morgan stanley ira was a community asset,insofar as there was a commingling of community and separate property funds and an inability to trace the separate property contributions.as noted,the trial court further found that wife breached her duty in failing to advise husband of the depletion of the morgan stanley ira,and,pursuant to family code section,subdivision g awarded to husband the wife had withdrawn from the ira without his knowledge from through,the five years prior to the parties separation.
wife contention on appeal 
on appeal,wife reiterates her argument that the morgan stanley ira was husband separate property and her management and control thereof was not subject to a breach of fiduciary duty under family code sections and.however,the factual and legal premises of her appellate argument differ from her trial court rationale.
at trial wife argument was premised on the entire morgan stanley ira being husband separate property.
on appeal,wife accepts that a portion of the morgan stanley ira was community property,but argues that the community property portion was exhausted prior to to pay community debts.therefore,she argues,the that the court found she had withdrawn from the ira without husband knowledge during the five years prior to the parties separation,from through,was husband separate property.specifically,she asserts the community had a percent interest in the morgan stanley ira when it was created at the time of husband retirement hence,in the community property portion of the morgan stanley ira was worth and husband separate property portion was worth because the trial court found the morgan stanley ira was depleted by in the five years prior to the parties november separation,the ira was depleted by between february and november it was undisputed that wife used all funds she withdrew from the morgan stanley ira between husband february retirement and the parties november separation to pay community debts the law presumes community debts are paid first with community funds,and,after community funds are exhausted,with separate funds therefore,the of community funds were necessarily depleted from the morgan stanley ira before november,and the that the trial court ascribed to wife as a breach of her fiduciary duty was husband separate property,because this sum represented withdrawals from the morgan stanley ira made after november.
we reject wife argument that she can not be liable for breach of fiduciary duty because the she withdrew from the morgan stanley ira without husband knowledge was husband separate property.first,the trial court found that the entire morgan stanley ira was community property because of the commingling of community and separate funds and the inability to trace the separate contributions.wife has not specifically challenged this finding on appeal.the most fundamental rule of appellate review is that a judgment is presumed correct,and the appealing party must affirmatively show error.denham superior court cal d.an issue not raised is deemed waived.reyes kosha th,fn,d stoll shuff th,fn,d.wife assertion on appeal that family code sections and do not apply to breaches of fiduciary duty regarding separate property necessarily rests on a finding that the morgan stanley ira was,at least in part,separate property.because wife has not affirmatively shown that the court erred in concluding the entire morgan stanley ira was community property,she may be deemed to have waived the issue of whether the court characterization was correct.thus,any argument concerning whether there can be a breach of fiduciary duty in conjunction with separate property may be deemed moot.
second,even if we assume that wife is impliedly arguing the trial court erred in characterizing the entire morgan stanley ira as a community asset,we reject her argument.our assumption is based on her appellate explanations of the separate and community values of the morgan stanley ira at the time of husband retirement and that the community portion of the ira was exhausted in satisfying community debts prior to.as a rule,parties are precluded from urging on appeal any points that were not raised before the trial court.in re riva d.to permit a party to raise a new theory is both unfair to the trial court and unjust to the opposing litigant.sierra club,california coastal com.d.wife appellate theory of why the is husband separate property is based on her apparently newly devised formula for calculating the separate and community values of the morgan stanley ira in and her assertion that the community value was completely expended as of in paying community debts.husband did not have an opportunity at trial to challenge the factual or legal bases for her calculations or assertions,nor did the trial court have the opportunity to evaluate those facts or apply them to the applicable rules governing characterization and division of marital property.
finally,like the trial court,we deem wife assertion that a spouse can not be subject to statutory breach of fiduciary duty for mismanagement of separate property to be contrary both to sound public policy and to the language of family code section,subdivision b which speaks of the confidential relationship between husband and wife imposing on them the duty of highest good faith and fair dealing and not taking unfair advantage of the other.we can fathom no reason to distinguish between a spouse duty to deal fairly and in good faith with separate property and her duty to deal fairly and in good faith with community property.
duty to disclose 
the fundamental reason the court found wife breached her fiduciary duty was not simply that she made withdrawals from the morgan stanley ira.it was her failure,as the family bookkeeper responsible for the parties financial affairs,to inform husband that the morgan stanley ira was shrinking significantly each year as a result of these withdrawals and that the withdrawals had tax consequences.wife contends she can not be liable for breach of fiduciary duty for this reason because she had no duty to disclose the amount of funds in the morgan stanley ira to husband absent his request.
resolution of the question of whether wife,under the facts of this case,can be liable for failure to disclose requires an examination of the history of family code sections and,subdivision e.
original family code section 
family code section was enacted in.stats,ch.assem.bill.family code section,subdivision b provided that the confidential relationship of spouses is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners as provided in sections,and of the corporations code,including the following 
providing each spouse access at all times to any books kept regarding a transaction for the purposes of inspection and copying 
rendering upon request true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which affects the community property 
accounting to the spouse,and holding as a trustee,any benefit or profit derived from any transaction by one spouse without the consent of the other spouse,which concerns the community property,subd.b.
in,when family code section was enacted,corporations code section stated the partnership books shall be kept,subject to any agreement between the partners,at the principal place of business of the partnership,and every partner shall at all times have access to and may inspect and copy any of them.this right of access to books was expressed in subdivision b of family code section.
corporations code section stated partners shall render on demand true and full information of all things affecting the partnership to any partner or the legal representative of any deceased partner or partner under legal disability.this right to full disclosure was expressed in subdivision b of family code section.
corporations code section stated every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit,and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation,conduct,or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of this property.this section applies also to the representatives of a deceased partner engaged in the liquidation of the affairs of the partnership as the personal representatives of the surviving partner.this section was expressed in subdivision b of family code section.
corporations code section stated any partner shall have the right to a formal account as to partnership affairs a if he is wrongfully excluded from the partnership business or possession of its property by his copartners b if the right exists under the terms of any agreement c as provided by section d whenever other circumstances render it just and reasonable.family code section,subdivision b did not specifically enumerate a right to an accounting.
ii.family code section,subdivision e 
family code section,subdivision e was enacted in the same statute as family code section,subdivision b.stats,ch.assem.bill.it states each spouse shall act with respect to the other spouse in the management and control of the community assets and liabilities in accordance with the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons having relationships of personal confidence as specified in section,until such time as the assets and liabilities have been divided by the parties or by a court.this duty includes the obligation to make full disclosure to the other spouse of all material facts and information regarding the existence,characterization,and valuation of all assets in which the community has or may have an interest and debts for which the community is or may be liable,and to provide equal access to all information,records,and books that pertain to the value and character of those assets and debts,upon request.
the placement of the phrase upon request creates an ambiguity in the last sentence of family code section,subdivision e.it may reasonably be read as referring to both the requirement to make full disclosure to the other spouse of all material facts,and the requirement to provide equal access to all information,records,and books.it may also reasonably be read as referring only to the latter requirement to provide access to books.
the court task in construing a statute is,of course,to ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the purpose of the statute.renee superior court cal th,d.to that end,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.ibid.because family code section,subdivision e specifically incorporates the scope of spousal fiduciary duty set forth in the simultaneously enacted family code section,and section required a spouse to render true and full information upon request,the phrase upon request in family code section,subdivision e is most logically construed as applying to both articulated duties in subdivision e full disclosure of all material facts regarding the valuation of community assets and providing access to all records pertaining to those values.
we find further support for this construction from the punctuation in family code section,subdivision e.the last antecedent rule is a rule of statutory construction that provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.renee,supra,cal th at,d,quoting white county of sacramento cal d.however,evidence that a qualifying phrase is intended to apply to all antecedents,not only the immediately preceding one,may be found when a comma separates the antecedents and the qualifying phrase.white,supra,at.here,the phrase upon request is set off from the preceding antecedent duties by a comma.
given these rules of statutory construction,we conclude that when the legislature enacted family code sections and,subdivision e as part of the same statute,it intended that the duty to make full disclosure and the duty to provide equal access both turned on a request by the other spouse.
iii.revision of corporations code 
in,effective january,the sections of the corporations code that included the uniform partnership act upa,including the four sections enumerated in family code section,subdivision b,were repealed and replaced with the revised uniform partnership act rupa.stats,ch.assem.bill.the essence of former corporations code sections,and is now in corporations code sections and,but the language of the new sections is considerably broader.
pertinent to this appeal,corporations code section,entitled books and records right of access states,in relevant part 
a a partnership shall keep its books and records,if any at its chief executive office.
b a partnership shall provide partners and their agents and attorneys access to its books and records.it shall provide former partners and their agents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the period during which they were partners 
c each partner shall furnish to a partner,and to the legal representative of a deceased partner or partner under legal disability,both of the following 
without demand,any information concerning the partnership business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partners rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter,and 
on demand,any other information concerning the partnership business and affairs,except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.italics added.
while former corporations code section only required partners to render information of all things affecting the partnership on demand,the statute now requires partners to furnish certain essential information to each other even if they do not demand it 
family code section was not simultaneously amended in to renumber its references to the corporations code sections so that they reflected these newly enacted sections of the corporations code.
iv.in re marriage of duffy 
in in re marriage of duffy th,d,the couple had a lengthy marriage,during which the husband made various investments and gave the wife varying levels of information regarding the investments.one investment was a brokerage ira account containing nine stocks worth in february.id.at,d.on the suggestion of his broker,the husband invested the ira account in a single company.ibid.in may the value of the ira account had fallen to.ibid.there was some expert testimony that the ira investments were risky,and if they had been invested in a more conservative manner,the yield would have been higher.id.at,d.the trial court found the husband breached his fiduciary duty of full disclosure and awarded the wife damages of.id.at,d.
the appellate court reversed.it first concluded there was no evidence that the wife sought,and the husband failed or refused to provide,information about the ira account.duffy,supra,th at,d.therefore,duffy concluded there was no support for the trial court finding that the husband breached his fiduciary duty of full disclosure upon request,as set forth in family code sections,subdivision b and,subdivision e.id.at,d.
duffy then discussed whether the finding of breach could be upheld on the ground the husband breached some fiduciary duty other than the specified statutory duty of full disclosure upon request.duffy,supra,th at,d.it examined the legislative history of family code section,and concluded that by narrowing the scope of the fiduciary duty to the three specifically enumerated in family code section,subdivision b,and,the legislature removed a duty of care.duffy based this conclusion on the fact the legislature used only the word including before subdivisions b,and,instead of the phrase including,but not limited to those three enumerated.duffy,supra,at,d.by limiting the rights to those enumerated,and echoed by specific corporations code provisions,the legislature eliminated the possibility that family code section subdivision b could be interpreted expansively to include the duty of care a nonmarital partner owes another nonmarital partner,as set forth in corporations code section.in other words,by including certain corporations code provisions while eliminating the expansive words,but not limited to,the legislature necessarily excluded all other provisions of the specified corporations code sections.duffy,supra,at,d.
duffy reference to corporations code section in conjunction with its discussion of family code section,subdivision b is,strictly speaking,inexact.when family code section,subdivision b was enacted in,corporations code section did not yet exist.duffy reference to corporations code section reasonably assumed that the legislature would be amending family code section,subdivision b to substitute corporations code sections and,enacted in,for the simultaneously repealed corporations code sections,and that were enumerated in family code section,subdivision b.however,duffy did not compare the changes in language between the repealed corporations code sections and their replacement sections.
amendments to family code section 
in,effective january,family code section was amended with the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to clarify that section of the family code provides that the fiduciary relationship between spouses includes all of the same rights and duties in the management of community property as the rights and duties of unmarried business partners managing partnership property,as provided in sections,and of the corporations code,and to abrogate the ruling in in re marriage of duffy th d,to the extent the duffy ruling conflict s with this clarification.stats,ch.bill.
as amended,family code section states,in pertinent part 
b this confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners,as provided in sections,and of the corporations code,including,but not limited to,the following 
providing each spouse access at all times to any books kept regarding a transaction for the purposes of inspection and copying.
rendering upon request,true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property 
family code section,subdivision e has not been amended since its enactment in.because it adopts from family code section the scope of spousal fiduciary duty vis a vis community personal property,as of january,it necessarily adopts the amended section.
vi.retroactive effect of amended family code section 
critical to the resolution of this case is whether amended family code section,is retroactive,insofar as the parties separated in november,before the amended statute took effect on january.
a statute is retroactive if it affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions and conditions performed or existing prior to adoption of the statute and substantially changes the legal effect of those past events.citations.in re marriage of reuling th,d.there is a strong presumption that statutes are to operate prospectively,absent evidence the legislature intended them to be applied retroactively.kizer hanna cal d.this presumption applies particularly to laws creating new obligations,imposing new duties,or exacting new penalties because of past transactions.citations.reuling,supra,at,d.
by contrast,a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively,even if applied to transactions predating its enactment,because the true meaning of the statute remains the same.in re marriage of mcclellan th,d.a clarified law is simply a statement of what the law has always been.ibid.however,while the court may give due consideration to the legislature views,a legislative declaration of an existing statute meaning is neither binding nor conclusive on the courts in construing the statute.ibid.a court can not accept the legislature statement that an unmistakable change in the statute is nothing more than a clarification and restatement of the statute original terms.id.at,d.legislative history may be used to assist the court inquiry,but ultimately the court must determine whether an amendment changed or merely clarified existing law.ibid.
the final legislative bill analysis to senate bill,the bill enacted as chapter to amend family code section effective january,states the effect of this bill hinges on just four little words but not limited to.the duffy court found that the legislature failure to include these words in family code section meant that a spouse duties were in fact limited to those enumerated in that section,subdivision b.this bill adds but not limited to to clarify what the sponsor believes was the original intent of family code section to apply to spouses all fiduciary duties existing between nonmarital business partners under corporations code sections,and.these are duties such as to access to books and records fiduciary duties including the duty of loyalty,the duty of care,and an obligation of good faith and fair dealing and requirements to the transfer of a partner transferable interest in a partnership.applying all such duties appears to be in line both with the true intent of the legislature in enacting family code section com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
as to the renumbered sections of the corporations code incorporated into the amended family code section,subdivision b,the final analysis and the several preceding analyses state only that corporations code sections,and have been repealed and that senate bill updates the references to refer to corporations code sections,and,the comparable sections included in the current,renumbered version of the uniform partnership act.com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.none of the legislative analyses of the bill to amend family code,subdivision b contains any discussion of the differences in language between the repealed corporations code sections and the replacement sections that took effect january,six years before the amended family code section took effect.
given the comments in the legislative analyses,the specifically stated intent included in the statute itself stats,ch,and the legislature swift reaction to duffy see in re marriage of mcclellan,supra,th at,d,we conclude the legislature perceived the amendments to family code section,subdivision b as only a clarification of the law.
however,a close reading of the corporations code sections enumerated in the originally enacted family code section and the different corporations code sections enumerated in the amended family code section demonstrate that the legislature,notwithstanding its stated intention to clarify,was doing more than simply reiterating the existing state of the law.the corporations code sections that the original family code section incorporated to define the rights and duties of the spousal fiduciary relationship required only that partners provide each other on demand all information of all things affecting the partnership.former.by contrast,the corporations code sections enacted in,which the amendment to family code section employs to define these rights and duties,impose a duty on partners to furnish each other without demand any information concerning the partnership business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner rights and duties,subd.c.
a statute that creates a new obligation by imposing,for the first time,a specific requirement that a spouse convey certain information about the partnership,community affairs,even if the other spouse has not requested this information,constitutes more than a simple clarification of existing law.it provides an unavoidable implication that the legislature intended to change it.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.we conclude therefore that the amendment to family code section,which based the scope of spousal fiduciary duty on duties that did not exist prior to the amendment,makes family code section retroactive,to the extent that corporations code sections,and impose greater duties on partners than did former corporations code sections,and.
vii.punitive effect of retroactive application to the present case 
it is particularly compelling to the facts of this case that amended family code section,subdivision b and,by extension,section,subdivision e which applies the broad spousal fiduciary duty of section specifically to the fiduciary duty regarding community personal property,should not be applied retroactively.
it is undisputed that at all times during their marriage husband had access to the morgan stanley ira statements and the ira checking account.wife did not hide these documents.there is no evidence that husband ever asked wife for information regarding the morgan stanley ira,or that he did so inquire and she misrepresented its financial status,or that she used the morgan stanley ira funds only to her advantage and patently to husband disadvantage.indeed,the evidence is that wife used the funds for community purposes,such as trips,taxes,and household expenses.there is no evidence that she used them,for example,to support any clandestine behavior.there is no evidence husband was prevented from inquiring about the ira documents due to a mental or physical disability.nor can husband be deemed naïve about financial matters generally.he had owned an insurance agency,had a brokerage account for years before he retired,was familiar with the concept that mutual funds allow for diversification so as to reduce investment risk,and had purchased,sold,and refinanced real property.
as a recognized authority on the subject of retroactive and prospective application of statutes has stated r etroactive laws are characterized by want of notice and lack of knowledge of past conditions and they disturb feelings of security in past transactions.sutherland ed.statutory construction.to penalize wife now for breach of a statutory spousal duty that did not exist during the parties marriage would disrupt the repose that should follow the actions she undertook in accordance with the established customs and practices of their marriage and which were intended to serve their marital community,not her personally.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed to the extent it awards husband,representing withdrawals from the morgan stanley ira from to and attendant tax penalties.in all other respects,the judgment is affirmed.the parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
the ira was set up with the dean witter brokerage firm,which later merged into morgan stanley.
this figure is taken from husband exhibit,the annual ira checking account statements from.the sum of all distributions from the morgan stanley ira to the ira checking account for those five years equals.
family code section,subdivision g provides that remedies for breach of fiduciary duty shall include an award to the other spouse of percent of any asset transferred in breach of fiduciary duty.
husband moved to dismiss the appeal and for imposition of sanctions against wife and her attorney on the grounds wife was in contempt of the judgment when she filed her notice of appeal because she had failed to make monthly spousal support payments,to pay attorney fees,and to convey to husband her community interest in an unimproved lot,all of which were ordered by the january,judgment.he also argues she waived her right to appeal when she accepted the benefit of the january,judgment,after she noticed her appeal.specifically,he argues,the judgment ordered husband to make an equalizing payment to her,he had done so,and she had cashed the check.he seeks sanctions,in the form of attorney fees,for having to respond to a warrantless deferred ruling on husband motion until we addressed the merits of the appeal.we now deny the motion.as to the contempt allegation supporting his motion,on december,the trial court found wife was not in contempt for nonpayment or to the receiving benefits basis of husband motion,the trial court calculated the equalization payment based on its valuation of the middletown house and the sum charged to wife as a result of breaching her fiduciary duty in depleting the morgan stanley ira.as claims of error on appeal,wife asserts the court should have assigned a greater value to the house and should not have found that she breached her fiduciary duty.thus,should she prevail on appeal,she would be entitled to a greater equalizing payment.should she not prevail,she remains entitled to the equalizing payment she received.when a judgment clearly establishes the appellant right to recover,but the amount is less than she sought,she may accept the judgment and nevertheless appeal to claim the larger recovery.in re marriage of fonstein cal d.because we deny the motion to dismiss,we also deny the request for sanctions as moot.
footnote.see footnote,ante.
the record contains no documentary evidence regarding the value of the morgan stanley ira at any time pertinent to these proceedings,in when it was established,in november when the parties separated,or anytime in the interim.evidence of its value in and november is from husband testimony.wife does not challenge these figures on appeal.
as discussed more fully,post,family code section,subdivision b provides generally that spouses are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships that control the actions of persons who occupy confidential relations with each other.section,subdivision e provides generally that spouses shall act with respect to each other according to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships in the management and control of the community assets and liabilities.
wife calculates the percent figure from the following facts husband began contributing to the keogh retirement fund in.the parties married in august,and husband continued to contribute to the fund for another sic years to his retirement on february.seven and the number of years husband contributions to the fund came from community funds is approximately percent of the total number of years husband contributed to the fund.
this step in wife calculation would have the morgan stanley ira depleted completely.it overlooks the fact that,as husband testified and wife accepts on appeal,the morgan stanley ira was worth to when the parties separated in november.
former section was not replaced in the new sections of corporations code.
corporations code section,entitled fiduciary duties,states a the fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in subdivisions b and c.b a partner duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners includes all of the following to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property,profit,or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property or information,including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity.to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership.to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership.c a partner duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct,intentional misconduct,or a knowing violation of law.d a partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.e a partner does not violate a duty or ob
