joanna laxton appeals from the district court order granting gap,judgment as a matter of law in this case brought under the pregnancy discrimination act.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand.
background 
drawing all inferences in favor of the party,as we must when reviewing the grant of judgment as a matter of law,the factual background of this lawsuit is as follows.in march,gap recruited laxton,the general manager of a stein mart department store in tyler,texas,to become the general manager of an old navy store that gap intended to open in tyler.laxton had worked for for eight years,climbing the management ranks and helping to open a super center in henderson,texas.she then became an assistant manager for stein mart and was soon promoted to general manager.at first,laxton declined gap offer,but gap persisted.only after gap offered her plus bonuses more than she made at stein laxton accept.two stein mart employees followed her to the new old navy store to become assistant managers.
after accepting the offer but before starting work,laxton,aged at the time,learned that she was pregnant.on her first day of work,march,she informed lisa haverstick,gap regional assistant manager,of her pregnancy.she informed her direct supervisor,karen jones,of her pregnancy on june.that was the first real time laxton was able to sit down with jones and talk to her.it was also the day before the old navy store was due to open.specifically,laxton informed jones that she was pregnant and was due around thanksgiving.laxton did not discuss with jones her plans for maternity leave.she had not yet thought through the issue and was not yet familiar with gap maternity leave policy.jones became visibly angry.laxton testified that jones did appreciate the fact,i guess,that she was going to have to have someone come in during the holidays and fill in for me.jones said,you realize this means that i have to pull other management out of other stores to cover your store,when,basically,you know,this store should have been taken care of.what management do you think we supposed to use after this conversation,jones was usually unpleasant toward laxton.
under laxton management,the store timely opened on june.by all accounts,the store earned strong revenues.it won a national tech vest sales contest,and laxton received monthly bonuses of over.
on july,the mall notified laxton that it needed to cut power to her store between and.the store usually closed at,after which time employees served the customers that remained in the store,closed all the registers,counted the money,and opened a back door to receive deliveries.laxton feared that problems could arise if the store power was cut while her employees were counting money because the back door would be open for deliveries and the alarm system would be dead.she called jones to ask for permission to close the store minutes early.jones told laxton to keep the store open.laxton decided to close the store early anyway.for this incident,jones gave laxton a written warning,the first strike in gap out policy.
on july,jones and carla dotto,an employee at gap corporate headquarters,told laxton that a final written warning strike on its way.mary carr,the zone human resource manager,also played a significant role in preparing this warning.in the final written warning,gap charged laxton with four violations of company policies and procedures exiting the store by the back door displaying unacceptable behavior toward an employee,kerri vallery,over the store system neglecting to inform the regional office that she had taken a sick day and hiring a bank robber.the supervisors did not discuss these charges with laxton in the july conversation.rather,laxton learned of the nature of the charges only when she received a copy of the final written warning by fax on saturday,august,which was a day off for her.the warning alarmed and frightened her,and she suspected that she was the target of pregnancy discrimination.she believed that the asserted violations were false,and that she had been able to air her side of the story to anyone.
as to the allegation that she exited the store by the back door,laxton testified that once she learned that this was a violation of store policy,she never did so again.as to the incident,laxton testified that vallery had disobeyed her orders about where to place sales associates on the floor of the store.as to the sick day,laxton testified that she called in to report the sick day,did not reach anyone,and did not leave a message because she intended to talk with headquarters again soon anyway.when she discovered that her hours for the week had been entered improperly,she made efforts to correct them.regardless,laxton,despite her pregnancy,was working over hours a week while being paid on a salary based on hours per week,and gap produced no records indicating a problem with laxton overall attendance at work.finally,laxton testified that she never hired a bank robber.vallery recommended that laxton invite the job applicant to an orientation session.before the orientation session,laxton was amazed to discover through a conversation with her husband that the applicant was rumored to have robbed a bank.as soon as she discovered the problem,the applicant withdrew his application himself.at no time was the bank robber on gap payroll.
before laxton received the final written warning on august,laxton supervisors sent peg inglis,a zone trainer,to laxton store for a visit on august.based on conversations with three of the store four assistant managers,inglis reported that the store suffered from low employee morale.inglis also reported violations of store policy,including exceeding the discretionary spending limit by paying for pizza for employees asking two employees to wear unpurchased old navy tech vests during a sales promotion and failing to permit employees to take lunch breaks.inglis report indicates that termination was on gap mind,for she wrote that if laxton stays in position inglis spoke with laxton during the store visit,but she did not raise with laxton the issues of employee morale or the asserted violations of store policy.instead,inglis inquired as to laxton plans for maternity leave.
at trial,laxton provided explanations for the three violations cited by inglis she bought the pizza for employees during a busy and profitable tax free weekend after jones had directed her to do whatever it takes to make the weekend a success she directed two employees to wear tech vests during a nationwide tech vest sales contest that laxton store won and,relatedly,gap had sent down a directive to have employees wear unpurchased backpacks to increase backpack sales and laxton explained that the breaks were not recorded properly because the store automated punch clock system was broken and employees were too busy with tax free weekend to fill out time sheets manually.
laxton had previously scheduled a vacation day for monday,august,the first business day for gap after laxton received the final written warning.gap has a zero tolerance policy against discrimination,instructing employees to call a human resources representative with concerns.gap also makes a telephone line available for anonymous reports.on august,laxton called chazz pono,her human resources representative,to discuss her suspicion that she was the target of pregnancy discrimination.the record reflects that pono took no action.
on august,carlos licona,a gap auditor,arrived at laxton store unannounced.licona testified that he was not aware of laxton issues before his store visit.inglis report,however,indicated that the report would be forwarded to licona.licona discovered the same violations of store policy that inglis had pizza money,the tech vests,and the lunch breaks.like inglis,licona did not discuss the violations with laxton.he instead called carr,who,together with dotto,directed licona to terminate her.this was the first time that licona,a store auditor,had ever been asked to fire an employee.gap replaced laxton with a male.
laxton filed suit in federal district court on october,charging gap with violating title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended by the pregnancy discrimination act of the pda,et.the district court conducted a jury trial beginning on november.at the close of laxton case,gap moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied gap motion.the jury returned a verdict in favor of laxton,awarding in back pay,in front pay,in mental anguish,and in punitive damages.gap timely filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and an alternative,conditional motion for new trial or remittitur.the district court granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of liability and did not reach the issue of damages.the district court also granted the conditional motion for a new trial and did not reach the issue of remittitur.laxton timely appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.see wallace methodist hospital system,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.this occurs when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict.wallace,at quoting rubinstein adm rs of the tulane educ.fund,cir see also boeing shipman,cir.as we review the record,we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.russell mckinney hospital venture,cir quoting reeves sanderson plumbing,d.we must disregard evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.see id.the court gives credence to evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached if that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.see wallace,at.finally,more than a mere scintilla of evidence is required to render the grant of judgment as a matter of law inappropriate.see id.
iii.analytical framework 
title vii makes it unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.as amended by the first clause of the pda,title vii defines the term because of sex as including,but not limited to,because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions.k.the second clause of the pda further provides that women affected by pregnancy,childbirth,or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all purposes,including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs,as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.id.the supreme court has held that the first clause of the pda is not limited by the specific language in the second clause.california fed.sav.and loan ass guerra,d newport news shipbuilding and dry dock company eeoc,d.congress intended the pda to provide relief for working women and to end discrimination against pregnant workers.see guerra,at.at.the pda does not,however,protect a pregnant employee from being discharged for being absent from work even if her absence is due to pregnancy or to complications of pregnancy,unless the absences of nonpregnant employees are overlooked.stout baxter healthcare,cir quoting dormeyer comerica,cir see also wallace,at noting that the pda requires an employer to ignore an employee pregnancy,but not her absence from work,unless the employer overlooks comparable absences of employees.
a claim brought under the pda is analyzed like any other title vii discrimination claim.urbano continental airlines,cir.title vii discrimination can be established through either direct or circumstantial evidence.see wallace,at.laxton case is built on the latter,which means that it is analyzed under the familiar mcdonnell douglas framework.mcdonnell douglas green,d.under this framework,the plaintiff must first create a presumption of discrimination by making out a prima facie case of discrimination.see wallace,at.the burden then shifts to the employer to produce a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for her termination.see id.this causes the presumption of discrimination to dissipate.see id.the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer intentionally discriminated against her because of her protected status.see id.
to carry this burden,the plaintiff must produce substantial evidence indicating that the proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination.see reeves,at.at.the plaintiff must rebut each nondiscriminatory reason articulated by the employer.wallace,at.a plaintiff may establish pretext either through evidence of disparate treatment or by showing that the employer proffered explanation is false or unworthy of credence.reeves,at.at.an explanation is false or unworthy of credence if it is not the real reason for the adverse employment action.see sandstad cb richard ellis,cir.evidence demonstrating that the employer explanation is false or unworthy of credence,taken together with the plaintiff prima facie case,is likely to support an inference of discrimination even without further evidence of defendant true motive.id.at russell,at.no further evidence of discriminatory animus is required because once the employer justification has been eliminated,discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation reeves,at.at.the rare instances in which a showing of pretext is insufficient to establish discrimination are when the record conclusively reveals some other,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer decision,or when the plaintiff creates only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer reason was untrue,and there was abundant and uncontroverted evidence that no discrimination occurred.see russell,at citing reeves,at.at rubinstein,at.a decision as to whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate ultimately turns on the strength of the plaintiff prima facie case,the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,and any other evidence that supports the employer case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.wallace,at quoting reeves,at.at.
iv.application of the analytical framework 
the parties do not dispute on appeal that laxton made out a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination instead,the parties dispute whether laxton produced substantial evidence of pretext.evidence is substantial if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.long eastfield college,cir quoting boeing,at.
proffered legitimate reason for discharge 
gap proffers that laxton repeatedly violated store policy and alienated those who worked for her,the cumulative effect of which justified her termination.appellee brief,at.the conduct occurred over a period from july,to august.first,gap cites the incident that took place on july.second,gap cites the violations listed in the final written back door exit,the incident,the sick day,and the bank robber.third,gap cites the complaints of assistant managers,primarily those reported by inglis.fourth,and finally,gap cites the alleged violations of store policy identified by inglis and pizza money,tech vests,and lunch breaks.gap asserts that laxton multiple violations were too much,too soon.id.at.
evidence of pretext 
turning to laxton showing of pretext,we begin by defining the contours of our inquiry.our inquiry is whether gap perception of laxton performance,accurate or not,was the real reason for her termination.evans city of houston,cir quoting shackelford deloitte touche,llp,cir.it is not whether gap proffered reason was an incorrect reason for her discharge.sandstad,at.our concern is whether the evidence supports an inference that gap intentionally discriminated against laxton,an inference that can be drawn if its proffered reason was not the real reason for discharge.therefore,to survive gap motion for judgment as a matter of law,laxton must produce evidence permitting the jury to disbelieve that gap proffered reason was its true motivation.the factfinder disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity may,together with the elements of the prima facie case,suffice to show intentional discrimination.reeves,at.at quoting mary honor ctr.hicks,d.
laxton rebuts gap proffered justification for her discharge with evidence that it is false or unworthy of credence.wallace,at.she concedes that certain violations of store policy took place.she admits to closing the store early although she testified that doing so was justified and to exiting out the back door although she testified that when she did so she did not know this violated store policy.gap,however,did not terminate her for these violations.it proffers that it terminated laxton for the cumulative effect of many violations,and laxton casts doubt on this proffered justification in two ways.first,she brings evidence challenging the substance of violations,evidence demonstrating their falsity.second,she brings other evidence that undermines the overall credibility of gap proffered justification.
first,laxton rebuts the substance of violations asserted by gap,including the allegation that laxton hired a bank robber.laxton invited the applicant to an orientation on the recommendation of vallery.before the session,however,laxton was amazed to learn through her own inquiry that the applicant was rumored to have robbed a bank.the applicant subsequently withdrew his application and was never on gap payroll.
a second charge that the jury could have reasonably found to be false is that of employee complaints.jones testified that she made multiple calls to assistant managers and that employees lodged numerous complaints against laxton.yet gap produced no contemporaneous written documentation of any employee complaints,despite testimony that the corporation abides by rigorous policies.gap did not even produce written documentation of the incident referred to in the final written warning.further,even assuming that there were complaints such as those reported by inglis,laxton testified that a good,strong manager will draw employee complaints.the incident presents a perfect example.on that occasion,vallery allegedly lodged a complaint against laxton after being rebuked over the store system for attempting to override laxton decision as to where to place sales employees on the floor.notably,jones,who gave laxton a written warning for not following orders when laxton closed the store early,gave laxton a final written warning for disciplining an assistant manager for not following her orders.the jury may well have construed laxton rebuke of the assistant manager to be appropriate.moreover,laxton ability to manage employees is corroborated by the fact that two employees followed laxton from stein mart to gap.
laxton challenges the tech vest violation and the pizza money violation on the grounds that they involved conduct that gap authorized and that is so trivial as to be unworthy of credence.gap directed laxton to have employees wear unpurchased backpacks to increase backpack sales,but then cited laxton for directing two employees to wear unpurchased tech vests during a tech vest sales contest in which her store placed first in the nation.additionally,in preparation for tax free weekend,jones directed laxton to do whatever it takes.laxton therefore exceeded her discretionary spending authority by a minimal amount by spending on pizza for employees.the jury could have inferred,as did laxton,that jones authorized this spending.
the jury could have also reasonably concluded that laxton made an adequate effort to report her sick day.she testified that she called a supervisor that day,but that when nobody answered she did not leave a message.she testified that she attempted to correct her hours after she learned that they had been improperly entered.finally,the jury could have reasonably concluded that laxton permitted employees to take lunch breaks.laxton testified that her employees took breaks but that the breaks were not recorded properly because the store automated punch clock system was broken and employees were too busy with tax free weekend to fill out time sheets manually.further undermining this allegation is that the employees allegedly did not take lunch breaks over tax free weekend,which was the same weekend that laxton purchased pizza for lunch.
second,in addition to her attack on the substance of these violations,laxton brings evidence that undermines the credibility of gap proffered justification for her discharge.the evidence indicates that if gap were genuinely concerned about laxton asserted problems,it would have permitted laxton the opportunity to explain or to improve her conduct,but it did not do so.jones testified to the common sense notion that,from a business standpoint,it makes sense to try to utilize corrective action with an general manager before firing her.yet,as the alleged violations of store policy occurred,laxton supervisors,including jones,carr and dotto,did not discuss them with her.supervisors discussed only a single employee complaint with arguably justified incident.notably,no supervisor ever discussed with laxton the problem of lunch breaks,which carr testified was of particular concern to the company.laxton did not even receive a copy of the final written warning until saturday,august,just one working day before her discharge.perhaps most telling in this regard was inglis store visit.during the visit,inglis failed to discuss with laxton the serious problems of employee morale that she discovered.instead,inglis discussed laxton plans for maternity leave.
only six weeks elapsed between laxton first written warning and her termination,and during that time her supervisors never gave her the chance to explain her conduct or improve it.had gap bothered to do so,progress might have been made.for example,as soon as laxton learned that exiting by the back door violated store policy,she did not do so again 
further,the jury may have determined that gap witnesses lacked credibility.the record indicates that jones may have come across as a difficult witness and that licona was not credible.licona testified that he did not know that laxton was pregnant on the day that he terminated her.on that day,laxton was visibly pregnant,as a contemporaneous photograph confirms.licona also identified handwriting on his store visit log as that of laxton,from which the jury could have inferred that laxton was on notice of the violations that he found.laxton,however,denied that it was her handwriting,and her testimony was corroborated by that of an assistant manager who testified that it was her handwriting and not laxton.finally,licona testified that he did not see a copy of inglis report before he visited laxton store.the jury may have reasonably inferred that he had seen a copy because the report indicated that a copy should be forwarded to him and because he identified the exact violations of store policy that inglis cited in the report.
upon consideration of all of the evidence,the jury may have reasonably concluded that jones,carr and dotto solicited and exaggerated complaints from laxton assistant managers,issued a written warning and a final written warning,and dispatched inglis and licona for store visits in an effort to compile a laundry list of violations to justify a predetermined decision to terminate laxton.this would explain why gap asserted some violations that are false and others that involved conduct that was arguably authorized.it would also explain why gap,a company whose goal is to earn a profit,took issue with conduct like the tech vests and the pizza money that helped it to achieve its overarching goal.it would also explain inglis revealing statement in her report that if laxton remains in position finally,it would explain why gap rushed to fax laxton a copy of the final written warning on saturday,august,which was a day off for laxton.the jury may have inferred that gap wanted laxton to have the warning in hand before licona store visit on august,because gap knew that it was going to terminate laxton on that day regardless of what violations licona discovered.
gap proffered justification becomes even less credible when viewed in light of the strength of laxton prima facie case.the factfinder may consider evidence establishing laxton prima facie case,as well as inferences properly drawn therefrom,in its determination of whether gap proffered explanation is pretextual.reeves,at.at.part of laxton prima facie case is that she was qualified for the position of general manager.before joining gap,she had a successful career in retail with and stein mart.when gap recruited laxton away from stein mart to open the new old navy store,laxton declined.only after gap offered her a considerable raise did laxton accept.laxton store opened on time and,under her direction,earned strong revenues.gap rewarded her with monthly bonuses of over.by,when she was fired,the store had already surpassed the month quota to qualify for a bonus.in short,the store had just opened,laxton was working more than hours a week,and she was instructed by her supervisors to do whatever it takes.if the store revenues are any indication,that is exactly what she was doing.it was a stressful but successful environment.yet,despite laxton qualifications as a general manager and despite her success in making the new old navy store profitable,gap proffers that it terminated her for a laundry list of questionable violations,virtually none of which gap bothered to discuss with her.conveniently,gap left itself just enough time to permit a new general manager to settle into the job before the busy holiday season.based on the evidence presented,the jury could have reasonably concluded that gap proffered reason for discharge was not its real reason.
additional evidence of discrimination 
although laxton showing of pretext is,under reeves,sufficient for her to survive gap motion for judgment as a matter of law,she supplements her case of discrimination with an oral statement of her supervisor,karen jones.when laxton informed jones that she was pregnant and was due around thanksgiving,jones became visibly angry.laxton testified that jones did appreciate the fact,i guess,that she was going to have to have someone come in during the holidays and fill in for me.jones said,you realize this means that i have to pull other management out of other stores to cover your store,when,basically,you know,this store should have been taken care of.what management do you think we supposed to use 
an oral statement exhibiting discriminatory animus may be used to demonstrate pretext or,as is the case here,it may be used as additional evidence of discrimination.russell,at.the remark must,first,demonstrate discriminatory animus and,second,be made by a person primarily responsible for the adverse employment action or by a person with influence or leverage over the formal decisionmaker see also sandstad,at.
as to the first inquiry,the jury is permitted to infer discriminatory animus from jones remark.in maldonado bank,cir,the plaintiff notified her employer that she was pregnant and that she was due to give birth during the busy summer months.her employer terminated her the next day.the employer proffered that it fired her not because she was pregnant,but because her absence would make her unavailable to work at a busy time.after noting that the pda permits an employer to fire a pregnant employee for excessive absenteeism,the seventh circuit held that the pda bars an employer from discharging an employee based on an unjustified presumption that the employee pregnancy will render her unable to fulfill her job expectations.the maldonado court held that an employer can not take anticipatory action unless it has a good faith basis,supported by sufficiently strong evidence,that the normal inconveniences of an employee pregnancy will require special treatment.maldonado,at see also troy bay state computer group,cir affirming jury verdict in favor of terminated pregnant employee where employer might have acted on unlawful,stereotypical speculation that pregnant women are poor attendees deneen northwest airlines,cir affirming jury verdict in favor of terminated pregnant employee where employer may have discriminatorily assumed the plaintiff was suffering a condition that would interfere with her job.when jones made her remark on june,she did not know what the impact of laxton pregnancy would be.not even laxton knew,as she really had given maternity leave a lot of thought because we were just trying to make it through getting the store opened.she was not yet familiar with gap maternity leave policy.it is reasonable to infer from jones negative reaction to the news of laxton pregnancy that she harbored a stereotypical presumption about laxton ability to fulfill job duties as a result of her pregnancy.gap reliance on wallace is,for in that case the employee supervisor expressed frustration with the employee third pregnancy,stating that i do know how to classify you because you were gone three months and you be gone three months again.wallace,at.by contrast,jones had no knowledge as to how long laxton would take maternity leave.discriminatory animus can be inferred from jones willingness to assume the worst.
as to the second inquiry,laxton produced sufficient evidence to enable the jury to conclude that jones influenced carr and dotto,the individuals principally responsible for the adverse employment action.courts do not blindly accept the titular decisionmaker as the true decisionmaker.russell,at.rather,the discriminatory animus of a manager can be imputed to the ultimate decisionmaker if the decisionmaker acted as a rubber stamp,or the cat paw,for the subordinate employee prejudice.id.citing shager upjohn,cir.the relevant inquiry is whether jones had influence or leverage over carr and dotto decisionmaking.id.at.jones issued laxton written warning.carr issued laxton final written warning,but carr testified that jones served as her primary source of information.gap makes the somewhat implausible assertion that carr and dotto did not rely on the two warnings when they decided to terminate laxton,but instead relied solely on the independent investigations of inglis and licona.this position is inconsistent with gap proffered justification for laxton discharge,namely,the cumulative effect of violations of company policy including those cited in the written warning and final written warning.the degree to which carr and dotto relied on the independent investigations is a question of fact for the jury.mato baldauf,cir.given that the written warning and the final written warning represent strikes one and two in gap out policy,the jury could have reasonably concluded that these warnings influenced carr and dotto decisionmaking.
gap reliance on wallace for the proposition that jones did not influence the final decisionmakers is,again.like jones,the declarant in wallace was the terminated employee direct supervisor.also like jones,the wallace declarant participated in the factfinding leading to the plaintiff termination.in both cases,the supervisors discriminatory animus arguably colored their factfinding.the final decisionmakers in wallace,however,did not rely on the wallace declarant factfinding to terminate the plaintiff because the plaintiff in that case freely admitted to the final decisionmakers that she committed the violation for which they fired her.wallace,at.here,by contrast,laxton never admitted to carr and dotto that she committed the violations charged in the final written warning.indeed,carr herself testified that she relied on jones for the facts underlying these violations.the jury could have therefore reasonably inferred that jones had influence or leverage over carr and dotto,such that it would have been proper for the jury to impute jones discriminatory animus to carr and dotto.russell,at.
d.more than a mere scintilla 
we find that the parties presented the jury with two competing versions of laxton terminati
