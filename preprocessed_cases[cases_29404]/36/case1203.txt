no person who has a criminal record,other than for a minor traffic violation,may be licensed or certified as a foster parent for placement of a child without an exemption from the director of the state department of social services.health.similarly,although the legislature has expressed its clear preference for the placement of a dependent child in the home of a relative or extended family member rather than a traditional foster home,when the juvenile court removes a child from the physical custody of his or her parents,the child may not be placed in the home of a relative or other person who is not a licensed or certified foster parent and who has a criminal record unless a criminal records exemption has been granted by the appropriate official in the county in which the dependency proceeding has been initiated.welf.
as an alternative to removing the child from the physical custody of his or her parent and placing the child in the system,section and california rules of court,rule b authorize the juvenile court at the disposition hearing to appoint a legal guardian if the parent has advised the court he or she does not wish to receive family maintenance or family reunification services and agrees to the guardianship and the court finds,after consideration of all of the evidence,including a review of the proposed guardian criminal history,that the guardianship is in the child best interests.
does the criminal records exemption requirement of section circumscribe the court discretion to appoint a legal guardian under section the answer to this question,evident in the language of both sections and,as well as the context of the statutory scheme of which they are part,is no.the two statutes are intended to address different situations.section is a placement statute.its objective is to protect children who have been placed in the system by evaluating prospective caregivers who are not licensed or certified foster parents by the same criteria imposed on prospective foster parents.section,in contrast,is a statute.it is dependent not on the child removal from the physical custody of his or her parents and the county approval of the placement of the child,but on the parent consent to the guardianship and the juvenile court determination that the proposed guardianship is in the child best interests.
in the instant case the juvenile court concluded it was prohibited by section from granting the mother request for appointment of a legal guardian for her daughter pursuant to section because the proposed guardian who had previously been appointed by the probate court as the legal guardian for another of her daughters had a prior criminal record and no exemption had been granted by the county.the court discretion to order a legal guardianship under section is not so limited.accordingly,we grant the mother petition for writ of mandate and direct the juvenile court to hold a new hearing on the guardianship request.
factual and procedural background 
summer was born in june with cocaine in her system.her mother rhonda also tested positive for cocaine.rhonda admitted to a social worker with the los angeles county department of children and family services department that she is a cocaine abuser she had used cocaine while she was pregnant with summer she is unable to care for summer her sister christie is the legal guardian of her daughter born in january and she and christie had planned prior to summer birth for christie to assume guardianship of summer after receiving this information,the department initiated an investigation of christie and placed a hospital hold on summer pending the results of that investigation.
on june,a department social worker visited christie home and confirmed that christie was legal guardian pursuant to an order of the probate court no dependency petition had ever been filed on behalf even though had apparently also been born with cocaine in her system christie home was clean and free of health hazards appeared to be healthy and well cared for and christie was ready and willing to assume guardianship over summer.however,because a preliminary criminal background check revealed christie had been convicted several times for theft and receipt of stolen property between and,the department refused to permit christie to take summer home from the hospital.
on june,the department filed a section petition alleging rhonda had used cocaine while pregnant and therefore had failed to protect summer,subd.b and her cocaine addiction prevents her from being able to provide adequate care.ibid.the petition also alleged that rhonda substance abuse had led her to abuse or neglect nine of summer siblings all of whom,with the exception of,either are currently or were at one time the subject of dependency proceedings and that there is a substantial risk she will abuse or neglect summer as well,subd.j.finding a prima facie case for detention had been established,the juvenile court ordered summer detained upon her release from the hospital and set a pretrial resolution conference prc for july.
rhonda and christie appeared at the prc on july.the court continued the matter to july,and ordered the department to address the issue of termination of jurisdiction with a guardianship in place.on july,the court continued the prc to july,to allow the department to investigate the circumstances of christie prior convictions and determine whether the county would grant christie an exemption under section.the matter was continued several more times for this purpose and to allow the department to prepare a preadjudication social study.
on august,the court set a contested adjudication hearing for september.the matter was again continued to october,for the department to report on its investigation into christie criminal history and the status of christie request for a section exemption.on october,the department reported the details of christie prior convictions and advised the court that,on october,the county had denied a request for a criminal records exemption under section.the court continued the contested adjudication hearing to november.
on november,rhonda filed a formal motion for legal guardianship,requesting that christie be appointed summer legal guardian in lieu of declaring summer a dependent child of the court.rhonda argued in her motion that section disqualification provisions do not limit the court discretion to order guardianship under section.summer counsel filed a joinder in rhonda motion.
the department opposed the motion,arguing section must be read together with section to prohibit the court from ordering a section guardianship when,as in this case,the proposed guardian has disqualifying convictions under section and the county has denied an exemption.
on january,the juvenile court found summer was a person described by section and sustained the petition as to the,subd.b and allegations,subd.j,and struck the remaining allegations as redundant.the court denied rhonda motion to appoint christie as summer legal guardian,concluding the disqualification provisions of section prohibited it from ordering a section guardianship absent an exemption from the county.the court explained,i f i could exercise discretion i may have come to a different result 
on february,rhonda filed the instant petition for writ of mandate,asserting section prohibition on placement in a home where one of the residents has a disqualifying criminal conviction does not restrict the court discretion to order a section guardianship and requesting that we issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate its order denying rhonda motion for legal guardianship and to hold a new hearing applying the standards of section,subdivision a,to determine whether christie should be appointed summer legal guardian.on february,this court issued an order to show cause as to why the requested relief should not be granted.

the governing statutes sections and 
california has a comprehensive statutory scheme establishing procedures for the juvenile court to follow when and after a child is removed from the home for the child welfare.citations.the objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.citation.in re celine cal th,d.under the current statutory scheme dependency proceedings in which a child is removed from his or her home typically involve four phases jurisdiction,disposition,reunification and implementation of a permanent plan if reunification is unsuccessful.see generally cynthia superior court cal th,d.
after the juvenile court has assumed jurisdiction under section by finding the child is a person described by section,the court is required to hear evidence on the question of the proper disposition to be made of the child,subd.a.at the disposition hearing the court may enter an order ranging from dismissal of the petition rule a to declaring dependency,removing physical custody from the parents and making a general placement order for the child rule a.
section is a disposition statute and sets forth several of the options available to the court at the disposition hearing.section,subdivision a,provides,after receiving and considering the evidence on the proper disposition of the case,the juvenile court may enter judgment as follows a notwithstanding any other provision of law,if the court finds that the child is a person described by section and the parent has advised the court that the parent is not interested in family maintenance or family reunification services,it may,in addition to or in lieu of adjudicating the child a dependent of the court,order a legal guardianship,appoint a legal guardian and issue letters of guardianship,if the court determines the guardianship is in the best interest of the child,provided the parent and the child if old enough to give meaningful response agree to the guardianship see also rule a,a,b.
the statute prohibits any guardianship from being ordered under its terms until an assessment of the proposed guardian,including a screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect,is read and considered by the court and reflected in the minutes of the court,subd.a,a rule b a.the purpose of this statutorily required preliminary assessment is to provide the juvenile court with the information necessary to determine whether the guardianship is in the child best interests and whether the prospective guardian is an appropriate person to assume the duties of guardianship.in re dakota th,d.
added by the legislature to former section in stats,ch,subdivision a of section was intended to create a new and alternative procedure for appointing a guardian when the parent acknowledges early in the dependency proceedings that he or she can not,and will not be able to,even after family reunification services,provide adequate care for the child.as the author of the bill to add current subdivision a to section observed,t he dependency process needs tools that fit a variety of family situations.u nder current law the court may only grant a guardianship after to months of reunification services have been provided to the parents,and reunification has failed.w here the parent chooses to continue in a lifestyle that keeps him or her separated from the child,the court should have the option of granting the guardianship at an earlier stage,thus providing for more stability for the child.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as amended june,comment.

section imposes further restrictions on the placement of a child in any home other than a licensed foster home when a child has been removed from the physical custody of the parent or parents with whom the child was residing at the time the dependency proceedings were initiated and is to be placed with a relative,extended family member or any person other than his or her noncustodial parent who is not a licensed or certified foster parent,section requires the court or the county social worker entrusted with placing the child to initiate the same state and federal level criminal records check and check of child abuse indices undertaken for applicants seeking a foster home license.see,subds.b,c.if the criminal records check indicates that the person has no criminal record,the county social worker and the court may consider the home for possible placement in accordance with a determination and other factors identified in section,subdivision a,subd.d.however,i f the criminal records check indicates that the person has been convicted of a crime that would preclude licensure as a foster home under section of the health and safety code that is,any crime other than a minor traffic violation,the child may not be placed in the home,unless a criminal records exemption has been granted by the county,based on substantial and convincing evidence to support a reasonable belief that the person with the criminal conviction is of such good character as to justify the placement and not present a risk of harm to the child,subd.d.i n no event shall the county place a child in the home of a person who is ineligible for an exemption under health and safety code section,subdivision g making individuals with certain criminal convictions ineligible for exemptions,subd.d a.

section criminal records exemption requirement does not circumscribe the juvenile court discretion to order a legal guardianship under section 
in determining whether the legislature intended the juvenile court discretion to appoint a legal guardian pursuant to section to be circumscribed by the placement requirements of section,we examine first the words of both statutes because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.people trevino cal th,d.the statutory words must be given their ordinary and usual meaning hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d,trope katz cal th,d,and construed in a manner that avoids absurdity or interpretations that would render part of the statute meaningless or inoperative manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,d.furthermore,statutes are not to be read in isolation,but construed in context and with reference to the whole system of law of which they are part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citations.landrum superior court cal d.
section,subdivision a,commences with the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law.this phrase has a special legal connotation it is considered an express legislative intent that the specific statute in which it is contained controls in the circumstances covered by that statute,despite the existence of some other law which might otherwise apply to require a different or contrary outcome.souvannarath hadden th,d see also caliber bodyworks,superior court th,fn,d statutory phrase notwithstanding any other law is a term of art citation that declares the legislative intent to override all contrary law in re marriage of cutler th,d notwithstanding any other provision of law signals a broad application overriding all other code sections.
the department insists there is no conflict between sections and.according to the department,the legislature intended that section apply notwithstanding those statutes that would otherwise require an order of family reunification when warranted and did not intend to override section specific requirement for a criminal records exemption before a child could be placed in a home where one of the adult residents has a disqualifying criminal conviction.no such purpose is expressed in the statute.day city of fontana cal th,d,absent an ambiguity,plain language of statute controls.section specifies that its provisions apply under the prescribed circumstances n otwithstanding any other provision of law and does not exclude section from that directive.moreover,the department cramped construction of section is unnecessary to accomplish the purpose it advances.wholly apart from section,section,subdivision b,provides that reunification services need not be provided when the parent has advised the court that he or she is not interested in receiving family maintenance or family reunification services or having the child returned to or placed in his or her custody.utilizing that provision the juvenile court at disposition can order the child removed from the physical custody of his or her parents,deny reunification services and proceed directly to a permanency planning hearing at which legal guardianship can be considered for the child.see,subd.b.in light of this alternative path to legal guardianship,the interpretation of section urged by the department would make the entire provision essentially unnecessary and meaningless.see manufacturers life ins.superior court,supra,cal th at,d,statutory interpretations that render terms meaningless or inoperative are to be avoided select base materials board of equal.cal d,effect should be given whenever possible to every word and phrase of a statute so that no part is left without meaning.
although section,subdivision a,was enacted four years prior to section,we presume,as we must,the legislature was aware of section,subdivision a,when it enacted section in and similarly aware of section when it amended section in and again in yet,in neither statute did the legislature alter the n otwithstanding any other provision of law directive in section or otherwise make section specifically subject to the limitations of section.see stats,ch,stats,ch,see,peters superior court th,d statutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the legislature was aware of the existing law at the time of the statute enactment people mcguire th,d legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.
the department asserts the legislature intent to make section applicable to section guardianships is,in fact,explicit in the language of section by its terms,section applies w henever a child may be placed in the home of a relative or any prospective guardian or other person who is not a licensed or certified foster parent,subd.b,italics added.the department emphasis on placement is entirely correct but fails to support its position.section is a placement statute.it applies when a child has been removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section and put in the care,custody and control of the department for placement within the system.see,subd.e when court orders removal of the child,the court shall order the care,custody,control,and conduct of the child to be under the supervision of the social worker who may place the child in the system cheryl,supra,th at,d is a placement statute it applies to prospective placements.under those circumstances section prohibits the department from placing a child in its custody in any home that would be disqualified as a foster home under health and safety code section.
the legislative history of section is instructive on this point.enacted in as part of the lance helms child safety act,section was intended to address what the legislature viewed as a troubling gap in the dependency laws.prior to section enactment,any person involved in the operation of a foster home was required to undergo a criminal background check as a prerequisite for licensing and was,absent an exemption from the director of the state department of social services,disqualified from licensure if the background check revealed any conviction other than a minor traffic violation or certain specified arrests however,no similar disqualification and exemption procedure existed for relatives with criminal backgrounds despite the legislatively declared preference for placing the child with a relative.section eliminates much of this disparity by imposing on relatives,prospective guardians and other persons other than the child noncustodial parent who are neither certified nor licensed foster parents the same disqualifications for criminal convictions imposed on prospective foster parents under health and safety code section.see,subd.d.see also com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.existing law provides preferential consideration for the placement of a child with a relative in any case where that child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents.t his bill will do more to protect children and provide them with a safe environment while in the system.
lest there be any doubt about the legislature intent to equate a relative placement with traditional foster care and impose the same requirements on both,in the legislature amended several placement statutes including sections,and to,among other things,add extended family members to the list of homes into which a dependent child who is under the care,custody,and control of a social worker may be placed.in amending those statutes the legislature declared,it is the intent of the legislature to continue to promote the successful implementation of the statutory preference for foster care placement with relative caregivers the intent of the legislature is to clarify that california relative caregiver approval process employs the same standards used to license foster care homes.stats,ch.
unlike section,section is not a placement statute.it is not dependent on the removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her parent and concomitant placement of that child in the care,custody and control of the department with the objective that the departm
