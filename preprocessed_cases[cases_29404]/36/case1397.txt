factual and procedural background 
in july the agency removed louis from charisse custody and filed a section petition on his behalf.the petition alleged louis was at risk because he tested positive for,and charisse used,drugs.at the time of the detention hearing,the social worker was unable to inquire of louis parents about possible indian heritage because their whereabouts were unknown.in august the court made a true finding on the petition,declared louis to be a dependent,removed him from his parents custody,and ordered reunification services.
in january charisse told the social worker that her maternal grandmother,ramona,was an apache indian.charisse mother,vivian,told the social worker ramona was eligible for membership in the chiricahua tribe,a branch of the apache tribe,but she never registered with any tribe.presumably in an effort to determine where to send notice to comply with the provisions of the icwa,the social worker spoke with the enrollment clerk for the san carlos apache tribe,who said the members of the chiricahua tribe had blended with their tribe a long time ago.
the social worker stated in her review hearing report that in january she sent the icwa notices to the san carlos apache tribe and to the bureau of indian affairs bia.however,she did not file the notices or copies of the notices or any return receipt with the court.the san carlos apache tribe reported louis was not eligible for enrollment the bia did not respond.at the march review hearing,the court found the icwa did not apply.
at the september review hearing,the court terminated charisse reunification services,but continued services to louis father and continued jurisdiction over louis.charisse timely filed this appeal.subsequently,the court terminated reunification services for louis father and scheduled a section hearing for may the court again found the icwa did not apply to this proceeding.
discussion 
in her opening brief,charisse asserts the agency did not comply with the notice provisions of the icwa because it did not file the icwa notices or copies of the notices with the juvenile court the icwa notices it sent were insufficient it did not serve notice on all known apache tribes and it did not serve notice on the chairperson or the designated service agent for the san carlos apache tribe.we granted the agency request to augment the record with the notice it sent to the bia in january and the notice it sent to the san carlos apache tribe in january.charisse argues these notices were deficient because her name and the names of her mother and grandmother were misspelled her grandmother identification information was placed in the space on the form for her father information no birthdates were provided for either her mother or grandmother the notices sent to the bia were sent to the wrong address and the notice sent to the san carlos apache tribe in january did not provide information about ramona,the person with the alleged indian heritage.
congress enacted the icwa in to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.it allows a tribe to intervene in state court dependency proceedings c,because the icwa presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations,a most important resource.in re desiree th,d.
w here the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and their right of intervention.a.notice to the tribe provides it the opportunity to assert its rights.in re karla th,d.notice shall be sent whenever there is reason to believe the child may be an indian child,and for every hearing thereafter unless and until it is determined that the child is not an indian child.cal.rules of court,rule f.no proceeding to place a minor in foster care may occur until days after the tribe has received notice.a.we may void orders placing a minor in foster care if notice to the tribes or the bia is not given in accordance of provisions of the icwa.
charisse contends reversal of the order from the hearing is required because the agency never filed the notices,copies of the notices or return receipts for notices it sent to the san carlos apache tribe or the bia in the trial court.the bia guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings,the guidelines,which were designed to implement the icwa,require that an original or a copy of each icwa notice must be filed in the juvenile court together with any return receipts.in re karla,supra,th at,d.although the guidelines are not binding on state courts,this court has found the guidelines to be persuasive with regard to the icwa notice requirements.karla,supra,at,d dwayne superior court th,d.following the guidelines several courts,including this court,have held that the icwa notice,return receipts,and responses of the bia and the tribes must be filed in the juvenile court.in re samuel th,d in re th,d in re asia th,d karla,supra,at,d.
here,the social worker did not file any notices,copies of notices or return receipts with the juvenile court she did file the response from the san carlos apache tribe with the court.however,responses to the icwa notices without the notices are insufficient because it is impossible to determine from the responses alone whether the notices provided the tribe with relevant information and therefore with a meaningful opportunity to evaluate whether the dependent minor is an indian child within the meaning of the icwa.see in re karla,supra,th at,d.because the social worker did not file the notices,or copies of the notices and any return receipts,with the court,it was error for the court to conclude the icwa did not apply because it had insufficient information to reach that conclusion.
the agency concedes the initial appellate record does not show the icwa notice requirements were satisfied.however,it urges us to affirm because it contends the error was cured with the notice sent to the bia in january and to the san carlos apache tribe in january,which are now part of the appellate record by augmentation we may conclude the court error is harmless if the notices sent by the agency in january and january comply with the icwa.in re th,d.
one of the purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable it to determine whether the minor is an indian child.in re th,d.notice is meaningless if no information or insufficient information is presented to the tribe to make that determination.ibid.the notice must include the name,birthdate,and birthplace of the indian child his or her tribal affiliation a copy of the dependency petition the petitioner name a statement of the right to the tribe to intervene in the proceeding and information about the indian child biological mother,biological father,maternal and paternal grandparents and or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates places of birth and death current and former addresses tribal enrollment numbers,other identifying information.in re karla,supra,th at,d in re,supra,th at,d a,d.the burden is on the agency to obtain all possible information about the minor potential indian background and provide that info
