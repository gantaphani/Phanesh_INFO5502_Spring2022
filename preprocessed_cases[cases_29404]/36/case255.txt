harvey lloyd napier appeals his conviction under g for possession of firearms while subject to a domestic violence order.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm napier conviction.
the essential facts are not in dispute on january,napier estranged wife called the corbin,kentucky,police department to report an assault by napier.when napier vehicle was stopped,the officers found a mm glock model pistol and rounds of mm ammunition on the floorboard in the rear of the vehicle.napier was arrested.
at the time of his arrest napier was subject to two domestic violence orders.one domestic violence order was entered by the harlan county circuit court on december.the other domestic violence order was entered by the whitley county district court on september.both domestic violence orders contained a finding that acts of domestic violence had occurred and may occur again,and restrained napier from committing further acts of domestic violence against his spouse and their children.both orders contained the following notice in boldface type pursuant to section g,it is a federal violation to purchase,receive or possess a firearm while subject to this order.napier had received actual notice and had an opportunity to participate in both hearings prior to issuance of the orders.
napier was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of possession of firearms by a person subject to a domestic violence order in violation of g count one of the indictment charged him with possession of a handgun on january,while he was subject to two domestic violence orders,and count two charged him with possession of rounds of mm ammunition on the same date,while he was subject to the same domestic violence orders.
napier filed three motions to dismiss the indictment.in his first motion he argued that g violates the second and fifth amendments of the constitution and is an unconstitutional exercise of the commerce power.in his second motion he argued that the underlying domestic violence orders were either void or did not qualify as predicate offenses.in his third motion he argued that the domestic violence orders do not fulfill the substantive requirements of g i and ii.the district court denied all three motions.on the eve of trial the government made two oral motions in limine to exclude evidence regarding the validity of the domestic violence orders and regarding napier belief as to the existence of the domestic violence orders at the time of the instant offense.the district court granted the government motions.
in light of the district court rulings,napier entered a conditional plea of guilty to both counts of the indictment.he admitted that on january,in knox county,in the eastern district of kentucky,he knowingly possessed the gun and ammunition.he further admitted that at the time he possessed the firearm and ammunition,he was subject to domestic violence orders in whitley county,kentucky,and harlan county,kentucky.finally,napier admitted that the firearm and ammunition he possessed at the time of the instant offenses were manufactured outside the commonwealth of kentucky,and therefore traveled in interstate commerce prior to coming into his possession.as a condition of the plea of guilty,napier reserved the right to appeal the orders of the district court denying his motions to dismiss the indictment.
we review the district court determination of the constitutionality of a federal statute de novo.united states baker,cir,cert.denied,d.
napier contention that g violates the due process clause and the commerce clause of the united states constitution are not unprecedented.this circuit previously upheld g against similar attacks in baker,supra.
a fundamental principle of this court is that a panel can not overrule the decision of another panel.the prior decision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the united states supreme court requires modification of the decision or this court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.united states ables,cir quoting salmi secretary of health and human,cir.accordingly,unless baker is distinguishable,or if there are inconsistent decisions of the supreme court that require modification of baker.baker precludes us from ruling in napier favor on his due process and commerce clause challenges to g.
napier challenges g on due process grounds on its face because it fails to require notice of its prohibitions.napier also challenges the statute as applied because he contends he did not in fact receive notice that his conduct violated federal law.
according to napier,g is a technical,obscure statute which punishes conduct that a reasonable person ordinarily would not consider to be criminal.in support of this contention,napier relies on judge posner dissent in united states wilson,cir,cert.denied,d,and the determination in united states emerson,d,that g violates the fifth amendment because it is an obscure,highly technical statute with no mens rea requirement that renders a person subject to prosecution without proof of knowledge that he was violating the statute.
we rejected just such a challenge to g in baker,supra.the defendant in baker argued that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that it could not convict him of violating g unless he knew that the law forbade him to possess firearms while subject to a domestic violence order.at.we noted the general rule that citizens are presumed to know the requirements of the law.we also noted that this rule is not absolute,and may be abrogated when a law is so technical or obscure that it threatens to ensnare individuals engaged in apparently innocent conduct,because to presume knowledge of such a law would violate a core due process principle,namely that citizens are entitled to fair warning that their conduct may be criminal.at.we ultimately determined,however,that it was not necessary to interpret the statute to recognize ignorance of the law as an excuse because baker did receive adequate notice with respect to the requirements of g.id.at.each of the domestic violence orders entered against baker featured a bold print warning that he could not lawfully possess firearms.id.
although the domestic violence orders entered against napier contained the same bold print warning that was found adequate in baker.napier contends that his case is distinguishable from baker because he never received a copy of either domestic violence order entered against him.
the defendant in baker made a similar argument,which this court held was of no moment.id.at.even if baker had not received direct notice of his firearms disability,his prosecution under g would still not have resulted in a violation of his due process rights 
the fact that baker had been made subject to a domestic violence protection order provided him with notice that his conduct was subject to increased government scrutiny.because it is not reasonable for someone in his position to expect to possess dangerous weapons free from extensive regulation,baker can not successfully claim a lack of fair warning with respect to the requirements of g.
although this language in baker might be considered dicta,its reasoning was adopted in united states beavers,cir,to support the determination that g,which makes it a crime for one who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to possess a firearm,is constitutional even though it does not require the government to prove that the defendant had actual knowledge that his possession of a firearm was illegal.id.at.we concluded in beavers that the defendant conviction on a domestic violence offense sufficiently placed him on notice that the government might regulate his ability to own or possess a firearm.id.at.
napier suggests that in considering whether the domestic violence order proceeding should have put him on notice that the government might regulate his possession of a firearm,the court should consider the fact that domestic violence order proceedings are often informal and uncounselled.
while there are procedural differences between a domestic violence order and a misdemeanor conviction on a domestic violence offense,we do not find those procedural differences significant.as we pointed out in baker,the nature of the proceeding is not what is important under the statute.it is the status of the individual as one subject to a domestic violence order.at 
the fact that baker status makes him criminally liable for possessing a firearm does not imbue the process by which he attained that status with constitutional significance.indeed,a legally relevant status under g may arise in the absence of any formal proceeding.for example,g prohibits an individual addicted to controlled substances from possessing a firearm,yet an individual attains the status of a drug addict without a court proceeding of any kind.
at.regardless as to how baker became subject to a domestic violence protection order,he attained that status and thus must comply with g.id.at.
every circuit court which has considered a due process challenge similar to napier has rejected it.see,united states kafka,cir no departure from rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse was warranted because the restraining order transformed the otherwise innocent nature of the defendant gun possession united states reddick,cir we agree with every circuit court that has considered due process challenges to g and conclude that due process does not require actual knowledge of the federal statute.united states meade,cir individual under domestic violence protection order would not be sanguine about the legal consequences of possessing a firearm united states bostic,cir like a felon,a person subject to a domestic violence protection order can not reasonably expect to be free from regulation when possessing a firearm united states wilson,cir,cert.denied,d.
we find no basis for requiring actual notice of the gun prohibition.napier was notified of the proceedings that led up to issuance of the domestic violence orders and did in fact attend those hearings.he was made subject to a domestic violence order.as we stated in baker,whether or not he received or read those domestic violence orders is of no moment.his status alone,as one subject to a domestic violence order,was sufficient to preclude him from claiming a lack of fair warning with respect to the requirements of g.
napier contends the district court erred in granting the government motions in limine to exclude evidence at trial regarding the validity of the domestic violence orders and regarding napier knowledge of the existence of any valid domestic violence orders.
napier entered into a plea agreement which reserved his right to appeal the orders of the district court denying his motions to dismiss the indictment.he did not reserve the right to appeal the district court pretrial evidentiary ruling.napier expressly admitted,in a document entitled factual basis for guilty plea that at the time he possessed the firearm and ammunition he was subject to domestic violence orders in whitley county,kentucky,and harlan county,kentucky.napier did not preserve the issue regarding the validity of the domestic violence orders for appeal.
moreover,in light of our determination above that g does not require that the defendant have actual knowledge of the firearm restrictions,the district court correctly concluded that the evidence napier sought to introduce regarding his knowledge as to the existence of those orders was irrelevant.
napier also challenges the constitutionality of g on the basis that it represents an unconstitutional exercise of congress power under the commerce clause.napier contends that g is an unconstitutional attempt to regulate domestic abuse,which is strictly a matter of state concern.
our review of the commerce clause challenge begins with the recognition that congressional enactments are entitled to a presumption of constitutionality.w e invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds.united states morrison,d.there are three broad categories of activity that congress may regulate under its commerce power the use of the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.id.at.
in support of his commerce clause challenge to g,napier contends that the supreme court opinion in united states lopez,d,requires a finding that congress exceeded the proper scope of the commerce clause when it enacted g.
a similar argument relying on lopez was made and rejected in baker,supra.in lopez the supreme court struck down a federal law prohibiting firearm possession in a school zone because it exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause one of the court considerations was that the statute contained no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.at.
we determined in baker that g did not suffer from the same infirmity because it contains the jurisdictional element that was lacking in lopez.section g only applies to firearms or ammunition that are shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce,or possessed in or affecting commerce.g.with this jurisdictional element,g both explicitly relates to commerce and ensures only those activities affecting interstate commerce fall within its scope.baker,at.
baker does not stand alone.in united states chesney,cir,and united states turner,cir,we relied on this jurisdictional element in upholding g against a commerce clause challenge.as we stated in turner,every court of appeals that has been faced with the commerce clause challenge to g since lopez has held that the jurisdictional element of g provides the requisite nexus with interstate commerce that q lacked.turner,at.
notwithstanding our determination in baker that g is a proper exercise of congressional power under the commerce clause,napier contends that his case is distinguishable from baker because baker purchased a gun after he was subject to a domestic violence order.napier,on the other hand,had possessed his gun for years before a domestic violence order was entered against him.he contends that any commerce involving the firearm had long since ceased,and the link between his conduct and the effect on commerce is too attenuated to come within congress power under the commerce clause.he contends that even if congress has the authority to regulate persons who purchase guns when they are subject to domestic violence orders,it does not have the authority to regulate persons who already own guns before they become subject to a domestic violence order.
a similar argument was rejected in chesney.although there was no question that chesney gun had moved in interstate commerce,chesney argued that lopez requires the government to prove that his possession of the gun in itself had a substantial connection to interstate commerce.at.we rejected that argument because it read lopez too broadly.lopez did not disturb the supreme court precedents which indicate that a firearm that has been transported at any time in interstate commerce has a sufficient effect on commerce to allow congress to regulate the possession of that firearm pursuant to its commerce clause powers.chesney,at emphasis added.as we noted in chesney,p rohibiting possession by felons limits the market for firearms,and discourages shipping,transporting,and receiving firearms in or from interstate commerce.regulation of interstate gun trafficking,which is clearly commercial activity,is thus facilitated by regulation of possession in or affecting commerce.id.at.
the same analysis applies to those subject to domestic violence orders.see also gillespie city of indianapolis,cir without question,congress has the power to regulate the interstate trade in firearms so long as that gun has moved across state lines at least once,it is subject to the exercise of congressional commerce clause authority.united states barry,cir g constitutionally applied to a defendant who possessed a shotgun that had traveled in interstate commerce united states hanna,cir section g requirement that the firearm have
