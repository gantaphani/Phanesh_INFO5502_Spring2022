introduction 
the marriage of timothy seagondollar timothy and melinda seagondollar melinda ended in dissolution,and they were given shared physical and legal custody of their four minor children.timothy appeals from a postjudgment order changing that arrangement to give melinda sole physical and legal custody and permitting her to move with the children to virginia,where melinda now resides with her new husband.we reverse because the trial court deprived timothy of an opportunity to be meaningfully heard before granting melinda request.
a custody decision allowing one parent to move the children out of the state necessarily interferes with the other parent ability to have frequent and continuing contact with them.such a decision is one of the most serious decisions a family law court is required to make,and should not be made in haste.in re marriage of mcginnis th,d,disapproved on other grounds in in re marriage of burgess cal th,d.the best interests of the children require that competing claims be considered in a calm,dispassionate manner and only after the parties have had an opportunity to be meaningfully heard.in re marriage of mcginnis,supra,th at,d.
those requirements were not met in granting melinda request.virtually from start to finish,the trial court handling this matter failed to follow or evenly apply the rules and procedures governing family law matters and,by failing to do so,denied timothy the opportunity to be meaningfully heard.the rules of procedure for reaching family law in the family code,the code of civil procedure,the california rules of court,and local court not mere suggestions.the rules of procedure are commands which ensure fairness by their enforcement.
we recognize one result of reversal is to perpetuate an unstable custody relationship all the more reason why it is important to adhere to the correct procedures and provide a fair hearing in the first instance.in the next instance,on remand,we are confident the trial court will impartially follow the procedures and rules governing family law matters to ensure a decision is reached after giving both sides an opportunity to be meaningfully heard.
since we reverse on procedural grounds,we do not address timothy argument that the trial court failed to apply the correct legal standard,set forth in in re marriage of lamusga cal th,d,in awarding melinda sole custody with a right.
ii.facts and proceedings in the trial court 
the marriage of timothy and melinda was dissolved on may.the dissolution judgment awarded timothy and melinda joint legal and physical custody of their four children,eric born,adam born,ian born,and kaia born.the custody order awarded timothy custody on those days on which melinda was on call or available to work her job as a flight attendant for united airlines.the order awarded melinda custody the rest of the time.
eric chose to live with timothy in august.in june,eric started living with melinda.
on march,timothy brought an order to show cause march osc asking the court to award him sole physical custody of the four children and award melinda reasonable visitation.in the march osc,timothy asserted the custody arrangement was unworkable and created constant upheaval in the living situation for the children and myself.the hearing on timothy march osc was set for may.
in the meantime,on april,melinda brought an osc april osc seeking an order for an evidence code section evaluation of the children by stephen adam.timothy opposition to melinda april osc stated melinda,who moved out of the residence at the time of separation,remarried over the weekend and envisions a living arrangement.new spouse lives on the east coast and melinda lives in an apartment here.
at the hearing on may,the trial court expressed its belief an evidence code section evaluation was unnecessary because it not a case,at least that not the way it presented.melinda counsel agreed a issue was not before the court,but stated,there are issues of moving away that will be addressed at the time of the hearing,in part,because of my client recent remarriage.the court replied,that not something that we can foist upon each other by surprise if there is going to be a move away filed,then file it and we deal with that as a separate issue.but i not going to anticipate it at this point.
thus,on may,the trial court denied,for the time being,melinda request for an evidence code section evaluation.the court also appointed boo giuffre as the children counsel to represent the children in the custody dispute.the court continued the two osc timothy march osc for custody modification and melinda april osc for a section evaluation to july.the court ordered timothy and melinda to attend mediation.
on june,timothy brought an ex parte application and osc requesting an immediate temporary award giving him physical custody and prohibiting removal of the children from southern california without the parties written agreement or a court order.in a supporting declaration,timothy stated the children have lived under the hideous pressure of choosing which parent to live with.according to timothy,eric who had been living with timothy since august h as developed an attitude that i can not tell him what to do or where to go,or not go,or when to come home.the three other children were more aligned with their mother behavior and all four were suffering the worst emotional burdens that can be associated with divorce and all that is going on in this family.giving timothy temporary sole custody would,he claimed,assist us in providing stability and continuity in the lives of these children.timothy asserted melinda was manipulating the custody order,and t he new spouse,new home,mile move and all that go with it have been dangled in front of the children.
melinda opposition handwritten by her attorney asserted timothy brought the ex parte application and osc because he was angry and because he disapprove d of melinda remarriage.
when timothy ex parte application was heard on june,the trial court took the unusual step,as the court described it,of placing the hearing on the record.the children counsel stated she was extremely concerned about these children emotional and requested the court,on the children behalf,to appoint adam to conduct a limited evidence code section evaluation.the children counsel explained that melinda had remarried and is now seeking to relocate with the minor children to the state of virginia.the children counsel stated,i think that the involvement of the mental health professional is going to be very,very necessary in order to sort this issue out prior to the commencement of school.melinda counsel stated we are in the status quo.melinda has no intention of moving or relocating to the state of virginia,nor relocating the children residence until after this matter has been heard in july.
the court appointed adam to conduct a limited evidence code section evaluation.no definition of limited was provided.the court modified the custody schedule to provide equal visitation,from the time the children school let out until the hearing on july,and to allow melinda to take the children out of state until july.the parties later stipulated to continue the july hearing to october.
adam conducted his evaluation and,on september,met with the parties to discuss his recommendations and conclusions.he recommended the court consider allowing all of the children to relocate to virginia to live with melinda and her husband the children visit timothy in california once a month timothy be permitted to visit the children for a weekend or extended weekend in virginia custody and visitation over holidays and school vacations be divided in a reasonable and equitable manner the children spend half of the summer with timothy and the parents facilitate any other reasonable personal or telephonic contact between the nonresidential parent and the children.
adam stated in the report the above recommendations are rendered with the knowledge that there is data that can not be known at this time.the living arrangements and family dynamics in virginia must be tested.although one can not be certain,i believe that the likelihood for the children to adapt and flourish is probable.i do not believe that the mother will undermine,obstruct,or frustrate the children relationship with the father.the children are of an age where they have each established a relationship with their father that will sustain despite the geographical distance.on the other hand,what is known is that the current shared custody plan has proven to be a failure.the children do not wish to reside primarily with their father.based on the data,this evaluator can not recommend that the children reside primarily with their father.
on september,timothy filed a notice withdrawing the march osc,which at that time was scheduled for hearing on october.
on october,melinda brought an ex parte application to restore the custody case to calendar on october.she also filed on that date an osc requesting modification of the custody order october osc and brought an ex parte application to have the osc heard on shortened notice.melinda october osc was not personally served on timothy.melinda october osc stated as its factual support petitioner has remarried.petitioner will be living in the state of virginia with the minor children.the children and the parties have been evaluated by stephen adam there is a need to modify the present child support order because the time that the children spend with each parent will change.the court granted the ex parte application for shortened notice,over timothy opposition,and set melinda october osc for hearing on october.
also on october,the children counsel filed a statement of issues and contentions,concluding the existing custody order is not in the children best interest eric,adam,and ian had not performed to their capacity in academics during the previous year the three younger children do not wish to disclose a preference regarding their primary residence and eric,the oldest child,may not be of sufficient maturity to make a statement of preference which is in his best interests based on the existing relationship he has with his mother and father.the statement disclosed that the children counsel had several telephonic conferences and one personal meeting with adam.
on october,timothy brought an ex parte motion to quash service of melinda october osc.the motion asserted the october osc did not provide the notice required for a hearing under family code section.the attorney declaration submitted with the motion stated as of this writing,i have not received the evidence code section report.i am not ready to proceed to trial on october,and allowing the trial to commence on october deprives my client,seagondollar,of his constitutional right to due process.a hearing on timothy motion to quash was scheduled for november.
on october,timothy sought a continuance of the hearing on melinda october osc.the facts in support of the request were october,hearing is the first setting of petitioner osc.under family code section e respondent is entitled to one continuance.under ccp section respondent needs a continuance to procure a material witness.respondent received the evaluator s record on october,at approximately.i can not,with due diligence,procure competent rebuttal witness s and competently prepare for trial for what is the most important issue this family has ever faced.please note the report was received less than days prior to the october hearing date.a hearing on timothy request for a continuance was scheduled for november,after the hearing on melinda october osc.
timothy filed a responsive declaration to melinda october osc.
on october,the trial court continued the hearing on melinda october osc to november,to accommodate adam schedule.the hearing was held on november,and.the minutes state that timothy two osc and melinda two osc were being heard,although timothy had withdrawn the march osc and his june osc had sought only temporary relief.on november,the first day of the hearing,the trial court denied timothy request for a continuance.adam testified.
on november,timothy requested the court to schedule a day of the hearing to present philip stahl as a rebuttal witness to adam.timothy counsel represented that stahl would not be available to testify until november.melinda counsel and the children counsel opposed the request.timothy counsel made an offer of proof that stahl would testify that adam did not consider all relevant information and did not comply with california rules of court,rules and,and that stahl would tell the court there are items and circumstances missing from that report that are essential for the court to be able to make its decision.
on november,during,the children counsel questioned timothy about stahl.timothy counsel objected on the grounds of privilege and work product.the court stated,if this is a potential witness here,his discussion privilege is gone.timothy counsel explained the court had previously stated that stahl would not be permitted to testify if the hearing ended before he was available.the court then sustained the privilege objection,stating,if no witness is here,they not going to testify because i not extending this proceeding forever.
the hearing ended on november.stahl had not testified.
the trial court granted melinda primary custody of the children and permitted her to relocate with the children to virginia,conditioned on various orders regarding timothy custody.a statement of decision was signed and filed on january.the court stated the court is not making any decision.the court is not making a decision on the basis of one party having to show detriment.in this case,the best interests of the children,is the legal standard to be applied by the court.the trial court found that melinda has a stronger emotional attachment with the children and that they look to her for their emotional strength.the court continued melinda is the more open parent and it is easier for her to deal with the children problems.the children are more closely bonded to melinda.she provided the stability in the children lives.melinda strengths lie in the openness with which she reacts to the children and the children respond well to melinda.she is the parent most sic likely to share the time with the children.melinda was also the parent with whom the children would prefer to reside.timothy is not as close with the children as melinda and timothy is not dealing with the children on the same level as melinda.the court found that melinda move to virginia was not done in bad faith.
the court concluded it was in the children best interest to award melinda primary physical custody and to authorize her to relocate to virginia with the children.findings and an order after hearing reflecting the trial court decision were filed on january.timothy timely appealed from the order.
iii.analysis 
statutory framework 
in the recent case of in re marriage of brown yana cal th,d,the california supreme court explained california statutory scheme governing child custody and visitation determinations is set forth in the family code all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.under this scheme,the overarching concern is the best interest of the child.citation.for purposes of an initial custody determination,section,subdivision b,affords the trial court and the family the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.citation.when the parents are unable to agree on a custody arrangement,the court must determine the best interest of the child by setting the matter for an adversarial hearing and considering all relevant factors,including the child health,safety,and welfare,any history of abuse by one parent against any child or the other parent,and the nature and amount of the child contact with the parents.citations.once the trial court has entered a final or permanent custody order reflecting that a particular custodial arrangement is in the best interest of the child,the paramount need for continuity and stability in custody the harm that may result from disruption of established patterns of care and emotional bonds with the primary heavily in favor of maintaining that custody arrangement.citation.in recognition of this policy concern,we have articulated a variation on the best interest standard,known as the changed circumstance rule,that the trial court must apply when a parent seeks modification of a final judicial custody determination.citations.under the changed circumstance rule,custody modification is appropriate only if the parent seeking modification demonstrates a significant change of circumstances indicating that a different custody arrangement would be in the child best interest.citation.not only does this serve to protect the weighty interest in stable custody arrangements,but it also fosters judicial economy.citation.the family code contemplates that,in making a custody determination,consideration of the best interest of the child may lead the trial court to award custody either to both parents joint or shared custody or to only one parent sole custody.fn.omitted.
when one parent has sole custody,that parent has a right to change the residence of the child,subject to the power of the court to restrain a removal that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child,subd.a.in a case,a change of custody is not justified simply because the custodial parent has chosen,for any sound good faith reason,to reside in a different location,but only if,as a result of relocation with that parent,the child will suffer detriment rendering it essential or expedient for the welfare of the child that there be a change.citation.in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
here,timothy and melinda were given joint legal and physical custody of the children,and a different analysis may be required when parents share joint physical custody of the minor children under an existing order and in fact,and one parent seeks to relocate with the minor children.in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in such cases,if it is shown that the best interests of the children require modification or termination of the order,the court must determine de novo what arrangement for primary custody is in the best interest of the minor children.in re marriage of lamusga,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
b.the trial court procedural errors deprived timothy of a fair hearing on melinda request for custody and to relocate the children to virginia.
timothy argues the trial court erred by failing to require melinda to file a responsive pleading to his march osc or to file a requesting custody and a granting melinda request to hear her october osc on shortened notice without good cause refusing to hear timothy motion to quash before the hearing on melinda october osc refusing to trail or continue the matter for three days to permit timothy rebuttal expert to testify and failing to issue an order defining in detail the purpose and scope of the evidence code section evaluation.we agree the trial court erred in all of those ways.while some error may be excused as harmless,the cumulative effect was to deny timothy a fair hearing.
melinda failure to file a response to timothy march osc 
we start with melinda failure to file a responsive pleading seeking affirmative relief.a party served with an osc re modification of custody may use a responsive declaration to seek affirmative relief on the same issues,see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.melinda did not file a response to timothy march osc and did not request affirmative modification relief.melinda did file an osc requesting appointment of an evaluator,but she did not file her own osc seeking modification of custody.
indeed,as timothy points out,at the hearing on may,the trial court expressed its belief an evidence code section evaluation was unnecessary because it not a case,at least that not the way it presented.the trial court made clear melinda would have to file her own osc to present the issue,and stated,i not going to anticipate it at this point.at the june hearing,melinda counsel had stated we are in the status quo.melinda has no intention of moving or relocating to the state of virginia,nor relocating the children residence until after this matter has been heard in july.the july hearing was later continued to october.
throughout the summer,while adam conducted his evaluation,melinda never sought affirmative relief and never filed a response to timothy march osc.
thus,as of september,only timothy march osc requesting sole custody of the children was set for hearing.because melinda had requested no affirmative relief,the trial court could either grant timothy march osc and give him sole custody,or deny timothy march osc and keep the current joint custody order in place.a with melinda receiving sole custody was not an option.
on september,timothy filed a notice withdrawing his march osc,then scheduled for hearing on october.timothy was within his rights to withdraw the osc melinda had not filed a response,and trial had not commenced.see code civ,subd.c.melinda chose not to file a responsive declaration and did not request affirmative relief.the effect of withdrawing timothy march osc was,therefore,to keep the current custody order in place.
lack of good cause to hear melinda october osc on shortened notice 
melinda first sought affirmative relief asking for primary physical custody and a with the children to virginia when she filed the october osc.a hearing date on an osc re modifying custody must be selected to comply with the ccp b minimum notice period,absent an order shortening time.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.an order shortening time may be requested when filing the osc.the request should be made on the appropriate application form,setting forth evidentiary facts why a shorter notice period is necessary,see cal.rules of court,rule b.
melinda applied ex parte for an order shortening time when she filed her october osc seeking modification of custody.as evidence in support of her application,melinda submitted the declaration of her attorney,who stated timothy withdrew his march osc set for hearing on october,adam had been appointed to conduct a limited evidence code section evaluation and had completed that evaluation and i t is necessary for the court to issue a new custody order for the four minor children because melinda has remarried and is moving,with the children,to the state of virginia.
those facts merely restate the basis for seeking the modification they do not constitute good cause for shortening time to hear such an important matter as an osc to modify custody and approve a.yet,the trial court granted melinda application and set the hearing on the october osc for october,only eight days away.the trial court erred by so doing.
melinda justifies the order shortening time by arguing timothy had known since april she had remarried and intended to move to virginia.in opposition to melinda april osc for an evidence code section evaluation,timothy stated melinda,having remarried,envision ed a living arrangement italics added and maintained an apartment in orange county.further,melinda decision to relocate to virginia does not necessarily mean she also intended to seek primary physical custody of the children and move them with her.to the contrary,melinda conduct from april until filing her october osc suggested she did not intend to seek primary custody.at the june hearing,her counsel represented she had no intention of relocating until after the hearing on timothy march osc.timothy should not be charged with knowledge of a request that melinda did not make and commit herself to until filing her october osc.
refusing to hear timothy motion to quash before the hearing on melinda october osc 
on october,the trial court continued the hearing on melinda october osc to november,so the error in granting melinda ex parte application might be considered harmless but in addition,it appears melinda october osc was not properly served on timothy.an osc requesting modification of a custody order must be served on the party service on the party attorney is not sufficient,see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.a postjudgment modification issued without proper service of the osc is void on its face and subject to collateral attack.in re marriage of kreiss d.
