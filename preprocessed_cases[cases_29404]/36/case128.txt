opinion of the court 
thomas kane appeals the judgment of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court decision not to apply judicial estoppel to the entirety of a proof of claim filed by his estranged wife in his bankruptcy proceeding,and its conclusion that kane has standing to pursue equitable distribution as a claim in that proceeding.we will affirm.
background 
shannon and thomas kane were married in august of.two years later,kane filed for divorce in mercer county,new jersey,and moved to new york.in september of,she presented her husband with a written settlement proposal requesting,inter alia,equitable distribution,and informing him that she intended to file for bankruptcy.on september,she filed a chapter petition in the eastern district of new york.her filing disclosed her estrangement from kane,and the pending divorce litigation 
schedule a of her petition included details about the couple house and specified that debtor and her husband are separated 
schedule f of her petition listed kane as an unsecured creditor,specifying p ossible obligations arising out of matrimonial proceeding with a stated amount of claim listed as unknown 
kane statement of financial affairs listed the couple divorce proceeding by docket number,and indicated its status as pending.
on november,the trustee in kane bankruptcy proceeding reviewed her petition at a meeting,see,at which she was present with counsel.kane also attended in his capacity as a creditor listed on her petition.he argued,as he argues now,that his wife sworn averments were false and misleading because they failed to disclose that she was simultaneously litigating her entitlement to alimony,equitable distribution,and attorney fees in another court.appellant br.at nevertheless,after extensive colloquy,the trustee concluded for the record,i satisfied that the debtor disclosure was sufficient,that there are certain omissions that she might have made,they negligible.id.at.the trustee also confirmed that a distributive award is an asset of the estate.id.at.thereafter,on november,kane filed an amended petition which disclosed a claim for alimony and a pending lawsuit that did not appear in her first petition.on november,the trustee filed a trustee letter of assets with the bankruptcy court in new york,which in early granted kane a discharge.
on april,kane filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the district of new jersey,and his wife filed a proof of claim in the amount of.the bankruptcy court in new jersey held a hearing on kane motion to expunge kane claim with prejudice because it was premised on claims that she failed to include in her own bankruptcy petition.the court expunged her proof of claim without prejudice to her right to refile it.the court concluded that such refiling would constitute a claim in kane bankruptcy action.and,the court indicated that such a claim is dependent on the mercer county family court entering an equitable distribution award in her favor,with that court responsible for determining its parameters.however,the court ruled that kane was judicially estopped from filing claims for loans to debtor sisters,debtor premarital car loan,wedding expenses and lost social security benefits to the extent that the matrimonial court determines such claims do not fall within the ambit of equitable distribution as a result of her failure to disclose such claims in her bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.the court then vacated the automatic stay imposed under,permitting kane to pursue equitable distribution in the state court.
the bankruptcy court decision relied on two conclusions,affirmed by the district court,that are the crux of kane arguments on appeal.first,the court concluded that,pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code,entitlement to equitable distribution is not an asset of a bankruptcy estate,and therefore kane had no obligation to list the equitable distribution right as an asset in her petition schedule b.id.at.the court thus distinguished kane pursuit of equitable distribution in state court litigation,from entitlement to equitable distribution arising from an award entered on her behalf within days of a bankruptcy filing,concluding that only the latter becomes property of a bankruptcy estate pursuant to a.
second,the bankruptcy court concluded that because kane equitable distribution claim was sufficiently before the bankruptcy court in new york,via her meeting,she was not estopped from pursuing it in her husband proceeding.the court noted that the transcript from kane meeting addressed equitable distribution and her divorce litigation,which she had reference d in her statement of financial affairs,and concluded that no one can suggest to this court that the chapter trustee was not aware of the right for an equitable distribution,that there was litigation out there in which shannon kane was seeking equitable distribution,but that the trustee made a conscious decision not to pursue it.id.at.
kane appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court,and kane.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in all respects,and kane now appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a final order of the bankruptcy court arises under a.we have jurisdiction under d and.
we employ the same standard of review that the district court employed in reviewing the bankruptcy court decision.we review factual findings for clear error,and we exercise plenary review over any legal conclusions.krystal gmc truck,motors,cir citation omitted.we review a district court decision whether to invoke judicial estoppel only for abuse of discretion,asking whether its ruling is founded on an error of law or a misapplication of law to the facts.montrose med.grp.participating sav.plan bulger,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.with respect to an issue of standing,our review is plenary.hutchins irs,cir citation omitted.we may affirm the rulings of the district court for any proper reason that appears on the record even where not relied on by it.united states perez,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
introduction 
the bankruptcy code requires that a debtor file necessary declarations adequately,honestly,and in good faith.see,a defining a debtor filing duties fed.b outlining requirements of proper purpose and evidentiary support in representations to bankruptcy court.
in ryan operations lumber,we set forth the code disclosure requirements,and sought to place a party alleged prior inconsistent statement in context,cir.citing and a b,as well as applicable official disclosure forms,we proceeded to note 
the code imposes on debtors an affirmative duty of full disclosure.section requires the debtor to file with the court a schedule of assets and liabilities and a statement of the debtor financial affairs.the schedule must disclose,inter alia,contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature and provide an estimated value for each one.
these disclosure requirements are crucial to the effective functioning of the federal bankruptcy system.because creditors and the bankruptcy court rely heavily on the debtor disclosure statement in determining whether to approve a proposed reorganization plan,the importance of full and honest disclosure can not be overstated.

as indicated above,a debtor disclosure obligation extends to contingent assets such as causes of action pursued against another party,krystal cadillac,at,because such disclosure allows the trustee and the creditors to determine whether to pursue these assets on the creditors behalf.in re costello.while a bankruptcy case is pending,it i s the trustee,and not the debtor,who ha s the capacity to pursue the debtor claims.id.citations omitted.indeed,it would be inconsistent with the bankruptcy code to apply a rule requiring the debtor to have to supervise and double check the actions of the trustee,who is accountable for all property received.hutchins,at citing in re lee sons,limiting debtor burden to reasonable diligence in completing schedules.
the bankruptcy code defines the property of a bankruptcy estate as including,inter alia,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,u.a with certain exceptions,inapplicable here,and a ny interest in property that would have been property of the estate if such interest had been an interest of the debtor on the date of the filing of the petition,and that the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire within days after such date as a result of a property settlement agreement with the debtor spouse,or of an interlocutory or final divorce decree.id.a b.section then provides 
a after notice and a hearing,the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate.
c unless the court orders otherwise,any property scheduled under section of this title not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and administered for purposes of section of this title.
d unless the court orders otherwise,property of the estate that is not abandoned under this section and that is not administered in the case remains property of the estate.
in light of the foregoing,we have emphasized that section a was intended to sweep broadly to include all kinds of property,including tangible or intangible property,and causes of action,westmoreland human opportunities,walsh,cir quoting united states whiting pools,and that an asset must be properly scheduled in order to pass to the debtor through abandonment under.hutchins,at citing cases.
kane correctly cites various of these obligations that the bankruptcy code and case law impose on debtors.however,his arguments that the district court erred by refusing to apply judicial estoppel to the entirety of kane proof of claim,and by concluding that she has standing to pursue equitable because he elides two other considerations that necessarily govern our decision.first,courts have discretion in applying the,equitable remedy of judicial estoppel.second,jurisdictional considerations caution us against,if not prevent us from,essentially the basis for a discharge in bankruptcy by a court not subject to our review.
underlying kane appeal is his fundamental contention that kane chapter proceeding worked a fraud upon the three courts that have considered this matter and her creditors.that contention belonged,in the first instance,before the court responsible for overseeing her petition the bankruptcy court in new york in any event,in light of the record that is before us,we conclude that the district court,and before it the bankruptcy court in new jersey,had ample reason to assume that kane disclosures,and kane own actions as well as his opportunity to take additional action,fairly set forth before the bankruptcy court in new york what needed to be set forth.we address each of kane arguments in turn.
judicial estoppel 
judicial estoppel is a,equitable doctrine,applied at courts discretion.kane insufficiently accounts for this,and for the corollary that a given set of circumstances does not,as he suggests,necessarily compel its application.accordingly,his judicial estoppel argument fails.
we summarized the doctrine of judicial estoppel,and applied it in a bankruptcy case,in krystal cadillac.our summary bears quoting at some length 
we first articulated the doctrine of judicial estoppel in scarano central of.there,we recognized the intrinsic ability of courts to dismiss an offending litigant complaint without considering the merits of the underlying claims when such dismissal is necessary to prevent a litigant from playing fast and loose with the courts.
since scarano,we have consistently stated that the doctrine should only be applied to avoid a miscarriage of justice.thus,in ryan operations lumber,we stated that t he basic principle of judicial estoppel is that absent any good explanation,a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory,and then seek an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory.
judicial estoppel is therefore not intended to eliminate all inconsistencies no matter how slight or inadvertent they may be.in montrose medical group participating savings plan bulger,we identified certain criteria for determining when seemingly inconsistent litigation stances justify application of the doctrine.we concluded 
first,the party to be estopped must have taken two positions that are irreconcilably inconsistent.second,judicial estoppel is unwarranted unless the party changed his or her position in bad,with intent to play fast and loose with the court.finally,a district court may not employ judicial estoppel unless it is tailored to address the harm identified and no lesser sanction would adequately remedy the damage done by the litigant misconduct.
we also noted that equity requires that the presiding court give the party to be estopped a meaningful opportunity to provide an explanation for its changed position.
krystal cadillac,at emphasis in original internal quotation marks,citations,and references omitted.
more generally,and citing various circuit court decisions,including our own in scarano,the supreme court has described judicial estoppel as imposing not inflexible prerequisites,but rather as encompassing a dditional considerations that may inform the doctrine application in specific factual contexts.new hampshire maine,citations omitted.the court observed that,b ecause the rule is intended to prevent improper use of judicial machinery,judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.as we recently observed,t he applicability vel non of judicial estoppel is.howard hess dental labs.dentsply int l,cir citation omitted 
the crux of kane judicial estoppel argument is that his wife averments and omissions in her bankruptcy proceeding were inconsistent with if not concealed terms of a settlement proposal in the couple divorce proceeding,claims to equitable distribution that she began litigating against kane approximately one year prior to the filing of her chapter petition.these alleged misrepresentations and omissions,the argument goes,underlie her proof of claim filed in his bankruptcy proceeding.
however,irreconcilable inconsistency is but the first of three prongs in a judicial estoppel analysis,and all three must be satisfied before a court opts to apply the doctrine.in ryan,it was undisputed that the debtor had violated disclosure duties,but we declined to apply estoppel because the bad faith prong had not been satisfied.at.we also noted that we have expressly left open whether nondisclosure,standing alone,can support a finding of irreconcilable inconsistency within the meaning of the doctrine.id.citation omitted.here,in rejecting kane plea to apply estoppel,the district court relied on the fact that the bankruptcy court in new jersey both noted and deferred to the new york trustee finding that kane disclosures were s ufficient and any omissions negligible.app.at.this was not error.
to be sure,there would be no issue here if kane chapter petition had included the specific amount that she sought in equitable distribution,rather than referencing her divorce litigation in various sections of the petition,and presumably relying on the extensive discussion of her claims at her meeting to fill in any gaps.however,her disclosures must be placed in context.see ryan,at.that context is this one bankruptcy court may well have examined her petition and concluded that her disclosures were insufficient because references to her marital status and pending divorce litigation on schedules a and f and in the statement of financial affairs did not excuse her from providing a specific,estimated value of equitable distribution sought on schedule or,another bankruptcy court might have concluded,as the bankruptcy court in new york apparently did,that her disclosures were sufficient because the trustee,who had the capacity to pursue her claims,see costello,at,became aware of them in both fact and substance before he proclaimed them sufficient.see hutchins,at questioning propriety of requiring a debtor to supervise and double check the action
