this appeal concerns the fate of a young alien widow who seeks to remain in the united states notwithstanding that her citizen husband,to whom she was married for only a short time,tragically died in a car accident and,according to the government,thereby stripped her of her status as his spouse.complicating the widow appeal is the fact that although she along with her citizen spouse had petitioned to adjust her status to that of lawful permanent resident,she entered the united states under the terms of a special visa waiver program that limited her to a visitor stay in this country and required her to waive her rights to contest the government decision to remove her.she now asks us,not to grant her lawful permanent resident we can not rather,to determine whether she remains a spouse who can qualify for such status.
background 
carla freeman freeman,a dual citizen of south africa and italy,met robert freeman,a united states citizen,while she was temporarily working in the united states as an au pair.the freemans became engaged and thereafter were married near chicago,illinois in february.shortly after the marriage,freeman went back to south africa.she returned to the united states in june under the terms of a special visa waiver program vwp granting her a visitor stay in this country in september,before freeman visa waiver expired,freeman filed a petition for immediate relative form attesting to the fact of their marriage and his wife current status as a vwp entrant.the same day,freeman filed an application to register permanent resident or adjust status form the filing of these forms initiated the formal process for adjusting freeman status to that of a lawful permanent resident lpr,a status granted to the spouses of citizens.concurrently with the filing of the and forms,the immigration and naturalization service ins granted freeman a work authorization,effectively treating her as no longer simply a visitor subject to the limitation of the vwp 
while their application was pending,robert freeman was tragically killed in a car accident shortly before the freemans first wedding anniversary.subsequently,when the department of homeland security dhs finally reviewed her application in may,the district director for the citizenship and immigration services ruled that freeman,now a widow,no longer qualified for an adjustment of status because she was not a spouse for purposes of the immigration and nationality act ina,her husband death having occurred before they had been married for two years.further,the director ruled that freeman,as a vwp entrant subject to the program clause see,supra,had waived any right to renew her adjustment of status application or obtain review of his decision by an immigration judge.he ordered her to leave the united states because her vwp authorization had expired.
freeman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court,challenging the district director determinations that she was no longer a spouse entitled to adjustment of status and that she had waived any review of the director ruling.the district court denied her habeas petition.freeman timely filed a notice of appeal to this court,but has since returned to south africa where she remains subject to and a,which prohibit her from reentering the united states for years from the date of her departure 
freeman appeal raises two questions,both requiring us to interpret statutory language to resolve matters of first impression in this circuit.the first concerns the scope and applicability of the visa waiver program clause,and the second concerns the proper definition of spouse for purposes of adjustment of status under the immigration laws.we hold that once a vwp entrant files an adjustment of status application as an immediate relative,as contemplated by c,the alien is entitled to the procedural guarantees of the adjustment of status regime,see,and to that extent is no longer subject to the visa waiver program clause.we further hold that an alien widow whose citizen spouse filed the necessary immediate relative petition form but died within two years of the qualifying marriage nonetheless remains a spouse for purposes of b a i,and is entitled to be treated as such when dhs adjudicates her adjustment of status application 
ii.visa waiver program 
a.the vwp regime 
the visa waiver program authorizes the government to waive visa requirements for citizens of certain favored countries.see under the terms of the vwp,as a condition of entering the united states without a visa,freeman had to leave within days and,under the clause,agree to waive any right 
to review or appeal under the ina of an immigration officer determination as to the admissibility of the alien at the port of entry into the united states,or to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action for removal of the alien.
b.we have described the clause as the linchpin of the visa waiver program,which assures that a person who comes here with a vwp visa will leave on time and will not raise a host of legal and factual claims to impede her removal if s he overstays.handa clark,cir.notwithstanding that the clause severely restricts an alien ability to seek review of a removal decision,the alien may still claim that she is not subject to the vwp procedures at all or that the law requires that she be brought before an immigration judge ij prior to removal.see id.at.
although the clause was designed generally to limit the rights of alien visitors and prevent them from challenging their removal,the ina does not entirely preclude such visitors from seeking to extend their stay.specifically,c provides that a vwp visitor may seek to adjust her status to that of a permanent resident through an immediate relative petition,the procedure invoked by the freemans.see faruqi dep t of homeland security,cir noting that vwp visitors are eligible for adjustment of status on the basis of either an immediate relative petition or an application for asylum.see also b.once an adjustment of status application is filed,certain procedural safeguards are in place to ensure fair adjudication of the application.see generally.
freeman argues that once she and her husband initiated the adjustment of status process by filing the necessary forms,her right to remain in the united states and to challenge any adverse decision became subject to the procedural protections governing adjustment of status applications.accordingly,the district director erred in applying the vwp proviso to her in denying her adjustment of status application.the government,however,insists that the vwp proviso remains in force and precludes freeman from challenging her removal order and the district director determination that she is no longer a qualifying spouse.it argues that only asylum seekers are exempted from the clause under the express terms of b,and freeman is not seeking asylum 
we think the government position ignores the interplay between the adjustment of status regime and the visa waiver program,which explicitly allows vwp visitors to file an adjustment of status application pursuant to an immediate relative petition.see c.as we shall explain,the text and purpose of this complex statute,along with dhs action in freeman case,persuade us that once a vwp visitor properly files an adjustment of status application,the vwp clause does not deprive the of the procedural guarantees afforded any applicant seeking adjustment of status.see.
b.the right to adjust status 
section explains that certain classes of may petition the attorney general for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident,provided that the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to her at the time her application is filed.a.included in the class of who may petition for lpr status are vwp entrants,but only those who seek adjustment pursuant to an immediate relative petition.c under the regulatory regime associated with adjustment of status,alien applicants are afforded various procedural benefits.among these benefits,an applicant retains the right to renew his or her application if it has been denied.a.if the adjustment of status application is renewed after removal proceedings have been initiated,as would have been the procedure in freeman situation,an ij rather than the district director would review and rule upon the application.see agyeman ins,cir a.
with respect to these renewal and review procedures,there is no exception in the statute or regulations for aliens who are in the united states under any particular status the procedures apply to any applicant for adjustment of status.nor does the vwp clause on its face clearly exempt vwp visitors from these procedures.see jama immigration customs enforcement,d we do not lightly assume that congress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends to apply.indeed,having granted vwp visitors the right to seek an adjustment of status,it makes no sense for congress to have intended that these preferred definition,citizens of certain favored have status once they enter into the adjustment of status process.see crandal ball,ball brosamer,cir a statute should be read in a manner which attribute s a rational purpose to the legislature.
we decline the government invitation to read the vwp restriction into the adjustment of status procedural regime,effectively denying vwp applicants the procedural due process all other applicants enjoy,when congress has not done so explicitly.had congress intended such a result,it could have withheld the adjustment of status right from vwp entrants or specified,within the adjustment of status regime,that they constitute a special class of applicants without the normal rights of appeal and review.see united states jones,cir a statutory grant of power carries with it,by implication,everything necessary to carry out the power and make it effectual and complete.blue cross ass harris,cir it is a commonplace of statutory construction that a legislative grant of power carries with it the right to use the means and instrumentalities necessary to the beneficial exercise of that power.accordingly,alleged errors in dhs adjudication of freeman application for lpr status should be subject to review as part of the adjustment of status process,and not foreclosed by the vwp clause.
moreover,the purpose of the adjustment of status procedures is best served by allowing vwp right to contest their summary denial without having to leave the united states first the adjustment procedure of section was specifically designed to obviate the need for departure and reentry in the cases of aliens temporarily in the united states it seems clear that section was intended to permit nonimmigrants to attain permanent resident status without leaving the united states.matter of s,wl bia internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
finally,the agency own actions are relevant to and consistent with our interpretation of the scope of the vwp clause.defenders of wildlife norton,cir nor do we owe deference to the interpretation of the statute now advocated by the secretary minted,it seems,for this lawsuit,and inconsistent with prior agency we ordinarily will not defer to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.after filing her adjustment of status application,freeman received work authorization,suggesting that the immigration authorities no longer considered her a vwp entrant,but instead treated her like any other adjustment of status applicant,including no longer being subject to a stay limit.see a describing a vwp entrant as a tourist a b describing a vwp entrant as an alien other than one coming for the purpose of study or of performing skilled or unskilled labor having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning and who is visiting the united states temporarily for business or temporarily for pleasure.
based on c grant of the right to vwp entrants to adjust their status,reinforced by the statute purpose and the agency granting of her work permit,we conclude that upon the proper filing of an adjustment of status application,freeman was assimilated into the adjustment of status procedural regime.her rights to review of her review of the dhs director determination of her status as a not subject to the visa waiver program clause.
iii.adjustment of status 
jurisdiction 
although the parties did not raise the question of our jurisdiction,we have raised it sua sponte,as we must.wmx tech.miller,cir.notwithstanding the real id act limitation on appellate review,see,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review freeman purely legal claim that the district director violated her due process rights by improperly interpreting b a i to determine that she was no longer the spouse of a citizen and therefore not entitled to adjustment of status.see wong ins,cir d ecisions made on a purely legal basis may be reviewed,as they do not turn on discretionary judgment the a b bar on review of discretionary decisions does not apply to cases rais ing only constitutional or purely legal,nondiscretionary challenges to the decisions in question.
purely legal questions,such as the proper definition of spouse under b a i,are reviewed de novo.see de martinez ashcroft,cir.
immediate relative definition 
under,a united states citizen can petition the immigration authorities to adjust the status of an alien who is an immediate relative to that of a lawful permanent resident.immediate relative is a defined term,as set forth in b a i 
for purposes of this subsection,the term immediate relatives means the children,spouses,and parents of a citizen of the united states,except that,in the case of parents,such citizens shall be at least years of age.in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the united states for at least years at the time of the citizen death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen death,the alien and each child of the alien shall be considered,for purposes of this subsection,to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen death but only if the spouse files a petition under section a a ii of this title within years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries.
the government,relying primarily on the statute second sentence in the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen,reads b a i as requir ing that in order to be an immediate relative under immigration law the alien spouse wife must have been married to the united states citizen spouse husband for at least years at the time of the citizen death.under the government proffered reading,if the citizen spouse dies before the second anniversary of the qualifying marriage,the alien spouse is no longer considered a spouse and is no longer entitled to an adjustment of status.
freeman disputes the government reading.relying on the first sentence of the statute for purposes of this section,the term immediate relative means the children,spouses,and parents,she argues that she qualified for adjustment of status as an immediate,a of her marriage to a citizen at the time her husband and she filed the forms required to initiate the adjustment of status process.she further argues that the statute does not impose a marriage requirement to be considered an spouse,nor does it void that spousal status upon her husband death.to the extent the second sentence the government invokes is relevant,it simply grants an alien spouse whose deceased citizen spouse had not filed an the right to so long as the parties were married for two years prior to the citizen death.
chevron deference 
the question for this court is which reading of the statute is government or freeman.we are mindful that the answer implicat es an agency construction of a statute which it administers,and we must initially determine whether,and to what extent,chevron deference is due.ins,d quoting chevron nrdc,d.
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
chevron,at.footnote omitted.chevron deference,however,is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.gonzales oregon,d.we should not defer to an agency interpretation of a statute if congress intent can be clearly ascertained through analysis of the language,purpose and structure of the statute.nrdc marine fisheries,cir.
here,the district director relied on in re varela,bia,in which the bia summarily ruled that by the time the wife adjustment of status petition was being determined,she was no longer a spouse of a united states citizen under because her husband death had stripped her of that status.aside from varela lack of statutory analysis,the opinion weight is further undercut by the bia later finding that it was.beyond this,the bia has not otherwise addressed the statutory question before us.in any event,the bia interpretation,to the extent it is entitled to some deference,is not a permissible construction of the statute.see ashcroft,cir if we conclude that the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue before us,we must respect the agency construction of the statute so long as it is permissible.
we conclude,through our review of the language,structure,purpose and application of the statute,that congress clearly intended an alien widow whose citizen spouse has filed the necessary forms to be and to remain an immediate relative spouse for purposes of b a i,even if the citizen spouse dies within two years of the marriage.as such,the widowed spouse remains entitled to the process that flows from a properly filed adjustment of status application.the durational language in the second sentence of b a i grants a separate right to an alien widow to,within two years of the citizen spouse death,by filing a form where the citizen spouse had not filed an immediate relative petition prior to his death.therefore,freeman,having filed all necessary forms,must be considered a spouse for purposes of her adjustment of status application.
language,structure,purpose and application of the adjustment of status process 
the starting point for our interpretation of a statute is always its language.cmty.for creative reid,d.interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.dolan united states postal service,d.in understanding and applying a regulatory scheme,we should interpret statutes to be coherent and internally consistent.see fda brown williamson tobacco,d mutschler peoples bank of,cir.
the language of the first sentence of b a i,which sets out the general definition of immediate relative,is straightforward and succinct,and expressly includes spouses.only alien parents are subject to any limitation,with the grant of immediate relative status being restricted to those whose citizen child is at least years of age.there is no comparable qualifier to be a spouse that is,a requirement that the marriage must have existed for at least two years.this fact only underscores our duty to refrain from reading a phrase into a statute when congress has left it out.where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.keene united states,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the words of congress are clear and we presume that congress meant precisely what it said the term immediate relative means the spouse of a citizen of the united states,without exception.b a i see also bedroc,llc united states,d the preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.quoting connecticut nat.bank germain,d.under the express terms of the statute,freeman qualified as the spouse of a citizen when she and her husband petitioned for adjustment of status,and absent a clear statutory provision voiding her spousal status upon her husband untimely death,she remains a surviving spouse.neither the definition of immediate relative nor the text and structure of the adjustment of status regime provides support for the government position that freeman should be stripped of her spousal status.
before we address and reject the government attempt to read the second sentence of b a i as implicitly importing a requirement into the definition of spouse,we turn to the structure of the adjustment of status procedure that was initiated when the freeman filed their adjustment of status forms.the immigration statute provides that a ny citizen of the united states claiming that an alien is entitled to immediate relative status under section b a i of this title may file a petition with the attorney general for such classification.a a i.a citizen spouse is generally eligible,without exception,to file a petition on behalf of his alien spouse so long as the marriage was not fraudulent and the marriage was not entered into while the alien was in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,or judicial proceedings relating thereto.a ii iii see also dabaghian civiletti,cir if a marriage is not sham or fraudulent from its inception,it is valid for the purposes of determining eligibility for adjustment of status under of the immigration and nationality act until it is legally dissolved.the critical form the citizen spouse must file in order to seek of his alien spouse is the form,petition for alien relative,establishing his citizenship and that the alien seeking adjustment is an immediate relative.see a.along with the citizen filing,the alien must file a form seeking adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident,relying on the citizen petition attesting to the alien status as his spouse.see a upon submission of these two forms,no additional forms are expected to be filed by the citizen and alien spouses the government points to nothing in this procedure suggesting that the properly filed forms are entirely voided upon the citizen petitioner death.
it is undisputed that and freeman adequately followed this procedure and filed the necessary forms and,and that their marriage was neither a sham nor fraudulent.the government also tells us that,had dhs addressed the freemans application before freeman died,the adjustment of status could have been granted even though they had not been married for two years.nonetheless,by the time dhs did reach the petition freeman was a widow and,in dhs view,no longer a spouse eligible for lpr status because her marriage did not meet a requirement.the government infers this requirement from the second sentence of b a i,which it reads as governing all cases where the immigration authorities have not yet adjudicated a widow pending adjustment of status application.the government position is that regardless of there being no minimum to qualify either as a spouse for filing or for being granted an adjustment of status,if the citizen spouse dies short of a marriage and before dhs has acted,his alien spouse opportunity for adjustment of status dies with him because the alien is no longer an immediate relative of a citizen we can not accept this untenable interpretation.dabaghian,at the word spouses in b a i includes the parties to all marriages that are legally valid and not sham.there is no exception for marriages that the ins thinks are factually dead at the time of adjustment.
the more logical and statutorily substantiated interpretation of the second sentence is that it applies to those aliens whose citizen spouses did not initiate an adjustment of status proceeding before t
