in the first of two consolidated appeals filed in this juvenile dependency case,shanna mother challenges a predispositional restraining order issued against her pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.all further statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise indicated.she contends that violent behavior is a prerequisite for the issuance of a restraining order,and because she neither engaged in nor threatened violence,the restraining order was not supported by substantial evidence,and the juvenile court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing it.the second appeal challenges the court orders at disposition maintaining the restraining order in full force and effect.
respondent seeks dismissal of the appeals,asserting that the issues are moot because the restraining order expired on its own terms on june,because the issuance of the restraining order could have consequences for mother in this and future court proceedings,we find that the issues presented in mother first appeal are not moot and warrant review on the merits.however,mother second appeal from the juvenile court orders maintaining the restraining order was rendered moot by the expiration of the restraining order,and that appeal will be dismissed.moreover,because the restraining order was directly appealable,mother challenge to the issuance of the restraining order in her second appeal from the disposition order is untimely.
we find that substantial evidence supported issuance of the restraining order and affirm the juvenile court order.
factual and procedural background 
cassandra first came to the attention of the los angeles county department of children and family services the department on october,when she was removed from her mother home following her mother involuntary hospitalization for psychiatric evaluation.the previous day,mother had been found kneeling in the middle of the street with her hands folded,praying to the sky.mother told the officer who found her that she was the virgin mary.mother was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation and released the next day.cassandra was placed with her stepfather,douglas,and his girlfriend,mona 
mother,who has a drug history,told the social worker she had been clean for several years,but admitted using methamphetamine on october and.mother also told the social worker she had begun hearing voices in october.she described feeling the bed shake,seeing movements in her house,and feeling like she was being shoved.mother believed it was possible the neighbors had inserted a camera into her television to create the voices she was hearing.when asked about her drug usage,mother attributed her behavior on october to a chemical imbalance,claiming she had never had this sort of reaction before.
on october,the department filed a petition pursuant to section on cassandra behalf.the petition alleged that mother history of substance abuse and current use of methamphetamine rendered her incapable of providing regular care for cassandra.in addition,mother ongoing auditory hallucinations endangered cassandra physical and emotional health and safety,placing her at risk of physical and emotional harm.at the detention hearing on october,the juvenile court ordered cassandra detained with her stepfather.the court further ordered reunification services for mother,and granted monitored visitation for mother,with the department given discretion to liberalize her visits.
on november,cassandra attorney requested that the court issue a temporary restraining order tro against mother because mother has been harassing the child and her caretakers.in a declaration attached to the proposed tro,mona stated,since cassandra has been placed in our home,we have received numerous phone calls from cassandra mother.she has called our home so many times that our voice mailbox is full and we are unable to access our voice mail system.in her messages she blames us for the removal of her daughter by the courts,and has stated that she was going to pick up cassandra from school.mother also called douglas,leaving numerous messages.in one message,mother threatened to see to it that douglas sic son matthew was taken away from him if cassandra were placed in a foster home.
mona further stated that on october,mother went to douglas apartment when cassandra was home with a babysitter,but was prevented from entering the building by a security guard.the following day,mother was seen near cassandra school just as it was letting out.douglas had already picked up cassandra,and mother followed them from the school.on both of these occasions mother was accompanied by an unknown individual.
cassandra stated she was afraid of mother,who had told her she was going to come and get her at school.when mother called cassandra on the phone,she would yell at her.despite their previous willingness to monitor mother visits with cassandra,douglas and mona stated they no longer felt comfortable doing so due to mother behavior and threats,fearing that mother would try to take cassandra during a monitored visit.
on november,the juvenile court heard argument from mother counsel against the tro.the attorney explained that mother had been frustrated because visitation with cassandra had not been arranged as ordered,and mother had called the caregivers because they were to monitor her visits with cassandra.but once advised by counsel that she should not have ongoing direct contact with the caregivers,mother agreed that despite her right to visitation,she was going about it the wrong way.counsel pointed out that there was no indication that the caregivers had any problems with mother since counsel had spoken with mother,and mother had had no contact at all with cassandra,douglas,mona,or matthew since october.
the court granted the tro on november,requiring mother to stay yards from cassandra,douglas,mona,and matthew,including their residence,place of work,school,and vehicles.mother was further ordered not to harass,attack,strike,threaten,assault sexually or otherwise,hit,follow,stalk,molest,destroy personal property,disturb the peace,keep under surveillance,or block movements of the protected parties.except for brief and peaceful contact as required for court ordered visitation,mother was also ordered not to contact,directly or indirectly,by telephone or messages,or the protected parties.
on november,cassandra counsel informed the court that despite the issuance of the tro,douglas had continued to receive telephone calls from mother on his cell phone,and mother continued to tell cassandra she was going to take her to northern california.counsel reported that it was very difficult for cassandra to hear mother statements that she was going to take her away,and cassandra was concerned about her mother behavior.the court read the tro requirements to mother,and ordered her not to discuss the case with cassandra or make promises concerning the court order until a disposition had been entered.
the department november,report stated that mother left messages on the social worker phone in one day.during one conversation with the social worker,mother insisted that cassandra had been wrongfully removed from her,and she planned to do something about it.mother told the social worker she had decided to move to northern california with cassandra to start a new life.the social worker explained to mother that the juvenile court had jurisdiction over cassandra,and mother could not take cassandra to another city,but mother insisted that she was going to northern california with her daughter.
the report stated that when cassandra learned that her mother wanted to take her to northern california,she appeared to be fearful,and said,i do want to go with her to northern california.i want to stay with doug.do i have to go the social worker told cassandra she would not be going to northern california,and cassandra said,what if she comes to my school to get me cassandra appeared to be relieved that the school had been advised not to release cassandra to her mother,and she would not be going with her mother.cassandra told the social worker she did not want to live with her mother,and she did not want to have a lot of visits either because she was afraid her mother was going to kidnap her.
on december,the petition was sustained.cassandra counsel reported that despite the tro,mother had continued to call douglas and threaten to pick cassandra up from school,and she had not honored the schedule the social worker had set up for calling cassandra.mother denied threatening anyone.she argued that the restraining order was inappropriate because there was no report from cassandra school that mother had been there and the caregiver declaration supporting the restraining order contained only speculation that mother might go to the school.
the court granted a restraining order against mother consistent with the tro previously issued,to expire on june.the court further ordered that mother was entitled to reasonable visitation with a monitor in a neutral setting.the disposition hearing was continued to february.
on january,mother filed a notice of appeal from the court december,restraining order.
at the disposition hearing on february,the court ordered all prior orders to remain in full force and effect,and continued the matter to march,for a contested disposition hearing.the department reported that mother had moved to northern california in early january,and her occasional telephone calls with cassandra had been appropriate.at the march,disposition hearing,mother counsel argued that there had been no incidents since the issuance of the restraining order and the order should be terminated.over mother objection,the court ordered that the restraining order remain in effect until it expired,but allowed mother to have reasonable telephone contact and monitored visits with cassandra.
mother second appeal from the court december,february,and march,orders followed.
the restraining order expired by its own terms on june,
discussion 
the restraining order is directly appealable.
the department contends that an order issuing a restraining order is not directly appealable,and requests that we treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.mother argues that the order is directly appealable because the requirement in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b that the juvenile court may issue an ex parte restraining order upon application in the manner provided by section of the code of civil procedure allows an appeal in accordance with the code of civil procedure.but code of civil procedure section makes no reference to appeal rights 
t he scope of a party right to appeal is completely a creature of statute.in re daniel th,d.in exercising its complete control over the right to appeal,the legislature may restrict,change,withhold or even abolish that right.melinda superior court th,d.the right to appeal in juvenile dependency cases is governed by section,which provides in pertinent part a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment.
courts have held that welfare and institutions code section should be interpreted to be in harmony,to the extent possible,with basic appellate principles such as the one final judgment rule,codified in code of civil procedure section.in re debra d.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.consistent with this principle,there is general agreement that i n juvenile dependency matters,all orders starting chronologically with the dispositional order are,with the exception of an order setting a section hearing,appealable judgments.citation.in re daniel,supra,th at,d melinda superior court,supra,th,d.in in re natasha th,d,the court declared that the basic appellate principles codified in code of civil procedure sections through apply in juvenile dependency proceedings,at least to the extent not inconsistent therewith.see code civ,in re brittany th,d code civ,in re andrew d.code civ.while appeal rights with regard to injunctions are not addressed under juvenile dependency law,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a specifically allows a direct appeal from an order granting an injunction.
under these principles,we hold that a restraining order issued in a juvenile dependency proceeding is directly appealable to the same extent as a restraining order granted in a civil action.code civ,subd.a see brydon city of hermosa beach,the intent of the statute is that all orders granting or refusing injunctions,whether temporary or permanent or provisional pending appeal,shall be appealable.accordingly,mother challenge to the restraining order in this case is subject to review on direct appeal from the order granting the restraining order.
our conclusion that the restraining order was directly appealable means that mother challenge to the juvenile court issuance of the restraining order in her second appeal,filed on april,is untimely.an appeal from the most recent order entered in a dependency matter may not challenge prior orders for which the statutory time for filing an appeal has passed.citations.in re daniel,supra,th at,d.the notice of appeal must be filed within days after the juvenile court makes an appealable order.cal.rules of court,rules b,f.here,while mother first appeal from the juvenile court december,issuance of the restraining order,filed on january,was within the statutory time limit,her second appeal was not.
although the restraining order has already expired,mother first appeal should not be dismissed as moot.
the department has renewed its request that mother appeals be dismissed on the ground that the expiration of the restraining order on june,has rendered both appeals moot.in this regard,the department contends that dismissal is required where,as here,subsequent events have rendered the controversy moot and there remains no effectual relief to grant.consol.united cal d,finnie town of tiburon d.mother counters that the question of the propriety of the restraining order is not moot because its issuance in the first instance could have consequences for mother in this and future court proceedings.we agree with mother,and conclude that the issuance of the restraining order in this case warrants review on the merits.see haywood superior court th,d appeal is not mooted by subsequent events when these events leave a material question affecting the parties unresolved.
before a hearing on the issuance of an order pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,the juvenile court is required to conduct a search as described in family code section,subdivision a.family code section,subdivision a in turn provides prior to a hearing on the issuance or denial of an order under this part,the court shall ensure that a search is or has been conducted to determine if the subject of the proposed order has any prior restraining order.under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision k,the juvenile court must consider the existence of the prior restraining order in determining whether to issue another one against the same party prior to deciding whether to issue an order under this part,the court shall consider the following information obtained pursuant to a search conducted under paragraph any prior restraining order and any violation of a prior restraining order.
the existence of the prior restraining order must be considered by the juvenile court in any proceeding to issue another restraining order against mother.this consequence of the restraining order leaves unresolved a material question affecting the parties,and mother challenge to the issuance of the restraining order is therefore not moot 
mother appeal from the juvenile court orders maintaining the restraining order is another matter,however.because the restraining order has already expired,the orders maintaining it carry no consequences for mother apart from those arising from the issuance of the restraining order in the first instance.thus,only mother challenge to the issuance of the restraining order presents any justiciable issue on appeal the expiration of the restraining order has rendered mother second appeal moot and there remains no effectual relief to grant with respect to the juvenile court orders mai
