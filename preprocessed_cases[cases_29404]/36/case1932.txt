we have for review department of children family services,so d dca,a decision of the fifth district court of appeal on the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance and which we have rephrased 
are the procedures applicable to criminal cases to be followed in cases involving termination of parental rights 
we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we conclude that anders procedures do not apply to termination of parental rights cases and,therefore,answer the rephrased certified question in the negative.
the anders framework 
in,the united states supreme court decided anders and held that counsel appointed to represent an indigent criminal defendant could not withdraw from representation during the appeal by merely advising the appellate court in a letter that the appeal had no merit.see at.the anders case was part of a continuing line of cases that had reached the united states supreme court concerning discrimination against the indigent criminal defendant on first appeal.id.at.in order to protect the indigent criminal defendant right to appellate counsel established in douglas california,d,the supreme court set forth a procedure to be used in those cases where appointed counsel determines an appeal to be wholly frivolous 
i f counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous,after a conscientious examination of it,he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.that request must,however,be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.a copy of counsel brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points that he chooses the proceeds,after a full examination of all the proceedings,to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.if it so finds it may grant counsel request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned,or proceed to a decision on the merits,if state law so requires.on the other hand,if it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits and therefore not frivolous it must,prior to decision,afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.
anders,at.emphasis supplied.
in,this court adopted the precise procedure set forth in the original supreme court opinion in anders for criminal appeals in this state.see state wooden,so d,abrogated on other grounds,state district court of appeal,so d,see also in re anders briefs,so d.the supreme court has since clarified that the procedure set forth in anders is merely one method of satisfying the requirements of the constitution for indigent criminal appeals.smith robbins,d.
although this court has not yet reevaluated its current anders procedures in light of smith,this court recently extended the use of the anders procedure to appeals of involuntary civil commitment to a mental health facility where an individual physical liberty is at stake.see pullen state,so d.the issue now before us is whether this court should mandate anders procedures in termination of parental rights appeals,which would require the appellate court to conduct an independent review of the record in cases where appointed counsel has concluded that an appeal would be frivolous.
in this case,the fifth district granted the appointed attorney motion to withdraw from representation of a parent in a termination of parental rights case,after that attorney determined in good faith that there were no valid issues to appeal and that any appeal would be frivolous.see,so d at.however,in light of this court opinion in pullen,the fifth district certified the question to this court as to whether the anders procedures should be followed in termination of parental rights proceedings.
before our decision in pullen,those district courts of appeal addressing the issue had concluded that the anders procedure for criminal appeals was not applicable to termination of parental rights cases.in ostrum department of health rehabilitative services,so d dca,the fourth district held that the full panoply of anders procedures is unnecessary in the appellate review of these cases.so d at.the fourth district also found that the need to resolve issues involving the legal status of children quickly and to refrain from unduly burdening the caseload of the appellate courts weighed against imposition of the more time consuming anders procedures.see id.the second,third,and fifth districts have likewise declined to extend anders to termination of parental rights cases.see in re,so d,dca in re so d,dca jimenez dep t of health rehabilitative,so d,dca.we agree with the district courts of appeal that anders procedures should not be mandated in termination of parental rights cases.
the anders decision addressed the specific issue of the indigent criminal defendant right to a meaningful first appeal.see at.has cited no research,and we are unaware of any research,that indicates that the same concerns in criminal appeals that led to the anders decision are present today,more than thirty years later,in termination of parental rights proceedings so as to mandate comparable appellate oversight.
as stated above,the anders procedures adopted in this state require that counsel set forth in a brief anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.wooden,so d at quoting anders,at.these procedures then require the court after a full examination of all the proceedings,to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.id.at.quoting anders,at.absent the compelling concerns expressed by the united states supreme court in anders,we can not justify thrusting appellate courts into a position that represents a departure from the court traditional role as a neutral decision maker.as the fourth district aptly observed 
anders represents a radical departure from the traditional role of appellate judges as neutral decision makers without bias or prejudice for or against any party.instead,it turns them into advocates for the party whose counsel seeks to withdraw.whatever may be the rationale for requiring that departure from neutrality in criminal cases,we are quite unwilling to allow it in purely civil matters.
ostrum,so d at see also in re anders briefs,so d at stating that once a motion to withdraw is filed and the defendant is given the opportunity to file a pro se brief,t he appellate court assumes the responsibility of conducting a full and independent review of the record.
although we do not minimize the significant interests at stake in parental rights termination proceedings,the essential difference between termination proceedings and both criminal proceedings and civil commitment proceedings is that termination proceedings do not involve the risk of loss of physical liberty.further,there are two interests that must be weighed in a termination proceeding that of the parent and that of the child the fourth district recognized both of these distinguishing factors in ostrum when it noted that termination of parental rights cases are not criminal in nature.they are civil proceedings which happen to affect the substantial interests of the parents and children involved.so d at.
in addition,the records in termination of parental rights cases are often extensive and extremely this contrasts with the typical case in a criminal anders appeal and with this court observation in pullen as to the civil commitment proceeding at issue in that case 
the state noted in both its brief and at oral argument that civil commitment hearings under the baker act are usually brief and factually straightforward and v ery rarely is the person mental illness contested.instead,the state contends,the most common points on appeal assert that evidence as to the person likelihood to harm himself or others does not meet the clear and convincing standard.thus,we do not agree with the state contention that the independent appellate court review which is part of the procedure will cause an undue burden to the court or result in unnecessary delay.
pullen,so d at.requiring appellate courts to review extensive records in termination of parental rights cases to determine whether there are any meritorious issues to appeal would add to both the burden placed on the appellate courts and the delay in bringing the termination of parental rights proceeding to conclusion without a concomitant showing of need to protect the constitutional rights of parents.
although we recognize that mere speed of operation and speed for the purpose of expediency,concurring in result op.at,do not outweigh other important values of our system of justice,such as a fair opportunity for an indigent parent to pursue a meaningful appeal of an order terminating parental rights,we do not believe that extending anders procedures to termination of parental rights appeals serves those higher values.further,considering the test of mathews eldridge,d,we conclude that there is no due process violation in failing to require that the anders procedure be followed in appeals from termination of parental rights proceedings davis,so d,t he extent of procedural due process protections varies with the character of the interest and nature of the proceeding involved.quoting in re,so d.accordingly,we decline to extend the anders procedure to termination of parental rights proceedings.we conclude that the procedure is not constitutionally mandated and any potential benefits from the anders procedure in the context of termination of parental rights proceedings are outweighed by the delay in the disposition of the case and the consequent potential detriment to the child from any additional delay in finalizing the permanent placement of the child.
we next address what procedure should be followed when appointed counsel seeks to withdraw from representation of an indigent parent in a termination of parental rights appeal.the fourth district adopted the following procedure 
it will be enough for appellate counsel to file a motion seeking leave to withdraw as counsel for the parent whose rights have been terminated w here appellate counsel seeks leave to withdraw,we can then give the party a period of time in which to argue the case without an attorney.if the party then fails to file a brief within the time period granted for that purpose,we will conclude that the party no longer wishes to prosecute the appeal and dismiss for failure to prosecute.if the party has filed a brief,we will review the brief and if it fails to present a preliminary basis for reversal we will summarily affirm under rule.when we find that the party brief presents a preliminary basis for reversal,the case will then proceed as any ordinary appeal.
ostrum,so d at.the procedure enunciated by the fourth district in ostrum does not explicitly state that appellate counsel motion to withdraw must contain a certification that he or she has conducted a conscientious review of the record and could find no meritorious grounds on which to base an appeal.however,we interpreted ostrum as including this requirement in our decision in pullen,see so d at,and this requirement is consistent with the fifth district decision in 
w e shall adhere to the ostrum procedure which requires service of a motion to withdraw on the client,certification in that motion to this court that counsel in good faith has discovered no valid error below,and an opportunity for the client to file a brief on his or her own behalf,or through subsequently retained counsel.
so d at.accordingly,we approve the procedures set forth in ostrum and.as to the certification required,we specifically hold that where appellate counsel seeks leave to withdraw from representation of an indigent parent in a termination of parental rights case,the motion to withdraw shall be served on the client and contain a certification that after a conscientious review of the record the attorney has determined in good faith that there are no meritorious grounds on which to base an appeal.the parent shall then be provided the opportunity to file a brief on his or her own behalf.
based on the foregoing,we answer the certified question in the negative and approve the decision of the fifth district court of appeal.
it is so ordered.
this court has recognized a constitutionally protected interest in the context of juvenile dependency proceedings,and the important fundamental nature of the interest at risk when permanent termination of parental rights might result.we have held that the fundamental interest at stake requires procedural safeguards and the appointment of counsel for indigents under due process considerations commensurate with those granted criminal defendants and individuals subject to civil commitment.see pullen state,so d in re,so d see also florida dep t of children family,so d.while the right to counsel may flow from,and have its origins in,the sixth amendment in the criminal context and concepts of due process under the united states and florida constitutions in the dependency arena,the goal to be achieved is the participation of counsel acting as competent counsel.although it may be argued that the sixth amendment right to counsel may be somewhat distinguished from the right to counsel in dependency proceedings flowing from due process considerations,in that the extent of protections may vary with the character of the interest and nature of the proceeding involved,the underlying substantive constitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process can only be realized when counsel is performing as an active advocate.this court made no distinctions when it announced the governmental obligation to provide counsel when constitutionally required to do so in the dependency context.see,so d at.
the concept at issue in anders california,d,was a concern with the extent of the duty of appellate counsel,and the result was not dictated simply by the source of the appointment.the anders court reasoned 
the constitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process can only be attained where counsel acts in the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client,as opposed to that of amicus curiae.the letter and the procedure it triggers do not reach that dignity.counsel should,and can with honor and without conflict,be of more assistance to his client and to the court.his role as advocate requires that he support his client appeal to the best of his ability.
id.at.footnote omitted.the power of anders,which should be no less controlling here,counsels that 
this procedure will assure penniless defendants the same rights and opportunities on nearly as is are enjoyed by those persons who are able to afford the retention of private counsel.
id.at.i do not agree with the majority that the alleged putative administrative burden of procedures in the direct appeal of permanent parental rights terminations is so onerous that it must trump fundamental due process constitutional rights.if the rights and interests are identified as deserving the same constitutional protection with the right to appointed counsel,it is the procedure that should be analyzed,not the process denied.i conclude that principles of constitutional consistency should mandate the granting of protections in permanent parental rights termination appeals,and would so hold in the instant case.the evil to be addressed is the lack of equality in the process.
the united states supreme court has made it clear many times that the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized.troxel granville,d.this interest,which emanates from the fundamental right to privacy,is among associational rights the supreme court has ranked as of basic importance in our society,rights sheltered by the fourteenth amendment against the state unwarranted usurpation,disregard,or disrespect,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also moore city of east cleveland,d stanley illinois,d.we have echoed the pronouncements of the supreme court when deciding cases which concern the fundamental rights of parents with regard to their children.see,florida dep t of children family,so d,von eiff azicri,so d,in re,so d,padgett dep t of health rehabilitative,so d.indeed,this court has noted that florida constitutional right to privacy is much broader in scope,embraces more privacy inter
