angelika taschen,a german citizen,filed a petition for dissolution of her marriage to benedikt taschen,also a german citizen,in los angeles county superior court.angelika later moved to dismiss or stay the dissolution action on the grounds that los angeles is an inconvenient forum.the trial court granted the motion and stayed the action,and benedikt appeals.
after rejecting angelika argument that the appeal is untimely,we hold that because angelika is a party to the dissolution action,she had a statutory right to bring a forum non conveniens motion,and her motion was not barred by waiver or judicial estoppel.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting angelika motion,so we affirm the trial court order.
background 
angelika and benedikt are citizens of germany.they were married in europe on september.benedikt is the president of taschen gmbh,a company headquartered in germany but with offices in several other countries,including the united states.angelika has been employed by taschen gmbh for the last years.angelika and benedikt own two homes in los angeles,and for several years they have lived part time in germany and part time in los angeles.
in april,benedikt filed for divorce in germany.benedikt alleged that he and angelika had been separated at least since march.angelika disputed that allegation,and she claims that as a result there were concerns about whether the german courts would enter a judgment of divorce.benedikt asserts that a german court will not enter a judgment of divorce unless the couple has been separated for at least one year.on september,angelika petitioned for dissolution of marriage in los angeles county superior court.benedikt subsequently dismissed the divorce action he had filed in germany.
on january,benedikt filed a motion to bifurcate the issue of marital status so that he could quickly obtain a judgment of dissolution,with the court reserving jurisdiction to determine all remaining issues,including property division.benedikt sought an expedited dissolution because he wished to marry another woman and move on with his life.
angelika opposed benedikt motion because she feared that a dissolution judgment would jeopardize her immigration status.she claimed that her visa was derivative and dependent upon her marriage to benedikt,who was the primary visa holder.angelika was consequently uncertain whether she would be able to remain in the united states after entry of a dissolution judgment,and she was concerned that her ability to litigate the rest of her dissolution action in los angeles would be impaired if she were forced to return to germany.angelika stated that t he immigration issue was the only reason she opposed benedikt bifurcation motion.at the same time,she requested that if the court were to grant the motion,it do so only on certain conditions,largely drawn from family code section.
in response to angelika opposition,benedikt argued that the immigration problem would be solved if angelika were employed by taschen america llc an american affiliate of taschen gmbh,and benedikt pledged to cooperate with angelika in any way necessary for her to obtain an independent visa on that basis.angelika expressed dissatisfaction with this approach,because she could be terminated at will under the employment contract that taschen america llc proposed,so her immigration status would remain insecure.
in the end,benedikt resolved this issue to the trial court satisfaction by attaching to the dissolution judgment an order that required taschen america llc to employ angelika and not to terminate her until a further judgment on reserved issues is entered.the attachment to the dissolution judgment also included the other conditions that angelika had requested,such as guarantees concerning health insurance and pension benefits.the trial court entered the dissolution judgment,including the attachment reflecting all of the foregoing provisions,on june.angelika never withdrew her opposition to benedikt bifurcation motion and did not consent to entry of the judgment.
meanwhile,in the month before the judgment was entered,on may,angelika filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to stay the entire action.her grounds were that the court lacked jurisdiction and that los angeles was an inconvenient forum.the basis for her forum non conveniens argument was,in essence,that the valuation of taschen gmbh would be one of the central property division issues,and numerous important witnesses and documents were located in germany or elsewhere in europe.
benedikt opposed angelika forum non conveniens motion on several grounds.in addition to arguing that the motion failed on the merits because los angeles is not a seriously inconvenient forum,he argued that only defendants or respondents are permitted to file forum non conveniens motions,and that in any event angelika motion was barred by waiver,estoppel,and laches.
by minute order entered on july,the trial court denied angelika motion to dismiss but granted her motion to stay on grounds of inconvenient forum.the minute order directed the clerk to send copies of the order to both parties on july.the minute order also directed angelika to prepare an appropriate order for the court signature.angelika complied,and the signed order was filed on august.benedikt filed his notice of appeal on october.
discussion 
the notice of appeal was timely filed 
angelika argues that benedikt did not timely file his notice of appeal,and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal.we disagree.
the minute order entered on july,was an appealable order.code civ,subd.a see also id.thus,if the clerk had mailed or one of the parties had served either a copy of that order or a document entitled notice of entry of the order,then benedikt notice of appeal would have been due within days of the date of mailing or service.cal.rules of court,rule a,f.but neither the clerk nor angelika mailed such a document to benedikt.his notice of appeal was therefore due within days of the entry of the order.cal.rules of court,rule a f.because the order itself directed that a separate written order be prepared,the entry date of the order,for purposes of determining the timeliness of benedikt notice of appeal,was not july,but rather was august,the date on which the subsequently prepared written order was filed.cal.rules of court,rule d.thus,benedikt deadline for filing his notice of appeal was days from august.he filed the notice of appeal on october,well within the time allowed.
angelika challenges this analysis in only one respect she asserts that the copy of the order that the clerk mailed to both parties on july,was file stamped.that assertion is incorrect.the final page of the order displays a notation from the superior court clerk indicating that the order was entered in the minutes on july,but that notation is not a file stamp.every order that is entered in the minutes bears such a notation of its entry.but minute orders are virtually never file stamped see,hughey city of hayward th,d,and this one was not.
because the time limits for filing a notice of appeal are jurisdictional,we must apply rule a of the california rules of court strictly and literally according to its terms the rules must stand by themselves without embroidery.century ins.superior court th,d.neither the clerk nor angelika ever mailed a copy of the minute order or a document entitled notice of entry,so the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was never triggered.benedikt filed his notice well within days of august,so his appeal is timely.
a petitioner can move to dismiss or stay on grounds of inconvenient forum 
benedikt argues that the trial court erred when it even considered the merits of anglika forum non conveniens motion,because such motions can be made only by defendants or respondents.we disagree.
a court may,in its discretion,choose to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction to hear a case if the case may be more appropriately tried elsewhere.stangvik shiley cal d,d.california codified this principle,known as forum non conveniens,in code of civil procedure section.chong superior court th,d.code of civil procedure sect
