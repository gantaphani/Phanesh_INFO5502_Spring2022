cesar,biological and presumed father of anthony and presumed father of annissa,and cesar mother,elvia,seek extraordinary relief from the order of the juvenile court refusing to place the children with elvia.they claim the social worker failed to assess elvia properly under the relative placement preference,and the juvenile court should have independently evaluated her as a placement resource rather than merely reviewing the decision of the orange county social services agency ssa for an abuse of discretion.we grant the petition.
in september,annissa and anthony were declared dependents of the juvenile court.the children,then two and three years of age,had been detained after their mother was arrested.cesar was unable to take care of the children because he was about to enter a residential drug treatment program annissa biological father was nowhere to be found.after dispositional orders were entered,the court granted cesar de facto parent status as to annissa because,although he was not her biological father,he was present at her birth,his name was on her birth certificate,and he had always cared for her and held her out as his own child.the children were placed together in a foster home.
at the review hearing for annissa,reunification services were terminated and a permanency hearing was set for july.at anthony review,however,further reunification services were offered to the parents.by july,cesar was requesting reunification services for annissa because he planned to adopt her after he reunified with anthony.the court continued annissa permanency hearing,and cesar filed a paternity petition,seeking presumed father status.
in august,the court found cesar to be annissa presumed father it vacated annissa permanency hearing and set a month review hearing for both children a week later.by then,however,cesar had been arrested on charges of burglary,petty theft and probation violation.according to his counsel,he was resigned to losing his parental rights because of his being incarcerated.however,he was adamant that he wanted the children placed with his mother he was transported in custody and stipulated to the termination of reunification services for both children.
the children foster family was not interested in adoption,necessitating a change in placement all parties stipulated to a placement evaluation of elvia.the court set a permanency hearing for both children in january and ordered ssa to evaluate paternal grandmother and paternal uncle for possible placement and any other suitable relative.
in the report filed on december,for the permanency hearing,the social worker reported the children had been placed in a prospective adoptive home on november.the social worker stated that elvia was found not to be a suitable placement due to having a car child abuse registry history dated march,for allegations of physical abuse against her son,cesar that were unsubstantiated due to an alternative plausible explanation the undersigned reviewed this child abuse report with her supervisor and decided that this would not be a stable and safe environment for the children based on what was included in the report.the social worker was also concerned that the grandmother had not been in contact with social services or the children during the dependency proceedings and that she had not followed up with paperwork necessary to have the children placed with her.the social worker met with elvia on september,and requested documentation from her boyfriend she lives with to do a background check as well as a household budget and proof of income to financially provide for the children,which was never given to the undersigned.elvia told the social worker she was moving and would call to give social services her new telephone number so the new home could be evaluated.the social worker stated there was no word from elvia until december.the undersigned went ahead to place these children in a stable home in order to not further delay providing a possible permanent home for these children.
when the court convened for the permanency hearing on january,cesar counsel challenged ssa denial of placement with elvia.after discussions on and off the record,the parties stipulated to proceed in a bifurcated fashion and resolve cesar challenge to placement before the permanency issues.cesar counsel was allowed to make an oral motion that ssa abused its discretion in the reevaluation and assessment of the grandmother pursuant to the order made on september.over the next two weeks,the court heard five days of testimony and argument on the issue.
the social worker,julie fulkerson,testified elvia called her after the september court hearing fulkerson returned the call and set up the september meeting at elvia home.they discussed background clearance information and household budget issues,and fulkerson explained elvia would receive forms that needed to be filled out.the forms were sent to elvia days later by a social worker assistant.on september,cesar counsel called fulkerson and asked her to follow up on the relative placement issue.fulkerson called elvia the next day reminding her to call with her new address and telephone number.
on september,fulkerson received the car report from.although she felt the report might disqualify elvia,she did not speak to elvia,cesar,or any other witnesses to the reported incidents.fulkerson reviewed the report with her supervisor in maybe early october,and they determined elvia was unsuitable based on the report as well as over time not hearing from her,not getting other information,documentation,background information from her boyfriend,household budget.there was no response from her at all.fulkerson later testified the primary reason for not placing the children with elvia was her lack of relationship with the children throughout dependency proceedings.elvia called fulkerson on december,and fulkerson returned the call on december,informing elvia that the children had been placed elsewhere.
fulkerson denied receiving calls from cesar counsel or an ssa court officer in october.she acknowledged receiving a telephone message from cesar counsel on november,asking about progress on placing the children with elvia,but instead of returning the call,fulkerson called the deputy county counsel on the case and asked her to direct information to cesar counsel with regard to the placement issues.both cesar counsel and the ssa court officer called fulkerson on december asking about placement both calls were referred to county counsel.fulkerson testified she had talked to her supervisor about the case and he told me it standard protocol to go ahead and call your county counsel and direct it that way.the court sustained relevancy objections to cesar counsel questions about the protocol of social workers refusing to speak directly to other parties counsel.
the children prospective adoptive family first saw pictures of the children on september,at a family night sponsored by ssa.the children met the family on november and were placed with them a week later.fulkerson testified the family had the resources necessary to meet the children special education needs.these foster parents had a lot of background information,with their own son needing the specific education needs.she also considered that the foster mother is an foster mother and she readily available to meet the needs of the two children in the home.cesar counsel objected to fulkerson testimony as irrelevant.this is not relating to the parents.it regarding the appropriateness of analyzing the placement of the grandmother.this is not a who better test.the court overruled the objection,stating that the relative placement preference statute did not apply after the termination of reunification services a nd in addition,in this instance we are looking at abuse of discretion with respect to placement issues.and certainly one aspect of abuse of discretion is a consideration that was given to the needs of the child and the needs that these prospective adoptive parents could meet.
elvia testified she had almost daily contact with the children before the dependency proceedings were initiated and she saw the children during the first part of the dependency when cesar was allowed unmonitored visits.she did not ask for visits for herself because she thought she was not entitled and she thought cesar would reunify with them.when fulkerson met with elvia in september,she asked me questions about my income,and how i would provide for the kids.and then she asked me about my boyfriend income.and i told her i did not have that information at that time.fulkerson told elvia she would send some paperwork,but elvia claimed it never arrived.she testified she made several calls to fulkerson between september and december,but the calls were not returned.she had planned to move into a house she was purchasing in november,but the escrow fell through.she ultimately moved in december into another house she is purchasing.
the juvenile court found ssa acted upon its order to assess elvia as a placement resource.it determined that welfare and institutions code section applied and that the question before it was whether ssa abused its discretion under the statute.given the information available to ssa,which the court found was credible to the point it was not unreasonable for the agency to act on it,balanced against elvia conduct,the court found ssa did not abuse its discretion in denying placement.
cesar counsel then filed a section petition alleging new evidence showing elvia suitability as a placement for the children.the petition incorporated offers of proof from an independent clinical social worker and elvia former landlady which confirmed elvia good moral character and her parenting abilities,and provided an assessment of her new home.the court denied a hearing on the petition,finding it did not make a prima facie showing of how the relief sought would be in the best interests of the children.
ii.relative placement preference 
cesar and elvia first contend ssa never completed the relative placement evaluation it was ordered to perform at the review hearing on september.they are joined in this contention by counsel for both anthony and annissa,who urged at oral argument before this court that elvia evaluation should be completed.cesar and elvia also contend even if the evaluation were complete,the juvenile court used the wrong standard in reviewing ssa refusal to place the children with elvia.they claim under section the court should have used its independent judgment to evaluate the grandmother rather than merely reviewing ssa actions for an abuse of discretion.ssa,on the other hand,contends section was not applicable because reunification services had been terminated,but that in any event,the juvenile court correctly evaluated ssa decisions under the abuse of discretion standard.
section applies before parental rights are terminated.
it is that the relative placement preference found in section does not apply after parental rights have been terminated and the child has been freed for adoption.in in re sarah th,d,the court compared that statute to section,subdivision k,which provides that a relative caretaker or foster parent of a dependent child shall be given preference in applying to adopt the child.s ection assures interested relatives that,when a child is taken from her parents and placed outside the home pending the determination whether reunification is possible,the relative application will be considered before a stranger application when reunification fails,section,subdivision k,assures a relative caretaker who has cared for the child that,when parental rights are terminated and the child is freed for adoption,his or her application will be considered before those submitted by other relatives and strangers.id.at,d see also in re baby girl d.
here,the question is whether the relative placement preference applies when a new placement becomes necessary after reunification services are terminated but before parental rights are terminated and adoptive placement becomes an issue.citing language from several cases,ssa urges the underlying purpose of the relative placement preference is to facilitate reunification,and that purpose no longer obtains once reunification services are terminated.t he object of dispositional hearings is to find a temporary caretaker who will meet the child physical and psychological needs while cooperating in reunification efforts.a relative,who presumably has a broader interest in family unity,is more likely than a stranger to be supportive of the relationship and less likely to develop a conflicting emotional bond with the child.when a case moves from reunification to permanency planning,however,and a court determines that a child should be freed for adoption,we hold there is no longer any reason to give relatives preferential consideration in placement.in re jessica d,quoting in re baby girl,supra,d at.see also in re robert th,d.
these cases,however,were decided under a previous version of section.in,the statute was amended to include subdivision d,which specifically provides for the application of the relative placement preference if a child must be moved after disposition,to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable and who will fulfill the child reunification or permanent plan requirements,subd.d,emphasis added.in,the statute was again amended to add the ability of the relative to p rovide legal permanence for the child if reunification fails to the list of factors that must be considered when evaluating a relative for placement,subd.a h,emphasis added.these additions to the statute indicate the legislature did not intend to limit the purpose of the relative placement preference to reunification efforts.
ssa evaluation of elvia was not sufficient under section.
section gives preferential consideration to a relative request for placement,which means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated,subd.c.the assessment of the relative shall involve the consideration of eight factors set out in the statute,including t he good moral character of the relative and any other adult living in the home,including whether any individual residing in the home has a prior history of violent criminal acts or has been responsible for acts of child abuse or neglect and t he safety of the relative home.for purposes of this paragraph,the county social worker shall conduct a direct assessment of the safety of the relative home.the information obtained as a result of this assessment shall be documented by the county social worker in the child case record,subd.a a.the statute reiterates the county social worker shall document these efforts to assess the relative according to the statutory factors in the social study prepared pursuant to section,subd.a.
the record shows the social worker did not make significant efforts to gather the required information before deciding elvia was unsuitable and abandoning the assessment.furthermore,the social worker began looking for another foster family before elvia had even received ssa forms.this approach is clearly not within the spirit of the statute.while we understand the urgency involved in securing a stable placement for dependent children,ssa is required to give a fair chance to a relative seeking placement.the correct application of the relative placement preference places the relative at the head of the line when the court is determining which placement is in the child best interests.in re sarah,supra,th at,d.
section requires the juvenile court independent judgment.
when section applies to a relative placement request,the juvenile court must exercise its independent judgment rather than merely review ssa placement decision for an abuse of discretion.the statute itself directs both the county social worker and court to consider the propriety of relative placement,subd.a.the cases,too,discuss the relative placement preference in the context of an independent determination by the juvenile court.t he statute expresse s a command that relatives be assessed and considered favorably,subject to the juvenile court consideration of the suitability of the relative home and the best interests of the child.in re stephanie cal th,d,emphasis omitted.
