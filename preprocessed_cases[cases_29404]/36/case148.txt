opinion of the court 
in,after fourteen years of marriage,ira kukafka abandoned his wife and four children in new jersey and fled to florida where he shared an apartment with his mother.eight years later,owing over in outstanding child support,kukafka was indicted by a new jersey grand jury for willful failure to pay his support obligation in violation of the federal child support recovery act.kukafka was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison and in restitution.on appeal,kukafka primary challenge is that,following the supreme court decision in united states morrison,d,the child support recovery act exceeds congress power under the commerce clause.he also contends that a provision in his divorce judgment requiring him to obtain an ecclesiastical divorce violates the free exercise clause of the first amendment.further,he claims that the district court jury instruction on willfulness improperly stated the government burden of proof.we reject these contentions and will affirm the judgment of conviction.
background 
ira kukafka is a trained electrical engineer,with an undergraduate degree from the city university of new york and a master degree from fairleigh dickinson university.he also has several credits toward a phd at the new jersey institute of technology.during the and,kukafka worked as an engineer for at t and then for the united states army.in,he married esther bailey and moved to a house in oakhurst,new jersey.the couple have four children.
in,kukafka left engineering to go into the real estate business with his,harry bailey.after ten years,and facing increasing financial difficulty,the partnership dissolved because of a bad real estate venture.the bank foreclosed on kukafka house,which had been used as collateral for part of the deal,forcing him and his family to move in with his.over the next two years,financial difficulties and family pressures led to problems in kukafka marriage.he worked only intermittently,and two of his children were diagnosed with serious with retinal blastoma resulting in the loss of an eye,and the other with a congenital stomach disorder and a severe developmental disability.in,after a fight with his,kukafka left his family to stay with his sister in new york.soon thereafter he moved to florida and,from that time forward,had only sporadic contact with his children.
in,esther bailey commenced divorce proceedings against her husband.kukafka did not contest the divorce and the superior court of new jersey entered a default judgment of divorce divorce decree.among other things,the divorce decree required kukafka to pay per week in child support,per week in alimony,for an ecclesiastical divorce,and to maintain health insurance for his children.
from to,kukafka consistently failed to make child support payments.he made no payments in,the year this action was commenced.during the period he was in default,kukafka was living with his mother and had no rent or basic living expenses.although he applied for various positions,his only employment was one week of work in december,for which he earned about.kukafka also earned sporadic income from an assortment of odd jobs,such as providing driving service to the elderly.around this time,kukafka was also diagnosed with depression and diabetes.
by august,kukafka had paid only in child support and owed in outstanding payments.except for in,every payment kukafka made was pursuant to court order following contempt proceedings in florida these payments were the minimum amount needed to avoid being sent to jail for ninety days.during the contempt proceedings,kukafka claimed,among other things that he should not have to pay child support that his earned enough on her own to support their children that he was unable to obtain suitable employment that he was awaiting returns on several real estate ventures that he was pursuing needed licensing and education and that his illnesses prevented him from finding work.he was repeatedly admonished to make efforts to find work and to pay the per week obligation.
ultimately,a grand jury indicted kukafka on two counts of knowing failure to pay child support.count i charged kukafka with willful failure to make support payments from december until june,in violation of a.count ii charged him with willful failure to provide support from june,until august,in violation of a.after a trial,a jury found kukafka guilty of both counts and made a supplementary finding that he had violated one or more specific court orders.the district court sentenced him to two years in prison,one year of supervised release,in restitution,and a special assessment.this appeal followed.we have carefully reviewed the numerous issues kukafka raises.of these,the four relating to the child support recovery act warrant discussion.his other arguments are without merit and require no further discussion.
ii.discussion 
the child support recovery act of,as amended by the deadbeat parents punishment act of,stat.hereinafter the deadbeat parents act,or the act makes it a federal crime to willfully fail to pay a child support obligation to a child in another state the act was intended by congress to strengthen state efforts to enforce child support obligations against parents who flee across state lines.specifically,the act addresses the growing problem of interstate enforcement of child support by punishing certain persons who intentionally fail to pay their child support obligations.see,at.see generally united states kramer,cir discussing the legislative history of the child support recovery act.congress intended its amendments to further enhance these efforts by making certain violations punishable as felonies.see cong.rec.statements of senators discussing need for more serious punishment for failure to pay child support.
kukafka was convicted under a and a.under a,if a child support obligation remains unpaid for longer than one year,or is greater than,the offender is subject to six months imprisonment.a,c.under a,if the child support obligation remains unpaid for longer than two years,or is greater than,the offender is subject to two years imprisonment.a,c.by their terms,these provisions apply only to interstate support obligations.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under and a.see united states tykarsky,cir.
commerce clause 
kukafka argues that the deadbeat parents act exceeds the scope of congress power under the commerce clause and violates the tenth amendment of the constitution.because he challenges the constitutionality of the act,we exercise plenary review over the district court assertion of federal jurisdiction.united states singletary,cir.
in united states lopez,d,the supreme court held that the school zones act of exceeded congress authority under the commerce clause.the court identified three broad categories of activity that congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,and those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.id.at.focusing on the third category,the court concluded that possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might,through repetition elsewhere,substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce.id.at.
in united states parker,cir,we considered lopez,as well as our own commerce clause precedent,and held that the deadbeat parents act was a constitutional exercise of congress power.we explained that 
failure to make required payments gives rise to a debt which implicates economic activity.this is an instance where local activities are part of a national problem with a substantial impact upon interstate commerce.it is significant that the legislative history underlying the act establishes that state efforts have been inadequate to ensure that payments owed are actually made and that,as a result,annual obligations covered by the act total billions of dollars.finally,unlike the statute the court reviewed in lopez,the deadbeat parents act involves an unbroken chain of interstate events which begins when one parent crosses state lines and ends with interstate collection efforts.
id.at quoting united states bishop,cir.based on this reasoning,we recognized that,although failure to pay child support might be a local activity,it is part of a national economic problem that substantially affects interstate commerce.consequently,we concluded that the statute falls within the scope of congressional authority under the commerce clause.id.at.
kukafka contends that parker was effectively overruled by united states morrison,d.in morrison,echoing both the holding of lopez and its underlying reasoning,the supreme court struck down portions of the violence against women act vawa.united states whited,cir.in concluding vawa was unconstitutional,the court emphasized that intrastate,g crimes of violence are not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.morrison,at.although it did not adopt a categorical rule,the court reasoned that congress could not regulate conduct based solely on that conduct aggregate effect on interstate commerce.id.at.see also whited,at.
focusing on the third lopez category,the court provided a framework to determine whether a law regulates intrastate activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.united states gregg,cir citing morrison,at.under this framework,a court should consider the economic nature of the regulated activity a jurisdictional element limiting the reach of the law to a discrete set of activities that additionally has an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of the activity in question and the link between the regulated activity and interstate commerce.gregg,at.in assessing these factors,our task is to determine whether a rational basis exists for concluding that the regulated activities,taken in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce.see gonzales raich,d.
with this in mind,the deadbeat parents act clearly regulates an activity having a substantial effect on interstate commerce.first,the activity regulated under the act is commercial,or economic,in nature.as characterized in parker,failure to fulfill a financial obligation gives rise to a debt which implicates economic activity.at.second,by regulating only obligations to children,the act contains an explicit jurisdictional element that limits its reach to interstate transactions.id.at.third,the act was passed after express legislative findings about the effect of unpaid child support on interstate commerce.indeed,when congress passed the act,the amount of unpaid child support had reached into the billions of dollars and amounted to a national problem adversely affecting interstate commerce.see,at discussing economic impact of failure to pay interstate child support.this same legislative history highlights the link between the national problem addressed by congress and the legislation it passed.see gregg,at.
we therefore have no trouble determining that a rational basis exists for concluding that failure to make interstate child support payments substantially affects interstate commerce.accordingly,even after morrison,the deadbeat parents act falls within congress power under the third lopez category.
the constitutionality of the deadbeat parents act is unaffected by morrison for the additional reason that the act falls under the second lopez category,which was not addressed by morrison.see united states macewan,cir.under the second category,congress may regulate persons or things in interstate commerce.the child support payments regulated by the deadbeat parents act are things,which are interstate in nature because they must normally be transmitted through instrumentalities of interstate commerce by mail,by wire,or by electronic transfer.parker,at.moreover,the persons targeted by the act are those who,like kukafka,intentionally avoid payment by traveling across state lines.see,at explaining that chances for successfully avoiding such payments increase markedly when parents cross state lines.by targeting interstate child support obligations alone,congress has ensured the act regulates only those payments in interstate commerce and those persons who avoid their obligations by traveling across state lines.
the act covers persons or things in interstate commerce,even though it punishes only those who have willfully fail ed to pay a support obligation.a emphasis added.that is,by criminalizing an individual willful failure to pay,the deadbeat parents act encourages the payment of interstate debts.see,at stating that act promotes payment by taking the incentive out of moving interstate to avoid payment.in this way,the act prevents frustration of an interstate commercial transaction that otherwise would have occurred absent the defendant dereliction.united states bailey,cir.such discouragement of willful efforts to frustrate interstate commerce is a valid exercise of congressional power under the commerce clause.see united states sage,cir if congress can take measures under the commerce clause to foster potential interstate commerce,it surely has power to prevent the frustration of an obligation to engage in commerce.united states faasse,cir.
we therefore conclude that the deadbeat parents act properly regulates persons or things in interstate commerce.see united states king,cir finding the act regulates a thing in interstate commerce even after morrison united states klinzing,cir same 
in sum,we reject kukafka argument that morrison overrules our conclusion in parker that the act is constitutional.instead,we conclude that the deadbeat parents act is a constitutional exercise of congressional power under the second and third categories of lopez 
collateral challenge 
kukafka next argues that his indictment must be dismissed because the divorce decree containing his child support obligation includes a requirement that he obtain an ecclesiastical dissolution of,a get he contends that this provision interferes with his free exercise of religion under the first amendment of the constitution.the district court ruled that kukafka could not attack the indictment by collaterally challenging the divorce decree.our review is plenary.singletary,at.
the deadbeat parents act requires that a defendant be subject to a support obligation,which is defined as 
any amount determined under a court order or an order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a state or of an indian tribe to be due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living.
f.according to this plain language,kukafka is subject to a state court order obligating him to pay for the support and maintenance of a child.kukafka does not contest that he is subject to such an order.
rather,kukafka challenges the provision in that order requiring him to pay for a get.he argues that,because of the unconstitutionality of the get provision,the entire divorce decree,which contains the support obligation,must be invalid.because the decree is invalid,he claims,his indictment should be dismissed.
we see no merit to this collateral challenge.regardless of the constitutionality of the get provision,kukafka conviction is based upon his support obligation,which is wholly unrelated to and plainly separate from any obligation that he pay for the get.clearly,a federal prosecution under the deadbeat parents act is not the appropriate arena in which to litigate the terms of kukafka divorce.to sustain a conviction,the act does not require a federal court to ensure the validity of each aspect of the underlying court order containing the support obligation.see united states brand,cir united states leuschen,cir g prohibited leuschen from possessing a firearm on account of his state conviction,irrespective of the validity of that conviction.if it did,a federal prosecution under the act would become an avenue for substantive issues of state family law.congress certainly did not intend to entangle the federal government in such matters that are traditionally the province of state courts.see united states molak,cir domestic relations and family matters are,in the first instance,matters of state concern,a
