the parents and stepparents of minor children ian and alexis plaintiffs sued dana gresbach,a caseworker with the bureau of milwaukee child welfare bureau,under,alleging in part that gresbach violated the children fourth amendment rights when she conducted examinations of each child body during separate interviews at their private school,as part of a child abuse investigation in february of.gresbach moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.the district court denied the motion,holding that gresbach conduct violated the children rights to be free from unreasonable searches,and those rights were clearly established at the time of the searches.gresbach appeals,arguing that she is entitled to qualified immunity because her actions were objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment after she received general consent from the school principal to investigate an allegation of child abuse pursuant to.stat.c,and no case clearly established that her investigation violated the children fourth amendment rights.we affirm.
in doe heck,cir,we addressed the application of the fourth amendment in the context of child abuse investigations by the same state agency at issue here,the bureau,on the premises of a private school.because we find heck to be a blueprint for our analysis,a brief review of its facts and holding,as they pertain to this case,is necessary.
the bureau,a division of the wisconsin department of health and family services which provides child abuse prevention and related services in milwaukee county,conducts investigations of child abuse allegations under established protocols in order to substantiate whether or not child abuse has occurred.prior to april.stat.c had been interpreted as providing bureau caseworkers with the authority to interview children at school without having to obtain permission from their parents or school officials.see heck,at.in heck,bureau caseworkers received a report that a child had been spanked at his private school,which followed a corporal punishment policy.pursuant to their investigation,the caseworkers went to the school,identified themselves to the principal,and requested to see the child for an interview.the principal initially refused to allow the workers to interview the child,however once the workers received confirmation from a wisconsin district attorney that c gave them the authority to interview children on school premises without obtaining consent from either the parents or school officials,the principal reluctantly agreed to allow the caseworkers to interview the child,which they did,without conducting a physical examination of the child.later,the school and the child parents sued the caseworkers,alleging in part that they conducted an unreasonable search of the school premises and an illegal seizure of the child in violation of the fourth amendment.the district court found that the caseworkers were protected by qualified immunity,and we affirmed.
under established fourth amendment principles,we found that a private school and its students had a reasonable expectation of privacy in and within the school premises,and that therefore the caseworkers warrantless search of the premises and seizure of the child in order to conduct an interview for a child abuse investigation,without the consent of the child parents or school officials,was presumptively unreasonable.heck,at.we determined,in part,that to the extent c authorizes government officials to interview children suspected of being abused on private property without a warrant or probable cause,consent,or exigent circumstances,it is clearly unconstitutional as applied.id.at.we nevertheless found that a reasonable child welfare caseworker would not have understood his actions under the statute to be unconstitutional under the fourth amendment at the time of the alleged violation,because his conduct did not violate any clearly established law.accordingly,we held that the caseworkers were entitled to qualified immunity,but stated that a t this juncture april,we now make it clear that it is patently unconstitutional for governmental officials to search the premises of a private or parochial school seize a child attending that school without a warrant or court order,probable cause,consent,or exigent circumstances.heck,at.
it is through the lens of heck that we examine the district court conclusion that gresbach is not entitled to qualified immunity.
on february,a female family member of ian made a child abuse report to the bureau,stating that ian told her that michael,ian stepfather,hit him on the wrists with a plastic stick on january.on february,dana gresbach,an agent with the bureau since,was assigned the case.during the next four days,gresbach reviewed the child abuse report,met with a manager at the bureau,rita zappen,and spoke to the family member who reported the abuse.on february,gresbach went to ian private school,good hope christian academy good hope,to interview ian and his stepsister,alexis.
when gresbach arrived at good hope,she met with principal cheryl reetz.gresbach handed reetz her business card and told reetz that she needed to see ian and alexis.reetz was unfamiliar with her own role in a child abuse only real training she had received was annual review of the faculty handbook,which delineates a teacher responsibilities as a mandatory reporter of child abuse.reetz asked gresbach if she could call the children parents,to which gresbach said no,and that gresbach would contact the parents herself after she had spoken with ian and alexis.reetz also asked gresbach if she could observe the interviews,and gresbach responded that reetz need not do so.according to reetz,she was concerned about allowing gresbach to interview the children without parental consent,but she assumed that because gresbach was a bureau caseworker,reetz was legally obligated to allow gresbach to see the children,and that she was legally prohibited from contacting the children parents.gresbach did not ask permission from reetz to physically examine ian and alexis for signs of abuse she believed she was not obliged to do so,because c gave her the authority to conduct an interview and possible physical examination of the children without consent.under heck,gresbach belief was inaccurate.
reetz allowed gresbach to use her office to conduct the interviews,and she retrieved the children from their classrooms.gresbach spent ten to fifteen minutes alone in the office with each child.ian told gresbach that michael sometimes hit him with a flexible stick.gresbach examined ian wrist for injuries,but did not see any.gresbach asked the child to pull up his shirt,and ian complied.gresbach inspected his back for suspicious injuries,but found none.during her interview,alexis told gresbach that her parents sometimes gave her whoppings,but denied receiving any marks or injuries.gresbach asked alexis to pull down her tights and lift up her dress,and alexis did so.gresbach examined her legs for any injuries,and found none.gresbach finished the interviews and left the school.
gresbach later spoke with the children mother,who was very upset about what had happened at the school.the bureau made attempts to meet with the parents and of ian and alexis,but the meetings never occurred.because no injuries were observed on the children,the bureau eventually closed the case.
on june,plaintiffs individually and on behalf of their minor children,alexis and ian sued gresbach,individually and in her official capacity,and denise revels robinson the bureau director and helene nelson the bureau secretary in their official capacities.plaintiffs alleged that the defendants subjected each child to an unreasonable search and seizure at their private school,in violation of the fourth amendment violated all of the plaintiffs rights to familial relations under the fourteenth amendment and violated all of the plaintiffs rights to procedural due process under the fourteenth amendment.plaintiffs also challenged the constitutionality of.stat.c as applied,sought an injunction against defendants to prohibit enforcement of the statute in a manner inconsistent with plaintiffs constitutional rights and to direct defendants to amend their procedures and personnel training,and requested a declaration that the last sentence of c was unconstitutional.the defendants responded that their conduct did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights,and that therefore they were protected by qualified immunity.both parties moved for summary judgment.
on march,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,finding that gresbach violated the children fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.the court held that while gresbach obtained voluntary consent from reetz to conduct interviews of the children,gresbach did not have consent to conduct the searches of the children bodies,thus violating their rights to be free from unreasonable searches.the court further found that those rights were clearly established at the time of the alleged violation under heck,in that a reasonable child welfare worker would have known that she lacked authority to conduct such a search.accordingly,the court denied gresbach motion for summary judgment under qualified immunity 
we review a district court denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds de novo.sallenger oakes,cir.we will affirm the district court judgment if we find that a plaintiff present ed a version of the facts that is supported by the evidence and under which defendants would not be entitled to qualified immunity.borello allison,cir citation omitted.under the qualified immunity analysis,an official performing discretionary functions is immune from suit if her conduct could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights she is alleged to have violated.id.internal quotations omitted.
when evaluating a qualified immunity claim,we must first decide whether,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the facts show that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.finsel cruppenink,cir citing saucier katz,d.only if the answer is affirmative does the court inquire whether the official enjoys qualified immunity.hosty carter,cir.if a constitutional violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.id.to be clearly established,the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what she is doing violates that right.landstrom illinois of children and family services,cir quoting anderson creighton,d.if the right was clearly established,the official is not entitled to qualified immunity from suit.
violation of a constitutional right 
our threshold inquiry is whether gresbach violated ian and alexis fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches.the fourth amendment,as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment,protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons,homes,and effects,without a warrant supported by probable cause.see const.amend.iv.the protections afforded by the fourth amendment apply not only to the activities of criminal authorities,but civil authorities as well,new jersey,d,including child welfare workers.heck,at darryl coler,cir see also brokaw mercer county,cir finding that the fourth amendment protects students from unreasonable searches and seizures by public school officials jones hunt,cir there is no social worker exception to the fourth amendment.citation omitted tenenbaum williams.cir holding the fourth amendment doctrine applies to searches and seizures made in the context of child abuse investigations.
first we determine whether gresbach conduct constituted a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.when the fourth amendment was ratified,as now,to search meant to look over or through for the purpose of finding something to explore to examine by inspection heck,at quoting kyllo united states,d see johnson phelan,cir holding that observation of unclothed bodies is a form of a search under the fourth amendment.within the context of child abuse investigations,physical examinations conducted by child welfare caseworkers,that include visual examinations of portions of a child body which are normally covered by clothing,implicate fourth amendment concerns,and are within the scope of searches under the amendment.darryl,at.thus,the visual observations of ian stomach and alexis legs by gresbach to look for signs of abuse must be searches under the scope of the fourth amendment.
of course,the fourth amendment prohibits only those searches that are unreasonable.see vernonia school dist.acton,d as the text of the fourth amendment indicates,the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is reasonableness.stanley henson,cir included within the fourth amendment protection is the right to be free from unreasonable searches of one unclothed body.to determine reasonableness under the fourth amendment,we balance the degree of the intrusion on the individual privacy interests against the government need for the search.shell united states,cir.w hether a search is reasonable,in the constitutional sense,will vary according to the context of the search.darryl,at.gresbach searches of the children bodies took place on private property,and heck made clear that a warrantless search conducted on private property is presumptively unreasonable,whether the government motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory standards,so long as the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises on which the search took place.heck,at citations omitted.
a reasonable expectation of privacy is present for fourth amendment purposes when one exhibits an actual or subjective expectation of privacy,and that expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.united states,cir.even a limited search of a person is a substantial invasion of privacy.a search of a child person or of a closed purse or other bag carried on her person is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectation of privacy.darryl,at quoting,at,d.however,it is unnecessary to show a subjective expectation of privacy in instances of searches or seizures of young is more appropriate to consider whether the parents manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises within which the search took place.heck,at.private schools,by their very operation,exhibit a subjective expectation of privacy in their premises.id.at.the plaintiffs manifested a subjective expectation of privacy by placing their children in good hope academy,and entrusting their children to the care of the school officials in loco parentis.see id.
moreover,an expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable where parents who place their children in private schools expect that the parents express delegation of parental authority to school officials will be both acknowledged and respected by government actors.heck,at.we find that plaintiffs had a legitimate expectation of privacy at good hope,and therefore the searches of the children bodies to investigate child abuse were presumptively unreasonable,unless they fall within an exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment.see id.at.
gresbach argues that it is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment for a child welfare agent to visually inspect these areas of a child body for injuries after receiving general consent from the child private school principal to investigate child abuse.an established exception to the warrant requirement is a search conducted pursuant to consent.schneckloth bustamonte,d united states moore,cir.we are aware that this exception is grudgingly granted because the privacy interests protected by the fourth amendment are to be jealously guarded.heck,at quoting wilson health hosp.of marion county,cir.a consensual search is manifestly reasonable under the fourth amendment as long as it remains within the scope of consent.see florida jimeno,d.the scope of consent is limited by the breadth of actual consent,and whether the search remained within the boundaries of the consent is a question of fact to be
