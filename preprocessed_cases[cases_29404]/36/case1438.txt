in this appeal bradley bereznak seeks review of family court orders denying his petition to vacate an arbitration award and granting respondent susan heminger petition to confirm the award.appellant principal contention is that the parties stipulation to submit child support issues to arbitration was void as against public policy.he further challenges the specific findings made by the trial court in ruling on the competing petitions.we agree with appellant that the parties stipulation to engage in binding arbitration was void to the extent that it purported to deprive the court of jurisdiction to modify child support.we will reverse the order and direct the court to dismiss both parties petitions.
background 
in,several years after the dissolution of the parties marriage,respondent moved for modification of child support,a determination of support arrearages,and other relief.in january the court entered an order resolving these issues.in that order,by stipulation of the parties,the court stated that any future modification of child support would be submitted to sherrol cassedy for binding arbitration.
in march appellant contacted sherrol cassedy for the purpose of reducing his child support obligation.cassedy served as a mediator on that occasion,and the parties stipulated to a reduction in support.in the course of the mediation in the summer of,appellant learned that cassedy was married to matt sullivan,who had acted as a special master for the parties in a dispute.
in january appellant contacted cassedy to request a further reduction of child support.the matter proceeded to arbitration,which resulted in an award of arrearages to respondent and a determination of child support based on appellant earning capacity.one week later,on april,appellant wrote a letter to cassedy asking her to immediately reconsider and modify her decision.appellant protested that the january order did not allow for imputation of income,and that the arbitration decision reflected erroneous factual assumptions regarding his ability to pay support.cassedy replied by letter days later,stating that she had considered his claims and that t he arbitrator decision stands as submitted to the court.
on april,respondent filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.appellant opposed the petition on july.on the same day he filed a petition to vacate and or correct the award,citing the following grounds the arbitrator failed to disclose grounds for her disqualification the arbitrator exceeded her powers and my rights were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of the arbitrator.alternatively,i request that the court correct the award on the grounds that there was evident miscalculation of figures referred to in the award.
on september,the trial court granted respondent petition to confirm the award.however,because appellant petition to vacate was pending,the court stayed this ruling pending the hearing on appellant petition.that hearing took place on august.on september,the court filed an order denying appellant petition to set aside the award,finding his request to be untimely.the court further rejected appellant argument that stipulations to arbitrate child support issues are void as against public policy the court also ruled against appellant on the issue of the arbitrator disqualification,finding that appellant had waived this challenge and that there were no grounds for disqualification in any event.
discussion 
appealability of the september orders 
as a preliminary matter we must address respondent argument that appellant has appealed prematurely from a proposed statement of decision.although we reach a different conclusion,we do not agree with appellant that respondent contention is entirely frivolous and sanctionable.
appellant filed a notice of appeal on october,from the september and september,orders.he relies on code of civil procedure section,subdivision d as the basis for the appeal that provision,however,permits appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to this title.neither of the september orders was denominated a judgment the first was an order after hearing in which respondent petition to confirm the arbitration award was granted but stayed pending the hearing on appellant petition to vacate or correct the arbitration award.the september order thus never went into effect,as it contemplated further proceedings.thereafter the court issued its second order,on september,in which it denied appellant petition to set aside the arbitration award and unconditionally granted respondent petition to confirm the award.
the september,order bore the title of order after hearing re arbitration award.although appellant treated this order as a proposed statement of decision when he filed his objections to it,he apparently decided it was an order after all when he filed his notice of appeal.although it is not one of the specific orders made appealable by section,as appellant contends,we will nonetheless treat it as a judgment and address the central issue he presents.we will not,however,consider any rulings or other events occurring after the filing of the september,order.
timeliness of the petitions 
appellant contends that the court erred when it found that respondent petition to confirm the arbitration award was timely and his request to vacate was untimely.for purposes of this section only,we will assume that sections et governed the timing of the proceedings that followed the arbitrator award.neither the facts nor those statutory provisions support appellant position.
respondent submitted her petition on april,days after the arbitrator decision was filed and days after the decision was served on the parties.the petition complied with section,which precludes filing until at least days after service of the signed copy of the award.appellant petition to vacate and or correct an arbitration award was filed july,long past the response deadline prescribed by section the petition also exceeded the period allowed by sections and 
appellant assertion of error rests on the assumption that his april,letter to the arbitrator constituted an application for correction of the award under section.because that application was pending,he argues,section prohibited the filing of any petition to confirm the award the trial court,however,found that appellant letter to cassedy was not an application for correction.this ruling was primarily factual in nature.the court observed that appellant,a lawyer,had not asked the arbitrator for a correction,nor did he cite section he asked for an immediate reconsideration and modification.the court reasoned that a strict construction of the statutory correction provisions was justified,since appellant himself had requested a narrow reading of the code as applied to respondent.
the court ruling was well within its authority.that appellant was seeking reconsideration,not correction,is supported by his explicit request for reconsideration and modification and his failure even to mention either correction or section.moreover,in the letter he called for a of the merits,a task that would have exceeded the arbitrator authority under sections and the informal response received from the arbitrator indicates that she too did not perceive appellant letter to be a formal application for correction in interpreting appellant letter the court did not impose any extraneous requirements not contained in the code of civil procedure it merely determined as a matter of fact that appellant had submitted a request for reconsideration,primarily of the merits,not an application for correction.the court did not err in finding appellant petition to be untimely.
voidness of arbitration agreement 
the parties stipulation to submit future child support issues to binding arbitration was reflected in the court january order.appellant contacted the arbitrator three times after that for the purpose of reducing his child support obligation.the first contact,in march,resulted in mediation conducted by cassedy the second,in the fall of,led to the arbitration at issue in this appeal.only during the proceedings on appellant petition to vacate or correct the award did he first contest the
