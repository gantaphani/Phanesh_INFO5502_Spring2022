jennifer and frank appeal a juvenile court judgment terminating their parental rights over mary and choosing adoption as the permanent plan.welf.jennifer contends the court abused its discretion by denying her section petition for modification,and there is not substantial evidence to support the court finding the beneficial relationship exception to adoption is inapplicable.we conclude these contentions are without merit.
frank,however,persuasively asserts the court violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and full faith and credit principles by not recognizing him as a presumed father entitled to reunification services as a matter of right based on a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity,merely because it was made in michigan and not california.we reverse the judgment as to frank and mary because with exceptions not relevant here,the termination of parental rights must be made at the same time.we also reverse the judgment because,as both parents contend,san diego county health and human services agency the agency violated notice requirements of the indian child welfare act of icwa.et.
factual and procedural background 
jennifer has an extensive history with drugs,arrests and child protective services in san diego county.jennifer lost her parental rights to her three older children because of her drug use.when her son was born in,he tested positive for cocaine and opiates and suffered withdrawal symptoms.when her twin daughters were born prematurely in,they tested positive for methamphetamine.jennifer was offered services,but she failed to reunify with the children and they were adopted.
in april mary was born to jennifer in michigan.it is undisputed that frank is mary biological father,jennifer and frank were living together at the time of the birth,he was at the hospital for the birth,he is listed as the father on the birth certificate,and under michigan law he signed a voluntary affidavit of paternity and was ordered to pay child support.
shortly after the birth,jennifer and frank split up and he had no contact with mary.at some point,jennifer returned to the san diego area,and on november,she was arrested for possession of a methamphetamine pipe and marijuana,being under the influence of drugs,and child endangerment based on mary presence during the incident.the agency placed mary in foster care and on november filed a petition on her behalf under section,subdivision b.
the agency recommended that jennifer receive no reunification services because she was offered services during the proceedings for her three older children,to no avail.further,jennifer denied there was any problem and was uncooperative with the agency regarding the voluntary undertaking of services.jennifer reported she was already receiving drug treatment at the mcalister institute and she did not need the agency to dictate to her what she needs to do.
in a paternity questionnaire filed november,jennifer identified frank as mary father and stated a judgment of paternity had been made in michigan in.jennifer was unaware of his whereabouts and the agency undertook a search for him.
shortly before the january,jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the agency located frank in louisiana.at the hearing the court amended the petition to name him as an alleged father,appointed counsel for him and ordered that he be notified of the proceedings.the court made a true finding on the petition and declared mary a dependent.after taking judicial notice of the dependency files of jennifer three older children,the court denied her reunification services under section,subdivision b and,and scheduled a permanency planning hearing under section for may,
the court noted it proceeded without frank because he was an alleged father and t here is nothing to indicate that he has been part of this child life.the court explained there was no prejudice to frank because if he is blameless,and he is a good father,he could file a section petition and request custody,and he would be in the same position as if he came in today with counsel and was able to assume custody.
on february,frank requested a special hearing on the ground he believes he is mary presumed father.he requested a judgment of paternity.
frank did not appear at the february,hearing.frank submitted a paternity questionnaire that stated michigan had entered an order in that determined he is mary father and required him to pay child support.the questionnaire stated frank and jennifer lived together when mary was born,he signed a declaration at the hospital after her birth that stated he was her father,he told his sister he was the father,and he agreed to be named and was named on the birth certificate.frank also presented a copy of an august notice of order to withhold income for child support some capitalization omitted that was sent by a family law court in joseph county,michigan,to frank employer in louisiana.the notice ordered the employer to withhold and remit weekly from frank paychecks for child support under a michigan order.
frank counsel represented that frank had no contact with mary after she was about four months old,but to the best of his recollection he signed something in michigan that he believes would be akin to a paternity declaration at the time of birth.frank,however,did not have a copy of the document.the court advised,i am not going to find that he is a presumed father.i ca under the facts.the court entered a judgment of paternity,but continued frank alleged father status.the court invited frank to file a section petition to request reunification services.
on march,frank filed a petition for modification under section,seeking custody of mary,or alternatively,reunification services and an evaluation of his home in louisiana.the petition stated frank is anxious to reestablish a relationship with mary and he believes it is in her long term best interest to be with him.
the agency opposed the section petition.the social worker explained frank claims he was sent to jail due to a domestic violence incident that occurred between the couple.he stated that when he got out,he was at the hospital for mary birth.however,after months,the couple broke up and jennifer would not let him have contact with mary.frank stated that he did not want to argue with her and did not pursue a relationship with mary.he stated that he contacted her one other time and jennifer told him to leave them alone.he stated that he did leave them alone because he did not want to cause problems.frank told the social worker he eventually moved from michigan back to san diego,where he was homeless.frank admitted to multiple arrests in california including burglary and infliction of corporal injuries,which date back to.frank reported he moved to louisiana in and he had been employed in the landscape field for nine months.
jennifer told the social worker frank was jailed for a domestic violence incident when she was four months pregnant.he attended mary birth,but when she was two weeks old he left.he appeared about a year later and asked for visitation,but jennifer refused because he had not had any counseling or therapy.she had not heard from him since.the social worker wrote t here is no indication that his lifestyle is different from when he was involved with the domestic violence or that placing mary with him would be in her best interest and not pose further risk to her.
frank did not appear at the april,hearing.a copy of mary birth certificate was submitted,which named him as her father.the court denied an evidentiary hearing on frank section petition and confirmed that the section hearing would proceed on may.
in its assessment report,the agency recommended the termination of parental rights and adoption as the permanent plan.the social worker found mary is adoptable due to her young age,good health,lack of significant developmental delays,and her ability to attach to new caregivers.it does not appear that her relationship with her mother prevents her from adjusting and thriving in new environments.the texas couple who adopted jennifer twin girls remained committed to adopting mary,and the twins had ongoing contact with the maternal grandparents,who adopted jennifer son.additionally,there were other adoptive families willing to adopt a child with mary characteristics.
the court continued the permanency planning hearing to june.on may,jennifer filed a petition for modification under section.jennifer argued she should receive reunification services because she had been attending narcotics anonymous na meetings and drug testing,and was seeking mental health treatment as well.the petition stated the mcalister institute believed jennifer has real mental health issues that a diagnosis program,such as mite,could not have adequately addressed in the past jennifer has never been in a treatment program which could have adequately addressed her mental health issues.she has never had continuous treatment and supervision from a mental health professional or psy ch iatrist who could prescribe and monitor needed medication.
jennifer submitted evidence that on march,she completed a residential detoxification program at mcalister institute she regularly attended na meetings between august and september,and march and april,and,she passed two or three drug tests performed in late march.she also submitted an april,letter from a marketing company that attested to her employment beginning,and stated she has demonstrated work habits that indicate she has the potential to be a valuable addition to our company.
at the june,hearing,jennifer reported she began a dual diagnosis treatment program four or five days earlier.she argued that if she had a chance to get better through her dual diagnosis program,she would be able to provide a stable,loving,nurturing environment for mary.the court denied an evidentiary hearing on her section petition.
on june,the court temporarily suspended jennifer visitation because of her mental condition.the court also rescheduled the section hearing for july.
on july,frank filed another section petition to request months of reunification services.he submitted a copy of an affidavit of parentage some capitalization omitted from michigan,dated two days after mary birth.the affidavit acknowledged its completion was voluntary,the mother would have custody absent court order or agreement of the parents,either parent could assert in court a request for parenting time or custody,both parents had the responsibility to support the child,and by signing the affidavit the parents waived the right to genetic testing,appointed counsel or a trial to determine if the man is the biological father.the affidavit was signed by frank and jennifer,and signed and notarized by a witness.
at the july hearing,which frank did not attend,the court denied an evidentiary hearing on his second section motion.the court rejected the argument that the michigan affidavit gave frank presumed father status under california law.the court noted the california statute specifically sets out that the department of child support services in consultation with the state department of health services,the california association of hospitals and health systems and other affected health provider organizations will work to develop this form.this specifically talks about california,and an analogy may be drawn,but that would be truly rewriting the law if i decided to honor these michigan documents and find that this guy is a presumed father under our laws.that would be in my mind absolutely legal error.the court explained that as a biological father,frank entitlement to reunification services was discretionary,and the provision of services was not in mary best interest.
jennifer testified she was in the serenity house residential program and was being treated for drug dependency and bipolar disorder.she had been taking lithium and seroquel for approximately three weeks and they minimized her anxiety.
the court found by clear and convincing evidence that mary is adoptable and would not benefit from further contact with her parents.the court terminated parental rights and found adoption is in mary best interest.further,the court authorized mary immediate placement in texas with her half sisters.
discussion 
ifrank appeala 
in california,the statutes governing dependency proceedings differentiate the rights of presumed,natural,and alleged fathers.citation.the uniform parentage act of,originally adopted by our legislature as civil code section et and reenacted without substantive change as family code section et citation,distinguishes between presumed and merely biological fathers.citation.a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status,is an alleged father.in re liam th,d.presumed father status ranks highest.only a statutorily presumed father is entitled to reunification services under section,subdivision a and custody of his child under section.in re jerry th,d.ordinarily,a best interests standard is inapplicable in determining whether a presumed father is entitled to reunification services.in re eric th,d eric.
family code section generally sets forth the exclusive means for an unwed father to establish presumed fatherhood.in re zacharia cal th,d.under subdivision d of family code section,a man is a presumed father if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.the law gives presumed father status to those who have taken an active role in their children lives.in re liam,supra,th at,d.
further,in the legislature amended family code section to provide that alternatively,a man is a presumed father if he meets the conditions provided in chapter commencing with section of part,which pertains to the establishment of paternity by voluntary declaration.family code section provides that with exceptions not relevant here,a completed voluntary declaration of paternity,as described in section,that has been filed with the department of child support services shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.the voluntary declaration shall be recognized as a basis for the establishment of an order for child custody,visitation,or child support.
under family code section,subdivision a the voluntary declaration of paternity shall be executed on a form developed by the department of child support services in consultation with the state department of health services,the california family support council,and child support advocacy groups.the form must contain certain information,including statements by the parents that they have read and understand the written materials described in family code section a statement by the mother that the man who has signed the voluntary declaration of paternity is the only possible father,and she consents to the establishment of paternity by signing the declaration and,a statement by the man that he understands that by signing the voluntary declaration of paternity he is waiving his rights as described in the written materials,that he is the biological father of the child,and that he consents to the establishment of paternity by signing the voluntary declaration of paternity,subd.b see also.
the agency contends,and the juvenile court found,that an voluntary declaration of parentage can never confer presumed father status in a california dependency proceeding simply because the declaration was not made on a california form or filed with the department of child support services,as required by family code section.the agency concedes that had mary been born in california and had frank signed here the identical form he signed in michigan,he would qualify as a presumed father.frank asserts that to any extent california statutory scheme precludes him from being designated a presumed father based solely on geography,it violates his constitutional equal protection rights.we agree with frank.
the concept of the equal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.in re eric cal d.it is basic that the guarantees of equal protection embodied in the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution and article i,sections and,of the california constitution,prohibit the state from arbitrarily discriminating among persons subject to its jurisdiction.this principle,of course,does not preclude the state from drawing any distinctions between different groups of individuals,but does require that,at a minimum,classifications which are created bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public purpose.citations.moreover,in cases involving suspect classifications or touching on fundamental interests the state bears the burden of establishing not only that it has a compelling interest which justifies the law but that distinctions drawn by the law are necessary to further its purpose.in re king cal d,king.
frank is similarly situated to fathers who have voluntarily acknowledged paternity in california.under both california and michigan law,a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity shall be recognized as a basis for child support,custody or visitation.comp.laws.moreover,both california and michigan law have similar purposes.in california,w ith the adoption of the statutory scheme on voluntary declarations of paternity,family code section et,the legislature declared that there was a compelling state interest in establishing paternity for all children,with the goal of providing children with support awards and with equal access to benefits such as social security,health insurance,and inheritance rights,and found that knowledge of family medical history is often necessary for correct medical diagnosis and treatment.additionally,knowing one father is important to a child development.citation.the legislature further found that a simple system for voluntary paternity declarations would result in a significant increase in the ease of establishing paternity and a significant decrease in the time and money needed to establish paternity,and was in the public interest.county of los angeles sheldon th,d,fn.omitted.michigan acknowledgment of parentage act provides a simple procedure to establish paternity and provide support for children born out of wedlock.sinicropi mazurek.
the agency only cursorily addresses the equal protection issue.it submits that frank constitutional rights were not violated because he was given the same opportunities as every other man to establish presumed father status in california had he traveled to california and was denied access to the declaration process or properly executed a declaration but had not been recognized as a presumed father,then he would have an equal protection argument.the agency ignores,however,that a voluntary paternity declaration must include the mother signature and certain statements by the mother,subd.b.the record contains no suggestion jennifer would have cooperated with frank in executing a voluntary paternity declaration in california several years after they ended their relationship,or that frank had the financial ability to travel to california.the agency position essentially begs the constitutional questions.
king,supra,cal d,is instructive here.in king,the constitutionality of a former provision of penal code section was at issue.it provided that a father who failed to provide for his child was guilty of a misdemeanor,but i f the father,during such violation,remains out of the state for days he is guilty of a felony.king,at,fn.the court struck down the felony provision on equal protection grounds,explaining d iscrimination solely on the basis of location inside or outside of the state bears no more relation to the punitive and deterrent purposes of section than differing locations of nonsupporting fathers within this state.citation.as odious as the offense of nonsupport of a child may be,it does not take on varying ethical coloration because of its geographic location.thus,when viewed in relation to the main purposes of the criminal nonsupport provision,the classification drawn appears arbitrary and irrational.id.at.
likewise,the disparate treatment here is based solely on geography,and location of a father inside or outside the state bears no more relation to the purposes of the presumed father statute than differing locations of fathers within california.the agency has identified no compelling or even rational reason for the disparate treatment,and we are aware of none.accordingly,we hold family code sections and et violate constitutional equal protection principles to any extent they purport to deny frank presumed father status on the sole ground he made his voluntary acknowledgement of paternity in michigan instead of california.
frank also relies on the constitution full faith and credit clause.article iv,section of the united states constitution requires that f ull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records,and judicial proceedings of every other state.the purpose of the clause was to alter the status of several states as independent foreign sovereignties,each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others,and to make them integral parts of a single nation throughout which a remedy upon a just obligation might be demanded as of right,irrespective of the state of its origin.bank of america jennett th,d,citing milwaukee county white.regarding judgments,the full faith and credit obligation is exacting.a final judgment in one state,if rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment,qualifies for recognition throughout the land.baker general motors,d,fn.omitted.
frank paternity affidavit is a public record of michigan.see.comp.laws.further,under michigan law,as california law,a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity has the same force and effect as a judgment of paternity.comp.laws.
the agency agrees the michigan affidavit qualifies for full faith and credit,but it submits the juvenile court gave it due credit by declaring frank a biological father entitled to reunification services only on a best interests showing under section.the agency asserts that since there is no presumed father category in michigan,the michigan affidavit is not entitled to full faith and credit to establish presumed fatherhood in this state.the agency points out there was no proceeding in michigan in which frank was adjudged entitled to reunification services,custody or visitation.
the full faith and credit clause requires only that the judgment be given as much effect in the state of the forum as in the state of its rendition.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law.it is well settled that both the validity and the effect of a judgment are governed by the laws of the state where it is rendered judgments rendered in another state will usually be accepted as conclusive proof of the exact rights which have been finally adjudicated thereby.citation.the full faith and credit provision of the constitution is designed to provide a method of proving the record of a judicial proceeding in one state for the express purpose of carrying out the result of that proceeding in other states.citation.the full faith and credit clause requires only that the judgment should be given such effect as it had by the law or usage of the state of its origin.gilmer spitalny d.
frank agrees michigan has no presumed father category,but he asserts the effect of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is nonetheless essentially the same in michigan and california.in both states an acknowledgment acts as a judgment of paternity,and forms the basis for custody,visitation and support.comp.laws.in california,a father who has signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is,as a presumed father,ordinarily entitled to reunification services without any showing of best interests.eric,supra,th at,d.in michigan,before the juvenile court enters a disposition order,the child welfare agency shall prepare a case service plan for the parents that shall be available to the court and all the parties to the proceeding,and the court shall consider the case service plan,f,subds.
the agency ignores those provisions of the statute,and cites only the portion that states,if services were not provided to the child and his or her parent,the reasons why services were not provided must be included in the agency written report,f,subd.b.the agency submits michigan differs from california because michigan does not mandate treatment plans and services,and if it is not safe or reasonable to reunite the family,the father sexually molested the child,beat the child,is incarcerated for a significant period,it is not mandatory to give a treatment plan and services to that parent.
the agency well knows,however,that in california there are also instances in which a parent,including a presumed father,may be denied services.for instance,services may be denied because of severe physical abuse or severe sexual abuse of the child or a sibling because of the parent history of drug or alcohol abuse and past resistance to treatment because the parent failed to reunify with other dependent children,as happened here with jennifer and because the parent is incarcerated and services would be detrimental to the child,subd.b,e.the michigan statute,read as a whole,reasonably implies that a parent is entitled to reunification services unless there is a compelling reason for denying them,f,as is the case in california.we conclude the effect of the michigan paternity affidavit is essentially the same under both michigan and california law,and thus full faith and credit principles apply.
in any event,family code section puts the matter to rest.it provides a previous determination of paternity made by another state,whether established through voluntary acknowledgment procedures in effect in that state or through an administrative or judicial process shall be given full faith and credit by the courts in this state,and shall have the same effect as a paternity determination made in this state and may be enforced and satisfied in a like manner.italics added see also a each state participating in the tanf program must design p rocedures under which a state must give full faith and credit to a determination of paternity made by any other state,whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial process.
at oral argument,the agency asserted family code section is inapplicable because it appears in division,part,article of the family code,which pertains to intercounty support obligations.capitalization omitted.we review issues of statutory construction independently,and o ur primary aim in construing any law is to determine the legislative intent.citation.in doing so,we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.committee of seven thousand superior court cal d.significance should be given,if possible,to every word of an act,and a construction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided.home depot,contractors state license bd.th,d.when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction.department of fish game irrigation dist.th,d.
family code section broadly states an paternity declaration is entitled to full faith and credit and shall have the same effect as a paternity determination made in this state.italics added.a voluntary paternity acknowledgment made in california has the effect of giving the father presumed father status.had the legislature intended to limit family code section to child support matters it could,of course,have said so.we conclude family code section is applicable,and regardless of the lack of a presumed father category in michigan,that state paternity acknowledgment is entitled to full faith and credit in california,meaning it qualifies frank for presumed father status and reunification services as a matter of right.
the agency also contends the juvenile court was justified in requiring frank to bring a section motion and show the provision of reunification services was in mary best interest because the reunification period had passed by the time he requested presumed father status based on the michigan affidavit.
u p until the time the section hearing is set,the parent interest in reunification is given precedence over a child need for stability and permanency.citation.once reunification services are ordered terminated,the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability.citation.the burden thereafter is on the parent to prove changed circumstances pursuant to section to revive the reunification issue.section provides the escape mechanism that must be built into the process to allow the court to consider new information.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.in addition to showing changed circumstances,the parent must make a prima facie showing that modification would serve the child best interest.in re zachary,supra,th at,d.
the agency relies on eric,supra,th,d,in which the biological father claimed entitlement to presumed father status based on his filing of a voluntary declaration in california.the court deemed his motion to have been brought under section because it was made after expiration of the reunification period and the setting of a section hearing.eric,at,d.the court held the father argument that his voluntary declaration of paternity carries the weight of a judgment is premature because he can not show that he satisfies the threshold requirement of a section petition.id.at,d.the court rejected the notion it was improper to consider the best interest of the child in deciding presumed father status,as after the termination of reunification services and the scheduling of a hearing under section the focus changed to the needs of the child.eric,at,d.
eric,however,is readily distinguishable.in eric,the biological father was offered reunification services even though he was an alleged father.he failed to comply with his case plan,and at the section hearing,held more than a year after he was offered services,he moved for presumed father status based on a voluntary declaration of paternity.eric,supra,th at,d.in other words,the father was uncooperative and his lack of involvement during the reunification period showed a lack of dedication and the intent to unnecessarily delay the proceedings.
here,in november,at the commencement of the proceedings,jennifer identified frank as mary father and advised the court there was a paternity judgment and child support order in michigan.on january,jennifer was denied reunification services,and thus there was never any reunification period.frank first appeared and claimed presumed father status on february,which appears to have been shortly after the agency located him and notified him of the proceedings.it was also well within the reunification period for a child mary age,subd.a.
eric is inapplicable here,and the court erred by requiring frank to bring a section petition and make a best interest showing to receive reunification services.when frank requested presumed father status in february,the court should have granted it and ordered the agency to provide him with a service plan.the error was prejudicial and requires reversal of the judgment terminating his parental rights and remand for further proceedings.
jennifer appeala 
jennifer challenges the court denial of her petition for modification under section without an evidentiary hearing.a juvenile court order may be changed,modified or set aside under section if the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that new evidence or changed circumstances exist and the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child.citation.a parent need only make a prima facie showing of these elements to trigger the right to a hearing on a section petition and the petition should be liberally construed in favor of granting a hearing to consider the parent request.in re zachary th,d.
however,if the liberally construed allegations of the petition do not make a prima facie showing of changed circumstances and that the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child,the court need not order a hearing on the petition.citations.the prima facie requirement is not met unless the facts alleged,if supported by evidence given credit at the hearing,would sustain a favorable decision on the petition.in re zachary,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court will not disturb a decision unless the trial court has exceeded the limits of legal discretion by making an arbitrary,capricious,or patently absurd determination citations.in re geoffrey d.
we conclude jennifer did not make a prima facie showing of changed circumstances.jennifer conceded that when the jurisdiction and disposition hearing was held in early january she was not actively engaged in drug rehabilitation.she argued circumstances had changed because in march she completed a detoxification program,and she was in drug treatment and attending na meetings.jennifer drug abuse,however,dates back more than years.she reported she began using illegal substances at the age of,and that contributed to her dropping out of school during the grade.her drugs of choice were marijuana,methamphetamine,cocaine and heroin.she lost custody of her three older children because of her drug abuse.given the severity of jennifer drug problem the court could reasonably find her sobriety between march and the date of the hearing,june,was not particularly compelling.see in re cliffton th,d carl seven months of sobriety since his relapse,while commendable,was nothing new.
jennifer also claimed changed circumstances on the ground she was seeking mental health treatment that she did not receive during the dependency proceedings for her three older children.at the time of the hearing,however,she had been in dual treatment for drug abuse and bipolar disorder for only four or five days.as the court noted,there was no suggestion dual treatment may allow jennifer to reunify with mary within the period,which was then less than five months away.the court found there is no way based on the extensive history of this case that jennifer recent activity amounts to even a prima facie case of changing circumstances.we agree and find no abuse of discretion.a petition which alleges merely changing circumstances and would mean delaying the selection of a permanent home for a child to see if a parent might be able to reunify at some future point,does not promote stability for the child or the child best interests.citation.c hildhood does not wait for the parent to become adequate.in re casey th,d.
additionally,jennifer challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court finding that the exception to the adoption preference found in section,subdivision c a is inapplicable.on review of the sufficiency of the evidence,we presume in favor of the order,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving the prevailing party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of the order.in re autumn th,d.
adoption,where possible,is the permanent plan preferred by the legislature.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.if the court finds a child can not be returned to her parent and is likely to be adopted if parental rights are terminated,it must select adoption as the permanent plan unless it finds termination would be detrimental to the child under one of six specific exceptions,subd.c.the section,subdivision c a exception applies if termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child because the parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the minor and the minor would benefit from continuing the relationship.in re derek th,d.the parent bears the burden of proving the exception applies.ibid.
this court has interpreted the phrase benefit from continuing the relationship to refer to a relationship that promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the the child would gain in a permanent home with new,adoptive parents.in other words,the court balances the strength and quality of the natural parent child relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and the sense of belonging a new family would confer.if severing the natural parent child relationship would deprive the child of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed,the preference for adoption is overcome and the natural parent rights are not terminated.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.
a parent must show more than frequent and loving contact or pleasant visits.in re derek,supra,th,d.interaction between natural parent and child will always confer some incidental benefit to the child the relationship arises from the interaction,companionship and shared experiences.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.the parent must show he or she occupies a parental role in the child life,resulting in a significant,positive,emotional attachment between child and parent.in re autumn,at,d in re elizabeth th,d.
it is undisputed that jennifer regularly visited mary.the record,however,contains substantial evidence to support the court finding that jennifer did not show mary would suffer great harm if she did not have continued contact with her mother,or that the benefit of continued contact would outweigh the benefits of adoption.
the social worker wrote in the assessment report that she had observed four visits between jennifer and mary,and d uring the visits mary seems to enjoy the time she spends playing with jennifer.however,mary also leaves her mother presence willingly and does not appear to be negatively impacted by her mother absence.she does not ask to live with her nor does she ask when she will see her next.she has adapted to her current foster home 
in an addendum report,the social worker explained that during a recent visit jennifer moods fluctuated from laughter to hostility and she refused to follow the social worker directions and spoke about adult situations in front of her daughter.the report stated that mary consistently asks for her maternal aunt and to date has not asked the worker to see her mother.jennifer had requested a bonding study and the court authorized one,but no such study was presented at the section hearing.according to the social worker,the exception of a beneficial parent child relationship does not exist in this case and terminating parental rights for jennifer would not be detrimental to mary.although there was also evidence that jennifer and mary had an affectionate relationship,the court ruling is amply supported by the evidence.
jennifer also joins in frank arguments and contends that if we reverse the judgment terminating his parental rights,the judgment terminating her parental rights must be reversed as well,even absent any independent error pertaining to her.
california rules of court,rule a provides in part,the court may not terminate the rights of only one parent under section unless that parent is the only surviving parent or unless the rights of the other parent have been terminated or unless the other parent has relinquished custody of the child to the welfare department.rule h acknowledges the purpose of termination of parental rights is to free the dependent child for adoption.we conclude that because the reinstatement of frank parental rights precludes mary adoption at this time,the reinstatement of jennifer parental rights is in mary best interest.we emphasize,however,that this does not affect the order terminating jennifer reunification services.in re dejohn th,d discussing cal.rules of court,former rule,now rule.
icwa notices 
additionally,both jennifer and frank persuasively contend the judgment must be reversed because of inadequate icwa notices.
the icwa provides that where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.if the tribe is unknown,the notice must be given to the bureau of indian affairs bia as the agent for the secretary of the interior.in re edward th,d.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least te
