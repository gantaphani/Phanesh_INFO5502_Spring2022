effective january,the act replaced the uniform child custody jurisdiction act the uccja.the uccja purposes were to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict,promote interstate cooperation,litigate custody where child and family have closest connections,discourage continuing conflict over custody,deter abductions and unilateral removals of children,avoid relitigation of another state custody decisions,and promote exchange of information and other mutual assistance between courts of sister states.citation.in re th,d.the uccja policy was to limit,rather than proliferate,jurisdiction.in re marriage of newsome th,d accord,in re stephanie cal th,d.it provide d the exclusive method of determining subject matter jurisdiction in custody cases in california and applied to juvenile dependency proceedings and international custody disputes.stephanie,at,d.

the act sets forth the prerequisites of jurisdiction relevant to this case in sections and.
section home state jurisdiction 
section,subdivision a confers jurisdiction on the juvenile court only if any of the following are true 
this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding,or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.
a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph,or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that this state is the more appropriate forum under section or,and both of the following are true 
a the child and the child parents,or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent,have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence.
b substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child care,protection,training,and personal relationships.
all courts having jurisdiction under paragraph or have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under section or.
no court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraph,or.
section,subdivision a 
section provides the definitions necessary to a discussion of section,subdivision a.home state means the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding a period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period,subd.g.person acting as a parent means a person,other than a parent,who has physical custody of the child or has had physical custody for a period of six consecutive months,including any temporary absence,within one year immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding and has been awarded legal custody by a court or claims a right to legal custody under the law of this state,subd.m.physical custody means the physical care and supervision of a child,subd.n.
because neither mother nor father lived in california and because was in california when these proceedings were commenced on december,the only possibility for california subject matter jurisdiction under section,subdivision a is that california was home state on december.integrating the definitions in section into the language of section,subdivision a,california was her home state on that date if,since july,she had lived in california with a person who cared for and supervised her,and who had been awarded legal custody by a court or who claimed legal custody.aside from the hospital,the only place in california stayed was in the home.however,she was not moved to the home until september before the sacramento agency moved her from the shriners hospital to the home on that date,mexico was her home state,and she was temporarily absent from mexico solely for hospitalization and medical treatment we therefore conclude that section,subdivision a did not confer jurisdiction on the juvenile court.
section,subdivision a,and 
for california to have subject matter jurisdiction under section,subdivision a,or,mexico must lack jurisdiction mexico has jurisdiction if it was home state on december,or it was her home state within the period july to december and she was absent from mexico and her parents continued to live there,subd.a.mexico was home state both on december and within the period july to december if she lived there with her parents from july to december,aside from temporary absences,subd.g.therefore,we must determine if she lived in mexico with her parents from july to december,aside from temporary absences.
as noted above,mexico was home state before september.on september,the sacramento agency apparently took into custody after her release from the shriners hospital and moved her to the home.on september,it filed a dependency petition,which was dismissed on december.this dismissed petition did not change the fact that was still in california solely for medical care.thus,mexico remained her home state from september until december.as noted above,it is unclear where was from december until december,when agency detained her in the d.home.this detention by agency did not change her home state status,which remained mexico when the petition was filed on december.mexico therefore had subject matter jurisdiction,and california did not have subject matter jurisdiction under section,subdivision a,and.
section temporary emergency jurisdiction 
section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a states a court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child,or a sibling or parent of the child,is subjected to,or threatened with,mistreatment or abuse.
one of the reasons the uccja was revised and the act enacted was to clarify when a court could take emergency jurisdiction over a child.the act made clear that emergency jurisdiction could be exercised to protect a child only on a temporary basis until the court with appropriate jurisdiction issued a permanent order.citation.in re,supra,th at,d.an order assuming emergency jurisdiction under the act has time limitations.it must specify a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction,subd.c.it remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.ibid.in re,supra,th at,d.
emergencies under the act generally involve sexual or physical abuse.in re,supra,th at,d in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d,in re nada th,d.unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to invoke emergency jurisdiction.in re,supra,th at,d.the finding of an emergency is to be made only after an evidentiary hearing,although the juvenile court can detain the child before that hearing.id.at,fn,d.the jurisdictional hearing does not qualify as the hearing authorized by the act.id.at,d.
the requirements of section,subdivision a were not satisfied in this case.the jurisdictional and father were unable to provide the intensive medical treatment required for cerebral palsy,spinal cord injury,and respiratory compensation,resulting in a substantial risk would suffer serious physical harm or not necessarily include a finding under the act that an emergency existed and it was necessary to protect from actual or threatened mistreatment or abuse.in re,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.the jurisdictional finding does not include a finding of abandonment.although was present in california when agency filed the dependency petition on december,mother and father never abandoned her.abandoned means left without provision for reasonable and necessary care or supervision,subd.a.far from abandoning,or subjecting her to or threatening her with mistreatment or abuse,mother and father attempted to provide for the medical care she needed by sending her to the shriners hospital and then by acquiescing in the commencement of this dependency proceeding.this acquiescence was understandable considering grave condition,mother own debilitating injuries,and father position as the sole support for the family,which included younger sibling.
section,subdivision e 
section,subdivision e states it is the intent of the legislature in enacting subdivision a that the grounds on which a court may exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction be expanded.it is further the intent of the legislature that these grounds include those that existed under section of the family code as that section read on december,particularly including cases involving domestic violence.on december,section,subdivision a contained the following four alternate grounds for child custody jurisdiction.
former section,subdivision a 
this subdivision stated this state a is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding,or b had been the child home state within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state because of removal or retention by a person claiming custody of the child or for other reasons,and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this state.former,subd.a.the child physical presence was not a prerequisite for jurisdiction under former section,subdivision a former,subd.c,and the physical presence of the child,or the child and one contestant,was not sufficient to confer jurisdiction former,subd.b.
former section,subdivision a corresponds basically to section,subdivision a.in the instant case,it would not provide a ground for jurisdiction unavailable under the current statutory scheme.
former section,subdivision a 
this subdivision read it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this state assume jurisdiction because a the child and the child parents,or the child and at least one contestant,have a significant connection with this state,and b there is available in this state substantial evidence concerning the child present or future care,protection,training,and personal relationships.former,subd.a.the above provisions in former section,subdivisions b and c regarding physical presence applied.
former section,subdivision a corresponds basically to section,subdivision a,but it did not require another state to lack or decline jurisdiction.mother and father do not have a significant connection with california,as required by former section,subdivision a a,and there is no contestant meeting this requirement.former section,subdivision a defined contestant as a person,including a parent,who claims a right to custody or visitation rights with respect to a child.at the time the dependency petition was filed,neither the nor agency could claim a right to custody or v
