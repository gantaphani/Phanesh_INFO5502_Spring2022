in this case of first impression,we consider how to classify four years of credit in the california public employees retirement system calpers that respondent timothy green timothy elected to purchase with community funds during his marriage to appellant julie green julie.timothy was eligible to purchase the credit because he had performed four years of military service with the united states armed forces prior to the parties marriage.over julie objection,the trial court characterized the military service credit as timothy separate property,and ruled that julie was entitled only to reimbursement of the community funds used to pay for the service credit,plus interest.we conclude that,because the military service credit was purchased with community funds during the parties marriage,it was community property.we remand to the trial court to determine the correct allocation of the credit.
factual and procedural background 
timothy served in the united states air force for four years from july,to may.on june,he began working as a firefighter for the dougherty regional fire authority in dublin.the fire authority was a participant in calpers.julie and timothy were married in may.
in july,the dougherty regional fire authority merged with the alameda county fire department,which also is a participant in calpers.timothy continued to work for the alameda county fire department.
on august,timothy exercised his right to buy service credit for his military service.the purchase was made pursuant to section,which permits a calpers member to obtain up to four years of service credit for service with the united states armed forces.timothy elected to pay for the purchase through an installment plan,paying twice each month through payroll deductions for years scheduled to continue until july.before the parties separated on october,community funds in the amount of were used toward the purchase of the military service credit.
julie filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in march.during dissolution proceedings,a dispute arose over whether to characterize timothy military service credit as separate or community property.the trial court appointed an expert for the purpose of drafting proposed orders to divide the community property interests in the parties pension plans.according to a brief filed by timothy in connection with the dispute over his military service credit,the expert proposed treating percent of the service credit as a community property asset,representing the percentage of payments toward the military service credit made with community funds.
the parties could not agree on division of the military service credit,and submitted briefs on the issue to the trial court.julie sought to continue to pay half of the cost of future installment payments,and requested that half of the military service credit be placed into a separate account for her benefit through calpers.timothy argued that because his right to purchase military service credit arose prior to the parties marriage,all four years of credit were his separate property.timothy acknowledged,however,that community funds used to pay for the purchase before the parties separation in october were community property.
a trial was held on the issue,and both parties testified regarding the purchase of the military service credit.the trial court ordered that the military service credit portion of the calpers pension in timothy name be awarded to timothy as his separate property.timothy was ordered to pay julie the sum of,representing half of the installment payments made with community funds during the marriage toward the military service credit,plus interest at the rate of six percent.
julie appealed after judgment was entered,challenging only the characterization of the military service credit after appellate briefing was complete,this court on its own motion accorded amicus curiae status to the american academy of matrimonial lawyers,northern california chapter academy,and invited the academy to submit a brief.the academy accepted the court invitation.because academy members who discussed the issue were not unanimous in their views as to the appropriate characterization and allocation of the military service credit,the academy filed a brief containing two sections,one advocating reimbursement with interest,and the other advocating allocation of separate and community property interests in the credit.timothy and julie thereafter filed answer briefs.
discussiona.overview of applicable law.
the characterization of property as community or separate determines its division upon dissolution of marriage.each spouse owns a interest in all community property.in general,community property is divided equally in the aggregate when the marriage ends,see.however,separate property is not subject to a similar division,and belongs only to the owner spouse.in re marriage of benson cal th,d.we review the trial court characterization of military service credit as separate property as a mixed question of law and fact that is predominately one of law,subject to de novo review.in re marriage of sonne cal th,d,sonne.
any analysis of the division of pension rights must be guided by our supreme court seminal case,in re marriage of brown cal d,brown,which held that the community owns all pension rights attributable to employment during the marriage.id.at.brown concluded that pension rights,whether or not vested,represent a property interest,and to the extent that such rights derive from employment during marriage,they comprise a community asset subject to division in a dissolution proceeding.id.at.the court defined a vested pension right as one that is not subject to a condition of forfeiture if the employment relationship terminates before retirement.ibid.an employee can hold a vested but immature pension right,such as when the right to payment is subject to the condition that the employee survive until retirement.ibid.nonvested pension rights,by contrast,are contractual rights subject to a contingency or contingencies usually,that an employee continue to work for his or her employer.id.at.
at issue in brown were the nonvested pension rights of husband,who accumulated retirement points pursuant to a plan under which he would forfeit his pension rights if he was discharged before he accumulated a threshold number of points.brown,supra,cal d at.the court distinguished such nonvested rights from a mere expectancy,which is not a property right divisible upon dissolution of marriage.id.at.an expectancy is the interest of a person who merely foresees that he might receive a future beneficence,such as the interest of an heir apparent citations,or of a beneficiary designated by a living insured who has a right to change the beneficiary citations.id.at,fn.omitted.t he defining characteristic of an expectancy is that its holder has no enforceable right to his beneficence,original italics.the supreme court concluded that the nonvested property rights in brown were more than a mere expectancy since pension benefits represent a form of deferred compensation for services rendered citation,the employee right to such benefits is a contractual right,derived from the terms of the employment contract.ibid.n onvested pension rights are not an expectancy but a contingent interest in property.id.at.
process for purchasing military service credit.
many public employees in california enjoy the benefit of membership in calpers.members of calpers,once vested,participate in a defined benefit retirement plan,which supplies a monthly retirement allowance under a formula comprising factors such as final compensation,service credit,the credited years of employment,and a multiplier.the retirement allowance consists of an annuity which is funded by member contributions deducted from the member paycheck and interest thereon and a pension which is funded by employer contributions and which must be sufficient,when added to the annuity,to satisfy the amount specified in the benefit formula,subd.a,subd.a.sonne,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
section permits a calpers member to obtain up to four years of service credit for service with the united states armed forces before the statute was amended in,it provided that,in order to obtain such credit,the member must contribute an amount equal to the contributions for current and prior service that the employee and his or her employer would have made with respect to him or her had he or she been in membership for a period equal to the military service and assuming that the employer rate in effect at the time of election and his or her compensation at the beginning of his or her first period of service in membership with the employer under this section had been in effect for the period.stats,ch.in other words,whereas employers and employees generally both pay contributions to a member calpers plan for credit earned during employment sonne,supra,cal th at,d,a member was required to pay both the employer and employee amounts for military service credit purchased pursuant to section.
sections through were enacted in,to standardize the method for purchasing military service credit and other forms of credit based on service performed outside the calpers system.stats,ch.section governs the method of payment for service credit section governs the calculation of the contribution,and provides in relevant part that a member who elects to receive service credit subject to this section shall contribute,in accordance with section,an amount equal to the increase in employer liability,using the payrate and other factors affecting liability on the date of the request for costing of the service credit.the methodology for calculating the amount of the contribution shall be determined by the chief actuary and approved by the board.stats,ch.
at the same time that the forgoing statutes were enacted,section was amended to provide that any member electing to receive credit for military service shall do so pursuant to sections and.stats,ch.members,such as timothy,who requested costing of service credit between january,and december,had the option of making contributions pursuant to sections and,or to make the payment calculated under section as it read before the statute was amended.west ann.supp.
as for how contributions worked in this case,timothy testified below that his fire department elect ed to offer us certain and when my employer offers the military,pers takes a little bit more,that rate they pay each year.he further testified that his employer ha d been contributing to allow members to buy military service credit since they first gave us that option.so my employer has been contributing their portion of it into the pers system for many years.in its amicus brief,the academy claims that this testimony misrepresented that timothy employer paid for a portion of his military service credit.the author acknowledges that timothy was probably referring to the cost his employer paid to elect to be subject to section,as opposed to payment for his particular military service credit.see,subd.f statute authorizing purchase of military service credit applies only if contracting agency elects to be subject to it.timothy confirms in his answer brief that this was what he meant,which is consistent with his testimony below that the employer contribution was not an individual thing,meaning that his employer paid to enable its employees to purchase military service credit,subd.f,but not that his employer paid to purchase any individual employee military service credit.it is thus undisputed that timothy was responsible for the entire cost to purchase the military service credit.
as for the benefit that timothy obtained by electing to purchase military service credit,section,subdivision a provides that a member electing to purchase service pays contributions that he or she would have made to the system for the period during which military service was performed,at a rate of contribution under his or her employer formula at the rate age that applied when the employee was hired,and that the employee compensation earnable on that date applies to the member during the period for which credit is granted.before the statute was amended in,section provided that a purchase of military service credit was based on the rate in effect at the time of election,and as well as on the compensation at the time of hire.former,stats,ch.the rate that a calpers member is paid on retirement,however,takes into account an employee final compensation.thus,whatever method was used to set timothy contribution to purchase military service credit,he was able to purchase it based on his salary at the time of hire,but he will receive payment for the service credit based on his salary upon retirement 
community property interest in military service credit.
julie argues that the trial court erred in characterizing timothy military service credit as separate property,and we agree.as set forth above,in determining whether the community has an interest in pension rights,courts look to when a party acquired a property interest in them,such that the pension rights were more than a mere expectancy.brown,supra,cal d at.here,there is no dispute that timothy completed his military service before his marriage to julie.there can also be no dispute that calpers members who had served in the military,and whose employers elected to be subject to section,were eligible to purchase military service credit at the time that timothy served in the military however,at the time that timothy left the military,he had no property interest whatsoever in the calpers retirement plan,because he did not begin working for a calpers participant until three years later,when he began to work as a firefighter in.
even after timothy started working for a calpers participant,and thus became eligible to purchase military service credit based on his premarital service in the military,his right to such credit amounted to no more than an expectancy,which is not a property right divisible upon dissolution of marriage.brown,supra,cal d at.it is undisputed that,when timothy began working for the dougherty regional fire authority in,his employer was a calpers agency that provided its employees the option to purchase military service credit.however,section,subdivision e specifically provides that the statute shall apply to a member only if he or she elects to receive credit while he or she is in state service in the employment of one employer on or after the date of the employer election to be subject to this section.italics added.in other words,a member right to purchase credit is dependent on his or her employer election to be subject to section.presumably the employer could elect at some point to no longer be subject to section,in which case employees who had served in the military would have no right to purchase credit based on that service,let alone a property interest in calpers credit based on that service.
timothy characterizes his right to purchase military service credit as a nonvested pension right,which was a contingent retirement interest that was subject to conditions that we re wholly within his control.he relies on cases that stress that a contractual retirement benefit matures when the employee has an unconditional right to payment,all the conditions precedent to the payment of the benefits have taken place or are within the control of the employee.citations.citations.in re marriage of gillmore cal d,fn,italics added see also in re marriage of castle d.husband held property right even though contractual right to military retirement benefits contingent on avoiding court martial or dishonorable discharge in re marriage of pace d,fn.pension right matured if all conditions precedent to payment are within control of employee.in gillmore unlike here,husband held vested and matured retirement benefits,and the only condition to receiving those benefits was his actual retirement,at which point he would be immediately entitled to payment.gillmore at fn.
the academy author advocating reimbursement also focuses on timothy ability to control a condition precedent to activate his military service credit.she relies on in re marriage of skaden cal d,which held that termination benefits included in a husband insurance sales agent agreement with his employer entered into during the parties marriage were community property,subject to division upon dissolution.id.at.the relevant contract provided that husband would receive certain benefits if he was terminated two years or more after the contract effective date the parties were still married two years after husband entered into the contract.id.at.the court held that the vested but immature rights in question,which were subject to an agreement,were not a mere expectancy but a chose in action,and therefore property subject to division upon dissolution.id.at.apparently analogizing the status of the military service credit before timothy purchased it to the termination benefits in skaden,the academy author advocating reimbursement notes that the fact that the payment of benefits,the right to which has vested,is subject to a condition whose fulfillment is wholly within the control of the employee spouse does not affect the vested nature of the right or degrade it into an expectancy.id.at.in skaden,the condition subject to the employee spouse control was terminating his employment once he did that,he would automatically receive termination benefits,as set forth in his employment agreement.
here,by contrast,timothy held no such unconditional,contractual right to the payment of benefits,or even a nonvested right to such credit,before he actually purchased military service credit during the parties marriage,using community funds.the condition wholly within his control was the right to enter into a contract with calpers for the purchase of military service credit in the first place.before that point,he did not hold a contractual right to the military service credit,derived from the terms of the employment contract.brown,supra,cal d at,italics added.he instead held no more than an expectancy,because he held no enforceable right to the service credit,original italics.
the trial court also mischaracterized timothy abstract ability to purchase military service credit as a property interest when it relied on sonne,supra,cal th,d.sonne involved the dissolution of a husband second marriage.id.at,d.husband was a participant in calpers,and he transferred to his first wife her interest in the service credit he earned during their marriage years upon the dissolution of that first marriage.ibid.the first wife thereafter exercised her right to a refund of the accumulated contributions to the account,an election that permanently waived her right to any further claim on the retirement benefits,including any service credit,subds.a,d.sonne at,d.during his marriage to his second wife,husband exercised his right to redeposit the contributions pursuant to section,and paid for the redeposit with community funds through monthly payroll deductions.sonne at,d.at the time husband and his second wife separated,the community had redeposited percent of the scheduled payments,and the trial court concluded that the community was entitled to percent of the service credit based on the redeposited amount.ibid.
the supreme court reversed.the court concluded that because community funds contributed only to the annuity portion of the retirement allowance,the community was entitled only to a pro tanto share of the annuity,and not to a share of the pension component,which had been funded by employer contributions during husband first marriage.sonne,supra,cal th at,d.citing section,the court noted that a redeposit of member contributions for a prior period of service does not constitute consideration for the service credit for that period it is merely a condition precedent to a credit for that previously rendered service.sonne at,d.the trial court apportionment failed to consider that the right to the years of service credit was husband separate property,which preexisted the husband wife marriage,inasmuch as the service credit was offered in consideration for that prior years of service.ibid.the service credit at issue was earned during husband marriage to his first wife,and was not attributable to employment during the second marriage.id.at,d.t he community made a redeposit of a portion of husband accumulated contributions,for the period of the first marriage.those contributions were converted into an annuity upon husband retirement.the obligation of the employer to contribute to the pension component,on the other hand,derived from husband service during the first marriage.accordingly,the community had a claim only on the annuity component relating to the time period of the first marriage,and was entitled only to a pro tanto share of that portion of husband retirement allowance.id.at,d,original italics.
the redeposit of member contributions in sonne is distinguishable from the purchase of military service credit in this case.in sonne,the husband right to years of service credit was husband separate property,because husband had obtained a contractual right to it during a previous marriage.sonne,supra,cal th at,d.the community did not purchase the service credit by redepositing member contributions during husband second marriage instead,the redeposit was merely a condition precedent to receiving credit for previously rendered service.ibid.in the present case,timothy held no such contractual property interest in military service credit before he purchased it his payment for the credit was not simply a condition precedent to obtaining previously earned credit under calpers,as it was in sonne,because unlike in sonne,timothy did not previously have a right to such credit.ibid.
the academy author advocating reimbursement relies on in re marriage of lucero d.lucero,which was cited favorably in sonne.sonne,supra,cal th at,d.in lucero,husband withdrew retirement contributions from an employer retirement plan during the parties marriage.lucero at.husband redeposited those funds after the parties separated,using his own separate funds.ibid.the court characterized the pension rights held before redeposit as similar to the nonvested pension rights in brown,because they amounted to a nonvested pension subject to the single additional contingency of redeposit of retirement contributions previously withdrawn.both are contingent contract rights,and thus both should be treated as property subject to division on dissolution of marriage.lucero at.because the right to redeposit contributions was a pension right that was attributable to employment during the marriage,husband monthly retirement benefit was community property subject to division after wife reimbursed husband for his separate property payment to reactivate the credit.id.at.
according to the academy author advocating reimbursement,this case is analogous to lucero,supra,d,except that community property was used to activate service credit owned by timothy separate estate,instead of the other way around separate property being used to activate pension rights in lucero.however,the pension rights that were reactivated in lucero clearly were governed by a preexisting contract between the employee husband and his employer,meaning that they were contingent contract rights,and thus should be treated as property.here,by contrast,there was no contract governing husband military service time before the parties purchased the credit,only a possible expectancy that if timothy continued to work for a calpers participant,and if section remained in effect,and if timothy employer continued to offer the option to buy military service credit pursuant to the statute,and if timothy paid the requisite amount,he would be entitled to the benefit of the credit he purchased.
in re marriage of spengler th,d,upon which timothy relies,actually supports a finding that timothy did not hold a property right to military service credit before he entered into an agreement to purchase the credit.spengler held that the right to renew an life insurance policy was not a property right,because although the renewal right had potential value,in the absence of a right by the insured spouse to enforce that value,the renewal right is not property within the meaning of the community property laws.id.at,d.likewise here,although timothy right to purchase military service credit had potential value,he had
