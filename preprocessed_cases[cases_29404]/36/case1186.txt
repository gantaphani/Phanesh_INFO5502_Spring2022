joetta appeals from the dependency court order terminating the court jurisdiction over her daughters,and janee,while awarding legal and physical custody of the girls to their father,herman w.we affirm.
facts and procedural 
in january,the riverside county department of child protective services dcps filed a petition alleging that joetta mother had physically harmed or otherwise posed a risk of harm to her daughters,and janee welf.the petition alleged that mother routinely hit and,on january,hit and slapped face about times was arrested that day on charges of battery,criminal threats,and child endangerment abused drugs and alcohol suffered from mental health problems and placed janee at risk due to her conduct,subds.b,j.the petition alleged that the minors father,herman father,was not a member of the household and failed to provide for or protect his daughters,subd.b.
the petition was sustained in april,and the children were placed in foster care.reunification services were ordered for both mother and father.riverside dcps reports prepared for that jurisdictional hearing included statements from the children and others confirming that mother had a history of violent outbursts,physically attacked father,and bloodied nose.mother refused to provide information,and said she would talk to only her lawyer and jesus christ.the children said they wanted to live with mother,but only if she got help for her problems.father had used drugs in the past and had been in prison,but had gone through drug and alcohol counseling programs and was working as an auto mechanic.he wanted custody of the minors.
a review hearing was held in september.evidence at the hearing showed that the father had completed a parenting class and participated in counseling with the children.the minors had spent weekends with father,were excited about the prospect of living with him,and had asked to do so.mother still needed services and an appropriate place to live,and was unwilling to discuss or acknowledge her abusive conduct.the riverside dcps recommended placing the children with father and providing mother with another six months of reunification services.the riverside dependency court found that the father progress had been satisfactory,adopted those recommendations as its order,and set the matter for further review under sections and it then transferred the matter to the los angeles county dependency court because father lived in los angeles.the case was officially accepted for transfer by the los angeles county dependency court in november,and the case was continued in order to set a hearing for the father under section and for the mother under section.from then on,the case was overseen by the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs.
in march,dcfs submitted a report to the los angeles county dependency court.according to that report,mother had completed parenting education and participated in some type of therapy.a psychological evaluation of mother was reportedly completed,but had not been submitted because the evaluator was ill.in violation of her visitation orders,mother would sometimes walk the children home from school.she was living at a transitional home known as joshua house and was enrolled in the arms of grace counseling center.the children were still living with father and with father mother grandmother.father home was clean and safe.the children had regularly assigned chores and appeared happy to be living with father.because the minors were living in a good environment,which included the positive influence exerted by grandmother,because the father was providing his daughters with adequate care and supervision,and because they appeared happy with that arrangement,dcfs recommended that the children remain in father custody and that the court terminate its jurisdiction.notice that the court intended to adopt that order was provided to the mother,and the matter was set for a hearing in april.
at the april,dispositional hearing,the court took judicial notice of the entire file.it also heard testimony from mother,father,the children,and dcfs social worker tracey harrington.testified she did not want to choose between her parents because she loved them both.she felt safe on overnight visits with mother.janee said she had no preference between her parents.although she felt safe with mother,she admitted that she sometimes felt scared when she lived with mother.mother denied that she had unauthorized contact with the children.she admitted to,but minimized,a recent incident where she shut a car door on father leg.she also complained that she had received little in the way of reunification services.according to mother,she had been in constant contact with the social workers and asked them to visit her living quarters and arrange conjoint counseling.the social worker promised to get back to her,but never did.the social worker visited mother just once,right after the case was transferred to los angeles county.
according to social worker harrington,the children had a good relationship with mother and wanted to visit her.he admitted that he never contacted the person who conducted mother psychological evaluation.
the court agreed that,absent father presence in the case,it would not be able to find that reasonable reunification services had been offered to mother.because the children were with father,however,the court indicated that fact was not relevant.the court found that mother continued to deny or minimize the drug and alcohol use,mental health issues,and other matters that led the court to take jurisdiction.because the children had limited contact with mother since the case was transferred to los angeles county,they had no way of knowing whether mother still had the same problems.the court concluded that the children could not be safely returned to mother,and that they were safe with their father.the court also noted that months had elapsed since the children were first detained.the court then found that the conditions that justified taking jurisdiction under section no longer existed,terminated jurisdiction,awarded full legal and physical custody of the children to father,and allowed mother weekly visits.as a result,the case left the dependency court and was subject to jurisdiction of the family law court.
on appeal,mother contends the court erred because the evidence showed there was a need for continuing jurisdiction by the dependency court,and she did not receive adequate reunification services.
discussion 
section provides the applicable procedural rules 
after the review hearing,at which the children were placed with father,both the riverside and los angeles county dependency courts referred to section when setting future hearings and deciding this matter.section applies when a dependency court determines that jurisdiction under section is appropriate,but the child is not removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian,subd.a.at the review hearing,the court shall terminate its jurisdiction unless dcfs proves that the conditions still exist which would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under section,subd.c.because the minors did not live with father when first detained,but were instead taken from mother home and eventually placed with father,the dependency court erred by proceeding under section.in re nicholas th,d nicolas section applies when a child is not removed from the physical custody of the parent or guardian,and has no application where a child is placed in the home of a parent with whom the child did not previously reside after being removed from the home of the other parent but see in re th,d.
instead,we believe this matter should have been determined under section,which provides that when a court assumes jurisdiction of a minor,it must determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if so,the court must place the child with that parent unless it finds that doing so poses a risk of harm to the child,subd.a.under that
