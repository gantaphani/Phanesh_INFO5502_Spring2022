introduction 
the trial court was not justified in asserting dependency jurisdiction over the child in this case,who had never been abused or neglected by anyone.the child,came to the attention of the department of children and family services after her father asserted his right to custody of his daughter,seeking to gradually remove the child from the only home she had ever known where she lived with her maternal grandparents after her mother death.
was seven years old when she twisted her ankle at school and stayed home for a week.her father,wondering why his daughter was not in school her grandparents having told him nothing about the injury went to her school to inquire.the principal had known the family for years and recognized him as father.the principal told father how his daughter sprained her ankle and encouraged him to visit,who was back in school.after that,father went to the grandparents home to make arrangements to take custody of her the grandparents did not cooperate father called for police assistance and soon thereafter,the grandparents hired a lawyer to file a probate case to have themselves declared legal guardians.they also made a report of child abuse to the department.
maternal relatives reported father abused alcohol regularly and always during his rare visits with his daughter.they reported father saw no more than twice a year,and he ignored his daughter to drink himself into oblivion with his second wife and friends.they reported that during a recent visit,father got drunk,left his daughter locked in his truck for half an hour to drink some more and then,when his adult son discovered the child locked and sobbing in his truck,drove her home in an intoxicated state.needless to say,this report prompted the full intervention of the department,with interviews and evaluations by social workers,doctors,and psychologists,referrals for further evaluations,drug and alcohol testing,and extensive interviews of family,friends,neighbors,school officials,and others.
in the end,however,after a contested jurisdictional hearing,the dependency court struck all the allegations of alcohol abuse,including the allegation that father had left locked and alone in his truck.that left no allegations by the department to support jurisdiction over the child,who clearly did not want to leave her grandparents to go live with a father she felt she barely knew.so the dependency court amended the allegations on its own motion based on the finding that father had abdicated his role of father for his daughter all her life.
in short,the ruling resulted in the child being suitably placed with her grandparents,and put a father who had never harmed his child at risk of losing parental rights if he did not fulfill all court orders recommended by the department.the court assertion of dependency jurisdiction in this case was an abuse of discretion,and we reverse with instructions that the dependency proceeding be dismissed.we express no view as to whether probate proceedings may be appropriate to determine whether the grandparents should be declared the child guardians.we simply hold the dependency court can not assert jurisdiction where there is no evidence of parental abuse or neglect.
