at the detention hearing,the juvenile court found it appropriate to temporarily detain.the court then continued the hearing to allow mother an opportunity to appear with her retained counsel.however,because mother did not appear at the next hearing with retained counsel,the juvenile court appointed counsel to represent her.at mother request,a contested jurisdictional hearing was scheduled.the juvenile court advised mother that she could challenge the allegations in the petition at the jurisdictional hearing.the court also explained that she would have the right to testify,call witnesses,and witnesses.in response to mother suggestion that she had evidence demonstrating that the allegations in the petition were not true,including traffic collision reports saying she was not drinking on the date of the accident and ambulance reports,the court advised mother that she could give these reports to her attorney and present them at the jurisdictional hearing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court ordered detained with visitation for mother and the presumed father,and scheduled a combined jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.
