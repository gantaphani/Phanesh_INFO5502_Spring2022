introduction 
in may harris and croce terminated their marriage,agreed that spousal support would be waived,and that harris would hold croce harmless from the obligation of the community to pay mike munaretto and carol munaretto in connection with a debt totaling at the time but which has increased to over.in october,harris filed a chapter bankruptcy petition listing the munarettos as unsecured creditors but did not include croce as a creditor.harris did not notify croce of his petition.
on february,harris was granted a discharge of his debts under section of the bankruptcy code.harris never did include croce in the bankruptcy petition and did not tell her that his obligation to the munarettos had been discharged in bankruptcy.
in,croce purchased a home but was unaware of the munaretto judgment until november,when she received an application for renewal of the judgment from the munarettos.
this proceeding began by croce as a law and motion matter seeking an order modifying the spousal dissolution judgment to order harris to hold her harmless from the munaretto claims.that motion expanded into an evidentiary hearing consisting of croce testimony.as a result of the proceedings,the trial court denied croce initial request to compel harris to provide spousal support but made the following findings and orders 
the court finds that petitioner,sydney lowe harris,has had at various points in time before the bankruptcy discharge,as well as after,the ability to pay on the debt set forth in paragraph of the judgment for dissolution filed on january,specifically stating that petitioner shall pay the following community property obligation and hold respondent free and harmless therefrom on the litigation with munaretto,case no.vc,and has failed and neglected to do so,although it is petitioner responsibility as per the parties agreement that the parties had in their contractual agreement which is the marital settlement agreement.
despite lack of harm directly to respondent at this time,that petitioner does not intend to indemnify respondent in the future,and that the court finds therefore,that breach,as well as anticipatory breach in the alternative,has occurred which requires compensation of a party in order to make the party whole.
the most appropriate method of doing so is to place respondent in no better position than she would have been had,in fact,this agreement has been complied with namely,this is not a situation wherein respondent should be allowed to obtain a windfall.this is a situation wherein if respondent decides that she wishes to go by way of a discharge in bankruptcy herself,that she does not simply collect a quarter of million dollars from petitioner to keep for her own purposes.this was for a very specific use.
it does not appear appropriate that the court order the amount of be ordered by way of writ of execution.that respondent may obtain by way of writ of execution against petitioner for that amount which is the amount of the munaretto judgment against respondent with orders that any amounts collected from petitioner by way of writ of execution on this debt be forwarded to respondent judgment creditor,which would be the munarettos for payment on the debt.that would be a pure indemnification.it should occur within two weeks of the money actually being in hand.
we reject harris assertion that his bankruptcy discharge terminated his obligation to pay the munaretto community obligations despite his written agreement to do so.
effect of the discharge of harris in bankruptcy 
on january,harris and croce entered an agreement of dissolution of their marriage which,in addition to other agreements,required harris to hold croce harmless on litigation with munaretto 
harris argued before the trial court that his subsequent discharge in chapter bankruptcy in february discharged his obligation to croce under their dissolution agreement.in response,croce argued that harris chapter discharge did not terminate his obligation to her under the dissolution agreement for two reasons 
first,croce argues that harris obligation was not discharged under title united states code section a because her agreement with harris was in the nature of alimony to,maintenance for,or support for her as the spouse of harris.croce own reference to the case of in re gionis,gionis,raises substantial doubt that alimony,maintenance,or support for croce was an element in the dissolution of the marriage.in the gionis case there was a substantial disparity between the income of the husband and wife.the parties had a minor child for which custody was required.the trial court concluded that payments made to the wife by the husband were in the nature of spousal support.
none of the gionis factors were involved here.there was apparently no children in the marriage,there was no discussion of croce need for support,and no evidence of a disparity of income between them.the absence of those factors militated against a finding that the indemnity agreement between harris and croce was in the nature of spousal support.
in the alternative,croce argues that harris obligation to indemnify her was nondischargeable under title united states code section a section a.that section provided,at the time of the termination of the marriage,that discharge of an individual debtor under section of the bankruptcy code does not discharge that debtor from a debt of the kind described in section a incurred by the debtor in the course of a dissolution unless a the debtor does not have the ability to pay such debt from income or property that is not necessary to be expended for the maintenance or support of the debtor,or b discharging such debt would result in a benefit to the debtor that outweighs the detrimental consequences to the spouse.in that connection,the trial court could find that harris had the ability to pay the munaretto judgment.
in the case of in re montgomery montgomery,the court considered some factors similar to,and pertinent to this case.the parties borrowed money from wife parents to purchase a home and executed a joint note to wife parents.twelve years after the marriage,they separated.wife received the house husband received rights to his pension plan.they each agreed to pay of the debt owed to wife parents.when wife subsequently sold the property husband refused to pay his share of the unpaid debt.
the trial court observed that while dischargeability of a debt is liberally construed in favor of the debtor in order to promote his or her fresh start,that result is tempered when the debt arises from a divorce or separation agreement.
the trial court found that title united states code section a only precludes a debtor from discharging his obligations for alimony,maintenance or support.section a,however,precludes a discharge of the debtor in the course of a divorce,separation,or separation agreement unless a the debtor does not have the ability to pay from the income or property of the debtor such a debt or b the discharge of the debt would result in a benefit to the debtor that outweighs the detrimental consequences to a spouse or child of the debtor.
the montgomery trial court found that the wife was required by a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the debt was incurred in the course of a divorce proceeding,was imposed by a court of record,and did not qualify as alimony,maintenance or support within the scope of title united states code section a.once wife established those facts,the burden of proof shifted to husband to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt was dischargeable because the conditions set forth in subparagraph a or subparagraph b of section a existed.montgomery,supra,at.
the montgomery case confirms that section a a and b applies to this case and that harris obligation under the judgment of january,is not terminated unless subsections a or b apply.on remand the trial court must consider whether those subsections apply to harris here.
harris failure to notify croce of his petition 
croce complains that harris failure to notify her of his bankruptcy proceeding was dishonest,calculated to circumvent the bankruptcy court review of the indemnity a
