after pleading guilty to bank robbery,latidtus jones was sentenced to months imprisonment,based,in part,on the district court determination that he qualifies as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines.on appeal,jones challenges the district court career offender determination.we reverse.
in the summer of,latidtus jones robbed a bank in aurora,illinois.following his apprehension and arrest,the government charged jones with one count of bank robbery,in violation of a.jones eventually pleaded guilty to the charge and the district court accepted his plea.
in the sentencing proceedings that followed,the government sought a relatively high sentencing guideline range for jones based on the particulars of his crime and his extensive criminal history.among other things,the government argued that jones qualified as a career offender under of the sentencing guidelines because bank robbery is a crime of violence and jones had two previous felony convictions for crimes of violence,a massachusetts kidnapping conviction and a massachusetts assault and battery conviction.jones maintained,however,that his massachusetts assault and battery conviction was neither a felony conviction nor a conviction for a crime of violence.
jones contended that his assault and battery conviction was not a felony conviction because massachusetts classifies assault and battery as a misdemeanor.the district court rejected jones argument on the ground that,for purposes of the career offender guideline,a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year as assault and battery is in massachusetts qualifies as a felony,regardless of how state law classifies the crime.the court therefore ruled that jones assault and battery conviction must be considered a felony conviction.
jones contended that his assault and battery conviction was not a conviction for a crime of violence because there was insufficient evidence to establish that his offense involved actual,attempted,or threatened physical violence.also at issue was what evidence could be considered in determining whether his offense was a crime of violence.on this latter question,it appears that the district court decided to consider evidence outside the contents of the particular charge to which jones pleaded guilty,including testimony elicited from jones during the sentencing hearing and documents relating to his assault and battery conviction.
the documents received in evidence revealed that jones was originally charged with both simple assault and battery as well as assault and battery with a deadly weapon,namely,a paved parking lot.according to an incident report,jones had his face into the pavement in a parking lot and,when the police arrived,his wife was lying in a pool of blood.the state trial court record indicates that in exchange for an agreement to drop the assault and battery with a deadly weapon charge,jones pleaded guilty to the simple assault and battery charge,which alleged that jones did assault and beat his wife.the state court trial judge accepted his plea and sentenced him to two years imprisonment 
in his testimony before the district court,jones contested the allegation that he beat his he claimed that he was only trying to stop her from hitting him and she simply fell as they struggled.he also testified that when he pleaded guilty to the assault and battery charge he specifically objected to any claim that he beat his wife and that he pleaded guilty only because the trial judge assured him that simply touching someone constitutes assault and battery in massachusetts.
based on this evidence,the district court resolved the dispute over the nature of jones assault and battery conviction by concluding that jones had indeed pleaded guilty to beating his.accordingly,the district court ruled that jones assault and battery conviction was a conviction for a crime of violence.having concluded that jones assault and battery conviction was both a felony conviction and a conviction for a crime of violence,the district court ruled that jones qualified as a career offender under ussg.
taking into account this ruling,as well as other considerations relevant under the sentencing guidelines the district court sentenced jones to months imprisonment to be followed by years supervised release and ordered jones to pay in restitution and a assessment.jones now appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court erred in determining that he qualified as a career offender under ussg.
section of the sentencing guidelines provides,in relevant part 
a defendant is a career offender if the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction,the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
ussg.there is no dispute that jones was over at the time of the bank robbery or that bank robbery is a felony crime of violence,and there is no suggestion that jones has any felony controlled substance convictions.the only question the parties dispute is whether jones has two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence,and more particularly,whether jones massachusetts assault and battery conviction is a felony conviction for a crime of violence.jones contends,as he did in the district court,that,for purposes of the career offender guideline,his assault and battery conviction is neither a felony conviction nor a conviction for a crime of violence.the government confesses error on the latter point and we are persuaded that the government did so correctly.still,for completeness sake,we will address both of jones arguments,beginning with his argument that his assault and battery conviction is not a felony conviction for purposes of the career offender guideline.
felony conviction 
under massachusetts law,simple assault and battery is a misdemeanor punishable by up to years imprisonment.laws ch.laws ch.jones argues that because his offense of conviction is a misdemeanor under massachusetts law,it should not be considered a felony under the career offender guideline.the problem for jones is that the sentencing guidelines adopt an independent classification system for purposes of that guideline.the guidelines define prior felony conviction,as that term is used in ussg,to mean a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.ussg,comment.and,all of the courts that have considered the question have concluded that the only relevant consideration in determining whether a prior conviction is a felony conviction is whether the offense of conviction is punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year.united states dorsey,cir united states baker,cir united states davis,cir united states pinckney,cir see also united states belanger,cir suggesting in dicta such a conclusion.it simply does not matter whether state law classifies the offense as a misdemeanor or a felony.
jones offers a different reading of the guidelines definition of prior felony conviction.he contends that the definition is simply a default rule applicable only to crimes that are not specifically designated as felonies or is,crimes defined by wobbler statutes,which provide that a crime may be a felony or a misdemeanor depending on the length of the sentence imposed,see united states hester,cir dissenting opinion discussing a wobbler statute.under his view,federal courts must,in all other situations,respect the designation state law gives the crime in question.
we can not accept jones reading of the definition of prior felony conviction.to begin with,his reading disregards the significance of the first clause of the definition,a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,a clause that is not limited or qualified in any way by the remaining porti
