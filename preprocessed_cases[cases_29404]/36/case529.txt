the federal indian child welfare act icwa provides in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.this notice requirement,which is also codified in california law welf,all undesignated statutory references are to this code,enables a tribe to determine whether the child is an indian child and,if so,whether to intervene in or exercise jurisdiction over the proceeding.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding may be held until at least days after the tribe receives the required notice.a see,subd.d.
in this case,a juvenile court removed newborn isaiah from his parents care and placed him in foster care.in that proceeding,the court concluded there was no reason to know isaiah was an indian child.the court thus found icwa inapplicable and did not order the los angeles county department of children and family services the department to notify any tribe or the federal bureau of indian affairs bia.isaiah mother,defendant ashlee,did not appeal from this order placing isaiah in foster care.more than a year later,the juvenile court terminated ashlee parental rights.ashlee appealed from that order,citing the court failure to order the department to comply with icwa notice requirements.we granted review to decide whether a parent who does not bring a timely appeal from a juvenile court order that subsumes a finding of icwa inapplicability may challenge such a finding in the course of appealing from a subsequent order terminating parental rights.because icwa imposes on the juvenile court a continuing duty to inquire whether the child is an indian child,we hold that the parent may a challenge a finding of icwa inapplicability in an appeal from the subsequent order,even if she did not raise such a challenge in an appeal from the initial order.
isaiah was born in november,with a positive toxicology for marijuana,and he showed signs of withdrawal.the department filed a petition in juvenile court pursuant to section,subdivision b,alleging that parental drug use placed isaiah at risk of harm.at a hearing on december,the court removed isaiah from his parents care and granted temporary custody to the department.the court also ordered reunification services,drug rehabilitation,and counseling for isaiah parents.during the hearing,ashlee told the court she may have american indian ancestry.the court concluded it had no reason to know that isaiah was an indian child but ordered the department to investigate ashlee claims.
on january,the juvenile court held a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.the court placed isaiah in foster care and again ordered the department to offer reunification services to isaiah parents,including monitored visitation and substance abuse treatment.at this hearing,the court reviewed an icwa report prepared by the department indicating that isaiah grandfather may have had blackfeet ancestry and his may have been a member of a cherokee tribe.the court concluded that any possibility that isaiah is an indian child is really too attenuated and remote for it to suggest to this court or for this court to know that the child would fall under the indian child welfare act.accordingly,the court did not order the department to provide notice to any tribe or to the bia.ashlee did not appeal from this order placing isaiah in foster care or otherwise object to the court finding that icwa was inapplicable.
over the next several months,ashlee visited isaiah weekly.but she did not complete her drug treatment program or attend her scheduled drug tests.as a result,the juvenile court terminated reunification services in september and set a hearing on the termination of parental rights.the court ordered a permanent placement plan according to which isaiah would be adopted by his foster mother.
on april,the juvenile court terminated ashlee parental rights and again said it had no reason to know that isaiah was an indian child.the court cleared isaiah for permanent and final adoption.
on june,ashlee appealed from the order terminating her parental rights on the ground that the juvenile court had reason to know isaiah was an indian child yet failed to order the department to comply with icwa notice requirements.the court of appeal denied relief,explaining mother had the right to appeal the juvenile court order at the dispositional hearing.she did not do so,and only challenged the court failure to provide notice under the icwa approximately one and a half years later which was after the court terminated parental rights.however,the juvenile court dispositional findings and orders had become final days after the court announcement of the order.cal.rules of court,rule a.appellate jurisdiction to review an appealable order is dependent upon a timely notice of appeal.citation.in re elizabeth d.an appeal from the most recent order entered in a dependency matter may not challenge prior orders for which the statutory time for filing an appeal has passed.in re pedro th,pedro.here,because mother failed to timely appeal from the icwa finding in the juvenile court dispositional order,she is foreclosed from raising the issue now on appeal from the order terminating her parental rights.see in re elizabeth,supra,d at.in relying on pedro,the court of appeal took an approach contrary to in re th,dwayne superior court th dwayne,and in re marinna th marinna.we granted review to resolve this conflict among the courts of appeal.
congress enacted icwa in in response to rising concern in the mid over the consequences to indian children,indian families,and indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement,usually in homes.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,holyfield.icwa declared that it is the policy of this nation to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture.
the minimum standards established by icwa include the requirement of notice to indian tribes in any involuntary proceeding in state court to place a child in foster care or to terminate parental rights where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved.a.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or indian custodian and the tribe.ibid.the secretary refers to the united states secretary of the interior,whose department includes the bia.
icwa notice requirements serve two purposes.first,they facilitate a determination of whether the child is an indian child under icwa.defining indian child as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.bia guidelines in effect at the time of isaiah placement in foster care ma de clear that the best source of information on whether a particular child is indian is the tribe itself.of the interior,bia,guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings,see of the interior,bia,guidelines for state courts and agencies in indian child custody proceedings,only the indian tribe s may make the determination whether the child is an indian child under icwa.
second,icwa notice ensures that an indian tribe is aware of its right to intervene in or,where appropriate,exercise jurisdiction over a child custody proceeding involving an indian child.see c in any state court proceeding for the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child,the indian child tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.a an indian tribe shall have jurisdiction exclusive as to any state over any child custody proceeding involving an indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe,except where such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the state by existing federal law.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe a.in enacting these provisions,congress was concerned not solely about the interests of indian children and families,but also about the impact on the tribes themselves of the large numbers of indian children adopted by.holyfield,supra,at see id.at icwa recognizes that the tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.
in,our legislature enacted provisions that affirm icwa purposes,subd.a and mandate compliance with icwa i n all indian child custody proceedings,subd.b.section codifies and elaborates on icwa requirements of notice to a child parents or legal guardian,indian custodian,and indian tribe,and to the bia.in addition to requiring notice to the bia to the extent required by federal law,the statute requires any notice sent to a child parents,indian custodians,or tribe to also be sent directly to the secretary of the interior unless the secretary has waived notice in writing,subd.a.section,subdivision e provides that an indian tribe determination of a child membership or eligibility for membership in the tribe shall be conclusive,and subdivision e says that a determination by the bia of tribal membership or eligibility for membership is conclusive in the absence of a contrary determination by the tribe.section affirms that t he indian child tribe and indian custodian have the right to intervene at any point in an indian child custody proceeding.and importantly for our purposes,section,subdivision a section a provides that courts and county welfare departments have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition under section is to be,or has been,filed is or may be an indian child in all dependency proceedings and in any judicial wardship proceedings if the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care.
the question before us is not whether the juvenile court erroneously concluded from the record that it had no reason to know isaiah was an indian child.we express no view on that determination.moreover,the department does not contend that ashlee failure to object to the juvenile court finding of icwa inapplicability at the april proceeding to terminate her parental rights precludes her from raising the issue for the first time in this appeal.see in re samuel th,samuel failure to raise icwa notice error at juvenile court hearing does not waive the claim for purposes of appeal from an order issued at that hearing marinna,supra,th at same.the issue presented here is whether ashlee having brought no timely challenge to the january foster care placement order,which subsumed a finding by the juvenile court that icwa notice was unnecessary may now challenge the april order terminating her parental rights on the ground that the juvenile court erred in finding icwa notice unnecessary.this question requires us to interpret the federal and california statutes governing icwa applicability to dependency proceedings,and we apply independent review.mendiola cps security solutions,cal th.
the court of appeal was correct to observe that under rule a of the california rules of court,the juvenile court january order became final days after it was announced.ashlee did not appeal from that order during the day period.section provides in relevant part a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed as an order after judgment.in sara superior court cal th sara,we said that a consequence of section is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.citation.an appeal from the most recent order in a dependency matter may not challenge earlier orders for which the time for filing an appeal has passed.id.at.under section and sara,ashlee may not challenge the january dispositional order through an appeal from the april order terminating her parental rights.
but it does not follow,as the court of appeal believed,that because ashlee failed to timely appeal from the icwa finding in the juvenile court dispositional order,she is foreclosed from raising the issue now on appeal from the order terminating her parental rights.the reason is that the juvenile court had a continuing duty to inquire whether isaiah was an indian child in all dependency proceedings,including a proceeding to terminate parental rights.in light of this continuing duty,the april order terminating ashlee parental rights was necessarily premised on a current finding by the juvenile court that it had no reason to know isaiah was an indian child and thus icwa notice was not required.here,the juvenile court made that finding explicit in the course of the april hearing when it said,the court is once again making a finding that i have no reason to know the child would fall under the indian child welfare act.properly understood,ashlee present appeal does not seek to challenge the juvenile court finding of icwa inapplicability underlying the january dispositional order.it instead seeks to challenge the juvenile court finding of icwa inapplicability underlying the april order terminating her parental rights.ashlee inaction in the face of the earlier order does not preclude her from now claiming in this appeal that the juvenile court erred in finding icwa notice unnecessary.
the continuing nature of a juvenile court duty to inquire into a child indian status appears on the face of section a.as noted,that provision reads the court ha s an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition under section has been filed is or may be an indian child in all dependency proceedings and in any juvenile wardship proceedings if the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care.a.the plain language of this provision declaring an affirmative and continuing duty that applies to all dependency proceedings means that the juvenile court in this case had a present duty to inquire whether isaiah was an indian child at the april proceeding to terminate ashlee parental rights,even though the court had previously found no reason to know isaiah was an indian child at the january proceeding to place isaiah in foster care.because the validity of the april order is necessarily premised on the juvenile court fulfillment of that duty,there is nothing improper or untimely about ashlee contention in this appeal that the juvenile court erred in discharging that duty.
reading section a together with section,subdivision e section e underscores the continuing nature of the juvenile court duty.the latter provision says if proper and adequate notice has been provided pursuant to section,and neither a tribe nor the bureau of indian affairs has provided a determinative response within days after receiving that notice,the court may determine that the indian child welfare act et does not apply to the proceedings,provided that the court shall reverse its determination of the inapplicability of the indian child welfare act and apply the act prospectively if a tribe or the bureau of indian affairs subsequently confirms that the child is an indian child.e.
section e implicitly recognizes that any finding of icwa inapplicability before proper and adequate icwa notice has been given is not conclusive and does not relieve the court of its continuing duty under section a to inquire into a child indian status in all dependency proceedings.see dwayne,supra,th at because the court duty continues until proper notice is given,an error in not giving notice is also of a continuing nature and may be challenged at any time during the dependency proceedings.only after proper and adequate notice has been given and neither a tribe nor the bia has provided a determinative response within days does section e authorize the court to determine that icwa does not apply.the effect of that determination is to relieve the court of the duty it would otherwise have under section,subdivision b to provide icwa notice whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved,and for every hearing thereafter.nevertheless,the court shall reverse its determination of icwa inapplicability if a tribe or the bia subsequently confirms that the child is an indian child.e see,subd.f notwithstanding a finding of icwa inapplicability under e,any information subsequently received by the court,social worker,or probation officer that would be subject to icwa notice must be provided to any tribes entitled to notice and to the bia.
the court of appeal observed that at the january dispositional hearing,all of the information provided by ashlee and her relatives about their american indian heritage was before the juvenile court,and the court considered the department report on its investigation into mother heritage.it does not appear that ashlee submitted any additional information bearing on isaiah status between january and april.but section a,which establishes a juvenile court affirmative and continuing duty to inquire into a child indian status,does not contain an exception for situations where no new information is submitted between one proceeding and the next.unlike a determination of icwa inapplicability that is made after proper and adequate notice has been provided and neither a tribe nor the bia has provided a determinative response within days e,the juvenile court determination of icwa inapplicability at the january hearing had no effect on its ongoing inquiry and notice obligations under sections and a.that is true even though ashlee did not submit any new information between january and the april hearing to terminate her parental rights.
the department,echoing concerns expressed by the court of appeal,contends that icwa notice issues are best resolved at the beginning of any dependency proceeding and that allowing icwa issues to be determined in an appeal from a hearing to terminate parental rights encourages the practice of ignoring icwa violations for years while a dependency case creeps through the proceedings.amicus curiae california state association of counties similarly contends that it is in the best interests of the all sic children to have a child indian status determined early in the child proceedings rather than waiting to raise the issue after parental rights have been terminated.we are mindful of the child need for a permanent and stable home,and we agree that swift and early resolution of icwa notice issues is ideal.but the federal and state statutes were clearly written to protect the integrity and stability of indian tribes despite the potential for delay in placing a child.the provisions of the california statute just discussed,as well as others,recognize the importance of properly determining a child indian status,even when a dependency proceeding has progressed beyond the initial stages.see ante,at discussing,subd.b,subds.a,e,f see also the indian child tribe and indian custodian have the right to intervene at any point in an indian child custody proceeding,subd.b requiring judicial compliance with icwa i n all indian child custody proceedings.the federal statute similarly provides in any state court proceeding for the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child,the indian custodian of the child and the indian child tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.c.icwa also provides any indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under state law,any parent or indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed,and the indian child tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections,and of this title.this latter provision contemplates that icwa notice requirements may be enforced after the issuance of an order terminating parental rights.allowing icwa notice error to be raised for the first time in a direct appeal from an order terminating parental rights seems unlikely to cause greater delay than allowing the parent to litigate the same issue in a separate and collateral proceeding.
in construing statutes,we consider the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme citation.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.smith superior court cal th.the provisions above,considered as a whole,make clear that indian tribes have interests protected by icwa that are separate and distinct from the interests of parents of indian children.see holyfield,supra,at.icwa notice requirements are intended to protect the interests of indian children and tribes despite the parents inaction.dwayne,supra,th at see samuel,supra,cal.app th at the notice requirements serve the interests of the indian tribes irrespective of the position of the parents and can not be waived by the parent.we agree with the majority view among the courts of appeal that given the court continuing duty throughout the dependency proceedings to ensure the requisite notice is given citation,and the protections the icwa affords indian children and tribes,the parents inaction does not constitute a waiver or otherwise preclude appellate review.dwayne,at accord,in re,supra,th at marinna,supra,th at.
in reaching a contrary holding,the court of appeal,relying on pedro,said,we are only addressing the rights of ashlee,not the rights of a tribe under the icwa.pedro reasoned that whereas icwa authorizes a tribe to intervene in a dependency action at any point in the proceeding c,it authorizes parents to petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate a dependency action but does not expressly permit a parent to allege an icwa violation at any point in the proceeding.pedro,supra,th at.as other authorities have observed,however,the tribe right to assert jurisdiction over the proceeding or to intervene in it is meaningless if the tribe has no notice that the action is pending.in re junious d,see samuel,supra,th at if a tribe which may have an interest in a proceeding does not have notice of that proceeding,the tribe will be unable to assert its rights under the icwa.marinna,supra,th at as a result of lack of notice to relevant tribes,it is unlikely that those tribes had notice of the dependency proceeding,and thus virtually certain that they were unable to assert their rights under icwa.as a practical matter,the approach taken by pedro makes the statutory right of indian tribes to intervene at any point in the proceeding c see largely contingent upon a parent alleging icwa notice error at the earliest possible opportunity in a dependency action.such an approach can not be reconciled with the statutory scheme,and we hereby disapprove in re pedro,supra,th.
the court of appeal also said,the principles enunciated in in re th support our conclusion that a dependent child interest in permanency and stability requires that there be a time limit to a parent right to raise the issue of icwa compliance.but in re is distinguishable.there the court of appeal,relying on dwayne,granted the parents first appeal challenging icwa notice violations and ordered the juvenile court to conditionally reverse its order terminating parental rights and to provide icwa notice.in re,at.the juvenile court gave notice to several tribes and,after receiving responses,concluded at a special hearing that
