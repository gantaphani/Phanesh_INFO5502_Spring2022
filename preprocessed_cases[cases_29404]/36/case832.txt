defendant and appellant adelaide kircher appeals the judgment entered after a bench trial adelaide contends the trial court erred by concluding that a marital settlement agreement msa between adelaide deceased husband,vincent kircher,and his former wife,plaintiff bonnie kircher,which was executed in june and modified in by stipulation of the parties waived the provisions of family code,section and provided for continuing support payments to bonnie after vincent death the trial court erred by concluding that adelaide is personally liable to bonnie for such continuing support payments in an amount not exceeding the fair market value of real property held by vincent and adelaide as joint tenants at the time of vincent death,pursuant to sections of the probate code 
we conclude that the modified msa waived the provisions of family code section and provided for continuing support payments to bonnie after vincent death.moreover,we find no error in the trial court legal conclusion that the property held in joint tenancy falls within the ambit of section.accordingly,the judgment is affirmed.
the facts framing the legal issues presented are undisputed.bonnie and vincent married on december,and separated on february.the couple had no children during the marriage in june,vincent attorney prepared the msa between bonnie and vincent.the msa states that t he purpose of this agreement is to make a final and complete settlement of all rights and obligations between bonnie and vincent,including their respective property rights and their rights and obligations concerning the support of wife.under the terms of the msa,husband agreed to pay wife per month in support payments terminating upon the death of either the husband or the wife or the remarriage of wife.at the time of the dissolution of the marriage in bonnie was years old.
further,the msa states it is our intention to effect an equal division of our community property listed in exhibit because of the nature of husband business operating primarily leased hotels,the division is not possible in kind.husband will pay the substituted asset out of the revenue from the community property retained by him.husband agrees that wife shall receive the community property described in exhibit wife agrees that husband shall receive the community property described in exhibit the community property assigned to bonnie in exhibit c includes a house in millbrae,california,complete with furniture and furnishings,a interest in real property at eddy street in san francisco,and the principal sum of payable in monthly installments of.the community property assigned to vincent under exhibit of the msa includes two san francisco properties,a hotel at eddy street and an apartment block at eddy street,as well as a percent interest in six hotel and apartment block leaseholds in san francisco the other percent owned by a third party and the proceeds of several life insurance policies.under the msa,vincent also agreed to leave by will to bonnie his undivided interest in eddy street.
in march,vincent and bonnie jointly filed a stipulation and order modifying interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage stipulation.the stipulation contains several recitals the first of which acknowledges that bonnie has raised issues regarding the propriety and equity of the division of community property set forth in the msa.further recitals state that vincent has met the support obligations set forth in the msa,denies any inequity or impropriety of the division of community property under the msa,and continues to have an abiding and sincere concern for bonnie.the stipulation also revised the support obligations under the msa,in return for which bonnie waived once and for all any rights,causes of action,claims,title or interest in any of the property of whatsoever character description set forth in the msa.under the terms of the stipulation,vincent agreed to pay bonnie per month commencing february,as and for spousal support,and continuing with monthly installments thereafter until the death of bonnie or until the remarriage of bonnie or proof that bonnie has lived with another person in a relationship for thirty or more consecutive days.in addition,vincent agreed to purchase or lease a new vehicle for bonnie at least every five years and to maintain health insurance for her benefit,both obligations to continue until the death of bonnie,her remarriage,or proof that bonnie has lived with another person in a relationship for thirty or more consecutive days.
in july,following the execution of the modified msa,vincent married adelaide.they remained married until vincent death in january.vincent executed his last will and testament on november.under the provisions of the will,vincent left to adelaide,among other things,a property at oak drive,san rafael,his interest in the real property known as the women hotel at jones street in san francisco,together with any other real property and leasehold interests that he owned at the time of his death.
sometime during his marriage to adelaide,but prior to his death,vincent transferred title in three real properties,namely oak drive,san rafael,jones street,san francisco and post street in san francisco,to himself and adelaide as joint tenants after vincent died,adelaide sold the post street property for million and received from the escrow of the sale the sum of.adelaide also sold the jones street property for and received proceeds from the sale in the amount of.
while vincent was alive,he met all the support payments to bonnie required under the modified msa.after vincent death in january,bonnie filed a creditor claim against vincent estate in probate court on july,asserting a claim for past and future obligations under the modified msa.during this time,adelaide continued to make support payments to bonnie as provided in the modified msa.adelaide terminated monthly support payments to bonnie in april,but continued to pay for bonnie health insurance.
procedural background 
on may,bonnie filed a complaint against adelaide personally and in her capacity as the executor of the will of vincent kircher,alleging that adelaide is personally liable for vincent debts under section and seeking damages and attorney fees for breach of the terms of the modified msa.on october,bonnie filed a first amended complaint fac adding a claim for declaratory relief which sought a declaration that adelaide,both individually and as the executor of vincent estate,was obligated to continue to comply with the terms of the modified msa.
thereafter,adelaide filed a motion for determination that bonnie has no right to demand payment out of properties held by adelaide and vincent kircher in joint tenancy when vincent died.in her motion,adelaide argued that bonnie can not enforce the modified msa support obligations against the real properties that she and vincent held in joint tenancy because under settled law a surviving joint tenant takes the property free of creditors claims.bonnie,in her opposition,asserted that she did not seek a judgment lien upon the joint tenancy properties which adelaide sold rather she sought to impose personal liability for continuing support payments on adelaide up to the value of those properties,pursuant to applicable sections of the probate code.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling on the motion,and after hearing oral argument adopted its tentative ruling,which states adelaide motion for determination that probate code sections,et,do not apply to joint tenancy property is denied.defendant relies on a strict interpretation of the language of probate code,which limits the personal liability of the surviving spouse to the value of community,and separate property of the decedent that passes to the surviving spouse without administration.under traditional concepts of joint tenancy,defendant argues that no property passes on the joint tenant death because the right of survivorship attaches as a result of the original grant that created the joint tenancy,and not as a result of the death of a joint tenant.at least one case has interpreted the language of more broadly as meaning property received or held by the surviving spouse,suggesting that it applies to property that was already possessed by the surviving spouse such as joint tenancy property.dawes rich th,see also miller and starr,cal.real estate,the interest of the deceased joint tenant passes to the surviving joint tenant or tenants by operation of law.the entire context of the probate code governing liability for debts of a deceased spouse supports the conclusion that the legislature intended to reach all property that passes without formal administration,limited only by whether the property is community,or separate property of the decedent,the character of the property,rather than the manner in which title is held.this conclusion is supported by probate code,which cuts off the personal liability of the surviving spouse who elects to subject all of the decedent property to probate administration in which case the creditors must look solely to the estate to satisfy their claims,and,which provides that any debt of the deceased spouse may be enforced against the surviving spouse in the same manner as it could have been enforced against the deceased spouse if the deceased spouse had not died.adelaide admits that vincent property held in joint tenancy could have been subject to a judgment lien had he breached his obligation during his lifetime.it is important to note that bonnie does not seek recovery or liens against the joint tenancy property,but seeks only to impose personal liability against defendant up to the fair market value of the property described in sections,et which this court finds may include the value of joint tenancy property that passed to adelaide without administration.
having determined that calculation of adelaide personal liability under section,subdivision c,encompasses property held in joint tenancy,the court conducted a bench trial and received evidence and testimony on the issue of whether the obligations set forth in the modified msa survived vincent death.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that vincent knowingly and intentionally waived the otherwise automatic termination of spousal support provisions on his death.in this regard,the court stated that it need not look any further than the terms of the modified msa,which evidenced a clear agreement that support payments would terminate only upon bonnie death.
an amended judgment was entered on may.adelaide filed a motion for new trial on june.the trial court denied the motion for new trial by its order filed on july,and a timely notice of appeal followed.
discussion 
family code section 
family code section section provides except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing,the obligation of a party under an order for the support of the other party terminates upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the other party.a party seeking to overcome the presumption that section applies must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parties intended to waive its provisions.in re marriage of cesnalis th,cesnalis.adelaide contends the trial court erred by concluding that bonnie established by clear and convincing evidence that vincent intended to waive the provisions of section.

the cesnalis court identified the basic principles governing how a written agreement may waive the termination provisions of section no particular words are required to waive section and make spousal support continue after death of obligor,but silence will not do.citations.there must be a written agreement on the issue or the subject.citations.section death termination is not waived simply because the written agreement fails to include death among the terminating events that are expressly mentioned.citation.nor is section overcome if the written agreement simply makes the spousal support provision nonmodifiable in general.citation.this is because termination and modification are distinct concepts describing different ways to alter a support obligation.citations.cesnalis,supra,th at.
we conclude that the modified msa constitutes a written agreement,within the meaning of section,that support payments would continue until bonnie death.such an agreement is reflected in the fact that the msa included section provision that support terminated upon the death of either party,it provided that the support provision of per month payable by husband to wife terminated under three circumstances the death of either the husband or the wife wife remarriage or if wife entered a relationship.following the stipulation,however,the modified msa did not retain section provision that support terminated upon the death of either party.rather,the modified msa expanded vincent support obligations making him responsible for paying bonnie per month,purchasing or leasing her a car every five years,and providing her with health care insurance,and provided that each of these support obligations would not terminate unless bonnie died bonnie remarried or bonnie entered a relationship.in short,the modified msa stripped out the terminating provision that support would cease with either vincent or bonnie death and replaced it with a terminating provision that support would cease only upon bonnie death.furthermore,although the written agreement does not use precise words such as bonnie support will continue after vincent death,case law does not require such precision in order to effect a waiver of section and make spousal support continue after the death of the obligor.cesnalis,supra,th at thornton,supra,th at see also steele langmuir d,support payments do not terminate simply because the parties literally do not provide otherwise.in sum,because the parties deleted the provision in the msa terminating support upon the death of either husband or wife,and in its place provided in the modified msa that all three support obligations would continue until bonnie death,we conclude that the modified msa constitutes a written agreement,within the meaning of section,that vincent would support bonnie until her death.
personal liability under the applicable provisions of the probate code 
having determined that vincent support obligations to bonnie survived his death,we now address the scope of adelaide personal liability for vincent obligations to bonnie under the governing statutes.on this issue,adelaide contends that the trial court erred in its conclusion that the property she held with vincent in joint tenancy could be considered in determining the extent of her personal liability under section.we conclude the trial court did not err on this point.
section provides except as provided in sections and upon the death of a married person,the surviving spouse is personally liable for the debts of the deceased spouse chargeable against the property described in section to the extent provided in section.adelaide does not contend that any of the foregoing statutory exceptions apply here.accordingly,the extent of her personal liability for vincent continuing support obligations is governed solely by section.
section provides the liability imposed by section shall not exceed the fair market value at the date of the decedent death,less the amount of any liens and encumbrances,of the total of the following a the portion of the of the community and property belonging to the surviving spouse under sections and that is not exempt from enforcement of a money judgment and is not administered in the estate of the deceased spouse b the portion of the of the community and property belonging to the decedent under sections and that passes to the surviving spouse without administration c the separate property of the decedent that passes to the surviving spouse without administration,subds.a c.
