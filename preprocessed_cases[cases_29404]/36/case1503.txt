when the juvenile court takes custody away from a legal guardian previously appointed by the family court,without terminating the guardianship,does a parent have the right to seek to regain custody the juvenile court here said no.we say yes.
factual and procedural background 
janice is the mother of catherine and her older sister,theresa who is not a party to this appeal.when this case was filed,catherine was she is now.
janice suffers from mental illness.in august,she was twice involuntarily hospitalized.florence,janice mother,took theresa and catherine into her care.upon janice release,florence filed a guardianship petition in family court.on august,the family court appointed florence as temporary guardian on june,it appointed her as permanent guardian.
on may,florence left four minors home overnight without any adult supervision catherine,theresa,one of florence grandsons,and one of theresa friends.the only other adult in the house was florence son daniel,who was schizophrenic and incapable of looking after the children.florence grandson amused himself by throwing molotov cocktails into traffic.when the police responded,theresa admitted that she and her friend had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana.catherine was detained and placed in a foster home.florence told social workers that she was too old to care for catherine properly,and she felt it was in catherine best interest to remain in foster care.
on may,the san bernardino county department of children services the department filed a dependency petition in juvenile court as to catherine,alleging that florence had failed to supervise or protect her.welf,subd.b.there were no allegations regarding janice.the next day,at the detention hearing,the juvenile court allowed florence to have unsupervised visitation it allowed janice to have supervised visitation.
on july,the date set for the hearing,florence filed a written waiver of reunification services.the juvenile court accepted her waiver.florence noted,however,that she was not consenting to terminate the guardianship.
janice counsel announced that janice was seeking custody and asked the juvenile court to set a contested hearing.minor counsel objected that janice did not have standing to contest any issues.the department counsel likewise objected t he court is removing custody from the guardian,and we not terminating the guardianship,so janice at this point does not have the right to custody.the juvenile court denied janice request,ruling that janice does not have standing in which to object to the however,it continued the hearing,partly to allow janice counsel to bring forth any case law which would prove the court wrong.
on august,at the continued hearing,janice was not present.janice counsel did not contest jurisdiction however,she reiterated her request for a contested dispositional hearing.counsel for the department and for the minor objected again.they argued i f janice wishes to do anything,i think she has to file a welfare and institutions code section petition.the juvenile court agreed that janice correct course of action would be to file a welfare and institutions code section petition.it ruled that janice does not have standing to set a contested hearing.
the juvenile court then found the allegations of the petition true.it declared catherine a dependent and formally removed her from florence custody.it also selected foster care as her permanent plan.
refusal to hold a contested dispositional hearing 
janice contends the juvenile court erred by denying her request for a contested hearing.in her opening brief,she relied on welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.this provision applies to proceedings to terminate a guardianship established by the juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section or.it provides that unless the parental rights of the child parent or parents have been terminated,they shall be notified that the legal guardianship has been revoked or terminated and shall be entitled to participate in the new permanency planning hearing.she argued that there had been a de facto revocation of the guardianship,and hence she was entitled to participate.the department argued that this provision did not apply at a hearing and that the guardianship had not been terminated.
we requested further briefing.we noted that generally,when the juvenile court removes a child from a parent or guardian custody,it must consider placing that child with any noncustodial parent who so requests.welf,subd.a.we asked whether the juvenile court prejudicially erred by violating this provision.in response,both janice and catherine argued that it did.it is perhaps not surprising,in light of our request for further briefing,that we agree.we therefore do not reach the applicability of welfare and institutions code section.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,as relevant here,provides when a court orders removal of a child,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.janice fell squarely within the terms of this provision.the juvenile court was ordering catherine removed from florence custody janice was a parent with whom catherine was not residing before the petition was filed and janice was requesting custody.
the department argues that welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a applies only to a parent who is at that time entitled to custody,not one whose right of custody has been supplanted by a guardianship not so.this provision is designed to allow the court to place the child in the custody of a parent who is not otherwise entitled to custody.in re sarah d,disapproved on other grounds in in re chantal cal th,d.indeed,noncustodial is often used as a shorthand term for a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing,in re erika th,d.either term would include a parent whose child is in a guardianship.
once a petition has been filed,the juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction over custody of the including any guardianship proceedings.welf,subds.a,f cal.rules of court,rule a.by placing catherine in foster care,without terminating the guardianship,the juvenile court effectively took physical custody away from florence while leaving her with legal custody.thus,she retained the right and the responsibility to make decisions relating to catherine health,education,and welfare.see.the guardianship did not preclude the juvenile court from taking physical custody away from florence and granting it to someone else.welf,subds.a,c.in particular,it did not preclude the juvenile court from granting physical custody to janice.
the department also argues that,in a dependency proceeding under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a only the social services agency,the child,or the guardian can move to modify or terminate a guardianship previously established under the probate code.it concludes that janice lacks standing.we may assume,without deciding,that the department interpretation of this subdivision is correct.janice,however,was not seeking to modify or terminate the guardianship.the department was seeking to modify the guardianship,by removing catherine from florence custody.this modification would necessitate a change in placement.janice merely sought to be heard on the question of argue that catherine,once removed,should be placed with her rather than in foster care.
indeed,welfare and institutions code section,if it applies here,tends to support janice position.it requires that notice of a motion to modify or terminate the guardianship must be given not only to the guardian,but also to the parent.welf,subd.a,incorporating,subd.b.notice to the parent may be pretermitted only if the parent has relinquished the child for adoption or the child has been declared fr
