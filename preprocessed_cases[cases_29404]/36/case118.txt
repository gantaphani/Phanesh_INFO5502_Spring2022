background 
in september,tindall and dianne tindall,parents of kyle tindall,a minor,brought an action against the defendants under the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,et,section of the rehabilitation act of rehabilitation act,the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and.in april,following the dismissal by the district court jerome niedermeier,magistrate judge of two counts of the original complaint,the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing ten counts,including several claims brought on behalf of kyle.counts i and iv were dismissed with prejudice by stipulation in november.after counts ix and x were voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiffs,the district court,in an opinion dated january,on the defendant motion for judgment on the the court converted to a motion for summary counts vi through x of the amended complaint.among those counts,count vi invasion of privacy and count vii misrepresentation were claims on kyle behalf.
two weeks later,the tindalls counsel moved to withdraw.the court granted the motion,ordering the tindalls to find other counsel or appear pro se.tindall entered an appearance pro se and also filed a motion for reconsideration of the order allowing her counsel to withdraw,as well as several motions requesting more time to find new counsel.noting that tindall could not represent her son kyle pro se,the court granted an extension until august,to retain or request appointment of counsel for kyle.
in an opinion dated september,the district court dismissed,without prejudice,counts ii and v,which had been brought on behalf of kyle,on the basis that tindall could not represent her son pro se.the court noted that tindall had been unable to retain a lawyer to represent kyle despite being granted extensions of time to do so.the court pointed out that although tindall asserted that her inability to retain counsel resulted from financial constraints,a court may award attorneys fees to parents of a disabled child if he or she prevails under idea.in addition,the court found that kyle failed to meet the standard for the appointment of counsel at public expense.subsequently,in an opinion dated may,the court also granted summary judgment to the defendants,and denied summary judgment to the plaintiff,as to count iii,which alleged that tindall had been discriminated against based on her disability,resulting in injury to kyle.the court found that the record did not show that tindall had suffered any harm,and further noted that the claim of injury as to kyle was the same as the one alleged in previously dismissed counts of the original complaint.tindall appeals,representing herself and purporting to represent her son kyle.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment de novo,accepting the plaintiff allegations as true when considering the motion to dismiss,and drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party for purposes of summary judgment,see sharpe conole,cir,or,when for summary judgment are filed,against the party whose motion is under consideration,boy scouts of am.wyman,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.mackey ex rel.thomas bd.of educ.for arlington cent.sch,cir quoting.c.
upon review of the record and the applicable law,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to count viii,alleging defamation of character,brought by tindall on her own behalf.the court correctly concluded that this claim,which accrued in when the alleged defamatory statements were made,was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.see.stat.ann.tit.we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to the claims under count iii pertaining to tindall,because the evidence she proffered does not support her claim that she was harmed in this way.furthermore,because counts ix and x were voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiffs and counts i and iv were dismissed by stipulation,they are not before us.
as to the counts brought on behalf of kyle tindall that have been dismissed,namely counts ii,v,vi,vii and part of count iii,we defer our decision for the limited purpose of permitting counsel to be retained to represent him before us.the choice to appear pro se is not a true choice for minors who under state law,see.b,can not determine their own legal actions.cheung youth orchestra found.of buffalo,cir and although l itigants in federal court have a statutory right to choose to act as their own counsel,machadio apfel,cir citing,an individual who is not licensed as an attorney may not appear on another person behalf in the other cause,id.quoting iannaccone law,cir.it is thus a general rule in this circuit that a parent not admitted to the bar can not bring an action pro se in federal court on behalf of his or her child.see cheung,at a parent must be represented by counsel in bringing an action on behalf of his or her child in federal court wenger canastota cent.sch,cir per curiam same,cert.denied,d see also murphy arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir noting that i n this circuit,a parent is precluded from representing his or her child in federal court and that the district court should have ordered pro se plaintiff who prevailed in district court when represented by a parent,and was represented by counsel on appeal,to obtain counsel in the district court,although finding no reversible error under the circumstances of the case,see infra,footnote.the rule is primarily based on protection of the legal interests of the minor and the impropriety of a person who is not a member of the bar representing another person in court proceedings.see cheung,at i t is not in the interests of minors or incompetents that they be represented by.where they have claims that require adjudication,they are entitled to trained legal assistance so their rights may be fully protected.
the broad language of our decisions,as discussed above,and the reasons for it suggest that the principle ordinarily must hold in our court on appeal.lewis,cir per curiam extending the rule that an individual may appear in the federal courts only pro se or through counsel to the appellate though the federal rules of appellate procedure and the seventh circuit rules are silent as to whether may represent anyone other than themselves and striking the appearance and brief of a purporting to represent the appellant georgiades,concluding that son,who was not a member of the bar of any court,was not qualified to appear in the district court or in the court of appeals as counsel for others 
we pause to note,however,that the rule is not quite as absolute as it may seem.see machadio,at a parent may bring an action on behalf of his or her child without representation by an attorney,w here a district court,after appropriate inquiry into the particular circumstances of the matter at hand,determines that a parent who brings a supplemental security income appeal from a decision by an administrative law judge on behalf of his or her children has a sufficient interest in the case and meets basic standards of competence.murphy,at declining to vacate,on appeal in which minor was represented by counsel,the district court judgment in favor of a minor represented there by his parents we further note that some of the same factors that were present in as the intertwining of the interests of the parent and the arguably present here.
in our view,the rule that a parent may not represent her child should be applied gingerly.in light of the fact that a minor is unlikely to be able to represent him or herself the rule appears to create a special class of,rather like corporations,see cheung,at,can not pursue an appeal in this circuit without engaging professional counsel to do so for them.this seems to us to be in some tension with the general notion that a person may appear in court without the benefit or expense of professional assistance.see times,cir noting that the right to is one of high standing,with deep historical roots,reflecting values of freedo
