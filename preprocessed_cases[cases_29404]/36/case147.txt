opinion of the court 
milla karkkainen filed a petition for return of child under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,hague convention.karkkainen alleged that her,vladimir kovalchuk,and his current wife,julie collectively,the respondents,wrongfully retained her daughter,maria kovalchuk,when she was eleven years old.the district court denied the petition,holding that there was no wrongful retention because maria habitual residence was the united states.karkkainen appeals this decision,arguing that maria is habitually resident in finland.although this is a close case,we believe that,prior to her retention,maria acclimatized to the united states and that there was a degree of settled purpose from her perspective to remain in this country.the existence of shared parental intent to permit maria to choose her country of residence bolsters this conclusion.thus,we agree with the district court finding that maria is a habitual resident of the united states and will affirm.
facts and procedural history 
maria was born on april,in russia.her parents,milla karkkainen and vladimir kovalchuk,were married at the time and remained so until.after their divorce,karkkainen and kovalchuk agreed that maria would live with her mother in finland.
both karkkainen and kovalchuk remarried after their split.karkkainen married kimmo karkkainen in january,and kovalchuk married julie in september.kovalchuk and saw maria periodically,either by traveling to europe or by bringing her for visits to the united states.in,however,maria was unable to obtain a tourist visa for a visit to the united states due to the concerns of the united states consulate in finland about maria custody status.
as part of their effort to obtain a visa for maria to visit the united states,kovalchuk and karkkainen signed a stipulation in custody in december that clarified their custody arrangement.the stipulation provided,inter alia,that karkkainen shall have primary physical custody of maria,including the right of the child residence in finland,which for purposes of the hague convention on the civil aspects of child abduction,shall be considered the child habitual residence.stipulation in custody at app.the parents continued to share legal custody of maria such that both had the right and responsibility to make major decisions affecting her best interest.stipulation in custody at app.the terms of the stipulation required that it be filed with the court of common pleas of allegheny county,pennsylvania.though the stipulation was signed by a common pleas judge,the parties never actually filed it with the court.the record reflects that the primary purpose of the stipulation in custody was to secure maria tourist visa.
despite these efforts to clarify maria custody status,maria was unable to obtain a visa to visit the united states.in february,the parties began discussions about making maria a permanent resident of the united states for immigration purposes,which would dispense with the need for a tourist visa.in march,karkkainen granted permission for maria to become a permanent american resident in a signed and notarized document.it was karkkainen understanding at that time that she would not lose any custody rights over her daughter if she were made a permanent resident of the united states,but that the change in immigration status would give maria the right to remain in the united states indefinitely.maria was granted an immigrant visa in september and she officially became a permanent resident of the united states when she visited the country in october.she also visited the united states in december during the christmas holiday and over her easter break in april.
during the winter of and spring of,maria,her parents,and her stepparents began to plan for maria to make a longer visit to the united states.the parties agreed that she would spend the entire summer here with her father and.in addition,maria began increasingly to express her preference to move permanently to the united states.maria had a conversation in may with her mother and stepfather in which she stated that she wanted to live with her father.maria stepfather told her that she was free to make that decision.when karkkainen did not disagree with this statement,maria was left with the impression that she had been given permission to move permanently to the united states if she wished.after this conversation,maria said goodbye to her teacher,tuula merenheimo,and to several friends,telling them that she was moving to the united states.as a parting gift,merenheimo gave maria the books that she would have used during the next school year in finland.these books were usually kept by the teacher during the summer and handed out at the beginning of the academic year.
several events reinforced maria belief that she would be permitted to move to the united states permanently.milla and kimmo karkkainen helped maria apply to a private american school for the fall semester of by faxing her academic transcripts to the school.maria heard her mother tell her grandmother on the telephone that maria was moving to the united states.and karkkainen let maria travel to the united states on june,moments after maria told karkkainen that she was unsure she would return to finland at the end of the summer.
the central factual dispute of this case is what the understanding of the parties was at the time maria came to the united states.the respondents claim that the parties agreed that the summer would be a trial period during which maria would decide whether she wanted to move to the united states permanently.karkkainen argues that she never granted permission for maria to live in the united states indefinitely and that she expected maria to return to finland on august.
the record reflects that maria is both mature and intelligent for her age.an expert in teaching and training children in the performing arts testified that maria is a very focused,gifted,talented and creative child with particularly strong skills in photography and drawing.an independent child psychologist found that maria was uniquely talented and highly intelligent,an impression the district court echoed after hearing maria testimony.maria could communicate well in finnish,english,and russian,and had extensive experience traveling in europe and the united states for visits with her father.she was,in short,much more experienced and mature than the average eleven year old when she came to the united states on june.
during the summer of,maria took academic classes,studied photography,traveled in the united states,and cultivated her relationships with and family.in addition,maria was admitted to a private american school named the ellis school,where she enrolled to attend in the fall.when maria did not return to finland in august,karkkainen filed a petition for return under the hague convention.the district court determined that maria had become acclimatized during her stay in the united states prior to the date of her retention.accordingly,the court found that maria was a habitual resident of the united states and refused to return her to finland.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under and a.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
ii.the legal framework of the hague convention 
the two main purposes of the hague convention are to ensure the prompt return of children to the state of their habitual residence when they have been wrongfully removed,hague convention,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.the convention procedures are not designed to settle international custody disputes,but rather to restore the status quo prior to any wrongful removal or retention,and to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases.baxter baxter,cir.
any person seeking the return of a child in the united states may commence a civil action under the convention by filing a petition in a court of the jurisdiction in which the child is located.b.to obtain an order for the child return under the hague convention,the petitioner bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal or retention was wrongful under article.e a.under article of the hague convention,the removal or retention of a child is wrongful where 
it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention.
a petitioner can not claim that the removal or retention of a child is wrongful under the hague convention unless the child to whom the petition relates is habitually resident in a state signatory to the convention and has been removed to or retained in a different state.gitter gitter,cir emphasis added see also miller miller,cir requiring petitioner to prove that children were habitually resident in a country other than the one to which they were removed.determination of a child habitual residence immediately before the alleged wrongful removal or retention is therefore a threshold question in deciding a case under the hague convention.feder,cir.
thus,we have noted that wrongful removal or retention claims under article of the convention typically raise four questions when did the removal or retention at issue take place immediately prior to the removal or retention,in which state was the child habitually resident did the removal or retention breach the rights of custody attributed to the petitioner under the law of the habitual residence was the petitioner exercising those rights at the time of the removal or retention see baxter,at citing mozes mozes,cir.because the parties stipulated that karkkainen had rights of custody under finnish law that she was exercising prior to maria retention,only the first two issues are in contention on this appeal.
even when a court finds wrongful removal or retention,it is not necessarily required to return a child to its habitual residence.after a petitioner demonstrates wrongful removal or retention,the burden shifts to the respondent to prove an affirmative defense against the return of the child to the country of habitual residence.baxter,at see also james garbolino,international child custody cases handling hague convention cases in courts ch.ed discussing the affirmative defenses under the convention.these affirmative defenses are narrowly construed to effectuate the purposes of the convention and,even where a defense applies,the court has the discretion to order the child return.see feder,at hague international child abduction convention,text and legal analysis.
iii.the district court evidentiary and factual rulings 
though the fundamental issue in this appeal is whether the district court correctly determined maria habitual residence,karkkainen also contends that the district court erred in several evidentiary rulings and in its.because these rulings formed the basis for the district court holding that maria was not wrongfully retained,we take them up before turning to the merits of karkkainen claim under article of the convention 
we review the district court determinations concerning the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.forrest beloit,cir.to the extent an evidentiary issue turns on the interpretation of a federal rule of evidence,rather than the mere application of the rule,our review is plenary.id.
karkkainen claims that the district court abused its discretion by appointing an expert to evaluate maria level of maturity that lacked sufficient experience in parental alienation syndrome.karkkainen argues that one of the central themes of her case was that maria had been alienated from her mother by the respondents and that the district court therefore should not have considered maria desire to move to the united states permanently.as evidence of maria alienation,karkkainen cites an instance in which maria called her mother aunt.however,as the district court noted,karkkainen raised the claim of maria alienation only as a way to rebut the respondents affirmative defenses.because the district court ruled that the united states was maria habitual residence,respondents affirmative defenses were not at issue and any lack of knowledge on the part of the expert about parental alienation syndrome was irrelevant.
the district court heard testimony from two witnesses that karkkainen argues should not have testified.the custodian of records from the ellis school testified as to whether the school relied on documents sent by maria finnish teacher for her admission.though karkkainen contends that this testimony constituted unfair surprise,the records custodian was listed as a witness on the witness list.the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting her to testify as to factual matters about which she had personal knowledge.karkkainen also argues that maria should not have been permitted to testify.however,the district court held,based on expert evidence,that maria was mature enough to testify.because maria perspective was central to the question of her habitual residence under the hague convention,see feder,at defining a child habitual residence in terms of the child perspective,it was clearly appropriate for the district court to admit her testimony.
the district court admitted testimony about whether maria was.karkkainen argues that the defense of article of the hague convention is inapplicable in this case and that the district court should have rejected testimony as to this issue.the district court reserved judgment on whether the defense applied and stated that it would consider the testimony only if the defense later became relevant.there is no evidence that the district court used such testimony to reach its decision on habitual residence,the only subject of its holding.likewise,we reject karkkainen claim that the district court improperly permitted testimony regarding maria best interests.karkkainen points to no specific instances in which the district court permitted such testimony,and we have found none within the record.we also conclude that the district court admitted hearsay testimony only under the exceptions of the federal rules and properly limited its use.thus,we find no abuse of discretion on these points.
finally,karkkainen argues that the district court erred in finding that the parties agreed to allow maria to choose whether she would live in the united states indefinitely or return to finland at the end of the summer of.we must review this factual finding for clear error.baxter,at delvoye lee,cir.we will not reverse as long as the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record,even if convinced that we would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson city of bessemer,d.
the record supports the district court conclusion that the parties agreed when maria left for the united states in june that she would choose where she would reside after the summer.at an interview at the american embassy in helsinki in september,explained to a consular officer that maria would have the option of remaining in the united states after her visit in the summer of.karkkainen was present during the conversation and did not object to the proposed plan.email exchanges and multiple discussions between the parties leading up to maria trip to the united states also suggested that karkkainen agreed maria was free to go to the united states indefinitely.in addition,karkkainen aided the respondents in their efforts to place maria in the ellis school for the fall school semester and never contacted the school to indicate that she did not wish maria to attend.indeed,on the very day maria left for the united states,she and her mother discussed the possibility that maria would not return to finland at the end of the summer.taken together,this and other evidence in the record supports the district court finding that karkkainen,the respondents,and maria all understood that maria would have the choice of remaining in the united states and that she would not necessarily return to finland in august.
at the same time,there is evidence in the record that could support a different conclusion.for example,karkkainen never expressly gave permission for maria to attend school in the united states.moreover,the respondents stated in a january email that it was their understanding that maria would return to finland in august.the fact that maria had a ticket with which she could return to finland on august,may also suggest that the parties did not intend maria to remain in the united states indefinitely.despite such evidence,we will not set aside the district court finding given our deferential clear error standard.
iv.date of retention 
having resolved karkkainen evidentiary and factual objections,we must determine when the alleged wrongful retention occurred so as to establish the relevant date of maria habitual residence for purposes of the hague convention.the district court held that the date of retention was august,the date on which karkkainen filed her petition for maria return.prior to that time,the court found that there was an ongoing dispute between the parties about whether the agreement to allow maria to stay permanently in the united states remained in effect.once karkkainen filed the petition for maria return,she unequivocally signaled her opposition to maria presence in the united states.after that date,there was no doubt that maria remained with her father against her mother wishes and was therefore retained.see slagenweit slagenweit,the wrongful retention does not begin until the noncustodial parent clearly communicates her desire to regain custody and asserts her parental right to have her child live with her.emphasis added.
karkkainen argues that august,not august,is the proper date of retention.this was the date of maria return airline ticket to finland and the date after which kimmo karkkainen indicated in a july email to the respondents that maria presence in the united states would constitute kidnapping.karkkainen argues that there is no legal basis for setting the date of retention as the day on which she unequivocally communicated her opposition to maria presence in the united states and that,in any event,she had clearly communicated her opposition prior to august.
this case does not require us to decide whether a child is not retained under the convention until a parent unequivocally communicates his or her desire to regain custody.we assume that this standard applies,but hold that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to find that karkkainen had not clearly communicated her opposition to maria presence in the united states until she filed the petition for return.there is unrebutted evidence in the record showing that,by,karkkainen had withdrawn her consent to have maria remain in the united states beyond august,and that the respondents were fully aware of this.neither the district court nor the respondents pointed to anything in the record that suggests there was confusion about karkkainen opposition after,and we have found no such evidence ourselves.under these circumstances,we must set aside the district court factual finding and accept as the date of retention august,prior to which it is undisputed that maria was present in the united states with karkkainen permission.see toren toren,cir finding no retention where child presence in united states was consistent with agreement of parents.
habitual residence 
whether the respondents wrongfully retained maria under the hague convention will be determined by where maria habitually resided immediately prior to her alleged wrongful retention on august.if we find finland was maria habitual residence on that date,we must also find that her retention in the united states was wrongful if we conclude that maria was a habitual resident of the united states,her retention here would not be wrongful under article of the convention.see gitter,at miller,at feder,at.the determination of a child habitual residence presents a mixed question of fact and law.whiting krassner,cir.we therefore review the d istrict c ourt underlying findings of historical and narrative facts for clear error,but exercise plenary review over the court application of legal precepts to the facts.delvoye,at.
legal standards for habitual residence 
the convention does not specifically define the term habitual residence.though the courts of appeals have employed slightly different tests for habitual residence,each test has in common the goal of determining where a child home is at the time of removal or retention.these tests facilitate the primary objective of the hague convention to ensure stability in a child family and social environment.see elisa,explanatory report,in hague conference on private international law,acts and documents of the fourteenth session,child abduction report 
the inquiry into a child habitual residence is a determination that can not be reduced to a predetermined formula and necessarily varies with the circumstances of each case.whiting,at.this is especially true in cases such as this one,where the petitioning parent initially agreed to allow the child to stay abroad for an indefinite duration,but subsequently had second thoughts about that decision.mozes,at.these cases generally have no clear answer and are very.whiting,at 
we have stated that a child habitual residence is the place where he or she has been physically present for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and which has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.feder,at.this approach considers a child experience in and contacts with her surroundings,focusing on whether she develop ed a certain routine and acquire d a sense of environmental normalcy by form ing meaningful connections with the people and places she encountered in a country prior to the retention date.id.at.we examine a child conduct and experiences to determine whether she became firmly rooted in her new surroundings,not merely whether she acculturated to a country language or customs.holder holder,cir see also mozes,at describing acclimatization as being firmly embedded in the new country or being in one present environment.thus,if a child becomes rooted in one country,we will not return her to another one where doing so would take her out of the family and social environment in which her life has developed.report.simply put,this inquiry considers whether a child has made a country her home before the date of her removal or retention.see holder,at.
though we examine acclimatization and settled purpose from the child perspective,feder,at,we consider parental intent as part of this inquiry because the child knowledge of these intentions is likely to color its attitude to the contacts it is making,mozes,at.see also silverman silverman,cir noting that,although courts must focus on the child,parental intent is also taken into account.as the court of appeals for the ninth circuit noted,the intentions of a child parents may affect the length of time necessary for a child to become habitually resident or otherwise influence a child ability to acclimatize.mozes,at.
in addition to considering how parental intent affected a child perspective,we must also give some independent weight to the parents present,shared intentions regarding their child presence in a particular place.feder,at emphasis added.this approach helps courts ensure that neither parent is acting unilaterally to alter a joint understanding reached by the parents.thus,given the facts of this case,the agreement between maria parents is relevant in two ways.first,it affects the amount of time required for maria to become acclimatized and to demonstrate a degree of settled purpose to live in the united states.second,the agreement is relevant on its own under the shared intent inquiry.
it is obvious based on these standards that maria was a habitual resident of finland prior to her arrival in the united states on june.she lived in that country for years and was acclimatized to her environment there in every way.in addition,finland was the country that maria parents had set as her habitual residence in their stipulation in custody.the question before us,then,is whether maria habitual residence changed from finland to the united states prior to the retention date.
b.the stipulation in custody 
before applying these standards to the instant case,we address karkkainen claim that the stipulation in custody prevented a change in maria habitual residence,as it remained binding and rendered maria habitually resident in finland on the retention date.the district court disagreed with this argument and found that the parties had modified the stipulation by developing a shared intention that maria would be permitted to decide during the summer of whether she wished to move to the united states or return to finland.because we will not set aside the district court finding that the parties agreed maria would decide for herself whether to return to finland,we must determine whether this shared intention effectively modified the stipulation in custody.
though it was signed by a common pleas judge,the stipulation in custody was never filed with the court of common pleas of allegheny county,as its terms required.consequently,it is an informal custody agreement under pennsylvania law,not a binding court order.witmayer witmayer.while a court will generally look favorably upon an informal custody agreement,if circumstances change after the making of the agreement,then lesser or no weight should be afforded to it.id.at.the district court believed that the shared intention of the parties that maria would choose where to live constituted a changed circumstance that modified the stipulation in custody.we agree.the shared intention of maria parents changed the underlying assumption of the stipulation when it was prepared,namely,that maria would necessarily live with her mother.once the parties reached a new agreement about how maria residence would be determined and gave her the option to live in the united states with her father,circumstances had changed and the habitual residence term of the stipulation in custody was no longer binding.
furthermore,the stipulation was prepared for the express purpose of obtaining a tourist visa for maria.maria has since become a permanent legal resident of the united states,making a tourist visa unnecessary for her to visit or remain in this country.because maria immigration status was critical to the factual context in which the parties drafted the stipulation,this change buttresses our conclusion that the instant case involves different circumstances from those present when the parties entered the stipulation and that the stipulation lasting effectiveness is suspect.id.we therefore afford no weight to the provision of the stipulation in custody that sets finland as maria habitual residence.
acclimatization and degree of settled purpose 
to determine whether maria habitual residence changed from finland to the united states,we first consider whether she acclimatized to the united states prior to the date of retention and whether there was a degree of settled purpose from her perspective to remain in this country beyond august.whiting,at.courts have identified a number of specific factors that are indicative of acclimatization and a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.in feder,we noted that academic activities are among the most central in a child life and therefore highly suggestive of acclimatization.at.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has taken school attendance,social engagements,and lessons to be evidence of acclimatization.ruiz tenorio,cir.the ninth circuit court of appeals weighed a child participation in sports programs and excursions in his new country in favor of acclimatization.holder,at.
applying the lessons of such cases to the circumstances before us,there is evidence in the record that maria acclimatized herself to the united states during the summer of.she enrolled in the ellis school and took summer classes to prepare for her attendance there in the fall.she also took photography classes that summer,traveled in the country,and developed relationships with and her family that she had established during previous visits to the united states in october,december,and april.we view these events in the context of record evidence that maria is uniquely talented and highly intelligent,an experienced traveler with strong english skills,and mature for her age.taken together,these factors suggest that maria form ed meaningful connections with the people and places she encounter ed in the united states and was therefore acclimatized prior to the date of her retention.whiting,at.
furthermore,there is evidence in the record that maria abandoned finland as her habitual residence.when maria came to the united states in june,she brought more personal belongings with her than usual,in anticipation that she would remain here after the summer.see silverman,at noting that transfer of personal possessions indicates settled purpose to remain in new country.maria decision in july to remain in the united states,which she communicated to her parents and stepparents,was essentially a choice to abandon finland as her habitual residence.w hile our jurisprudence on habitual residency has not heretofore enunciated a need for an intent to abandon a former habitual residency in order to establish a new one,it does seem implicit in the concept of acquiring a new habitual residence that the previous habitual residence has been left behind or discarded.whiting,at.
there are also factors that weigh against a finding of acclimatization.habitual residence may only be altered by a change in geography and passage of time,silverman,at,and is a concept that focuses on past experience,not future intentions,friedrich friedrich,cir.it is fair to ask whether maria was physically present in the united states for an amount of time sufficient to provide the experiences required to acclimatize to a new country.maria visited the united states for less than three months in the summer of.even a mature old may not be able to acclimatize to a new country in such a short period of time,especially since maria did not decide until that she wanted to stay permanently with her father in the united states.
as stated above,the intentions of a child parents affect the length of time necessary for a child to become habitually resident,because the child knowledge of these intentions is likely to color its attitude to the contacts it is making.mozes,at.in this case,maria parents intended when maria left for the united states in june that maria would be able to choose where she would live at the end of the summer and that her choice would be respected.this agreement,unusual in cases under the hague convention,provided the defining context for maria visit in the summer of.
there is considerable evidence that the agreement between maria parents colored her attitude towards her visit to the united states during the summer of.maria thought when she arrived that she would be permitted to choose,before the end of the summer,the country in which she would reside permanently.in multiple conversations with parents and stepparents,maria expressed her desire to pick her residence.she indicated to her friends and teacher prior to leaving finland that her parents would allow her to choose where she would live after the summer of.furthermore,maria told her mother on the day that she was leaving for the united states that she was not sure she would return.the fact that maria believed that she controlled her own destiny influenced her entire experience in the united states prior to her retention here.indeed,maria strongly suspected even before she arrived that she would choose to remain here.under these circumstances,less time was required for maria to acclimatize and demonstrate a degree of settled purpose to stay in the united states than would normally be the case.
we are presented with a unique fact pattern,in that maria parents agreed in june that she possessed the material and psychological wherewithal to decide where she would reside.mozes,at.any eleven girl could conceivably tell her mother that she prefers to remain in a country where she is visiting,yet this would n
