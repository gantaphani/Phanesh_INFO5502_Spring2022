dependent derrick appeals from the order made at the review when the juvenile court denied his motion that his mother not receive additional months of reunification services.derrick supported his motion with in re aryanna th,d aryanna,where the court of appeal for the third district held that a juvenile court has the discretion to terminate reunification services at any point after ordering them for a dependent minor who was under the age of three years when removed from parental custody.because derrick was over the age of three when he was removed from his mother custody,the court believed the reasoning of aryanna did not apply,and that the court was required by welfare and institutions code section and former california rules of court rule to grant the mother the additional six months of reunification services.indeed,the court expressly stated that it had no discretion not to order the additional services.
we conclude that aryanna is soundly reasoned and that its holding is equally applicable to dependents over the age of three.no statute or rule of court restricts a juvenile court discretion to order less than the maximum amount of reunification services when confronted with a parent who is unwilling or unable to benefit from additional reunification services,or if for other reasons the likelihood of reunifying the family is faint.in light of this conclusion,we reverse.
background 
derrick mother,stephanie,had herself been a dependent due to the neglect of her mother,derrick grandmother.stephanie dependency was ended in because her mother failed to complete her reunification plan,and because stephanie had become a runaway.
derrick was born the following year.shortly after he was born,derrick was the subject of a dependency commenced because stephanie was unable to care for him adequately.the dependency was terminated in after stephanie completed her reunification plan.
in early,the contra costa county children and family services bureau bureau received information that derrick,then seven years of age,was not attending school and was not receiving adequate food and dental care.derrick was living with stephanie and her mother.the relationship between the two women was rocky both had substance abuse problems.the bureau was informally attempting to improve matters with a voluntary family maintenance plan.
but it was the dual facts of stephanie arrest and her leaving derrick in the care of his grandmother that led the bureau in march,to file a petition to the effect that derrick qualified as a dependent child.derrick was promptly detained at a hearing stephanie did not attend.
at the jurisdictional hearing held on may,stephanie submitted on a single amended allegation that she failed to provide adequate dental treatment and adequate housing for the child and has failed to ensure that the child attend school regularly within the meaning of section,subdivision b.the juvenile court sustained this allegation.the remaining allegations were dismissed with the understanding that stephanie would undertake days of constant drug testing,and if she tested positive she would enter a more significant treatment regimen.
on june,a week before the scheduled dispositional hearing,the bureau sent a letter advising the court that as of that date it has not received any drug testing results from stephanie.the bureau also confirmed that stephanie settled her criminal matter and had been ordered to complete a residential treatment program to be monitored by the contra costa county probation department.the bureau recommended that stephanie receive reunification services according to a case plan that had been modified to conform with the requirements of the probation department.
stephanie was not present at the july,dispositional hearing.her counsel explained to the court that many,but not all,of her missed drug tests were due to her being required to appear in criminal court until the case settled on june.after brief discussion of the proposed case plan,the court approved it.the plan required stephanie to complete the residential treatment program and monitoring.stephanie was ordered to meet with the social worker every month.she was granted supervised visitation with derrick up to twice a week.derrick was declared a dependent child.
the review was initially scheduled for late november,but it was continued to january.the bureau prepared a status report dated november.its conclusions were mixed.stephanie had not entered,much less completed,a residential drug treatment program.the social worker reported that stephanie has had fairly regular phone calls with derrick,but her visitation with the child has been problematic.stephanie is not easily contacted by telephone,as she does not have her own phone and has to rely on others to relay messages to her through their phones.stephanie has also not presented any evidence to the bureau regarding her participation in any of the services listed on her case plan.
the social worker was being euphemistic.as she went on to explain according to the concord police department,stephanie has a,felony warrant for arrest for with the conditions of her probation stephanie has not been testing regularly for probation,nor communicating regularly with her probation office.the concord police department is actively seeking stephanie at this time for arrest.
as for derrick reuniting with his mother,the social worker concluded that he would not be safe in her home at this time due to the current instability,substance abuse and illegal activity.on the other hand,derrick appears to be stable in his current location and has bonded with the members of the foster family,who are interested in the adoption or guardianship of derrick should his mother fail to regain custody of him.
nevertheless,the bureau was guardedly optimistic about an ultimate reunification.it recommended additional reunification services,but it warned that even if this recommendation were adopted by the court,stephanie must realize that she must make adequate progress during the next six months of family reunification services in order to regain custody of her son or the bureau will request that a hearing is scheduled to terminate her parental rights to allow derrick to be adopted.
in anticipation of the scheduled november hearing,derrick forwarded to the court a review brief consisting of a long excerpt from aryanna and requesting that an early w i hearing be set as quickly as possible pursuant to the holding of that decision.
on december,the court received another communication from the social worker reporting that the bureau received an anonymous call from a concerned and admittedly fearful acquaintance of the mother,who disclosed that stephanie planned to kidnap derrick and take him to florida.the acquaintance also mentioned that stephanie is currently driving a stolen car without any license plates and uses her sister identity when stopped by law enforcement.although these are allegations,the bureau sees the mother current known criminal activity as high risk and the mother has not yet presented herself to the bureau to dispute these allegations.therefore,the bureau is requesting that supervised visitation between derrick and his mother be terminated at this time.
stephanie was not present when the review was held on january.the social worker responsible for the case plan until january testified that since she wrote the november,status report stephanie had not visited derrick or provided any proof of compliance with the case plan.around december,stephanie had a telephone conversation with derrick and another with the social worker in which she stephanie stated she was going to turn herself in at the beginning of the year.
the court then heard argument,beginning with that from derricks counsel,who argued that aryanna was right on point.mom has done nothing.she has a warrant outstanding.the child deserves to move toward permanence at a faster pace than the review hearing.this court is empowered to do so.i ask you to do so.counsel for the bureau stated that it is not opposing this motion.
counsel for stephanie argued that aryanna was distinguishable because the dependent there was a newborn who had no relationship with the parent.by contrast,derrick was clearly attached to his mother.stephanie counsel concluded that i think the court needs to give this mother an opportunity to use her full months which the legislature has provided that a parent of an older child is entitled to.it entirely possible that if mother turns herself in,she would get into residential treatment and would be able to complete her plan within the period.
counsel for derrick responded,and concluded the argument by urging the court to terminate services and set the termination hearing at this point.he did so by disputing that there is a relationship that needs to be maintained because the mom is not nothing,the very minimal,and relationships can be detrimental as well as positive.derrick is in a safe place.that not going to change.but mother has proven that she deserves the extra time.she has done anything except for maybe promised she going to turn herself in.i disagree with stephanie counsel that mother would finish her plan to the point that it would be likely that the child could be returned within an period.
after a recess to review authorities,the court ruled as follows it clear that mother has done little,if would be a great way to characterize her efforts to date,and the issue before me is whether or not mother should receive five more months of services.mother,at the present time,is apparently at large.there is a bench warrant out on her.she has not surrendered.my bailiff did check the local facility,and she has not turned herself in as promised.well,clearly,there been no substantial compliance with the case plan 
if this was sic an under three matter,we would even be having this discussion.aryanna cited by counsel is a case where we have a minor who is under three.so the issue is whether i can legally make a finding,and terminate services and set a hearing.in researching this matter in chambers,after reviewing points and authorities and also rules of court,i think not allowing mother the additional time is somewhat problematic.and let me tell you the statutory sic basis that i concerned about,and i am relying on.rule indicates the court may set a hearing under section within days if,and this is the section that deals with the hearing,the child was removed under section g,and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parents whereabouts are still unknown,which is not the situation here.
the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parents have not had contact with the child for six months,which is not the situation here,and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony,indicating parental unfitness,or the parent is deceased,or the child was under the age of three.
i think i statutorily precluded,under these circumstances,so i am going to essentially find that the additional six in this case,five months of services,is legally required.not that i want to make these findings,but i do want to create an appellate issue where one does not exist.i t the court decision to continue six more months of services i think the rules of court are quite explicit so i ca set a termination hearing.
the court then ordered the bureau to provide stephanie with additional reunification services and scheduled a review.derrick filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.
discussion 
derrick is the sole appellant.he presents one issue for our review.as he frames that issue in his brief a parent of a child over the age of three at the time of removal is not entitled to a minimum of twelve months of reunification services rather,the length of services is within the sound discretion of the court,which may terminate such services at the status review hearing if there has been no substantial compliance with the case plan.derrick asks this court to extend the principle of aryanna from dependents under the age of three to dependents over the age of three.stephanie has not filed a brief.although the bureau in its brief attempts to defend the juvenile court decision,it tacitly aligns itself with derrick,arguing that that it would welcome a ruling that the trial court has the discretion to terminate family reunification services prior to twelve months when the parent s are not complying with or participating in the case plan.for the reasons we now set out,we conclude derrick is correct.
we begin with confirmation of the fundamental principle applicable here,a principle that can not be repeated too often it is difficult,if not impossible,to exaggerate the importance of reunification in the dependency system.with but few exceptions,whenever a minor is removed from parental custody,the juvenile court is required to provide services to the parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family.in re luke th,d accord,in re michael th,d.the statutory authority governing the provision of reunification services is section.its subdivision a reflects the different treatment afforded to minors above and below the age of three 
w henever a child is removed from a parent custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother child welfare services,when provided,shall be provided,as follows for a child who,on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent was three years of age or older,services shall not exceed a period of months from the date the child entered foster care for a child who,on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent was under the age of three years,services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care.notwithstanding paragraphs and,services may be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed months after the date the child was originally removed from physical custody of his or her parent,subd.a.
this statutory language establishes a approach based on the dependent minor age.if the child is under three,the default position is six months of reunification services.if the child is over three,the default position is months.for both categories,the outer limit is months but none of these time periods is immutable.
that follows from a principle noted by the court in aryanna reunification services constitute a benefit there is no constitutional entitlement to those services.aryanna,supra,th,d accord,in re joshua th,d in re christina d.put even more bluntly,there is no absolute right to receive the maximum amount of services in any and all circumstances.
this is made clear beyond doubt by subdivision b of section,which specifies no fewer than situations in which the juvenile court is not required to order any reunification services the statutory scheme for dependencies allows for reunifications services only in most cases.in re zacharia,supra,cal th,d,in re marilyn cal th,d.but for dependent children over the age of three,nowhere is it provided that a minimum of twelve months is required.to the contrary,the emphasis throughout the statutes is upon setting outside limits to the length of time a child may be kept in foster care before a permanent plan is established.in re david th,d see denny superior court th,d citing in re david.moreover,since it has been established that a motion pursuant to section may be used to ask the juvenile court to terminate a parent reunification services prior to expiration of the period.sheila superior court th,d upholding termination after four months of services.
also pertinent is the language of subdivision e of section at the review hearing held six months after the initial dispositional hearing,the court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent unless the court finds that the return of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child the failure of the parent to participate regularly and make substantive progress in treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.in making its determination,the court shall consider the eff
