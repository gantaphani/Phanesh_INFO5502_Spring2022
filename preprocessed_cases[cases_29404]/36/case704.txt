introduction 
this matter arises out of the dissolution of nathan la moure marriage to robin la moure and consequential division of assets,including nathan defined benefit pension plan pension plan.nathan appeals two orders a july,order restraining disbursements from nathan pension plan and a december,order granting reconsideration of the court october,order,granting nathan claim of exemption and motion to quash orders restraining him from transferring assets from his pension plan.
nathan contends the trial court erred in ordering restraints on his pension plan assets and denying his claim of exemption,because erisa preempts state law and prohibits alienation of pension plan assets and benefits.nathan argues that erisa provisions prohibit payment of funds from nathan pension plan to robin attorney for attorney fees.nathan further argues that his pension plan is exempt from levy on the writ of execution,and the trial court erred in issuing the writ of execution upon the custodian of the assets of his pension plan.in addition,nathan argues there were no new facts or law justifying granting robin motion for reconsideration.also,the trial court abused its discretion in granting robin motion for reconsideration because the new ruling,allowing levy on assets in nathan pension plan,violated erisa.
we reject nathan contentions on the ground there was substantial evidence that nathan abused the pension plan by secreting community property assets and funneling them through the pension plan.as a consequence,nathan pension plan was not protected by erisa.we therefore affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural background 
nathan and robin married in,and separated in february.a month later,on march,nathan filed for divorce.in interim orders in march and april,the trial court ordered nathan and robin to share equal custody of their two sons.the court further ordered nathan,who practiced law as a sole practitioner,to pay robin spousal and child support.
nathan fell behind on his support obligations.in april,the california department of child support services dcss issued an order to morgan stanley to withhold funds from nathan retirement accounts for the purpose of collecting child support arrears.on april,nathan filed a claim of exemption and ex parte motion to quash the levy on his morgan stanley ira rollover and ira accounts.
in may,the trial court heard and denied nathan claim of exemption and motion to the ira levy.on june,nathan faxed the dcss and robin attorney a letter stating that nathan would be filing an ex parte application to stay the of execution on my morgan stanley ira rollover plan and to dispense with an undertaking pending appeal of the minute orders of and a petition for writ of supersedeas in the reviewing court.the trial court granted a stay until june,and extended the stay until july.
on july,the trial court heard and again denied nathan claim of exemption and motion to quash and recall levy on nathan morgan stanley ira account for payment of support support appeal.on july,nathan filed a notice of appeal of the july,order in re marriage of lamoure th,d,case no.on august,nathan also filed a petition for writ of supersedeas in this court,seeking a stay of the trial court proceedings.on september,this court denied the writ and request for a stay.however,on september,the trial court granted nathan request for a stay pending resolution of nathan support appeal.on august,this court entered its decision in the support appeal,affirming the lower court july,order.
writ of execution for payment of robin s attorney s fees 
meanwhile,during proceedings from through,the trial court ordered nathan to pay robin attorney fees and costs totaling over.
on march,the trial court heard and granted robin order to show cause osc and motions for a writ of attachment,for in sanctions against nathan,for breach of fiduciary duties,for in statutory penalties and awards against nathan,and for reimbursement of robin expert fees totaling.
on march,the trial court issued a writ of execution for payment of robin attorney fees against nathan pension plan.because the writ only named nathan and his law corporation but did not name his recently created trust as a judgment debtor in the writ,the morgan stanley custodian of nathan pension plan refused to enforce the writ against the pension plan.
on april,nathan served a claim of exemption as to nathan morgan stanley accounts,seeking exemption as to any funds held by morgan stanley for the benefit of nathan,nathan law firm,or his pension plan,or funds held by merrill lynch in his recently created trust.
during a hearing on april,nathan informed the court that the trial court had previously issued a stay.the trial court did not find any record of the stay and did not believe there was any reason for a stay.the court therefore ruled on robin pending motions on support and other matters,and denied nathan oral motion to set aside the march,and march,orders based on not receiving notice.on june,the court denied nathan claim of exemption.
restraining order prohibiting transfer of pension fund assets 
on july,robin filed an ex parte motion requesting a temporary order restraining nathan from withdrawing,transferring,or disposing of any funds held in his morgan stanley accounts.robin asserted the temporary hold was necessary until the trial court ruled on her motion to add nathan pension plan to the writ of execution as a judgment debtor.once the pension was added to the writ,robin could immediately serve morgan stanley with the writ,which would ensure the pension assets were subject to the trial court jurisdiction and control.
on july,the trial court heard and took under submission robin ex parte motion.on or about july,the trial court granted robin motion and ordered nathan restrained from transferring any funds in any morgan stanley account in his name or the name of his law firm or law firm pension plan.the court also ordered that morgan stanley was to hold all such funds,pending further order of the court.
on august,nathan transferred approximately from his morgan stanley pension plan account to his merrill lynch trust account.
on august,the court granted robin motion and amended the writ of execution by adding the pension plan to the writ.the court issued the amended writ of execution for,on august.the instant appeal is founded on this writ of execution.the amended writ of execution hereafter referred to as the writ or writ of execution was served on morgan stanley as the pension plan administrator.the writ directed the county sheriff to enforce the judgments entered on may,and on march,against nathan and his pension plan.
on september,nathan filed a notice of appeal of the march,and march,writ of execution order and judgment,and the july,restraining order.this court dismissed the appeal of the march,and may,order and judgment as untimely.
on september,robin filed opposition to nathan claim of exemption to the writ of execution.robin opposed nathan claim of exemption on the grounds nathan transferred funds into the trust on august,in direct violation of the trial court orders,including the automatic temporary restraining orders atros and july,order,prohibiting any transfer of funds.in addition,the trial court already ruled in june,that funds in the pension plan were not exempt.
on october,the trial court heard and took under submission nathan claim of exemption.the court found that the only matter stayed was regarding nathan claim of exemption,conditioned upon nathan properly posting bonds.on october,the court granted nathan claim of exemption.
motion for reconsideration 
robin filed an ex parte motion for reconsideration of the october,order.the trial court heard robin motion for reconsideration,granted it on december,and amended the order on december.the court found that robin provided new and different facts,and that the trial court had legal authority to order a writ of execution against nathan pension plan.the court vacated its october,order and denied nathan claim of exemption.
on december,nathan filed an ex parte motion to stay execution of the march and march orders,quash and recall the writ of execution,vacate the levies,and reconsider the ruling on robin motion for reconsideration.the trial court denied nathan request for a stay.in addition the trial court modified sua sponte and nunc pro tunc its september,order granting a stay.the trial court explained regarding petitioner claim that the court stay pending petitioner appeal of one narrow issue dealing with petitioner ira,the court rules that this is not a stay of the entire action.petitioner was previously advised by the court that the stay did not stay the entire family law proceedings and in fact,petitioner himself moved this court for orders subsequent to the stay.the court will order,sua sponte and nunc pro tunc that the stay is only applicable to the narrow issue on appeal to the date that the stay was issued.
on december,nathan filed a supplemental notice of appeal,adding the order entered on december,granting robin motion for reconsideration of the order on october.
july restraining order 
nathan challenges the july restraining order barring him from transferring assets out of his pension fund but does not specifically state why the order is improper.nathan seems to be arguing that the restraining order is improper under erisa,since his pension plan is subject to erisa protection.
the july restraining order states the court orders a petitioner nathan is restrained from withdrawing,transferring,encumbering,hypothecating,concealing,or in any way disposing of any property or funds in any account maintained with morgan stanley in the name of nathan lamoure nathan lamoure,a professional corporation and nathan lamoure law office retirement plan.b morgan stanley shall hold all funds maintained on petitioner behalf in any account in the name of nathan lamoure nathan lamoure,a professional corporation and nathan lamoure law office retirement plan,pending further order of this court.this order shall be effective starting for a minimum of days or further order.
the trial court stated that it based the july restraining order on the following findings on evidence presented at the within hearing on respondent motion for a restraining order prohibiting the transfer of any funds currently being held at morgan stanley,there is good cause to order that petitioner is prohibited from transferring any and all assets in petitioner name in any account maintained at morgan stanley,including but not limited to accounts in the name of nathan lamoure nathan lamoure,a professional corporation and nathan lamoure law office retirement plan.
this restraining order prohibited nathan from transferring or withdrawing assets from his morgan stanley pension plan and law firm account.the restraining order was consistent with the preexisting atros and other orders prohibiting the transfer of assets.robin presented evidence that,after the trial court issued the writ of execution in march,nathan violated the atros and march,order by withdrawing assets out of his law firm account and transferring them to his morgan stanley pension.
based on nathan violations of the atros and other orders prohibiting the transfer of assets,the july restraining order was appropriate and did not violate erisa since it appropriately ordered nathan not to transfer assets during the pending dissolution proceedings.the order was not against the pension plan.it merely prohibited nathan from transferring or instigating the transfer of any assets in his name or the name of his law firm or pension plan.the order further informed morgan stanley that,in accordance with the restraining order,morgan stanley should not carry out any requests by nathan to transfer or withdraw assets subject to the order.nathan has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in entering the july restraining order.
order granting robin motion for reconsideration 
nathan contends the trial court abused its discretion in granting robin motion for reconsideration of the court october,order.the october order granted nathan claim of exemption and his motion to quash the order restraining him from transferring assets from his pension plan.we reject nathan contentions challenging the propriety of the underlying writ of execution issued in march,and the related april,order,since those contentions are not properly before this court in this appeal.this court previously dismissed nathan appeal of the march and april orders as untimely.code civ,walker los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d.
procedural background 
on october,the court granted nathan claim of exemption on the grounds the court did not have authority under erisa to issue a writ of attachment of the pension plan on march,and march.the trial court concluded the pension plan was a defined benefit trust plan governed exclusively by erisa.therefore the trial court did not have authority to determine whether the plan was a qualified erisa plan,and funds in the pension plan could only be accessed by a qualified domestic relations order qdro.the court ordered the release of any funds held by the levying officer.
robin immediately filed an ex parte motion for reconsideration of the october,order granting nathan claim of exemption.robin requested the trial court to vacate the order,deny nathan claim of exemption,and order the orange county sheriff to hold the pension plan funds pursuant to the writ of execution,pending the hearing on the motion for reconsideration.the motion was based on a newly discovered morgan stanley pension plan statement.robin argued morgan stanley account statements showed that nathan was secreting community property funds in the pension plan.there was new evidence that,after nathan filed for divorce,he moved approximately out of his pension plan account.on december,the court granted reconsideration and amended its ruling on december,to correct language in the december,order which incorrectly referred to the writ of execution granted on march,and march,as a writ of attachment.
in the december,order,as amended,the trial court found that robin provided new and different facts and substantial legal authority supporting her position that the trial court had authority to order a writ of execution on nathan pension plan.the court concluded the pension plan was not protected by erisa because nathan used the pension plan to secrete and shield community assets by funneling them through the pension plan.the court vacated the court october,order and denied nathan claim of exemption.the levying officer was ordered to release to robin attorney all funds currently held under the writ of execution issued on march,and march.
nathan argues the trial court erred in granting robin motion for reconsideration because robin failed to present any new facts or law.we disagree,as did the trial court.
a party affected by a trial court order may seek reconsideration of that order under code of civil procedure section within days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,the party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.code civ,subd.a.we review the trial court ruling on the motion for reconsideration under the abuse of discretion standard.glade glade th,d.
robin motion for reconsideration was founded on significant new facts and evidence,consisting of a morgan stanley account statement for nathan pension plan,showing that,as of january,the pension plan account had in assets.this evidence supported the reasonable inference that nathan illicitly removed a total of approximately from his pension plan during the marital dissolution proceedings,thereby abrogating his claim of exemption under erisa.
applicable law 
nathan argues that the writ of execution levied against his pension plan assets violated erisa because his pension plan is exempt under erisa.therefore the court should not have granted reconsideration and set aside nathan claim of exemption.
erisa,as amended by the retirement equity act of,stat,primarily regulates and preempts state employee benefit plan law.erisa is a remedial statute designed to protect the interests of employees in pension and welfare plans citation,and to protect employers from conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation of such plans citation.the former purpose is achieved through requirements for reporting,disclosure,participation rights,vesting of rights to benefits,funding,fiduciary responsibilities,and claims procedures.citation.the latter purpose is achieved through the preemption,with a few exceptions,of all state laws relating to employee pension and welfare benefit plans.citation.scott gulf oil cir,see also shaw delta air lines,d boggs boggs,d boggs.
although generally erisa preempts state law,under erisa state courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal district courts when a civil action is brought by an employee benefit plan beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b e.in all other instances,the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions relating to those plans governed by erisa.e.california state law,under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,provides all amounts held,controlled,or in process of distribution by a private retirement plan,for the payment of benefits as an annuity,pension,retirement allowance,disability payment,or death benefit from a private retirement plan are exempt.
nathan argues that,under erisa and code of civil procedure section section,subdivision b,his pension plan is exempt from the writ of execution and is not subject to any exception which would authorize levy upon his pension assets.therefore,the trial court abused its discretion in vacating its previous order on october,quashing the writ of execution and setting aside his claim of exemption.we disagree.as discussed below,we conclude the new evidence,along with other evidence,supported a reasonable finding by the trial court that nathan was using his pension plan to secret community property assets and funnel assets through the pension plan.under such circumstances,erisa does not apply.
subject matter jurisdiction to determine if pension plan qualifies 
nathan argues that,because federal erisa law preempts state law and the pension plan originally qualified under erisa for protection,the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine that the pension plan did not qualify for erisa protection.we disagree.although there is no case law factually on point,plunk yaquinto in re plunk cir plunk supports the proposition that the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether nathan pension plan qualified under erisa.
in bankruptcy proceedings in plunk,supra,a judgment creditor attempted to garnish the judgment debtor pension plan assets in order to collect on a judgment.the judgment creditor argued the pension plan was not qualified under the internal revenue code because the debtor had abused pension plan assets and therefore the pension plan assets were not exempt from garnishment.id.at.the plunk court agreed,holding that the bankruptcy court was not required to defer to the internal revenue service irs initial determination that the pension plan qualified.id.at.the court stated that,when disqualifying events occur after the irs has last determined that a plan is qualified,the bankruptcy court may,under state law,determine that the plan is no longer qualified based on recent disqualifying events,such as misusing pension plan assets.ibid.
nathan argues plunk is not dispositive because it did not overturn erisa preemption of state law or establish that there was state subject matter jurisdiction in the instant case.nevertheless,we conclude plunk,by analogy,supports the proposition that the trial court had jurisdiction to determine that,where there was evidence of abuse of nathan pension plan,the pension plan no longer qualified under erisa for protection and the pension plan assets were not exempt from being levied upon under state law.
e.the pension plan is not a qualified erisa plan 
regardless of whether nathan law firm pension plan initially qualified under erisa,there was substantial evidence that during the marital dissolution proceedings,commencing in,it no longer qualified because nathan was the sole employee of his law firm,sole shareholder of his law firm,sole beneficiary of his law firm pension plan assets,administrator of the pension plan,and trustee of the pension plan account.nathan stated in his declaration filed on november,that his law firm was the employer sponsor of the plan.nathan also stated that he was trustee of the pension plan and he was not receiving any payments from the plan.nathan further stated that he was the sole remaining employee with vested benefits who was entitled to benefits from the plan.the assets in the plan,according to nathan,were at that time,approximately.in another declaration filed on july,nathan again stated that he was the sole primary beneficiary of the pension plan benefits and administrator of the plan,but no longer trustee of the pension plan trust.apparently,a relative,steve lamoure,replaced him as trustee at some point during the divorce proceedings.
since there was substantial evidence nathan was the employer sponsor of the plan and the sole employee,beneficiary and trustee of the pension plan,the trial court reasonably concluded that erisa was inapplicable and the pension plan was therefore not exempt from the writ of execution under erisa.nelson california trust company cal d,in re watson,and in re acosta.in acosta,the bankruptcy court and federal district court concluded the judgment debtor pension plans were not erisa qualified and thus were not excluded under erisa because there was only one current employee and a sole shareholder of a corporation does not qualify as an employee,but is rather deemed to be an employer.a n employer is prohibited from receiving any benefit from an plan.acosta,at.likewise,here,nathan pension plan did not qualify as an plan because it hardly can be said to provide payment of pensions or employee benefits since its sponsors had no employees and were obligated to pay no pensions.the retirement plan resembles in name only a private retirement plan intended for such purposes names alone are not controlling.in re phillips,phillips.
misuse of pension plan 
even assuming the pension plan initially qualified under erisa,there is substantial evidence supporting the trial court finding that nathan abused his pension plan during the divorce litigation,and this disqualified the plan from erisa protection.this is substantiated by the following evidence.
nathan filed for divorce in february.an income tax form actuarial information form,schedule b dated march,shows that,before filing for divorce,during the period of december,to november,nathan pension plan was valued at.an account statement for nathan law firm salomon smith barney,account no.redacted for december,shows an ending value of.an account statement for nathan pension plan salomon smith barney,account no.redacted,for february,shows an ending value of.
by letter dated april,two months after nathan filed for divorce,nathan directed the transfer of approximately to his pension plan from his law firm investment account account no.redacted,in violation of the atro.an income tax form,schedule i form,entitled,financial information small plan,shows that for the period of december,to november,nathan pension plan had a beginning value of and ended the year with a value of.this indicates that nathan pension plan increased approximately in value in,after nathan filed for divorce.actuarial information form,schedule b,dated july,shows that for the period of december,to november,nathan pension plan was valued at.
newly discovered evidence provided in robin motion for reconsideration,confirmed that after nathan filed for divorce,he moved at least in community property assets out of his pension plan account during the divorce proceedings.a morgan stanley pension plan statement for the month ending january,showed a total
