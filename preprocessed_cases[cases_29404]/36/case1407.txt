appellant,albert,the alleged father of the minor,christopher,appeals from the juvenile court order terminating his parental rights.welf.appellant contends the juvenile court erroneously denied him a contested hearing.he also contends he was prejudiced by the juvenile court failure to follow the statutory procedures for determining paternity.appellant is mistaken.his right to assert a position regarding his paternal status did not entitle him to a contested hearing.and because the minor paternity had already been established by a voluntary declaration of paternity,the court did not have to give appellant the notice and form provided for in section.we will affirm the juvenile court order.
facts and procedural history 
a dependency petition was filed in february concerning the newborn minor,alleging that the minor tested positive for at birth,the mother had tested positive for cocaine during her pregnancy,and the mother had failed to reunify with five other children as a result of her substance abuse.the mother named roger as the minor father,and he was named as such in the petition.roger informed the social worker that he was present at the minor birth and had signed a declaration of paternity.
shortly after the detention hearing,appellant informed the social worker that he was possibly the minor father.according to appellant,he had sexual relations with the mother on two occasions,and he found out about the baby in september.regarding the allegations in the petition,appellant made the following statements i think that kid needs to be placed somewhere.i ca really comment on that i in a big old mess i feel that she should have never had no kids.if she was able to take care of them sic.i not knowing what going on.i really here because her mother said go get my son.
appellant appeared at the next court hearing in the matter.the juvenile court directed that appellant and roger be provided with packets to assist them in establishing paternity.the matter was continued approximately one week for a pretrial hearing,with a jurisdictional hearing scheduled one week later.
by the next hearing,a declaration of paternity,which was executed the day after the minor birth,had been filed with the juvenile court.based thereon,the court found roger to be the minor presumed father.appellant was not present at the hearing.
the jurisdictional hearing was continued numerous times.in july,the juvenile court sustained the petition.a contested dispositional hearing occurred in august and september,at which the juvenile court denied reunification services and set a hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for the minor pursuant to section.appellant did not appear at any of these hearings.
the minor was placed with two siblings in a prospective adoptive home,and the social worker opined that the likelihood of adoption was excellent if parental rights were terminated.
in november,appellant filed a petition for modification requesting an order for paternity testing and,if he was determined to be the father,that the minor be placed with him.
the hearing on appellant petition for modification was set on the same date as the section hearing.at the hearing,the juvenile court denied appellant an evidentiary hearing on his petition.the court noted that the issue of paternity had been raised months earlier and was resolved by the declaration of paternity signed by the mother and roger 
the juvenile court then proceeded to the section hearing.the court noted appellant objection to the termination of his parental rights and found that,although appellant had a right to notice and to attend the hearing,he was not entitled to a contested hearing.finding the minor was likely to be adopted,the juvenile court terminated parental rights and ordered a permanent plan of adoption.
discussion 
appellant claims his due process rights were violated when the juvenile court denied his request for a contested section hearing.we disagree.
the extent to which a father may participate in dependency proceedings and his rights in those proceedings are dependent on his paternal status.in re paul th,italics omitted.an alleged biological father in dependency proceedings is a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established.in re joseph th,d.alleged fathers have less rights in dependency proceedings than biological and presumed fathers.citation.an alleged father does not have a current interest in a child because his paternity has not yet been established.citation.in re th,d.thus,for example,an alleged father is not entitled to appointed counsel or reunification services.citations.in re paul,supra,th at.due process for an alleged father requires only that he be given notice and an opportunity to appear and assert a position and attempt to change his paternity status.citations.ibid.
appellant right to assert a position did not entitle him to a contested section hearing.unless and until appellant was able to elevate his status to that of a biological or presumed father,the only issues on which he was entitled to assert a position concerned his paternal status and his intent and desires regarding the minor if his paternal status became more than just a potentiality.
however,the sole purpose of the section hearing is to select and implement one of the listed permanent plans.in re marilyn cal th,d.as an alleged father,appellant did not have a current interest in the issues that were before the juvenile court at that the minor was adoptable and whether any exceptions to adoption applied.in re,supra,th at,d.neither reunification nor paternity is an issue before the juvenile court at the section hearing.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d,in re ninfa th,d.
appellant claims he had fundamental liberty interests at stake at the hearing,implicating his due process rights.however,even a biological father desire to establish a personal relationship with a child,without more,is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.in re kiana th,d.parental rights do not spring from the biological connection between parent and child.they require relationships more enduring.citation.lehr robertson,d,italics omitted.even less compelling is the liberty interest of an alleged father who has made no effort to establish a relationship with the subject child.
in support of his contention,appellant cites cases involving the denial of a contested hearing to the mother in re stacy th,d in re tamika th,d or to a father whose paternity was not disputed in re dolly th,d in re nemis th,d in re jeanette th,d.needless to say,the due process rights of parents whose connection to a child has been established are distinguishable from those of an individual whose connection remains only a possibility.
appellant also complains he was entitled to receive the social worker section report days before the hearing and that,because he did not receive the report in a timely fashion,he was unable to prepare to the social worker.appellant was provided a copy of the report at the section hearing.after receiving the report,appellant did not object to the lack of timeliness,thereby waiving the issue.see in re christopher th,d.furthermore,our conclusion that appellant was not entitled to a contested hearing leads to the related conclusion that he was not prejudiced by his inability to prepare to the social worker.
next,appellant claims the juvenile court failed to comply with the statutory procedures for determining paternity.we disagree.
appellant contention rests on the provisions of section.subdivision a of that section requires the juvenile court to conduct an inquiry as to the identity and address of all presumed or alleged fathers.however,the juvenile court duty in this regard arises only if parentage has not otherwise been determined.cal.rules of court,rule a,italics added.
a voluntary declaration of paternity shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of paternity by a court.rule c.in addition to other requirements,a voluntary declaration must contain a statement by the mother that the man signing the declaration is the only p
