vincent was surrendered by his mother at the hospital at birth in february,placed with the family for adoption,and declared a dependent of the court.mother refused to identify the father.the case went directly to permanency planning.jorge,vincent biological father and a stranger to vincent,appeared in the proceeding eight months later and filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section asking for presumed father status and family reunification services.the dependency court granted the request,finding that jorge was a nonstatutory presumed father entitled to reunification services without consideration of vincent best interest.the appeal this ruling.
relying on in re zacharia cal th,d,zacharia,we hold that jorge is not a presumed father because he does not fall within the definition of presumed father under family code section.we further hold that a biological father seeking reunification with a child,who does not come forward in the dependency proceeding until after the reunification period has ended,must establish under section that there are changed circumstances or new evidence demonstrating the child best interest would be promoted by reunification services.the rule is the same whether his paternity was concealed from him or not.in reaching these conclusions,we hold that adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey and cases decided thereafter such as in re baby boy th,d baby boy do not support the dependency court ruling made at the section permanency planning stage that a father whose paternity was hidden from him by the mother is a presumed father entitled to reunification services without regard to the best interests of the child.accordingly,we reverse 
procedural history 
on march,the dependency court declared vincent a dependent of the court based on sustained allegations under section,subdivision g that lena mother was unwilling to provide for the child and wanted the child to be placed for adoption,mother whereabouts was unknown,and father identity was unknown.custody was taken from the parents and given to the department of children and family services the department for suitable placement.because the parents whereabouts were unknown,reunification services were not ordered,permanency planning services were ordered,and a section hearing to select the permanent plan was set for july,with adoption as the plan.
on july,dan appeared in court with a prenatal paternity test report indicating he was the father.paternity testing was ordered,and the section hearing was continued pending receipt of the test results.on august,the were granted de facto parent status.in september,a dna test revealed that dan was not the father the section hearing was continued to october.
on october,jorge appeared in court alleging he was the biological father,counsel was appointed to represent him,and the dependency court ordered paternity testing to determine if he was the biological father.the section hearing was continued to november.
on october,jorge filed a petition under section requesting to be declared presumed father commensurate with his conduct and dna results and corresponding home of parent order or family reunification.the changed circumstances or new evidence he alleged was that he had lived with mother from december to december and neither observed mother was pregnant,nor was informed by mother of the pregnancy and birth.he alleged he moved to new york in december to get things ready so that she could join him there and continue their relationship,and they stayed in touch when he was in new york.he alleged that the requested order was in vincent best interest because upon being informed of his possible paternity,jorge immediately appeared.the child should not be deprived of his father because of the mother fraud and concealment.legislative scheme is family reunification.the dependency court ordered a hearing on the petition,with the section hearing to follow.
on november,based on the paternity test report that jorge could not be excluded as vincent biological father the dependency court found jorge was the biological father.
jorge section petition was heard on february and.the dependency court took judicial notice of the file and heard testimony and argument.jorge asked the court to find he was a presumed father under family code section,subdivision d on the basis he would have taken the child into his home but for mother concealment.in the alternative,jorge asked the court to deem him a presumed father under baby boy,supra,th,d,in that he timely came forward after learning he was the father.jorge argued that,as a presumed father,he was entitled to family reunification services unless the court found him to fall into one of the categories for denial of reunification services under section,subdivision b.
the dependency court granted the petition,found jorge to be victor presumed father,not under the statute but under case law,and ordered the department to prepare a report on jorge and recommend what services to provide.the court found mother did not tell jorge she was pregnant,jorge moved to new york believing she would follow him,and jorge should have known she could get pregnant.the court did not make a finding jorge did not know she was pregnant.the court found it did not have enough information to make a finding about whether jorge should have known mother was pregnant.finding that jorge came forward at the earliest possible time,after the original paternity test was refuted,the court had no choice but to find he was the presumed father entitled to reunification services without consideration of the child best interest,as he meets the criteria set out in the case law.
after the court ruling,the following colloquy between the prospective adoptive mother and the dependency court occurred what about the intentions of this child,what about jack,what about him the court,i know you are upset.i have a threshold issue that i have to determine and that what i have done.that does allow me to go to the direction that you have asked me to go.if i had the option,we might be in a totally different place.but i do have that option at this juncture.the two of you sat here and you listened to the same testimony that we all listened to and i know that you were no doubt offended by everything that you heard regarding people involved.i do have ca base a decision on these kinds of issues at this point.i can only look at them as they relate to the determination that i have to make today.and a lot of that did help me in making that decision.
the section hearing was taken off calendar.the matter was continued to march.on that date,the dependency court ordered reunification services,monitored visits,and an interstate compact on the placement of children for placement of vincent with jorge in new york.
the timely appealed from the order of february,granting the section petition.
statement of facts 
jorge lived in new york at the time of the hearing on his section petition.in,when he was years old,he had a daughter,alexis.following his separation from alexis mother after one year together,he never had custody of alexis.alexis lived with her mother,who subjected alexis to neglect and domestic violence.in,when alexis mother did not want to care for alexis any longer,jorge did not seek custody,and alexis went to jorge father home to live.
jorge met mother,who lived in los angeles,in.in december,he relocated to los angeles and moved in with mother.they did not use contraceptives or protection,and mother became pregnant in april.jorge was shocked,overwhelm ed,and concerned about how he could take care of a baby.they discussed terminating the pregnancy.mother had an abortion in may.
jorge and mother continued having unprotected sexual intercourse almost every day.he knew she was not using contraception and he used no protection.mother was also having an affair with dan mother became pregnant again,but did not tell jorge.she said she would never tell him,because it would kill him.mother told dan,who took a prenatal paternity test which indicated he was the father 
jorge testified he never knew or suspected mother was pregnant and never asked her if she was pregnant.she took a maternity leave of absence from her job in the fall of,but told jorge it was a medical leave because she had slight arthritis in her hand.in october,jorge learned mother was having an ongoing sexual relationship with dan in november,he audiotaped them having sex in his own bed.jorge was irate with mother.jorge noticed she was gaining weight,but she was a big girl and he thought she was eating more because she was at home.dan observed that mother displayed an obvious weight gain of or pounds by january.when vincent was born in february,mother told dan that the baby died at birth.
jorge moved to new york in late december to obtain custody of alexis.he thought mother would follow after she had settled her affairs,but mother did not join him there.jorge testified he did not suspect that mother had been pregnant and given birth,even though he saw a photograph in may or june revealing mother had lost significant weight.mother did not tell jorge about vincent until dan september paternity test revealed dan was not the father.on october,jorge called the social worker and identified himself as vincent father.
at the time of the hearing,jorge still had not taken alexis into his home.he testified he was ready to have vincent live with him,with his family help,and he would allow mother to be part of vincent life.the dependency court asked w hy have you made the same preparations to have your daughter with you w hy is your daughter with you jorge said his father felt jorge was not ready to have her.
in the meantime,vincent thrived in the home,where he had been provided with the unconditional love and attention of two loving parents since he was four days old.he was in the percentile of growth.quit her job to be with him full time.the child and his parents have bonded.he has become an integral part of their lives,families and friends.jack lights up with smiles and cooing when either of the walk into the room.his loving,happy interaction is ever present when he is being held.
even when it seemed they might lose custody of vincent,the b continued to provide him with unconditional love and care.they had a very nurturing relationship with vincent and their bond was extremely close.vincent was a very well adjusted happy baby in their care.the did not give up hope and continued to be very committed with providing vincent a permanent adoptive home.the completed the adoptive home study and were approved to adopt vincent.the foregoing evidence as to the relationship with vincent is uncontradicted.
discussion 
the have standing to appeal 
jorge and vincent contend the lack standing to appeal the order granting the section petition.they contend that the are de facto parents who are not aggrieved by the order because the have no right to custody or placement of vincent.under the circumstances of this case,the have standing to appeal.
code of civil procedure section permits appeals by any party aggrieved in a civil action.the case law has interpreted a party aggrieved as any person having an interest recognized by law in the subject matter of the judgment,which interest is injuriously affected by the judgment as the supreme court established in in re cal d,a de facto parent has an interest in the companionship,care,custody and management of the child citation.in re joel th,d.one is considered aggrieved whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment.citation.in re lauren th,d.
california law does not restrict a de facto parent right to appellate review to the procedural rights provided by california rules of court,rule e formerly rule e to be present at the dispositional hearing and all subsequent hearings affecting the child status,to be represented by counsel,and to present evidence.in re joel,supra,th at,d the de facto parent had standing to appeal the order under section,removing the children from her custody compare in re th,d the de facto parent,in whose home the child was placed pending finding a prospective adoptive home,had no standing to complain about the order removing the child to a prospective adoptive home.
in this case,the rights and interests were injuriously affected by the dependency court ruling.they provided a home for vincent since he was four days old and abandoned by mother.at disposition,the case proceeded directly to permanency planning on a track of adoption by the.as the people who,on a basis,assume d the role of parent,seeking to fulfill both vincent physical needs and his psychological need for affection and care,the were granted de facto parent status.see in re,supra,cal d at,fn.they completed an adoption home study and were approved to adopt vincent.unlike the circumstances in in re,supra,th at pages,d,the always intended to adopt vincent,and vincent was placed there with the expectation it was an adoptive home.the dependency court permitted the to litigate in opposition to the section petition,gave them access to the court file to facilitate their participation,and told them they could appeal the decision on the section petition.the ruling granting the section petition vacated the orders for permanency planning services and setting a section hearing to select a permanent plan,thus taking the case off the adoption track.services would be ordered whose goal is removing vincent from the and giving custody to jorge.as prior,final orders are not reviewable in an appeal of a subsequent order,the will be foreclosed from obtaining a ruling on the correctness of granting this section petition if they can not proceed in the instant appeal.see,in re megan d,d.
granting the section petition was an abuse of discretion without consideration of vincent best interest 
the contend the order granting the section petition was an abuse of discretion in that the dependency court failed to consider vincent best interest,and there is no substantial evidence vincent best interest would be promoted by granting reunification services we conclude that the order granting the section petition was an abuse of discretion.
applicable law on presumed father status and reviving the issue of reunification services 
section,subdivision a provides except as provided in subdivision b whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction,the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father,if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.
o nly a presumed,not a mere biological,father is a parent entitled to receive reunification services under section.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.p arental rights are generally conferred on a man not merely based on biology but on the father connection to the mother child through marriage or attempted marriage or his commitment to the child.citation.id.at,d.
in order to become a presumed father,a man must fall within one of several categories enumerated in civil code section,subdivision a.the only relevant category in this case is civil code section,subdivision a,which provides that a natural father may become a presumed father if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.see in re phoenix d,fn.id.at.presumed father status achieved when alleged father came forward when the department instituted dependency proceedings,offered to care for his daughter,took her into his home and held her out as his child.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
i f a man fails to achieve presumed father status prior to the expiration of any reunification period in a dependency case,whether that period be,or months as in this case,he is not entitled to such services under section.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
for a biological father who does not assert paternity until after the expiration of any reunification period,the only remedy is to file a petition to modify under section.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.while a biological father is not entitled to custody under section or reunification services under section if he does not attain presumed father status prior to the termination of any reunification period,he may move under section for a hearing to reconsider the juvenile court earlier rulings based on new evidence or changed circumstances.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.the section petition will not be granted unless there are changed circumstances or new evidence demonstrating it is in the child best interest to grant reunification services or custody.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d,in re jasmon cal th,d.
u p until the time the section hearing is set,the parent interest in reunification is given precedence over a child need for stability and permanency.citation.once reunification services are ordered terminated,the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability.citation.the burden thereafter is on the parent to prove changed circumstances pursuant to section to revive the reunification issue.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
jorge was not a presumed father 
the only status jorge established was that he is the biological father.he did not show he qualified as a presumed father under the only category that might be code section,subdivision d because he did not receive vincent into his home and hold him out as his own.under zacharia,jorge is not a presumed father.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
as a biological father who did not assert paternity until the case was in permanency planning,jorge only remedy was to show,under section,that vincent best interest required vacating the permanency planning orders and providing jorge reunification services so that he might qualify as a presumed father,entitled to custody.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.the dependency court erroneously ruled that vincent best interests were irrelevant to the determination and therefore never addressed the issue of whether providing reunification services to jorge would be in vincent best interests.by failing to make the necessary determination of the best interests of the child,the dependency court abused its discretion in granting the section petition.see zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
case law does not require treating jorge as a presumed father entitling him to reunification services without consideration of vincent best interest 
the dependency court in this case felt compelled by case law kelsey and baby boy deem jorge a presumed father entitled to reunification services,without consideration of vincent best interest under section,because jorge came forward shortly after learning he was the biological father.as we discuss below,kelsey and baby boy did not compel the dependency court to reach this result.zacharia held that biological fathers who appear after the end of any reunification period must file a section petition to revive the issue of reunification services.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.no case has declared section unconstitutional in the context of a biological father whose failure to timely appear was because the mother prevented his timely appearance.thus,the dependency court was bound by zacharia to comply with section to revive the reunification issue.
kelsey was not a dependency case.it was a private adoption case in which the unwed father was prevented from taking the child into his home and becoming a presumed father under civil code section,subdivision a.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.under the statutory scheme for private adoptions,mothers and presumed fathers had greater rights to prevent termination of parental rights for purposes of adoption than unwed biological fathers.
the supreme court in kelsey did not hold that the unwed father,who promptly came forward early in the proceeding to demonstrate a full commitment to his parental responsibilities but who was prevented from receiving the child into his home by the mother action,was a presumed father under family code section under the doctrine of constructive receipt.see kelsey,cal th at,d.nor did the supreme court hold under any theory that such a father had presumed father status.
the supreme court held that civil code section,subdivision a and the related statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers to the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child best interest.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.under such circumstances,i f an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.ibid.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.in determining whether a biological father has demonstrated such a commitment,t he father conduct both before and after the child birth must be considered.once the father knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy,he must promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in emphasiz ing the narrowness of our decision,we stated that the statutory distinction between natural fathers and presumed fathers is constitutionally invalid only to the extent it is applied to an unwed father who has sufficiently and timely demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities.our statutes,subd.d petition to terminate parental rights for private adoption are constitutionally sufficient when applied to a father who has failed to make such a showing.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
in zacharia,the supreme court limited kelsey by noting that it involved the standard under which parental rights were terminated in the private adoption context,not the standard for determining a biological parent right to reunification services in the dependency context.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court stated that the issue addressed in kelsey would arise in the dependency context as follows the issue would arise therefore,under facts not presented here,whether the statutory distinctions between biological and presumed fathers are unconstitutional as applied to a biological father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party,but who comes forward early in the dependency process,and who displays a commitment consistent with the standard set forth in kelsey extending kelsey to apply in the dependency context would allow such a father to participate as a parent in,or end the need for,the dependency proceedings.zacharia d,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.nothing in zacharia suggests that a constitutional issue would arise when an unwed father does not come forward until late in the process,as when the dependency case is already in permanency planning.when a dependency case is in permanency planning,the focus has shifted to the child needs for permanence and stability the reunification issue may only be revived if it is in the child best interest.see zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court in zacharia did not decide this constitutional issue in the dependency context.we are not called upon to decide it in this case either.however,we note that dependent children,unlike children in a private adoption,have been seriously abused or neglected.when a dependent child is involved,the state interest and child interest are unique and require higher protection for the child.the dependency court deals with children who have been seriously abused,abandoned,or neglected.the juvenile court has a special responsibility to the child as parens patriae and must look to the totality of a child circumstances when making decisions regarding the child.in re chantal cal th,d,discussion of different purposes and policies of the family code and juvenile court law.
in baby boy,a man claiming he might be the baby father came forward seven months after the baby was taken into custody by the department at birth.baby boy,supra,th at,d.the case was in permanency planning the baby was in a home.id.at,d.the man,jesus,stated he had had a sexual relationship with the mother but did not stay in touch with her,and she just told him about the baby.id.at,d.he appeared at the next court hearing,which was a section hearing,and requested paternity testing.id.at,d.the request was denied,and at a continued section hearing,parental rights were terminated.id.at,d.at no time did jesus file a section petition requesting presumed father status and reunification services.id.at fn,d.our colleagues in division one reversed the orders denying paternity testing and terminating parental rights.the court held that under kelsey,jesus was a presumed father and entitled to reunification services if,on remand,the dependency court finds he came forward promptly,paternity testing revealed he is the biological father,and he is not unfit.id.at,d.
we agree with the decision in baby boy to the extent the court reversed the order denying paternity testing.jesus was an alleged father who was entitled to an opportunity to establish he is the biological father.in re paul th,d.the dependency court has a duty to determine the parentage of a child when a man appears at a hearing requesting a paternity finding,cal.rules of court,rule a,h renumbered as rule h.as the case before us does not involve a deprivation of the right to a determination of biological paternity,baby boy is not authority for granting jorge section petition.a decision,of course,does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.flatley mauro cal th,d.
the conclusion in baby boy that jesus was entitled to presumed father status and reunification services is arguably dicta and thus not entitled to binding effect on the dependency court.to the extent the baby boy court recognized presumed father status and a right to reunification services,we respectfully disagree on the basis of the holding in zacharia that a biological father who appears after the end of the reunification period must proceed under section in order to be awarded reunification services.in sum,like kelsey,baby boy does not support the decision below 
while under normal circumstances a father may wait months or years before inquiring into the existence of any children that may have resulted from his sexual encounters with a woman,a child in the dependency system requires a more response.once a child is placed in that system,the father failure to ascertain the child existence and develop a parental relationship with that child must necessarily occur at the risk of ultimately losing any opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship.citation.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
any new section hearing will include current facts 
as we reverse the findings and orders,jorge may decide to file a new section petition to modify the dispositional orders.one year has passed since the order appealed from was made.reversal of the order will not return the hearing to the same arena in which it was first held.this is because the focus of the hearing must always be upon the best interest of the child.the new hearing would entail not only the facts and evidence brought forth at the original hearing,but of necessity would require evidence as to the current status of the child.in re arturo th,d.jorge will have to plead and prove the elements for relief under section based on current facts.see,italics omitted.the child best interest analysis must look at the totality of the child circumstances.in re chantal,supra,cal th at,d.
while the issue of whether jorge knew or should reasonably have known he was a father was originally cast as relevant to whether he was a kelsey father,the issue would now,on remand,be relevant to whether there are changed circumstances such that granting reunification services is in vincent best interest.the changed circumstance he alleged in his october,section petition was that he did not know and was not told mother was pregnant and gave birth.on this score,we find untenable the dependency court conclusion that the record was insufficient to determine whether or not he knew or should have known he was a father without mother telling him.it is uncontradicted in the record that jorge and mother engaged almost daily in what he knew was unprotected sex,which resulted in pregnancy only a year earlier,lived with her during the pregnancy until six weeks before the birth,watched her get heavier with the knowledge she was on a leave of absence from work,and observed five or six months after he moved away that she had lost weight.the dependency court stated it was not necessary to make the finding that had jorge reasonably suspected mother was pregnant and asked her,mother would have denied she was pregnant had he known she was pregnant,she would have shown him dan prenatal paternity test.while the dependency court thinking is within the range of possibilities,the fact remains it is entirely speculative.it is undisputed there is no evidence jorge ever asked mother if she were pregnant or had given birth.what she may have answered to a question he did not ask,and what he may have done in response to an answer she did not give,is all guesswork.because vincent was a child placed in the dependency system and jorge waited eight months without inquiring into the existence of any children that may have resulted from his sexual encounters with mother,his delay placed him at the risk of ultimately losing any opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship.citation.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
disposition 
the findings and orders granting jorge section petition are reversed.upon issuance of the remittitur,the temporary stay of february,shall become permanent.
i respectfully dissent.
the supreme court in in re zacharia cal th,d,noted that adoption of kelsey cal th,d,did not apply to the facts of that case,because zacharia father did not claim that he was prevented from becoming a statutory presumed father on account of the actions of the mother or any third party.the court suggested,however,that the same constitutional considerations at play in kelsey would arise under facts not presented here,whether the statutory distinctions between biological and presumed fathers are unconstitutional as applied to a biological father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party,but who comes forward early in the dependency process,and who displays a commitment consistent with the standard set forth in kelsey extending kelsey to apply in the dependency context would allow such a father to participate as a parent in,or end the need for,the dependency proceedings.zacharia,supra,at,d.unlike zacharia,this is just such a case.
as appellants dan and tina acknowledge,the facts in this appeal are not disputed.the juvenile court found that,due to his girlfriend extravagant duplicity,jorge first learned of the existence of his child vincent when vincent was seven months old.while mother abandoned vincent at the hospital and concocted an outrageous lie to prevent daniel,whom she believed to be vincent father,from having a relationship with his son,jorge was in new york preparing to make a home for mother and himself.the evidence in the record leaves no doubt but that jorge would have taken vincent into his home and held him out as his child,thereby becoming a statutory presumed father,but for mother actions.as soon as he learned of vincent existence,jorge made arrangements to take time off from work and flew miles to seek custody of vincent or,barring that,reunification services.the majority conclusion that jorge arrived too late is contrary to a substantial line of court of appeal cases recognizing kelsey fathers in the dependency court setting,and affording them the reunification rights which they are due under welfare and institutions code section.accordingly,i would affirm the juvenile court.
initially,i note my disagreement with the majority conclusion that dan and tina have standing to appeal the trial court grant of kelsey status to jorge,and the reunification services which flow from that status.as both jorge and vincent argue,dan and tina are not legally aggrieved by the order,and thus have no standing to appeal.
an aggrieved party for purposes of code of civil procedure section is one whose interest is injuriously affected by the judgment in re joel th,d.dan and tina claim to be aggrieved because t he court findings and orders thwarted their plan to adopt vincent.however,they have no legal right to adopt vincent.thus,i fail to see how their legal interests are aggrieved.
the majority does not satisfactorily define dan and tina legal interests or explain how those interests are affected by the juvenile court finding,pursuant to kelsey,that vincent biological father is a presumed father entitled to reunification services.that is to say,they do not explain why dan and tina are entitled to thwart vincent efforts at reunification with his father by appealing an order which vincent,through his counsel,supports.rather,dan and tina simply anticipate that,if reunification services are successful,vincent will be placed with his father.that,however,is the scenario envisioned by the legislature when it fashioned the entire dependency court process.if the process succeeds,foster parents will always relinquish custody of their charges.it is an odd conclusion indeed to deem the family legal injury to the foster parents.
the cases relied on by the majority to support dan and tina standing to appeal can not be read to apply to the facts here.the supreme court first stated in in re cal d,that d e facto parents,such as foster parents,should be permitted to appear as parties in juvenile court proceedings to assert and protect their own interest in the companionship,care,custody,and management of the child involved.id.at.however,as the court later explained in in re kieshia cal th,d,that standing is limited by the rationale underlying the de facto parent doctrine itself the de facto parenthood doctrine simply recognizes that persons who have provided a child with daily parental concern,affection,and care over substantial time may develop legitimate interests and perspectives,and may also present a custodial alternative,which should not be ignored in a juvenile dependency proceeding.the standing accorded de facto parents has no basis independent of these concerns.id.at,d.
the only cases cited by the majority which concern the de facto parents right to appeal a dependency court order are in re joel,supra,th,d and in re th,d.in each of these cases,the order appealed from removed the child from the home of the de facto parents,an order in no way analogous to that at issue here,finding jorge entitled to presumed father status and reunification services.
in in re,a newborn was placed in the home of the appellant foster mother.a selection and implementation hearing was set when the minor was just over a year old.although the foster mother had initially expressed an interest in adopting the child,she voiced some concerns regarding her health which caused her to reconsider.accordingly,dcfs located prospective adoptive parents.the foster mother very quickly changed her mind,and sought to adopt the minor who she had cared for since birth.at a subsequent placement review hearing,dcfs recommended a change in placement,which the juvenile court ordered.the foster mother,since accorded de facto parent status,appealed.in re,supra,at,d.
the appellate court in in re reiterated the rights of de facto parents in the dependency court arena de facto parents have limited rights that include the right to an attorney the right to be present at hearings and the right to present evidence and be heard.specifically,they do not have the right to reunification services,custody,or visitation.in re kieshia,at,d,clifford superior court th,d,italics added cal.rules of court,rule e.while de facto parents are given an opportunity to participate in the proceedings,that status does not give them the rights accorded to a parent or legal guardian.in re cynthia th,d in re crystal th,d.consequently,appellant has no legal standing to complain of the decision to place the child with the new prospective couple since she has no right to custody or continued placement as a mere de facto parent.in re,supra,at,d.the court dismissed the appeal.
in in re joel,supra,de facto parents,who like appellants here were both the minor foster parents and prospective adoptive parents,appealed a juvenile court order permanently removing the minor from their home upon a finding that they had physically and emotionally abused the child.during the pendency of the appeal,the minor was returned to his mother care.dcfs challenged the de facto parents right to appeal,based both on mootness and lack of standing.in ruling against the dcfs,the court of appeal noted regrettably,it is entirely possible given the family history here that joel may once again become the subject of dependency proceedings.should this occur,the finding of physical and emotional abuse and order permanently removing joel from the de facto parent custody would have res judicata effect and would prevent a court from considering her home if joel had to be removed from his mother custody.id.at,d.under those facts,the court found that the de facto parents were aggrieved by the juvenile court factual findings,unsupported by the record,which could be used in the future to prevent the minor placement in their home.it is worth noting that the de facto parents were permitted to challenge the factual findings that they were abusive,not the removal order itself.thus,even though the appellate court reversed the factual findings for lack of evidence,the de facto parents were not thereby entitled to return of the child.joel provides no basis for a finding that dan and tina are aggrieved by the juvenile court orders granting jorge presumed father status and ordering reunification services,because those orders do not adversely affect them as vincent de facto parents.
in sum,because dan and tina have no legal right to adopt vincent,their legal interests are not aggrieved by the juvenile court orders,despite the emotional pain they quite understandably feel at the possibility that they may not be able to adopt this child.
standing to appeal aside,i believe that the dictates of our supreme court as set forth in kelsey,supra,cal th,d,and as consistently followed by the courts of appeal over the last years require affirmance of the juvenile court orders.
kelsey was concerned with the distinction between biological or natural fathers,who are accorded lesser rights than are presumed fathers.the biological father in kelsey challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme which permitted the adoption of his child by a third party without his consent.that is to say,california law permitted the termination of a biological father parental rights over his objection notwithstanding that he would have been a statutory presumed father but for the unilateral actions of the child mother.in rejecting this outcome,the supreme court ruled that the presumed father statute,civil code section,subdivision a and the related statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathersto the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child best interest if an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.kelsey,supra,at,d.while decided on equal protection grounds,the underlying premise of the ruling is the bedrock principle that a parent has a constitutional right to the care,custody,companionship,and management of his or her child.santosky kramer,d in re gladys th,d.
here,as in kelsey,we are faced with the prospect of the termination of a biological father parental rights over his objection,notwithstanding that he would have been a statutory presumed father but for the unilateral actions of the child mother.i find no basis to distinguish kelsey,and therefore would conclude that kelsey is applicable to dependency court proceedings,a conclusion reached by every other court which has considered the issue.
in in re jerry th,d review granted may,opn.ordered published june,our colleagues in division seven of this district court of appeal held that adoption of kelsey applies to dependency proceedings and therefore family code section and the related dependency scheme violate the constitutional rights of a man seeking presumed father status to the extent they permit a mother or third person to unilaterally deny him that status by preventing him from receiving the child into his home.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the supreme court quoted the foregoing language with approval in in re nicholas cal th,d.indeed,a long line of appellate opinions have implicitly or explicitly recognized that the constitutional concerns which the supreme court expressed in kelsey apply with equal force in the dependency court see,in re th,d,div.although section makes no provision for a kelsey father in its list of presumptions,a father asserting valid kelsey rights may effectively qualify for presumed father status as the result of his constitutional right to parent,which overrides any contrary statutory direction.in re baby boy th,d,div.provided that father establishes on remand,that he satisfied the requirements of adoption of kelsey,he is entitled to reunification services absent a showing of unfitness in re elijah th,d,div.a biological father may be accorded parental rights and become a kelsey father when his attempt to achieve presumed parent status under section,subdivision d is thwarted by a third party and he made a full commitment to his parental,financial,and otherwise.in re andrew th,d,div.in re paul th,d dist.in re th,d,div.in re julia th,d,div.
notwithstanding the great weight of authority to the contrary,the majority concludes that jorge could not establish that he is a kelsey father because this is a dependency case and not an adoption case and that in any event,pursuant to in re zacharia,supra,he appeared too late to establish his status as a presumed father because the reunification period had ended and a section hearing had been set.in my view,zacharia has no application to this case.
in zacharia,supra,cal th,d,javan,the minor biological father,first appeared in the dependency proceedings at the hearing when zacharia was months old,and requested paternity testing.the juvenile court subsequently denied javan reunification services and terminated his parental rights.three weeks before the latter order was entered,javan married zacharia mother,a step preparatory to becoming a presumed father under family code section,subdivision c on appeal,the court of appeal assumed that javan,as the biological father,was entitled to receive reunification services before his parental rights could be terminated.id.at,d.the appellate court also concluded that,as a,noncustodial parent,zacharia must be placed with javan under section.id.at,d.
thus,the supreme court in zacharia was faced with two discrete issues of statutory interpretation,neither of which is present in this case whether the term parent as used in section includes a biological as opposed to a presumed father,and whether the mandate of section,subdivision a that,absent detriment to the child,a minor removed from a parent custody must be placed with the noncustodial parent,applies only at the time the child is first removed or may be invoked by a biological father who did not assert his paternity until the hearing the court also considered whether a biological but not a presumed father may request reunification services for the first time after the review hearing.id.at,d.zacharia conclusion that a presumed father,but not a biological father,is entitled to reunification services is now enshrined in statute jorge makes no claim that he is entitled to reunification services based upon his status as a mere biological father.nor did jorge first request reunification services at the review hearing,or demand that the trial court award him immediate custody of vincent under section,subdivision a.consequently,the issues addressed in zacharia are simply not present in this case.
as noted above,the zacharia court pointed out it does not appear that javan argued the point that kelsey did not apply to the facts of that case,because javan did not claim that he was prevented from becoming a statutory presumed father on account of the actions of the mother or any third party.after holding that parents entitled to reunification services under section include presumed fathers but not biological fathers,the court concluded here,javan failed to achieve presumed father status.the court of appeal therefore erred in concluding that he was a parent entitled to receive reunification services.id.at,d.rather,he was left to seek reunification services based upon the standard of the best interests of the child,by way of a section motion.
from this conclusion,the majority holds that the juvenile court in this case abused its discretion by failing to consider vincent best interests before ordering reunification services.if jorge stood in the same position as javan in zacharia,i would agree that he can only obtain reunification services by filing a section petition and convincing the court that those services are in vincent best interests.however,jorge occupies a completely different position than did the biological father in zacharia 
javan had a brief sexual relationship with wendy,zacharia mother,after which he disappeared from her life.he did not learn of wendy pregnancy because he chose not to maintain contact with her.upon first learning of zacharia existence,when the child was months old,he did not immediately come forward to care for his child but waited another three months,until the court was about to terminate wendy reunification services at the review hearing,to request paternity testing.by contrast,jorge was in a committed relationship with lena,maintaining a household together and planning their upcoming move to new york.as the juvenile court found,jorge did not abandon this mother.rather,lena engaged in a web of lies to deceive jorge about the pregnancy because she believed he was not the child father and daniel about vincent live birth for reasons known only to her.after returning to new york in december,jorge maintained contact with lena,speaking with her by telephone and computer approximately twice a week.when in september lena belatedly told jorge of the existence of the baby,then seven months old,he contacted dcfs to determine how to go about obtaining custody.he was told that the next dependency court hearing was scheduled for october.jorge took time off from work and flew to los angeles to attend the hearing.he was appointed counsel and the very next day filed papers,denominated a section petition,to get custody of his son so he could care for him.in short,jorge did everything one would hope a man in his position would do.yet the majority says he was too late,because the reunification period had ended and the case was in permanency planning.
in fact,the reunification period in this case ended in march,when vincent was a month old,since the dcfs sought no reunification services for the family pursuant to section,subdivision b,and recommended that the case proceed directly to permanency planning.applying the logic of the majority opinion,it would seem that no man can ever establish presumed father status if reunification services are not ordered for the mother.thus,the mother unilateral action in refusing to seek reunification services results in the father loss of rights,precisely the outcome the supreme court deemed constitutionally suspect in kelsey s.this simply can not be the law of the state of california.
indeed,it is not.at least three court of appeal opinions have sanctioned the provision of reunification services to a presumed or kelsey father who first appeared in
