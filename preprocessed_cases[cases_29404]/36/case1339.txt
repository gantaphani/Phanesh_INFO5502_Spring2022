star reyes mother and kenneth ragghanti father are the parents of the minor child.was born on april.mother and father never married and,with but a brief exception,never lived together.lived primarily with mother for the first six years of her life and visited father regularly.
when mother decided she wanted to move away and take with her,father sought an order of the court giving sole custody of to him.prior to trial of the custody issue the parties agreed that no final permanent custody determination had ever been made so that the trial court was to use the best interests analysis and consider all circumstances in making its custody decision.the trial court concluded that it was in best interest to live primarily with father and awarded sole physical custody of the child to him.mother appeals from that order.
mother contends that the trial court erred in applying the best interests analysis in the way it is typically used for initial custody determinations.she argues that given the length of time lived primarily with her,the court was required to find either that mother care was deficient or that her planned relocation would be detrimental to,before the court could award custody to father.we conclude that the trial court used the correct analysis and affirm the order.
background 
father was present when was born and was involved in her life for the first few weeks,but soon afterward,when he and mother stopped seeing each other,mother terminated his access to.the parties stipulated to paternity and a paternity judgment was entered in december,when was eight months old.the temporary custody order attached to that judgment provided that was to live primarily with mother and that father had visitation rights.both parents lived in santa clara county at the time.
in,within months of the trial court first visitation order,mother threatened to move to georgia.father obtained a restraining order and the trial court ultimately found that mother motive for moving was to deny father access to.the court ordered custody to father if mother chose to move.she did not move and remained in her custody.
after a attempt at reconciliation,the custody dispute continued.in february mother alleged that father physically abused.child protective services cps investigated the allegation and closed the case as unfounded.the trial court noted there is a hint in this case that mom is on a campaign to deny father his visitation rights.
in september,mother again told father she was going to move away with.this time she planned to relocate to sacramento.father hired an attorney and scheduled a meeting to discuss mother moving plans but before the meeting could take place,the trial court issued an emergency protective order that required father to stay away from.the court made the order after mother had insinuated to preschool teacher that father had sexually molested the child and the teacher reported the conversation to cps.underwent a sexual assault examination and the molestation allegation proved to be unfounded.
mother then filed a motion seeking permission to move to sacramento.the parties stipulated to the appointment of kenneth perlmutter as a neutral evaluator to make a recommendation on mother request to move away.
in his report dated september,perlmutter observed that father had a very good and thorough understanding of personality and needs.he seems very capable and well equipped to see to and meet her needs.and father had a very appropriate and loving relationship and a close and meaningful emotional bond.perlmutter described mother as a good enough mother and parent.he was concerned that mother had acted to limit the flourishing relationship between father and.therapist,jonee donnelly,did not believe anyone had been physically or sexually inappropriate with and questioned the validity and truthfulness of some of mother reports to her.she observed that had a troubling pattern of making negative comments about her father and donnelly believed that mother was the source of this.perlmutter noted there is a clear and definitive pattern that mother has attempted to discredit father by providing information to others that might cause them to take actions that would jeopardize father custodial rights.perlmutter also believed that a substantial part of mother request to move to sacramento is based on her desire to limit the amount of time father spends with.he concluded to approve a move to sacramento would likely be a death knell for this child continuing to have a positive relationship with her father.
when neither party objected,the trial court adopted perlmutter recommendations in an order dated march.the order gave the parents joint legal and joint physical custody of and called for father to have full physical custody if mother decided to move away.
b.the instant third request to move away and father request for sole physical custody of 
on june,evidently prompted by a concern that mother still wanted to move to sacramento,father filed a motion seeking sole physical custody of.mother filed her own motion two days later,again seeking permission to move to sacramento.mother had recently been married and her new husband lived and worked in sacramento.perlmutter was engaged to perform another custody evaluation.pursuant to the parties agreement,the court directed him to conduct a de novo evaluation of all the circumstances and make a custody recommendation based upon the child best interests.
perlmutter march,report concluded that whether or not mother chose to move to sacramento,it would be in best interest to award sole physical custody to father.mother objected to the recommendation and the matter proceeded to trial.
the issue of a permanent order was tried over three days in september.perlmutter opinion was largely the basis for the trial court ultimate decision.perlmutter was concerned that mother did not show any understanding of how her decisions affected and did not communicate effectively with the girl.while interviewing mother and together,perlmutter observed their interaction and was troubled by significant regressive behavior.perlmutter questioned whether mother would be able to give a consistent and predictable lifestyle,pointing out that mother shuttled her between san jose and sacramento and among four different houses.
in contrast,perlmutter had no such concerns about father.in his written report he stated that relationship with father has solidified and thrived.father continues to be a very important part of life.his role is at least equal to that of the mother.he has provided for her in ways that her mother has not.he has demonstrated a sensitivity to her needs in ways that her mother has not.he has been solely focused on her best interests in ways that her mother has not.he has been emotionally stable in ways that mother has not.he has provided her one stable home that her mother has not.perlmutter concluded that needed a stable environment to maximize her future development and that she was most likely to have that if she lived primarily with her father.
the trial court statement of decision and order after trial was filed october.applying the best interests standard,and expressly considering the fact that the child had spent more time with mother than with father during the preceding six years,the trial court concluded that it was in best interest to live primarily with her father during the school year.the court specifically found that the existing custody arrangement was a de facto joint custody arrangement.the court found that was equally bonded to mother and father and that father was a significant part of her daily life.the court also found that father was the parent most likely to share custody and that mother may not have the ability to do that.the trial court explained that its decision was based in large part upon what had happened in the past and upon perlmutter opinion.the trial court declined to make a finding that mother care had been deficient,stating,the court views the mother in a very positive light in many ways and finds that mother takes generally good care of and loves her daughter and is doing the best she can.
