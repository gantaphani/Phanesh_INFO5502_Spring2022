introduction 
how far does the immunity from a suit for damages accorded under the eleventh amendment extend to a county acting as an arm of the state in the present case,pedro hernandez,a resident of monterey county,suffered wage garnishments and a levy upon his savings account because the family support division family support of the office of san bernardino county district attorney confused hernandez with another person owing child support payments.in his third amended complaint against the county of san bernardino the county,hernandez sued the county for violation of his civil rights under title,section of the united states code section.hernandez appeals from an order granting the county motion for judgment on the pleadings.
we hold the court erred in granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings.at this stage in the proceedings,the complaint on its face and the undeveloped factual record did not permit the trial court to rule,as a matter of law,that family support was a state actor,making the county free from liability under section.nor could the trial court properly decide whether family support was a policymaker for the county,making the county liable under section in the absence of any evidence that the procedures followed by family support were state mandated or county initiated,the trial court acted precipitously in ruling in favor of the county.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
although hernandez has submitted a lengthy recitation of the factual background of this case,he has not provided us with supporting citations to the record as required by california rules of court,rule a c.furthermore,our review of a motion for judgment on the pleadings,like a demurrer,is confined to consideration of all facts properly pleaded in the complaint not the extraneous matters introduced by hernandez in his points and authorities below and his appellant opening brief.
nevertheless,for purposes of review,hernandez requests we consider the additional facts are either established or capable of being pleaded by amendment of the complaint.what apparently happened,according to hernandez and not disputed by the county,is that family support confused hernandez name,birthdate,and social security number with another man who owed delinquent child support,the support obligor.family support then reported hernandez to the state franchise tax board for being delinquent in child support.after learning its mistake,family support each time neglected to delete hernandez information from its accounting data base or to make telephone contact with the franchise tax board so it could flag the problem in its system.instead,family support repeatedly sent delinquency reports to the franchise tax board for collection.during the period between august and june,the franchise tax board acted four times to garnish hernandez wages and levy on his bank account.as a result,hernandez suffered economic and personal distress,including his wife leaving him for a period of time.
discussion 
hernandez has asserted one claim for civil rights violations against the county based on family support conduct.in monell of soc.serv.of city of monell the united states supreme court announced that a local government like a county,and unlike state government,is a person subject to a suit for damages under section.if family support was acting for the state in its collection procedures,the county could not be liable under section.but,if family support was acting on behalf of the county,the county could be liable therefore,we must consider whether family support was a state or county actor under the particular facts of this case.
california law governs the provision for and enforcement of child support.in return for receiving federal funding for public assistance under title of the social security act,a state must provide services related to the establishment,modification,and enforcement of child support obligations.in the present case,the applicable law is former welfare and institutions code section et,the family economic security act of more particularly,we are concerned with the application of former article,section et,governing enforcement of child support obligations.
most of article was repealed and superseded by family code section et,effective september,and july,in,the legislature enacted a new statutory scheme that created a department of child support services within the california health and human services agency,to establish,collect,and distribute child support.citations.the pertinent welfare and institutions code sections were repealed and replaced but the effective dates of the new statutes occurred after june,the last relevant date in this case.therefore,we will employ the former law for our analysis because a s a general rule,an appeal only determines whether the judgment was correctly rendered based on the law as it existed at that time.
article designated the state department of social services dss as the single organizational unit whose duty it shall be to administer the state plan for securing child support state plan functions shall be performed by other agencies as required by law,by delegation of the department,or by cooperative agreements.next,the director of dss was required to formulate,adopt,amend or repeal,in accordance with provisions of section,regulations and general policies affecting the purposes,responsibilities,and jurisdiction of the department and which are consistent with law and necessary for the administration of the state plan for securing child support orders section elaborated the department shall adopt regulations,orders,or standards of general application to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced by the department the rules of the department need not specify or include the detail of forms,reports or records 
the enforcement provisions also provided each county should maintain in its district attorney office an enforcement unit with the responsibility for child support obligations an action by the district attorney for child support was prosecuted in the name of the county support enforcement was available to all obligees,whether or not they received public assistance 
a number of courts interpreted these statutes as providing jurisdiction for a county,through its district attorney,to obtain and enforce child support orders under section,the county had standing to sue on behalf of minor children when the children are recipients of aid the county,via its legal representative the district attorney,is responsible for promptly and effectively enforcing the support obligation by taking appropriate action.the courts recognized a strong and manifest policy,obviously adopted for the benefit of the public,to the effect that a county which provides public assistance to a mother and children shall have the right to reimbursement from the primary obligor,the father.
the essential dispute between hernandez and the county involves whether family support was acting on behalf of the state,not the county,when it reported hernandez to the franchise tax board as being delinquent on child support.because it can not be determined conclusively as a matter of law based on the present state of the record that what occurred was state action,we decide the trial court was wrong to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings.in particular,it is unknown whether the county procedures for identifying and reporting delinquent support obligors in and were mandated by the state or developed independently by the county for implementing child support enforcement.it may be that the county,not the state,had faulty procedures that caused the kind of problem that occurred here.in that event,as discussed below,the county may be liable to hernandez under section.
in granting the county motion for judgment on the pleadings,the trial court relied on pitts county of kern in which the california supreme court held that,in prosecuting crimes involving sexual molestation,the district attorney acts for the state and can not be sued for damages under section.pitts followed the analysis of mcmillian monroe county,alabama in which the unit
