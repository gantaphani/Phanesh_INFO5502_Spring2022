karen butler,the mother of emily,appeals an order granting and extending visitation to emily paternal grandparents,charles harris,and leanne harris,and directing butler to allow her daughter to travel alone on airline flights to accomplish the visitation.butler asserts the visitation order must be reversed because the statute that authorized code section unconstitutional,both facially and as applied.
in addressing butler constitutional claims,we solicited amicus curiae briefs on the following question 
where there are no allegations of unfitness of the custodial parent and the custodial parent objects to grandparent visitation,does the best interest standard set forth in section comport with the constitutional rights of due process and privacy provided by the united states and california constitutions 
we reverse,finding the application of section violated butler due process rights under both the united states and california constitutions.applying the decision of the united states supreme court in troxel granville,d troxel,we find section does not per se violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.however,we hold in order for the statute to meet due process requirements under the california constitution,when a fit custodial parent opposes visitation,the statute must be construed to require grandparents to show by clear and convincing evidence that the parent decision would be detrimental to the child.we do not reach the constitutional challenges based on the right to privacy.
factual and procedural background 
butler met charles erik harris in october while she was in the navy.they were married on january.butler claimed harris was emotionally and physically abusive to her,and on october,they separated later that year,butler gave birth to their daughter,emily.
on july,the trial court,per stipulation of the parties,granted butler sole legal and physical custody of emily,following the recommendation of a clinical psychologist appointed by the court.the stipulation also provided that butler could permanently move to maryland with emily on or after august.harris was to have supervised visitation contingent on his undergoing psychotherapy,drug testing and enrollment in narcotics anonymous.
on august,harris parents,charles,and leanne harris the harrises or grandparents,were joined as parties to the action after stipulating they would not interfere with butler scheduled move to maryland.on november,by stipulated order,the trial court granted grandparents visitation in maryland.grandparents were granted four visits during,six visits during,and six visits during.none of the visitations was to be an overnight visit unless butler and grandparents mutually agreed.
grandparents visited emily in maryland in november,january and april.grandparents and butler disagreed over whether grandparents should be allowed to have unsupervised visitation with emily away from butler home.on april,butler filed an order to show cause seeking to terminate grandparents visitation rights.
on october,the trial court declined to terminate grandparents visitation,finding they are entitled to continue their right under the law and under the court existing orders to have visitation with their granddaughter,emily.the court modified the existing order to allow grandparents a maximum of four visits per year,with the first two days of each visit to take place in butler home or a mutually agreed place to be followed with visitation during the remaining days.the court also ordered butler and grandparents not to disparage each other or in any way convey their beliefs and attitudes regarding this case to emily.
in november,grandparents attempted to arrange a visit with emily the following month but were unable to contact butler.when grandparents arrived in maryland on december,butler and emily were no longer living there.butler had moved to utah,where she married mark butler,a widower with six children,in.
eventually,through the services of private investigators,grandparents were able to locate butler and emily in brigham city,utah.grandparents successfully sought to have butler found in contempt of court for failing to comply with court orders to keep grandparents advised at all times of her address and telephone number and to allow grandparents visitation with emily on december.the court ordered butler to pay grandparents for their attorney fees and expenses in connection with the contempt proceeding.
on february,grandparents sought to modify the visitation order to allow overnight visitation and visitation in california.on may,the trial court issued an order providing 
until the child starts public school,the paternal grandparents shall have four weeks with the child.the first week to occur after this hearing shall occur at a place selected by the paternal grandparents within the state of utah.the child shall have overnights with the grandparents 
all subsequent visits with the paternal grandparents may occur at the grandparents home in san diego county.either of the grandparents or another adult familiar to the child shall travel with the child to and from the grandparents residence in san diego county.
as emily approached school age,grandparents efforts to work out a new visitation plan with butler were unsuccessful as butler wanted to await the results of the troxel case then pending in the united states supreme court.
on may,grandparents sought modification of the visitation order to allow them two weeks during august,one week during year,one week during easter and one week in june.grandparents also sought relief from having to travel to utah to pick up emily and permission to take emily out of state and to other areas of california to visit paternal relatives.
during the mediation conference,butler acknowledged emily enjoys spending time with grandparents and there is a significant emotional attachment.butler said she did not intend to prevent grandparents from having contact with emily but does not want the court to order visitation.grandparents believed a court order is the only way to assure their contact with emily.in recommending the court continue grandparents visitation,the mediator stated he believed the minor benefits from contact with the paternal grandparents and that it is in her best interest to continue to have contact with them.the mediator also said grandparents have gone through extraordinary lengths to establish and maintain a relationship with the minor.
in a responsive declaration to grandparents modification motion,butler asked for an end to visitation,stating it is disruptive and intrusive to the butler family.butler said the visits to california uprooted emily from her new family,and the grandparents excessive hindered butler efforts to integrate emily into the family 
grandparents did not submit any declarations,but through counsel argued it is in emily best interest not to cut off her relationship with them grandparents love and adore their grandchild,with whom they have had significant contact since birth.further,they have taken extraordinary steps and have demonstrated a great commitment to having a relationship with emily.
the trial court found butler request for an end to visitation was properly before it.however,the court ruled in favor of grandparents,finding that based upon the circumstances of this case it is in the best interests of the minor child that the p aternal g randparents continue to be involved with their minor grandchild.the court specified the following visitation for grandparents days in august of each year days in june of each year,and from december to december of each year.the court also ruled beginning in december,grandparents do not have to accompany emily on her airplane flights between utah and san diego,and grandparents may take emily to visit other relatives in out of california 
the court said it firmly believed emily will be better off having a relationship with grandparents,who have demonstrated remarkable tenacity in the face of little or no cooperation.the court went on 
i ca remember grandparents who have gone to the extremes that they have to maintain a relationship with the child.i am sure the mother and relatives believe that their sole purpose is to aggravate her but that is what i believe here.i think,in part,it is to preserve what they feel is the harris heritage and to keep that alive with the child.i also think they truly love this child and they care about the child and they want to continue to have that relationship and that it is very important to them.
i think presently,at least,that it is in the best interest of this child to continue to have a significant relationship with the grandparents so i do agree by the way there is any realistic possibility that if i leave this to the mother good graces,essentially as the parent,that she would do anything to encourage the relationship in spite of what she says.her actions are absolutely contrary to that 
the court acknowledged the visitation creates practical problems for the butler family,but concluded the difficulties did not justify cutting off grandparents visitation.the court said 
i understand all the problems with the pregnancy,with the unity of the family and all of the things that the mother has expressed.they are valid,practical problems that are raised by having a continued relationship with the father or his family for this child.i just think that the rewards for the child are greater than any deficits that we have.
discussion 
background 
we begin by noting the obvious.in the vast majority of families,grandparents are actively engaged in the lives of their grandchildren,providing beneficial and nurturing guidance in a variety of roles that have the approval and support of the grandchildren parents.thus,conflicts over grandparent visitation requiring court intervention are not typical.they do arise,however,when relationships between grandparents and their children children spouses go awry.consequently,as noted by the supreme court in troxel,supra,at pages.fn,all states have enacted legislation allowing grandparents to petition for visitation with their grandchildren.
in recent years,the parents of grandchildren have challenged the constitutionality of these statutes in a number of states.see,king king hawk hawk brooks parkerson,campbell campbell utah app.most notably,one such lawsuit reached the united states supreme court troxel,supra,d,in which a plurality of the high court found application of a state of washington nonparental visitation statute unconstitutionally infringed on the mother fundamental rights as a parent.
troxel granville 
in troxel,the parents of the deceased father of two children were granted increased visitation pursuant to an order issued under washington nonparental visitation statute,which allows any person to petition the court for visitation rights at any time and provides visitation rights may be granted to any person when it may serve the child best interest the children mother had wanted to limit the paternal grandparents visitation to once a month however,the trial court found more extensive visitation with the grandparents was in the children best interest even though there were no allegations or findings that the mother was an unfit parent.troxel,supra,at.at.
a plurality of the united states supreme court found the washington statute,as applied,unconstitutional because of the sweeping breadth of the statute and the application of that broad,unlimited power in this case.troxel,supra,at.at.the breathtakingly broad language of the statute in effect allows any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent children to review.id.at.at.yet the statute does not require a court to give a parent decision concerning visitation any presumption of validity or any weight whatsoever,leaving it exclusively to the judge to determine the best interest of the child.ibid.should the judge disagree with the parent estimation of the child best interests,the judge view necessarily prevails.thus,in practical effect,in the state of washington a court can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation based solely on the judge determination of the child best interests.ibid.
the plurality faulted the trial court for not according any special weight to the mother determination of the children best interest and for presuming the grandparents request for visitation should be granted absent any adverse impact.troxel,supra,at.at.the plurality said the trial court effectively and erroneously had assigned to the mother the burden of disproving visitation would be in the best interest of her children,rather than properly requiring the grandparents to establish by some method that,in disallowing visitation,the mother was not acting in the best interest of her children.ibid.the decisional framework employed by trial court directly contravened the traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.ibid.
in considering nonparental visitation petitions,troxel teaches that courts must presume that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.troxel,supra,at.at.accordingly,so long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children,is fit,there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent children.id.at pp.at.
troxel further requires a court hearing a grandparent visitation case to give special weight to a parent determination on what is in his or her child best interest.troxel,supra,at.at.
in an ideal world,parents might always seek to cultivate the bonds between grandparents and their grandchildren.needless to say,however,our world is far from perfect,and in it the decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance.and,if a fit parent decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review,the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent own determination.id.at.at.
however,the high court narrow holding left several issues unresolved.the plurality declined to decide whether a showing of harm or potential harm is required before nonparental visitation can be ordered.troxel,supra,at.at.although calling for deference or special weight to be given to a parent decision regarding his or her child visitation,troxel does not spell out exactly how much deference is required it did not announce the standard of review that should be applied in protecting the parent liberty interest in visitation matters.id.at pp.at.thus,by implication,troxel abstained from applying the strict scrutiny standard of review usually utilized when a state action infringes on enjoyment of a fundamental right 
finally,troxel teaches courts should be cautious before declaring nonparental visitation per se unconstitutional.notwithstanding the breathtakingly broad language of the washington statute,the plurality chose not to declare the statute unconstitutional on its face.as the plurality noted,the constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the constitutional protections in this area are best elaborated with care.citation.because much adjudication in this context occurs on a basis,we would be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the due process clause as a per se matter.troxel,supra,at.at,fn.omitted.
the fundamental right to parent is constitutionally protected 
a parent right to raise his or her children without undue state interference is not specifically enumerated in the text of the united states constitution rather,the right stems from common law interpretations of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,which provides no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.
a parent fundamental liberty interest in the care,custody and control over his or her children is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.troxel,supra,at.at.it is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.ibid.at.
a long line of supreme court cases acknowledges the fundamental right of parents to raise their children as they see fit.in meyer nebraska,the united states supreme court held that 
w hile this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment,w ithout doubt,it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract,to engage in any of the common occupations of life,to acquire useful knowledge,to marry,establish a home and bring up children,to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience,and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.
the high court has reiterated the right of a parent to raise his or her children.in pierce society of the sisters of the holy names of jesus and mary,the supreme court voided a law that prohibited parents from choosing private education over public schooling for their children,reasoning the law would unreasonably interfere with the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.the high court further noted that the child is not the mere creature of the state those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right,coupled with the high duty,to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.id.at.at.in wisconsin yoder,d the supreme court,on the basis of first amendment protections and the fundamental interest of parents,as contrasted with that of the state,upheld the right of amish parents to withdraw their children from public schools after the eighth grade in order to educate them according to the amish beliefs.id.at.at.the court noted the history and culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children.this primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring american tradition.id.at.at.
by contrast,there is no fundamental liberty interest afforded to grandparents.
to bypass the common law tradition that basic decisions regarding family contact lie with the parents,grandparents have turned to legislatures throughout the country to pass laws providing for grandparent visitation.
california grandparent visitation statute 
section,the statute at issue here,specifically grants grandparents the right to petition for visitation of their grandchildren under certain circumstances 
a grandparent right to visitation is purely statutory.white jacobs d.the number and specificity of statutes providing for adjudication of grandparents rights of visitation belie any general or inherent rights of grandparents or authority of superior courts to mandate visitation with a grandchild over that child parents objection.
section requires a preexisting relationship between the grandparent and the grandchild that has engendered a bond such that visitation is in the best interest of the child and directs the court to b alance the interest of the child in having visitation with the grandparent against the right of the parents to exercise their parental authority,subd.a.the statute further provides there is a rebuttable presumption that grandparent visitation is not in the best interest of the child if the parent objects to the visitation,subds.e f.
ii.facial challenges to the constitutionality of section 
in considering the constitutionality of a statute,we presume its validity,resolving all doubts in favor of its constitutionality unless there is a clear and unquestionable conflict with a provision of the state or federal constitutions.clare state bd.of accountancy th,d.thus,wherever possible,we will interpret a statute as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions,seeking to harmonize constitution and statute.california housing finance agency elliott cal d.
is section on its face violative of federal constitution 
in light of troxel,a facial challenge to section under the federal due process clause can not succeed.section is much more narrowly drawn and offers far more protection for parental autonomy and liberty than the washington statute,which the troxel plurality declined to strike down as per se unconstitutional.
instead of allowing any person to seek visitation,section is not only limited to grandparents but to grandparents who have a preexisting relationship with the grandchild that has engendered a bond such that visitation is in the best interest of the child,subd.a.instead of allowing petitions at any time,section limits grandparent petitions to defined circumstances,subd.b.thus,california legislature,in section,has properly chosen to minimize the occasions in which a child must be exposed to conflicts.lopez martinez th,d.
significantly,instead of the washington statutory test of whether visitation may serve the best interest of the child,which gives a judge opinions equal or more weight than the parent views,section provides deference to parental autonomy by setting forth a rebuttable presumption that visitation is not in the best interest of the child,subds.e f.these provisions at least implicitly recognize the presumption that fit parents act in their children best interest.troxel,supra,at.at.in cases such as this one,where the parent with sole legal and physical custody objects to grandparent visitation,section provides for a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that the visitation of a grandparent is not in the best interest of a minor child,subd.f.this provision places upon the grandparents the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact that is,when the parent objects,the grandparents have the evidentiary burden of showing visitation is not contrary to the child best interest.see.
finally,section allows courts to give special deference to parental autonomy by directing the court to b alance the interest of the child in having visitation against the right of the parents to exercise their parental authority,subd.a.this provision gives courts flexibility in assessing the merits of grandparents visitation petitions,which is in keeping with the teachings of troxel.t he constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on the specific manner in which that standard is applied and the constitutional protections in this area are best elaborated with care.troxel,supra,at.at.
the united states supreme court has final authority on the interpretation of the federal constitution and the constitutionality of any law under the constitution.united states reynolds,brook city of oakland cal.given the unwillingness of the troxel plurality to invalidate the far broader and less protective washington nonparental visitation statute on its face,we decline to find section per se violates a parent federal due process rights.
is section on its face violative of california constitution 
however,we are not constrained from imposing higher standards in interpreting a statute under our state constitution.committee to defend reproductive rights myers cal d.our state constitution is a document of independent force subject to independent interpretation by state courts.see cal.const.art.i,rights guaranteed by this constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the united states constitution people chavez cal d.the state right to impose higher constitutional standards than those required under the united states constitution can not be seriously questioned.people brisendine cal d.
parents have the right to raise their children without undue state interference not only under the united states constitution they enjoy parallel protection under our state constitution.a parent fundamental liberty interest is protected by the california constitution,specifically,article i,section,which provides all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness and privacy.
california courts recognize parenting is a protected fundamental right.see in re carmaleta cal d,odell lutz d.accordingly,our state courts are reluctant to interfere in family matters absent a compelling need.in re marriage of mentry d.under california law,a child welfare must be threatened before the state may intervene in parental.the critical importance in california of the right to parent has been reaffirmed and reaffirmed.citations.it only gives way upon a showing of parental unfitness,detrimental to the child welfare.in re marriage of jenkens d.a showing of harm or potential harm is constitutionally required to justify governmental interference with child rearing.in re cal d.against this backdrop,we evaluate section.
as previously discussed,section does not allow a court to grant grandparent visitation solely upon a finding that it is in the best interest of the child the statute also provides for a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that such visitation is not in the best interest if the custodial parent objects to visitation,subd.f.the issue for us is whether the additional deference to parental supplied by subdivision f is sufficient to satisfy the fundamental liberty interest of parents under our state constitution.as we shall explain,we conclude it is sufficient to pass constitutional muster provided subdivision f is read to require clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer harm if visitation is not ordered.such a quantum of proof and a finding of detriment are necessary before a statutory right can infringe upon a fundamental liberty interest.
in reaching this conclusion,we are guided by the consistent approach of california courts in recognizing the primacy of parental rights.california law reflects a policy of parental preference in adjudicating the competing rights of parents and third parties,who assert an interest in the parents child.see,parents given top priority in order of preference for granting custody.one court has explained the policy rationale 
this attitude is predicated,inter alia,on the recognition that a court can not regulate by its processes the internal affairs of the home the vast majority of matters concerning the upbringing of children must be left to the conscience,patience,and self restraint of father and mother.no end of difficulties would arise if judges try to tell parents how to bring up their children.citations.in re marriage of mentry,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
in the area of visitation,custody cases provide useful guidance.because visitation is a limited form of custody during the time the visitation rights are being exercised in re marriage of gayden d,the conclusions reached in custody cases are relevant to visitation issues.just as a custody decision that is rendered contrary to the wishes of parents impacts parental authority,judicially compelled visitation against the wishes of both parents can significantly affect parental authority and the strength of the family unit.ibid.
custody cases are particularly instructive when one compares the rationale applied in cases where parents oppose each other versus disputes between a parent and a nonparent.whereas the paramount consideration in a dispute between parents is the best interest of the child,a far different emphasis applies when a parent and a nonparent vie for custody.in such cases,an award can not be made to the nonparent unless the court finds an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.in re,supra,cal d at.a parent,if not found unfit,has a natural and paramount right to custody as against a third party.roche roche cal d,in re,supra,cal d at.
in keeping with the state policy of parental preference,before making an order granting custody to a nonparent without the parents consent,a court must make a finding granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the child best interest.as earlier cases make clear,such findings are required to prevent impermissible intrusions into parent by fit parents.
likewise,given the strong interest in protecting the fundamental right of parenting,findings in support of a nonparental custody order over a parent objection must be based on clear and convincing evidence.guardianship of phillip d.guardianship of stephen th,d guardianship of jenna th,d guardianship of olivia th,d,but see guardianship of diana th,d.
in in re marriage of peters th,d,the court of appeal explained why there are differing burdens of proof 
the degree of burden of proof applied in a particular situation is an expression of the degree of confidence society wishes to require of the resolution of a of question fact.citation.the burden of proof thus serves to allocate the risk of error between the parties,and varies in proportion to the gravity of the consequences of an erroneous resolution.citations.preponderance of the evidence results in the roughly equal sharing of the risk of error.citation.to impose any higher burden of proof demonstrates a preference for one side interests.citation.generally,facts are subject to a higher burden of proof only where particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake 
when constitutional issues are at stake,a heightened evidentiary standard is mandated.see,in re marriage of murga d.custody decision can not be based on parent religious practices absent clear affirmative showing of harm see also conservatorship of wendland cal th,d,people englebrecht th,d.
persuaded by the reasoning applied in custody disputes,particularly those between parents and nonparents,and mindful that the right to parent is fundamental,we hold that to comply with article i,section,the rebuttable presumption set forth in section,subdivision f must be read to require clear and convincing evidence that the child will suffer harm or potential harm if visitation is not ordered.when a fit parent objects to visitation,the grandparent must bear the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the parent decision regarding visitation would be detrimental to the child.this is so because a parent decision regarding whether a a visit with his or her children is a basic component of parents fundamental interest in the care,custody and control of their children and requires heightened protection.deciding when,under what conditions,and with whom their children may associate is among the most important rights and responsibilities of parents.hoff berg,see also lulay lulay.before the state can usurp the role of fit parents and compel visitation,there initially must be a strong showing of harm or potential harm.
because the constitutional right of parents to care for their children as they see fit is afforded more protection than the statutory right to visitation of grandparents,it is appropriate to require the higher evidentiary standard of clear and convincing evidence under section.any conflict between parents constitutional rights and grandparents statutory rights must be reconciled in favor of the preservation of the parents fundamental liberty interest absent a compelling showing of detriment or potential detriment.
before the state can override a fit parent child rearing decisions,something more than preponderance of the evidence is called for.a preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate when society has a minimal concern with the outcome of the litigation,as in a suit for money damages.lillian superior court d.but when a constitutional right is at stake,a significant quantum of proof must be required to afford adequate protection of that right.otherwise,we risk having a court substitute its own views for those of a fit parent.by mandating a grandparent to show by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence that a fit parent decision against visitation would be detrimental to the child,we are precluding a court from overriding a parent child rearing decision merely on the basis of the court contrary view.as this court recently observed in punsly ho th,d,giving deference to the parent view of the child best interest only when the court agrees with the parent does not protect the parent constitutional interests at all.see also troxel,supra,at.t he due process clause does
