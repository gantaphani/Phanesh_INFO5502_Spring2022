discussion 
psychotherapist patient privilege 
mother contends the trial court erred in disclosing her confidential psychotherapist records to the department and,impliedly,in permitting admission of those records into the trial record.the department counters the records were statutorily disclosable pursuant to section,subdivisions f and l.moreover,the department maintains mother waived any privilege by contesting the allegations against her and revealing substantial portions of her treatment.it is apparent the trial court,the parties below,and the parties on appeal have conflated the difference between disclosure of privileged records and admissibility of such records.
we hold that separate analyses must be made to determine whether privileged records are,on the first hand,disclosable to the opposing party.once disclosure has been deemed appropriate,the proponent has the additional burden of proving the admissibility of such records into the trial record.here,we hold the trial court erred in failing to conduct an in camera review of mother psychotherapist records in order to determine if it was even appropriate or necessary to disclose the records to the department,in whole or in part,especially considering much of the content of those records already existed in nonprivileged documents contained in other documents in the record.we furthermore find that,even to the extent that disclosure of the entirety of the documents to the department was appropriate,the court erred in permitting the department to include both the records themselves and the content of those records in the department reports in the trial record without any further evaluation 
our supreme court has consistently recognized the public interest in supporting effective treatment of mental illness and the consequent public importance of safeguarding the confidential character of psychotherapeutic communication.citations.citation.at the time the privilege was adopted,it was noted psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are dependent upon the fullest revelation of the most intimate and embarrassing details of the patient life unless a patient is assured that such information can and will be held in utmost confidence,he will be reluctant to make the full disclosure upon which diagnosis and treatment depends.citation.san diego trolley,superior court th,d trolley.
crucial to psychotherapeutic treatment is a patient readiness to reveal his thoughts,dreams,fantasies,sins and shame.it would be unreasonable to expect a patient to freely participate in such treatment if he knew that what he said and what the therapist learned from what he said could all be revealed in court.a patient in therapy has and needs a justifiable expectation of confidentiality as to his psychotherapeutic treatment.citation.in re eduardo,supra,d at.
when a parent is afflicted with an illness or disability which may affect the welfare of the child,the confidentiality of communication with a therapist may encourage the parent to seek treatment,and may permit a kind of treatment otherwise impossible we must assume the legislature weighed these considerations in defining the scope of the relevant privileges.in re d.
the privilege covers not only confidential communication,but any communication made in confidence between the patient and his psychotherapist.the privilege extends even to communications that have lost their confidential nature due to broad disclosure by the patient himself.the patient likewise has the privilege to refuse to disclose or prevent another from disclosing such communications.trolley,supra,th at,d.
of course the privilege may be waived when the patient voluntarily discloses otherwise confidential information or tenders her mental state as an issue.citations.however,t he waiver of an important right must be a voluntary and knowing act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.citation.trolley,supra,th at,d.even where a patient has waived her privilege,such waiver must be narrowly construed and limited to matters as to which,based upon the patient disclosures,it can reasonably be said the patient no longer retains a privacy interest.citation.ibid.
moreover,notwithstanding a waiver,any disclosure of confidential or private information must be supported by a showing of compelling need and accomplished in a manner which protects,insofar as is practical,the patient privacy.citation.trolley,supra,th at,d.thus,even where such evidence is disclosed pursuant to an ostensible waiver,the trial court should exercise its discretion in excluding any such evidence at trial unless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the harm that may be caused by public disclosure.id.at,d see in re lifschutz cal d.
section disclosure 
section provides that a ll information and records obtained in the course of providing services commencing with section to either voluntary or involuntary recipients of services shall be confidential.thus,all information,records,and services provided pursuant to section involuntary psychiatric holds are confidential.nonetheless,section,subdivision f provides that such i nformation and records shall be disclosed only t o the courts,as necessary to the administration of justice.similarly,section,subdivision l provides that t he information and records sought to be disclosed shall be relevant to the provision of child welfare services or the investigation,prevention,identification,management,or treatment of child abuse or neglect as used in this subdivision,child welfare services means those services that are directed at preventing child abuse or neglect,subd.l.
welfare and institutions code section states a limitation on disclosure,not a ground for admissibility of evidence.in re,supra,d at.thus,evidence which may be disclosed pursuant to the statute does not automatically make that evidence admissible at trial.the proponent seeking admission of the disclosed,privileged evidence at trial has the additional burden of proving that it comes within some statutorily or exception to the privilege.ibid.
here,the department did not request disclosure of the privileged documents pursuant either to section,subdivisions f or l.moreover,the department did not seek disclosure of the privileged documents to the court as provided for in section,subdivision f.rather,the department sought disclosure of the privileged documents to itself.thus,section,subdivision f is not at all applicable in the instant case t he plain language of the exception to confidentiality contained in subdivision f of section says that information and records may be disclosed to the courts,not to an administrative agency through the courts.county of riverside superior court d,italics omitted.to construe the limited exception contained in subdivision f of section as permitting disclosure to any person or agency whenever a court determined it was necessary to the administration of justice would tend to nullify the broad legislative provision for confidentiality and would tend to stultify the legislative purpose ibid.
similarly,section,subdivision l is inapplicable in the current situation,because the department did not seek disclosure of the documents for the purpose of investigation,prevention,identification,management,or treatment of child abuse or neglect.rather,the department sought disclosure of the documents to prove its jurisdictional case.the clear language of the section,subdivision l exception reflects an intent to disclose such documents for the purpose of aiding the department or other such entities to provide services and treatment to the victim and offender it does not exist to provide an evidentiary basis with which to permit the department to prove its case,particularly not at the jurisdictional phase.
the petitioner in a dependency proceeding must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child who is the subject of a petition comes under the juvenile court jurisdiction.citation the basic question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.citation.in re th,d.
here,the court asked mother counsel how are you going to prove that mother does have a mental health issue without your client testifying and getting up on the stand,evidentiar l y and saying i have no
