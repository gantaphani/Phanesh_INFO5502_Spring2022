introduction 
following the entry of the judgment dissolving their marriage,park dietz and laura dietz entered into a stipulated judgment in,in which they divided their community property,including their retirement accounts,and agreed park would pay laura monthly spousal support.in,park sought a court order terminating or,alternatively,reducing his spousal support obligation.
after the hearing,the trial court found that a material change of circumstances had occurred since the stipulated judgment because laura had reached an age at which she could access her share of the retirement accounts without penalty and she had realized appreciation in securities securities she owned the court ordered park monthly spousal support obligation be reduced,and denied laura request that park contribute toward her attorney fees and costs.
laura contends the trial court erred by reducing park spousal support obligation because no material change of circumstances had occurred to warrant such a modification.she also challenges the trial court denial of her request for attorney fees and costs.
we reverse.as discussed in detail,post,the trial court erred by concluding the accessibility and increased value of the retirement accounts awarded to laura in the stipulated judgment constituted a material change of circumstances justifying a decrease in park monthly spousal support obligation.the stipulated judgment expressly awarded laura and park equal shares of the retirement accounts and any increase in their values.although park income had significantly increased and laura remained unemployed since the stipulated judgment,the trial court reduced park monthly spousal support obligation based on the accessibility and value of the retirement accounts.we hold laura rights to access the retirement accounts on a basis and to any increase in their values were insufficient,without more,to constitute a material change of circumstances permitting a reduction in her spousal support under family code section.all further statutory references are to the family code.
in determining whether to award attorney fees and costs in postdissolution proceedings,the trial court must consider how to apportion the overall cost of the litigation equitably between the parties under their relative circumstances.in re marriage of terry th,d.the trial court did not order park to pay any of laura attorney fees and costs because park had sought the termination or reduction of spousal support in good faith and both parties had access to quality legal assistance.because the court applied an incorrect standard in considering laura request for attorney fees and costs,we remand the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of laura request.

of dissolution stipulated judgment stipulated judgment

in october,park and laura entered into a stipulation to modify the stipulated judgment by striking its references to laura award of the fidelity investments accounts and a mutual fund ira and park fidelity blue chip growth ira account.the parties further stipulated to modify the portions of the stipulated judgment addressing the division of certain retirement accounts to state,as modified,the following each party is awarded of the community interest in the retirement plans accumulated by the parties during the marriage,including any and all contributions made from may,up to september,and any increase or decrease in value of such assets related to market conditions.any contributions made by either party before may,subsequent to september,and any on such contributions shall be deemed to be the sole and separate property of the party who has made the contribution such retirement plans will be divided pursuant to qualified domestic relations orders.each party shall pay own attorney fees related to the preparation of such qualified domestic relations orders.the stipulation modified language further stated,s aid retirement plans consist of tiaa cref retirement annuities,a vanguard plan account,certain fidelity keogh brokerage accounts,a fidelity investments mutual fund ira account,a fidelity investments brokerage keogh profit sharing account,and a fidelity ira account.the stipulation to modify the stipulated judgment was accepted by the trial court.
laura order to show cause seeking division of parties retirement accounts park order to show cause seeking termination or reduction of spousal support obligation 
in may,laura filed an order to show cause seeking the actual division of the parties retirement accounts.laura contended,f or several years i have been trying to get park to divide our pension assets.he refuses to do so.park filed a responsive declaration stating his agreement to an order effecting the immediate division of the retirement accounts and requiring laura counsel to obtain the financial records necessary for the division.
in august,park filed an order to show cause seeking the termination of his spousal support obligation under the stipulated judgment.park sought alternative relief,as follows if the court is not inclined to immediately terminate spousal support,then park requests that the court e stablish a hearing and discovery schedule so that this matter may be heard on an expedited basis,and to include live testimony or,in the alternative,order a step down schedule that forces laura to begin supporting herself based on her earning capacity and takes into account her income from assets and other investments,with an ultimate termination of spousal support.
the hearing on the orders to show cause took place in may.at the beginning of the hearing,park and laura agreed to the entry of another stipulated judgment which resolved the issue of their undivided retirement accounts as follows investment accounts standing in the name of park elliot dietz,md,at fidelity investments shall be awarded to laura dietz as a full and final community property distribution of the community assets held by the parties during their marriage.the stipulated judgment further stated,t hese distributions of investment retirement accounts are intended to be a tax free transfer of jointly owned assets to petitioner,laura dietz,incident to the judgment of dissolution and judgment on reserved issues dated april,and october,respect ive ly.finally,it stated,t he parties agree that with the entry of this judgment,there are no assets that remain undivided and neither party has any unresolved claims against the other regarding asset division.
the hearing resumed to resolve the sole remaining park spousal support obligation should be terminated or reduced.laura testified she was years old.she testified that during the marriage she had worked for park two businesses handling administrative matters.she has not been employed since.in,laura began suffering from symptoms of a respiratory illness that was diagnosed in as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis she had contracted the illness through the presence of fungus in the corona del mar residence that she had been awarded in the stipulated judgment.laura used money she had inherited from her mother toward the cost of remediating and renovating that residence.she also testified it was not medically advisable for her to go back to work.
park testified he was a forensic psychiatrist he acknowledged he earned percent more in than he had earned in.park stated,i would agree that it would appear that i have more than enough to pay laura spousal support.
trial court orders spousal support reduced laura appeals 
following the hearing,the court initially stated,at first glance the circumstances really do seem to be that much different from what they were in when the prior support order was entered.the court,however,explained it had found a material change of circumstances justifying a reexamination of the spousal support because based on a comparison of laura income and expense declarations for may and may,her marketable securities investment account increased by about and she has recently been allocated approximately in retirement assets and she has reached the age at which she can begin to use that retirement asset without penalty to provide for her support 
the trial court further stated it considered whether to terminate or modify park spousal support obligation by reweighing the factors set forth in section to determine a just and reasonable result under the facts and circumstances of this case.the court concluded that some of the relevant factors militate strongly in park favor in that laura has substantial assets.to put it simply,she is a wealthy woman.she has not less than million in assets,including a million un e ncumbered residence,in marketable securities,and in retirement assets although only million is liquid.the court stated laura substantial retirement assets were now accessible to her without penalty.although the court noted undisputed evidence that laura was unable to work due to her health condition,it also stated,g iven her assets,one could certainly conclude that she has every ability to be,even without going out into the workforce.certainly,with less than a million one would be expected to be,even if he or she were unable to work in the normal sense.the court found that laura needs were not greater at the time of trial than they were at the time the stipulated judgment was entered.
in laura favor,the court found the marriage was a marriage of approximately years the parties achieved an upper marital standard of living during the marriage laura was entitled,if the assets are available,to maintain the marital standard of living post dissolution and clearly,between the parties there are sufficient assets for both parties to maintain the marital standard of living post dissolution,now and into the foreseeable future.the court also found park income had increased since the stipulated judgment,and park enjoyed substantial tax savings as a result of the spousal support,because it is deductible from gross income.
having concluded laura was more than able to maintain the marital standard of living with less than the per month in spousal support that she has been receiving for the last several years,the trial court turned to the question of w hat reduction is appropriate 
the court stated,i n looking at just her increase since the date of judgment,that increase is not less than in marketable securities,in retirement assets.if one were to infer a reasonable return of percent,that would yield in income without invading the princip al.that,of course,is a month.the court ordered park monthly spousal support obligation be reduced by effective june,which the court concluded,need not have any effect on laura ability to maintain the marital standard of living.
the trial court also denied laura request that park pay her attorney fees and costs under section,stating,b oth parties here have equal access to quality legal services.the order to show cause re termination or reduction in spousal support was appropriate.it was brought in good faith.it was earnest.there just is any reason here to shift the burden of the attorney fees.
laura appealed.
discussion 
reverse the trial court order reducing spousal support.
laura contends the trial court erred by reducing park monthly spousal support obligation because there had been no material change of circumstances since the stipulated judgment to warrant such a reduction.we conclude the trial court erred by reducing spousal support.
general legal principles governing modifications of spousal support 
modification of spousal support,even if the prior amount is established by agreement,requires a material change of circumstances since the last order.citations.change of circumstances means a reduction or increase in the supporting spouse ability to pay an increase or decrease in the supported spouse needs.citations.it includes all factors affecting need and the ability to pay.in re marriage of mccann th,d.a trial court considering whether to modify a spousal support order considers the same criteria set forth in family code section as it considered in making the initial order.in re marriage of west th,d.
section provides 
in ordering spousal support under this part,the court shall consider all of the following circumstances 
a the extent to which the earning capacity of each party is sufficient to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage,taking into account all of the following 
the marketable skills of the supported party the job market for those skills the time and expenses required for the supported party to acquire the appropriate education or training to develop those skills and the possible need for retraining or education to acquire other,more marketable skills or employment.
the extent to which the supported party present or future earning capacity is impaired by periods of unemployment that were incurred during the marriage to permit the supported party to devote time to domestic duties.
b the extent to which the supported party contributed to the attainment of an education,training,a career position,or a license by the supporting party.
c the ability of the supporting party to pay spousal support,taking into account the supporting party earning capacity,earned and unearned income,assets,and standard of living.
d the needs of each party based on the standard of living established during the marriage.
e the obligations and assets,including the separate property,of each party.
f the duration of the marriage.

m the criminal conviction of an abusive spouse shall be considered in making a reduction or elimination of a spousal support award in accordance with section.
n any other factors the court determines are just and equitable.
standard of review 
appellate review of orders modifying spousal support is governed by an abuse of discretion standard,and such an abuse occurs when a court modifies a support order without substantial evidence of a material change of circumstances.in re marriage of mccann,supra,th at,d see in re marriage of west,supra,th at,d a spousal support order is modifiable only upon a material change of circumstances since the last order and w here there is no substantial evidence of a material change of circumstances,an order modifying a support order will be overturned for abuse of discretion in re marriage of smith d.absent a change of circumstances,a motion for modification is nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on a prior final order.so long as the court exercised its discretion along legal lines,its decision will not be reversed on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support it.in re marriage of biderman th,d.
the trial court was bound to give effect to the parties intent and reasonable expectations as expressed in the stipulated judgment.
a marital settlement agreement is a contract between the parties.citations.where the agreement permits modifications,those modifications require a showing of a change in circumstances.citations.moreover,in determining what constitutes a change in circumstances the trial court is bound to give effect to the intent and reasonable expectations of the parties as expressed in the agreement,and,thus,the trial court discretion to modify the spousal support order is constrained by the terms of the marital settlement agreement.in re marriage of aninger d.in in re marriage of norvall d,the appellate court held that evidence of income produced from a community property source awarded to the wife in a stipulated settlement agreement did not constitute substantial evidence of a material change of circumstances to justify a reduction in the husband spousal support obligation.
similarly,in in re marriage of rabkin d,the appellate court reversed an order reducing the husband spousal support obligation,stating in part we have concluded that none of these factors furnished a proper basis for the trial court per month reduction in wife permanent spousal support.as for the sale of the family residence and wife resulting right to receive approximately in monthly mortgage payments,such right constituted the single major asset awarded to wife as her share of the community property.the parties agreement,which was very carefully drafted by skilled attorneys,provided that wife would receive her share of the community property and spousal support.it makes no more sense to reduce wife spousal support because she received her rightful share of the community property than it would to increase wife spousal support because husband received his rightful share of the community property.in fact,husband testified that his pension plan,which was allegedly worth on the date of separation,was now worth between and.
here,the stipulated judgment constituted a similar marital settlement agreement.thus,in determining whether a material change of circumstances had occurred,necessary to support a modification of park spousal support obligation,the trial court was required to give effect to park and laura intent and reasonable expectations as expressed in the agreement.in re marriage of aninger,supra,d at.
the stipulated judgment reflects park and laura exchange through which they agreed how they would divide their assets,including their community property interests in the retirement accounts.the stipulated judgment expressly acknowledges park and laura expectations that the value of the subject retirement accounts might increase,stating that each party would receive of the community property interest in the retirement accounts,including any and all contributions made up to the date of separation,and any increase or decrease in value of such assets related to market conditions.italics added.the stipulated judgment,which modified portions of the stipulated judgment,again expressly stated that each party was awarded of the community property interest in the retirement accounts and retained the language,including any increase or decrease in value of such assets related to market conditions.necessarily included in this express division of the retirement accounts was the parties reasonable expectations that they both would reach the age at which they could access such accounts without a penalty 
the stipulated judgment also reflects the parties expectations as to spousal support.they agreed park would pay laura in monthly spousal support until park death,laura death,laura remarriage,or by further order of the court.the stipulated judgment further stated,t he support in this case was based upon laura having no income,and park having income in the sum of per month.the stipulated judgment did not in any way suggest the parties expected that spousal support,or any modification thereof,would be based on the value of the parties community property assets divided therein.
in light of the parties reasonable expectations as expressed in the stipulated judgment and reiterated in the stipulated judgment,we turn to consider whether a material change of circumstance surfaced to support the reduction of park spousal support obligation.the trial court concluded a material change of circumstances had occurred because laura share of the community property interest in the retirement accounts was now accessible to her without penalty and was valued at,and laura owned securities that had increased in value by.
but as discussed ante,the accessibility and possible increase in value of laura share of the retirement accounts were part of the parties expressed reasonable expectations in entering the stipulated judgment and can not constitute a material change of circumstances on these facts.the stipulated judgment provided that laura would receive half of the community property interest in the retirement accounts and spousal support,and further expressly stated spousal support was based on the parties respective incomes.it is undisputed park income had significantly increased since the stipulated judgment and laura was unable to work due to her medical condition.
furthermore,the record shows laura and park actually divided their interest in the retirement accounts at the hearing in this case and each received an equal interest valued at in retirement accounts at that time.park testified that,given his ability to pay,he would have no problem paying the,existing spousal support.on these facts,the trial court conclusion that a material change of circumstances had occurred,based on the accessibility and value of laura share of the retirement accounts constituted error.accord,in re marriage of norvall,supra,d.in re marriage of rabkin,supra,d.
as to the trial court finding that a material change of circumstances had occurred based on the appreciation of laura securities,the record is unclear whether laura was awarded those securities through the stipulated judgment.in the opening brief,laura contends the securities were part of the stipulated judgment,and park does not refute this assertion in the respondent brief.if laura was awarded the securities in the stipulated judgment as part of her share of the community property assets through the parties exchange,the appreciation of such securities would be within the parties reasonable expectations in entering into the stipulated judgment.because the record is unclear whether the securities were part of the stipulated judgment,we remand to the trial court to determine whether the securities were awarded through the stipulated judgment,and if so,to apply the same standards explained,ante.if the trial court concludes those securities were not awarded to laura through the stipulated judgment,the court may reconsider whether a material change of circumstances sufficient to justify a reduction in spousal support has occurred.
the trial court consideration of the factors set forth in section in determining whether to reduce spousal support did not support a reduction of spousal support.
in the respondent brief,park argues the trial court did not rely solely on the accessibility and value of the retirement accounts in determining that a change of circumstances had occurred,but reached that conclusion only after it undertook the required reweighing of the section factors.as we will explain,the record does not contain evidence supporting any factor which shows a material change of circumstances had occurred that would warrant depriving laura of the benefit of the bargain she made with park in the stipulated judgment.
after concluding a material change of circumstances had occurred,based on the accessibility and value of the retirement accounts and the appreciation of the securities laura owned,the trial court considered whether a reduction in spousal support would be appropriate by reweighing the factors set forth in section.the trial court did not consider factors that ha d no relevant evidence in this record and so ca be specifically factored into the analysis.
the trial court considered that the parties marriage was a marriage of approximately years.see,subd.f duration of marriage.the court found laura testimony about her health condition and her inability to work was unrebutted.thus,factors involving her earning capacity,marketable skills,and any expectation of her becoming within a reasonable period of time through employment did not support a reduction in spousal support.see,subds.a,l.although laura inherited about from her mother after the stipulated judgment,that money had been used to substantially renovate the corona del mar residence after the discovery of a mold infestation and was not available to use for her support.see,subd.e.no evidence was presented showing that laura had received any other separate property after the parties agreed to the stipulated judgment.
the trial court also observed the parties had achieved an upper marital standard of living during the marriage,and between the parties there are sufficient assets for both parties to maintain the marital standard of living post dissolution,now and into the foreseeable future.indeed,the trial court found park monthly income had increased by about percent since the stipulated judgment.see,subd.c supporting spouse ability to pay spousal support.the court found that park does enjoy substantial tax savings as a result of the spousal support,because it is deductible from gross income.see,subd.j.
as to laura obligations and assets,subd.e,the trial court found the majority of laura assets,namely,the family residence,were illiquid and further found that laura had not mismanaged her assets.as to laura needs,subd.d,the court stated laura needs today are no greater than they were at the time of the judgment in order for her to maintain the marital standard of living.although the court did not find laura needs had decreased,the trial court commented,i t could be argued,and,in fact,park did argue persuasively that her needs may be somewhat less,because her only child has now reached the age of majority,has concluded his education,and is.but no evidence was presented showing to what extent laura need for spousal support might have decreased after their son reached the age of majority and park monthly child support obligation had terminated.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,to,stating a custodial parent is commonly awarded lower spousal support in exchange for higher child support.as the court did not rely on a decrease in laura needs as a factor for reducing spousal support,we do not further address it.
the key finding the trial court relied on in balancing the section factors was the same finding the court initially relied upon in determining that a material change of circumstances had occurred in the first laura,given the assets she was provided in the stipulated judgment,and the accessibility and appreciation of such assets since the stipulated judgment,should be expected to be more.as discussed,ante,the court conclusion that a material change of circumstances occurred based on this finding,without more,was erroneous.the court reliance on this finding is further illustrated by its calculation of the reduction of park spousal support obligation.in so calculating the spousal support obligation,the trial court added the value of laura share of the community property interest in the retirement accounts to the amount her share of the securities had appreciated for a total of imputed a reasonable return of percent on the that would yield in income without invading the princip al and divided the by months to determine that spousal support should be reduced by per month.
furthermore,no evidence was presented at the hearing to support the trial court decision to impute a percent return on those assets.in rejecting park request that the trial court gradually terminate spousal support through a order,the court acknowledged the dearth of evidence on this point,stating there was no evidence given with respect to the return that one could expect to achieve on the retirement account the rate at which one would be expected,given laura age and other factors,to use that asset how long it could be expected to last what would be a reasonable amount for her to withdraw based upon actuarial data and so on.so there is no record here based upon which the court could conclude any particular schedule on which she would use her retirement assets and enable the court to make an order stepping down spousal support in the future.so i not going to do that.see in re marriage of kennedy d.the court may not ascribe an arbitrary and theoretical rate of return on assets.
thus,the trial court order reducing park spousal support obligation,based on its consideration of the section factors on this record,constituted error.
in re marriage of schmir 
the trial court stated it heavily relied on in re marriage of schmir th,d schmir,stating that case really does seem to be directly on point here.in schmir,the trial court found three material changes of circumstances had occurred since the parties entered a marital settlement agreement requiring the husband to pay in monthly spousal support the wife was presently employable as a licensed clinical social worker the wife monthly medical expenses had decreased from to and the wife was eligible to withdraw funds from her retirement account without penalty.id.at,d.
the wife in schmir,supra,th at page,d,argued on appeal,inter alia,that her ability to make withdrawals from her retirement account is not a change in circumstances because the parties must have contemplated when they entered into their support agreement in the wife would reach the age when she could begin making withdrawals from the account without penalty.therefore her reaching the requisite age is not a change in circumstance but merely an aspect of the same circumstance existing at the time of the original support order in.the appellate court rejected the wife argument,stating,a dopting the wife line of reasoning would mean that as a matter of law the supporting spouse attainment of retirement age could never constitute a change of circumstance for purposes of a motion to modify a support order,italics added.citing in re marriage of reynolds th,d and the cases cited therein,the appellate court stated numerous appellate court decisions have rejected such a result even though the parties in those cases clearly contemplated the supporting spouse would one day reach the age when he or she could legitimately retire.schmir,supra,th at,d.
we agree with schmir that a supporting spouse attainment of retirement age may constitute a material change of circumstances
