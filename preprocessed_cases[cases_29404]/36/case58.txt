this case poses a question of first impression should compensation awarded for lost during an employee successful pursuit of a grievance count as hours of service within the meaning of the family and medical leave act fmla,the district court answered this question in the negative and,accordingly,entered judgment in favor of the employer we affirm.
background 
we present the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment here,the plaintiff,consistent with record support.see mcintosh antonino,cir.
in february of,southern container,sci hired john plumley to work at its plant in westbrook,maine.throughout his tenure,plumley was part of a bargaining unit represented by local of the united paperworkers international union the union.at all times relevant hereto,sci and the union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement the cba that included a standard grievance procedure.under it,an employee who believed that he had been treated unfairly by sci could file a grievance and expect a grievance committee elected by the union to represent his interests.any settlement between sci and the grievance committee would bind the complaining employee.if sci and the grievance committee could not resolve the dispute amicably,either side could take the matter to arbitration.the cba stipulated that the parties and the complaining employee would be bound by the arbitrator decision.
plumley invoked the grievance procedure no fewer than seven times during his tour of duty with sci.one such occasion followed his discharge on march.the ensuing dispute reached the arbitration stage.finding that the sanction imposed was overly harsh,the arbitrator vacated the dismissal in favor of a suspension without pay.ancillary to this determination,the arbitrator ordered sci to compensate plumley in full for the wages and benefits that he had lost during the period when his grievance was being processed adjusted for the suspension.plumley received these and benefits for a span of approximately six the fact that he had not worked for sci during that interval.
the plant manager,leo parenteau,learned of the arbitral award on october.the next day,he sent plumley a registered letter directing him to return to work on october.plumley received the letter on october,but found the timing inconvenient he requested a brief delay,but parenteau remained resolute.
on october,plumley reported to work at sci,but departed before completing his shift.the next day,he left a message stating that he would be either late or absent because he needed to see his ill father.plumley did not report to work at all,but,rather,visited his father at a hospital in boston.when plumley arrived at the plant on october,parenteau cashiered him for abandoning his duties.plumley attempted to grieve the firing but the union elected not to submit his grievance to arbitration.
so goes a rote story in modern as routine as they are simple.the atypicality of this case is not apparent until certain elements are viewed through the prism of the fmla,a federal statute that entitle s eligible employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons including the care of a child,spouse,or parent who has a serious health condition b.the statute allows such employees to take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for specified reasons during any period without jeopardizing their employment security.id.it defines an eligible employee as one who has been employed i for at least months by the employer with respect to whom leave is requested and ii for at least hours of service with such employer during the previous period.id.a.
seizing upon this language,plumley filed suit against sci in maine federal district court,alleging that sci violated the fmla and the labor management relations act lmra,when it terminated his employment on october,sci denied the material allegations of the complaint.in due season,plumley moved for summary judgment.
in his motion,plumley contended that he met the requirements for fmla eligibility because he had worked for sci for more than one year and had provided more than hours of service during the twelve months preceding the leave request.he arrived at the total number of hours by aggregating hours actually worked up to march the date when he had been improvidently discharged and the hours for which he was compensated under the arbitral award.in plumley estimation,those corresponded generally to the work weeks from march to october,minus the suspension approved by the,as a matter of law,hours of service within the compass of the fmla and,thus,brought his aggregate hours of service well over for the relevant period.building on this foundation,he asseverated that sci had violated the fmla by firing him for taking leave to care for his ailing father.in the alternative,he theorized that sci should be estopped from disputing his eligibility for coverage under the fmla.finally,he maintained that he had a right under the lmra to recover from sci since the union had breached its duty of fair representation dfr by not submitting his grievance to arbitration.
sci opposed this motion and simultaneously for summary judgment,emphasizing that plumley actually had worked fewer than hours in the previous twelve months and thus did not meet the criteria for fmla eligibility.in sci view,this fact scuttled both the fmla and dfr claims.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of sci.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the role of summary judgment is to look behind the facade of the pleadings and assay the parties proof in order to determine whether a trial is required.mcintosh,at.in conventional summary judgment practice,the moving party has the initial responsibility of suggesting the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.quintero de quintero,cir.that entails supporting the motion,by affidavits,admissions,or other materials of evidentiary quality,as to issues on which the movant bears the burden of proof.mcintosh,at.once the movant has fulfilled this obligation,the burden shifts to the summary judgment target to demonstrate that a trialworthy issue exists.suarez pueblo int l,cir.in the last analysis,summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
this same paradigm governs our de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment.see suarez,at.that mode of review is particularly appropriate where,as here,a case turns on a question of statutory interpretation.see riva commonwealth of,cir explaining that rulings that depend on statutory construction engender de novo review.it is against this backdrop that we ponder plumley asseverational array.
a.the fmla claim.
as the parties readily concede,the central issue in this appeal presents a pure question of law the interpretation of the hours of service requirement of the fmla.the record is pellucid that plumley performed only hours of actual physical work for sci in the period prior to the date when he absented himself to visit his ailing father.in the first instance,then,plumley case stands or falls on the classification of the hours that he did not actually work but for which he was compensated under the arbitral award.if those hours comprise hours of service within the purview of the fmla,then plumley has demonstrated his eligibility for fmla benefits and,therefore,his action should have survived a motion for summary judgment.if,however,those hours do not count for fmla purposes,then plumley was not eligible for fmla benefits and,therefore,his action was ripe for brevis disposition.
the district court interpreted the fmla as excluding the hours in question and entered judgment accordingly.we test this determination.
in plotting the contours of a statute,courts must look first to its language and structure.hawayek,cir united states charles george trucking,cir.thus,statutory interpretation always begins with the text of the relevant it sometimes ends there as well.when the statutory language points unerringly in a single direction,and produces an entirely plausible result,it is look for other signposts or to browse in the congressional archives.charles george trucking,at.
with these precepts in mind,we examine the statutory provisions at issue here.the fmla instructs us that f or purposes of determining whether an employee meets the hours of service requirement,the legal standards established under section of title shall apply.c.section is part of the fair labor standards act flsa.the applicable subsection deals with pay classifications.it states that the regular rate at which an employee is employed shall be deemed to include all remuneration for employment paid to,or on behalf of,the employee id.e.
the phrase for employment is critically important.to ensure needed guidance,the fmla,in,refers courts to flsa g for the definition of employ the root of employment.that section provides that e mploy includes to suffer or permit to work.because this phrase is includes is not must broaden our search for the meaning of the words that congress wrote.
we conduct this inquiry with a keen awareness of the general principle that,absent credible evidence to the contrary,courts should assume that congress knew,and embraced,widely accepted legal definitions of specific words used in drafting particular statutes.united states nason,cir.that principle bears fruit in this instance.for legal purposes,the standard definition of employment is w ork for which one has been hired and is being paid by an employer.black law dictionary ed.by like token,the word work is defined in its verb form as t o exert effort to perform,either physically or mentally.id.at.merging these definitions into one coherent sentence,we find that the statutory language,in every technical sense,indicates that only those hours that an employer suffers or permits an employee to do work that is,to exert effort,either physically or mentally for which that employee has been hired and is being paid by the employer can be included as hours of service within the meaning of the fmla.
to end our analysis here would truncate the process,for the task of statutory construction often is informed by reading the whole of the statute.acadia ins.mcneil,cir.this case is no exception other language in flsa strongly supports the conclusion that hours of service must be limited to hours actually worked at the behest of the employer.we explain briefly.
flsa e contains a list of remunerations that the regular rate shall not be deemed to include.this compendium encompasses such things as reward s for service,the amount of which are not measured by or dependent on hours worked,production,or efficiency and payments made for occasional periods when no work is being performed due to vacation,holiday,illness,failure of the employer to provide sufficient work,or other similar cause.e.these exclusions and the statutory language used in their explication illustrate that any compensation that is not paid for hours actually worked in the service and at the gain of the employer is not to be counted toward hours of service.it is surpassingly difficult to make a principled distinction between wages received for hours not worked because an employer has failed to provide sufficient work and wages received for hours not worked because an employer unjustifiably has kept the employee from working and,thus,has failed to provide sufficient work.
plumley demurs.represented by able counsel,he argues that the arbitral award can be distinguished from the exemplars listed in flsa e on the basis that all the listed items provide some benefit to the employee,whereas a wrongfully discharged one who subsequently prevails at not benefit at all from his mistreatment.this characterization is of doubtful validity as this case illustrates,a wrongfully discharged employee who prevails at arbitration receives not only reinstatement but also the wages that he would have earned even though he has not performed the services to which those wages relate.in that sense,the wrongfully discharged employee benefits to the same extent as the employee who,say,is paid for down time.
in all events,plumley characterization,even if accurate,adds no dimension to our analysis.congress directed courts to use the legal standards established under section of the flsa in order to determine the way in which hours of service should be measured.c.one of these standards,enunciated long ago by the supreme court,is that work for purposes of the flsa means physical or mental exertion whether burdensome or not controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer tennessee coal,iron muscoda local.emphasis supplied.our derivation of the statutory language comports with this definition moreover,plumley cites no precedent under the flsa in which an adjudication hinged upon whether the employee was or was not benefitted by the employer payment.this lack of citation is understandable.
the case law shows,consistent with tennessee coal,that courts faced with scenarios not clearly anticipated by congress have looked primarily to whether the employer was benefitted to determine if particular hours are covered under flsa.see,richardson costco wholesale,d,holding that employee time spent in collection procedure does not constitute work under the flsa because not integral to employer business activities ragnone belo,d,determining that pilot time was not spent primarily for the benefit of the employer and its business and thus did not constitute actual hours worked under the flsa dinges sacred heart mary,cir reasoning that emergency medical technician time is not work under the flsa.consequently,we decline plumley invitation to determine which hours are covered hours of service based upon the benefit inuring to the employee rather than the benefit inuring to the employer.
plumley also argues that flsa works by exclusion,necessitating the inclusion of all compensation and,therefore,all hours of service not explicitly described in one of its subsections.the fatal flaw in this construct is that it reads the limiting phrase for employment out of the text of the statute.it is law that all words in a statute are presumed to have meaning and should be given full effect when feasible,united states,cir united states,cir.the words for employment fit naturally into the rhythm of flsa.those words inform courts what remunerations to include in calculating an employee regular rate,and,by incorporation,his hours of service under the fmla 
because congress imported flsa into the fmla,a thorough analysis requires us to ensure that our interpretation of,when transplanted into the soil of the fmla,produces a plausible result.see charles george trucking,at.we turn next to that task.
the stated purposes of the fmla are to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons and to accomplish the se purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers b.we see nothing odd about the fact that congress chose to strike this balance by defining eligible employees as those who have worked for the employer during the previous twelve months and have contributed hours of actual work.indeed,if congress chose to exclude periods when the employer fails to provide sufficient scenario completely at the fault of the employer and out of the control of the can not deem it implausible that congress would want to exclude for fmla purposes unproductive time elapsed during the pendency of a grievance.
plumley argument is that the intent of congress in requiring hours of service was to insulate employers from having to extend fmla coverage to workers.building on this foundation,he exhorts us to overlook the text of the statute and find that congress intended to cover all employees.but the foundation for this exhortation is porous congress chose to differentiate eligible employees from ineligible employees by the number of hours worked in the previous twelve months.see,at,reprinted in,explaining that the bill does not cover part time or seasonal employees working less t
