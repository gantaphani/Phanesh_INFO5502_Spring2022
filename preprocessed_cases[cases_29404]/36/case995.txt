in october,petitioner mother was incarcerated following allegations she engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with a boy that same day,the orange county social services agency ssa took mother son into protective custody because mother incarceration prevented her from caring for her son.see welf,subd.g.in january,mother pleaded no contest to the dependency petition,and the court declared her son a dependent and ordered reunification services for mother and her son pursuant to a case plan prepared by ssa.after spending approximately four months in county jail,mother was released to the immigration and naturalization service ins on march.sometime thereafter,the ins deported mother to mexico.mother notified ssa of her location in mexico on may,and she initiated services with the mexican authorities.however,at the time of the review hearing on june,mother had failed to comply with much of her case plan due in large measure to her incarceration and subsequent deportation.at the review hearing,following the recommendation of ssa,the court ordered reunification services terminated and set a hearing pursuant to section hearing to consider the termination of mother parental rights.
mother petitions for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order of june,and to issue a new and different order continuing reunification services to a review.she claims the court erred in terminating reunification services and setting a hearing by applying the review standard pursuant to section,subdivisions f and g,instead of the review standard pursuant to section,subdivision e.we agree and therefore issue a writ of mandate directing the court to vacate its order and revisit the issues in conformity with this opinion.
we will not belabor the factual background of this proceeding,as we grant the writ petition on a purely legal issue,and need not reach the issue of substantial evidence also raised in the parties briefs.
of primary relevance here are the court statement of the law and factual findings at the review hearing.at the hearing,counsel for mother argued there was a basis for continuing reunification services for an additional six months mother at some point after disposition in this matter,was deported.some reasonable period of time after she arrived back in her home town,she did get in touch with the mexican social services agency.and according to faxes that were sent by the mother to the social worker,she has been receiving services down there and participating in them.her case plan was relatively simple that she was to engage in,substance abuse and parenting and counseling,to address specific issues it appears that mother has been trying to do her part in completing the service plan.it equally appears that the social services agency in mexico has not been cooperating with anybody here,in this country,to verify the extent to which mother is participating or addressing the service plan that was ordered by this court.it appears that she not getting reasonable services.now,i realize that that not the control of the agency here,who has no control over what the mexican agency does for her down there,but to the extent that there is going to be an argument mother is not making substantial progress and is unable to show a likelihood of return within six months,i got to think that this is not due to mother lack of efforts i t seems like,given the dramatic changes and upheaval in her life,being deported back to her home state and the speed with which she got engaged in services and her efforts to document them it seems like mother is really making substantial progress and substantial effort at trying to regain custody of the child.
the court responded to counsel argument by setting forth what it believed to be the relevant legal standard.the court counsel,the finding that the court has to make is that there is a substantial probability of return is that true counsel for mother yes.the court and the code defines what that means.have you looked at those subsections the court it says that the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited the child is the first of the three criteria.the second one is that the parent or legal guardian has made significant progress in resolving the problems that led to the child removal from the home,and the last one is the c section,which indicates that the parent or legal guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child safety,protection,physical and emotional well being and special needs.what evidence do i have before me to suggest that all three of those have been satisfied 
after hearing additional argument from counsel for all parties,the court refused to extend reunification services and instead set a hearing to decide whether to terminate mother parental rights.the court first explained it found the services provided by ssa to be reasonable counsel comments regarding services,certainly,it is concerning that the mother finds herself in a position where it difficult for her to receive services however,the mother has failed to maintain regular contact with the social worker here and to that extent,there seems to be some difficulty with the mother,actually,engaging in services,even if adequate services are available to her.the court continued the court does note that based on what i have before me,that the court can not make a finding that there is a substantial probability of return within the next six months,and as a result,will order that reunification services be terminated at this time.the matter is set for a contested hearing.
the minute order generated from the hearing states court finds pursuant to e w i code that return of child to parents would create a substantial risk of detriment to the physical or emotional well being of the child based on parents failure to regularly participate in and complete the service plan.court finds reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent s guardian.the court can not find that there is a substantial probability of return within six months.court finds pursuant to e that the child was under the age of three on the date of initial removal and the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan.a hearing pursuant to is in the best interests of the child based on the reports and recommendations provided by the social services agency.court orders reunification services to parent s terminated.court orders pursuant to e that a hearing be held within days pursuant to.
discussion 
mother timely filed a petition for writ of mandate cal.rules of court,rule,claiming the court applied the wrong legal standard at the review and challenging the court factual findings for lack of substantial evidence.
legal standards utilized at reviews and reviews 
before explaining mother argument in detail,it is necessary to provide a brief summary of relevant dependency law.f amily preservation is the first priority when dependency proceedings are commenced.in re lauren th,d.to that end,w hen a child is removed from a parent custody,the juvenile court ordinarily must order child welfare services for the minor and the parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family.tonya superior court cal th,d,tonya see,subd.a.
in cases like the instant one,where the child is less than three years old and reunification services have been ordered,the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months,subd.a,italics added.whereas services are presumptively provided for months to children over the age of three and their parents,subd.a,the presumptive rule for children under the age of three on the date of initial removal is that services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care,subd.a see in re christina th,d.the unique developmental needs of infants and toddlers daria superior court th,d justifies a greater emphasis on establishing permanency and stability earlier in the dependency process in cases with a poor prognosis for family reunification.id.at,d.
the status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed periodically as determined by the court but no less frequently than once every six months,subd.a.pursuant to section,subdivision e,the court is required at the initial review to return any dependent child to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian unless the court finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the return of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child the failure of the parent or legal guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.mother does not challenge the court finding that her son should not be returned to her custody at the time of the review.it is uncontested mother failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in treatment programs during the first six months of her service plan.
instead,mother asserts her reunification services should have continued until the permanency hearing and the court should not have set a hearing to terminate her parental rights.the third paragraph of section,subdivision e,requires a specialized inquiry at the review for children like mother son,who are under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal and are not being returned to the custody of their parents at that time.for such dependent children,if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.if,however,the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child may be returned to his or her parent or legal guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided,the court shall continue the case to the permanency hearing,subd.e,italics added.
thus,there are two distinct determinations to be made by trial courts applying the third paragraph of section,subdivision e.first,the statute identifies specific factual to participate regularly and make substantive progress in the treatment,if found by clear and convincing evidence,would justify the court in scheduling a hearing to terminate parental rights.but this inquiry does not require the court to schedule a hearing the court may schedule a hearing,subd.e,italics added see in re jesse th,d the statute makes clear that the court has discretion to set a section hearing at the review hearing under specified circumstances italics added.instead,it authorizes the court to set such a hearing if the required findings have been made.mother does not contest the court finding,by clear and convincing evidence,that she failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan.
the second determination called for by the third paragraph of section,subdivision e,protects parents and guardians against premature hearings.notwithstanding any findings made pursuant to the first determination,the court shall not set a hearing if it finds either there is a substantial probability that the child may be returned to his or her parent within six months or reasonable services have not been provided to the parent,subd.e.in other words,the court must continue the case to the review if it makes either of these findings.however,the court is not required to set a hearing even if it finds against the parent on both of these findings.the parent is also entitled to continued reunification services with any necessary modifications if the court makes either of these findings in favor of the parent.tonya,supra,cal th at,d,cal.rules of court,rule f.mother challenges only the court finding pertaining to substantial probability on appeal,so we will focus on this portion of the inquiry.
section,subdivision e,which relates solely to the conduct of the review hearing,does not provide further guidance concerning how to determine at the review whether there is a substantial probability the child may be returned to a parent within the following six months,subd.e.california rules of court,rule f,restates subdivision e and in addition provides a test for assessing the probability of return at the review if the court does not return custody of the child the court may set a hearing under section within days if e the child was under the age of three when initially removed and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in any treatment plan,unless the court finds a substantial probability that the child may be returned within months or within months of the date the child entered foster care,whichever is sooner,or that reasonable services have not been offered or provided.in order to find a substantial probability of return within the applicable time period,the court must find all of the following i the parent or guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited the child ii the parent or guardian has made significant progress in resolving the problems that led to the removal of the child and iii the parent or guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability to complete the objectives of the treatment plan and to provide for the child safety,protection,physical and emotional health,and special needs.cal.rules of court,rule f,italics added.
presumably,the test for substantial probability of return presented in california rules of court,rule f e was taken from a substantively identical test in section,subdivision g.subdivision g provides,in relevant part if the time period in which the services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in section,subdivision a and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or legal guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision f,the court shall do one of the following continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing,provided that the hearing shall occur within months of the date the child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian.the court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian for the purposes of this section,in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time,the court shall be required to find all of the following a that the parent or legal guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child.b that the parent or legal guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child removal from the home.c the parent or legal guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child safety,protection,physical and emotional,and special needs,subd.g,italics added.
thus section,subdivision g,purports to apply only after the child has not been returned to the parent at a hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision f permanency hearings,and does not mention subdivision e hearings reviews pursuant to subdivision g,the court can only continue the case to the review if it finds a substantial probability the child will be returned to the parent moreover,the court must find all three of the listed factors to justify a finding of a substantial probability the child will be returned to his or her parent,subd.g.
applicability of review standard to reviews 
the trial court believed the test of substantial probability of return provided in section,subdivision g,to be applicable to review determinations of substantial probability.the court noted the code defines the meaning of substantial probability.the court then proceeded to read from section,subdivision g,in guiding mother counsel toward the concession there was insufficient evidence to satisfy all three findings required by this standard of substantial probability.the court concluded it could not make a finding that there is a substantial probability of return within the next six months,and as a result,will order that reunification services be terminated at this time.the court also set a hearing.
based on the language of the statute,mother contends the court erred in applying section,subdivision g,at the review.she also points to the tonya case in support of this proposition.in tonya,the parent filed a writ petition challenging the court termination of reunification services and decision to set a hearing,based in part on a finding at the hearing that there was no substantial probability of return within six months.tonya,supra,cal th at,d.our supreme court found the statute to be ambiguous,and embarked upon an investigation into the provision statutory context,its legislative history,and the human problems the legislature sought to address in adopting the juvenile dependency scheme.id.at,d.in conducting this review,the tonya court observed,the dependency scheme sets up three distinct periods and three corresponding distinct escalating standards for the provision of reunification services to parents of children under the age of three.id.at,d.in describing the escalating standards,it attributed the test of substantial probability set forth in section,subdivision g,only to the review.tonya,supra,cal th at,d.the effect of these shifting standards is to make services during these three periods first presumed,then possible,then disfavored.ibid.put simply,mother claims she should have been judged by a more lenient standard than the section,subdivision g,standard applied by the court.
ssa makes two counterarguments the legislature did intend to apply the same test to both substantial probability analyses,as evidenced by language in section,subdivision g,indicating its test of substantial probability applied f or the purposes of this section rather than referencing only subdivisions f and g and any error in applying subdivision g is harmless because the california rules of court prescribe an identical test.
we reject the proposition that determination of the substantial probability question presented by subdivision e requires the court to make the findings set forth in section,subdivision g.conceptually,the review and the review present distinct inquiries.at the review,the court has discretion to continue the case and forebear from scheduling a hearing even if it does not make the finding there is a substantial probability the child may be returned to his or her parent.section,subdivision e,places discretion in the hands of the trial court as to whether to schedule a hearing to terminate parental rights if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,it may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days,subd.e,italics added cal.rules of court,rule f the court may set a hearing under section italics added.of course,the court discretion becomes limited when there is a substantial probability the child may be returned to the parent,in which case the court must continue the case to the hearing.
furthermore,subdivisions e and g of section present distinct legal standards subdivision e asks whether there is a substantial probability the child may be reunited with the parent by the review subdivision g asks whether there is a substantial probability the child will be reunited with the parent by the review.see tonya,supra,cal th at,d.as observed by our supreme court,there is a different operable standard in play at each of the hearings.id.at,d.simply applying subdivision g at a review as if the court were making findings on substantial probability at a review is legal error.we do not think the legislature intended to countermand these different operable standards by using the word section in its preface to the subdivision g test,rather than specifically referencing subdivisions f and g.moreover,the statute expressly conditions all of the court options under subdivision g,including the subdivision g test,on a finding first being made at the permanency hearing that the child will not be returned to the parent or legal guardian,subd.g if a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or legal guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision f,the court shall do one of the following.
the more difficult question,however,is precisely what the operable standard of substantial probability at a review should be.tonya did not provide an answer to this question beyond simply quoting the language of the statute.tonya,supra,cal th at,d.the california rules of court,rule f e,suggests the substantive factors considered in the substantial probability component of the inquiry remain,the three factors by which a parent should be judged to be on the road to reunification maintaining consistent and regular contact with the child,making progress in addressing the issues that led to dependency,and demonstrating the potential to be a good parent are the same at both the review and the review.a court certainly does not err by considering at the review evidence pertaining to the factors identified in section,subdivision g,and california rules of court,rule f e.
however,for the purposes of this case,we see two crucial differences between the substantial probability inquiry required at the review and the inquiry required at the review first,the court is not charged by section,subdivision e,with finding a substantial probability the child will be returned.the court is charged with finding a substantial probability the child may be returned.literally,the statute commands the court to determine whether there is a strong likelihood of a possibility of return not simply a strong likelihood the return will in fact occur.the word may alters the typically high burden of substantial probability.admittedly,the statute is unwieldy.but we must honor the law as written by the legislature.campbell zolin th,d ordinarily,where the legislature uses a different word or phrase in one part of a statute than it does in other sections or in a similar statute concerning a related subject,it must be presumed that the legislature intended a different meaning.
second,the court may take all of the evidence into consideration in making its findings.the court is not limited to inquiring into the three factors set forth in section,subdivision g,and california rules of court,rule f e.the court should weigh evidence pertaining to the factors identified in california rules of court,rule f e,along with any other relevant evidence such as extenuating circumstances excusing noncompliance with the three factors in considering whether there is substantial evidence of a possible return to the mother by the hearing.it is inconsistent with the language and structure of the statute to impose the same three mandatory factual findings set forth in section,subdivision g to support a finding that the child may be returned to his or her parent pursuant to section,subdivision e 
if,at the review,the court finds there is a substantial probability the child may be returned to the parent,the court lacks discretion to schedule a hearing.the court must instead continue reunification services until the review,and make any necessary modifications to the service plan in the interests of facilitating reunification.cal.rules of court,rule f see in re jesse,supra,th at,d.
the analytical framework we describe is consistent with the purpose of the statutory scheme to provide more timely resolutions for very young children in cases with a poor prognosis for family reunification,chronic substance abuse,multiple previous removals,abandonment,and chronic history of mental illness,without vitiating the strong interest in reunifying families or prematurely cutting off the rights of parents who are making substantial efforts
