in march,a majority of california voters approved proposition,codified in family code section,which states only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.we shall refer to this as the defense of marriage initiative or proposition.
thereafter,the legislature enacted family code section,effective on january,which states in part a registered domestic partners shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.we shall refer to this as the domestic partners act.
petitioners filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,seeking a determination that the legislature enactment of the domestic partners act is void because,they argued,it in effect amends proposition,the defense of marriage initiative,without obtaining separate approval of the voters,which petitioners believe was required by article ii,section,subdivision c,of the california constitution.this constitutional provision states that a legislative amendment of an initiative statute becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.as petitioners point out,proposition did not contain a clause permitting such a result.
ruling on the parties motions for summary judgment,the trial judge held that the domestic partners act does not amend the defense of marriage initiative and,therefore,its enactment without subsequent voter approval does not violate california constitution,and in any event,interpreting the initiative in the manner urged by petitioners would likely violate the equal protection guarantees of our state constitution.consequently,a judgment was entered denying petitioners request to declare the domestic partners act to be void.
in december,petitioners filed in this court a petition for writ of mandate,challenging the trial judge ruling.since the legislation would become effective on january,they asked us to issue an interim stay to prohibit enforcement of the contested provisions of the domestic partners act pending our decision on the merits of petitioners writ petition.we denied the request for a stay but issued an alternative writ of mandate to address petitioners legal challenge to the domestic partners act.
we conclude the trial judge was correct in ruling that the legislature enactment of the domestic partners act did not constitute an amendment of the defense of marriage initiative and,thus,that the legislature action without separate voter approval did not violate article ii,section,subdivision c of the california constitution.
as we will explain,the plain and unambiguous language of proposition shows that the initiative was intended only to limit the status of marriage to heterosexual couples and to prevent the recognition in california of homosexual marriages that have been,or may in the future be,legitimized by laws of other jurisdictions.the words of proposition,and also its ballot pamphlet materials,do not express an intent to repeal our state domestic partners laws or to limit the legislature authority to enact other legislation regulating such unions.if this were the intention of proponents of proposition,the electorate was not given the opportunity to vote on that undisclosed objective,and courts are precluded from interpreting proposition in a manner that was not presented to the voters.
contrary to petitioners suggestion,the legislature has not created a marriage by another name or granted domestic partners a status equivalent to married spouses.we shall recount in the discussion,post,the numerous statutory dissimilarities between the two types of unions,which disclose that the legislature has not created a marriage under the guise of another name.
in sum,it is the role of the legislature,not the courts,to make such public policy.here,the trial judge did not make public policy rather,judge loren mcmaster conscientiously applied rules of statutory construction to reach a decision compelled by the law.as he was required to do,judge mcmaster correctly ruled that the legislature enactment of section did not constitute an amendment of proposition that the statute thus became effective without separate approval by the electorate and,therefore,that section is not void.
accordingly,we shall deny the petition for writ of mandate,without need to address the merits of judge mcmaster alternate reason for denying petitioners request for relief.if they feel that the statutory scheme is not wise public policy,petitioners must turn to the legislature or to the electorate,not the courts,to correct it.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d.
discussion 
family code section defines a valid marriage as follows marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman,to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary.consent alone does not constitute marriage.consent must be followed by the issuance of a license and solemnization as authorized by this division further section references are to the family code unless otherwise specified.
section expands upon this definition by providing that a marriage contracted outside this state that would be valid by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the marriage was contracted is valid in this state.thus,although common law marriage has been abolished in california elden sheldon cal d,california recognizes the validity of a common law marriage contracted in another state which would be valid under the laws of that state.people badgett cal th,d,colbert colbert cal d.and under the plain language of section,if another state legalizes marriage,such marriages would be recognized as valid in california however,this outcome has been prevented by subsequent legislation.
in,in anticipation of the possible legalization of marriages in hawaii,congress enacted the defense of marriage act,a,stat.cong.admin.news,which has two operative provisions.the first defines marriage and spouse under federal law to include only partners of the opposite sex.the second provides that a state shall not be required to recognize marriages performed in other states.
in march,the california electorate passed its own defense of marriage initiative,which states only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california,added by initiative measure,eff.pursuant to section,california will not recognize marriages even if those marriages are validly formed in other jurisdictions.in other words,section supplants the directive of section in the case of marriages.
prior to the passage of proposition,the legislature enacted section,establishing domestic partnership as a recognized legal relationship.stats,ch.assem.bill.that section authorized two persons to register as domestic partners if they were adults sharing a common residence,they agreed to be jointly responsible for each other basic living expenses,and they were either both persons of the same sex,or persons of the opposite sex,who were both over the age of and eligible to receive social security.former,subd.b.domestic partners were entitled to certain limited rights concerning hospital visitation,and to health benefits if one of the partners was a state employee.former,subd.a former,et health.
thereafter,the legislature amended the domestic partnership statutes to expand the rights and obligations of domestic partners stats,ch.assem.bill,stats,ch.assem.bill,and to provide that for heterosexual domestic partnerships only one of the partners need be over the age of.stats,ch.assem.bill.
in,the legislature amended the domestic partnership laws again in the california domestic partner rights and responsibilities act of the act.stats,ch.assem.bill,eff.section,subdivision a of the act states registered domestic partners shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,whether they derive from statutes,administrative regulations,court rules,government policies,common law,or any other provisions or sources of law,as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.
however,the statute goes on to provide that domestic partners may not file joint tax returns and their earned income is not treated as community property for the purposes of state income tax,subd.g,and that they are not entitled to many of the benefits the federal government provides to married couples,such as marital benefits relating to social security,medicare,federal housing,food stamps,veterans benefits,military benefits,and federal employment benefit laws,subd.k.
section states a legal union of two persons of the same sex,other than a marriage,that was validly formed in another jurisdiction,and that is substantially equivalent to a domestic partnership as defined in this part,shall be recognized as a valid domestic partnership in this state regardless of whether it bears the name domestic partnership.thus,a legal union that is valid in another jurisdiction will be recognized by california as a domestic partnership,but not as a marriage.
the legislature specified that the act is not intended to repeal or adversely affect any other ways in which relationships between adults may be recognized or given effect in california,or the legal consequences of those relationships,including,among other things,civil marriage stats,ch.assem.bill,subd.c and it does not amend or modify any provision of the california constitution or any provision of any statute that was adopted by initiative,subd.j.
according to petitioners,proposition did more than prevent california from recognizing marriages from other states it was designed to protect the institution of marriage by precluding the legislature from giving the rights and benefits of marriage to alternative relationships.
therefore,petitioners argue,section in effect amended proposition.citing article ii,section,subdivision c,of california constitution,petitioners claim that section is void because it has not been approved by the voters.
article ii,section,subdivision c,of the california constitution states the legislature may amend or repeal an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.the purpose of this constitutional limitation of legislative power is to protect the people initiative powers by precluding the legislature from undoing what the people have done,without the electorate consent.citations.proposition enforcement project quackenbush th,d.
an amendment is any change of the scope or effect of an existing statute,whether by addition,omission,or substitution of provisions,which does not wholly terminate its existence,whether by an act purporting to amend,repeal,revise,or supplement,or by an act independent and original in form,citation.a statute which adds to or takes away from an existing statute is considered an amendment.citation.mobilepark west homeowners escondido mobilepark west th,d.
the parties disagree as to whether section constitutes an amendment of proposition.there are no disputed material facts the parties simply dispute the legal significance of the relevant facts and reach different conclusions as to whether section adds to or takes away from proposition,as codified in section.since the answer to this question turns on an interpretation of the two statutes,it is an issue of law that a court may resolve in a summary judgment motion.hernandez modesto portuguese pentecost th,d.
in interpreting a voter initiative such as proposition,courts apply the same principles governing the construction of a statute.robert superior court cal th,d.we begin by examining the language of the initiative statute,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning,viewed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme.people rizo cal th,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day city of fontana cal th,d.
when the language is ambiguous,we refer to other indicia of the voters intent,particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.citation.people rizo,supra,cal th at,d.however,if the language is not ambiguous,not even the most reliable document of legislative history may have the force of law.citation.city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,d.a court can not insert or omit words to cause the meaning of a statute to conform to a presumed intent that is not expressed.code civ,california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.as a judicial body,it is our role to interpret the laws as they are written.san diego police officers city of san diego civil service com.th,d.
at the time the voters passed proposition,existing statutes defined marriage and domestic partnerships in a manner that indicates they are different legal relationships.section defines a valid marriage as a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman,to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary followed by the issuance of a license and a solemnizing ceremony.in contrast,section stated that domestic partners were two adults who have chosen to share one another lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring,and were both of the same sex,or of the opposite sex as long as they were both over the age of.former,added by stats,ch,assem.bill.statutes also granted rights and imposed obligations upon both types of relationships.
the plain language of proposition and its initiative statute,section,reaffirms the definition of marriage in section,by stating that only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid and recognized in california.this limitation ensures that california will not legitimize or recognize marriages from other jurisdictions,as it otherwise would be required to do pursuant to section,and that california will not permit partners to validly marry within the state.
without submitting the matter to the voters,the legislature can not change this absolute refusal to recognize marriages between persons of the same sex.cal,art.ii,subd.c.but the same is not true for enactment of legislation concerning domestic partnerships,a relationship other than marriage.this is so because the plain,unambiguous language of section does not state an intent to repeal existing domestic partnership laws or to limit the legislature authority to regulate such unions.section does not state that the legislature is precluded from expanding the rights and obligations of domestic partnerships or that,henceforth,such relationships will not be recognized or fostered in any fashion.
if that had been its purpose,the initiative easily and effectively could have accomplished that goal by using language akin to words used in laws from other states.for example,article i,section of the nebraska constitution provides only marriage between a man and a woman shall be valid or recognized in nebraska.the uniting of two persons of the same sex in a civil union,domestic partnership,or other similar relationship shall not be valid or recognized in nebraska.italics added see also,amend,legal status for unmarried persons which is identical or substantially similar to marital status shall not be valid or recognized in arkansas,except that the legislature may recognize a common law marriage from another state between a man and a woman,i b no union between persons of the same sex shall be recognized by this state as entitled to the benefits of marriage,only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in kentucky.a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized,no official or court of the state of louisiana shall construe this constitution or any state law to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any member of a union other than the union of one man and one woman.a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized ohio,art.xv,only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions.this state and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design,qualities,significance or effect of marriage,a marriage between persons of the same sex or a civil union granting to the parties of the relationship the legal protections,benefits,or responsibilities granted to the spouses of a marriage is contrary to public policy and void.
the plain language of the above cited laws of other states demonstrates an indisputable intent to limit the benefits associated with marriage to marriages between men and women,and to prohibit the recognition of other types of domestic unions or partnerships.proposition contains no similar language.given the existence of domestic partnership statutes in california when the initiative was put on the ballot,proposition needed such language if it was intended to supplant the legislature authority to enact and to amend legislation regarding domestic partnerships.instead,proposition unambiguously limits its scope to whether california will recognize the validity of marriages between persons of the same sex it says nothing about whether other types of relationships may be permitted to enjoy the rights typically conferred upon married couples.
because the plain,unambiguous language of proposition is concerned only with who is entitled to obtain the status of marriage,and not with the rights and obligations associated with marriage,section which does not grant the legal status of marriage to registered domestic partners does not add to,or take away from,proposition.
since the language of the initiative is unambiguous,we need not look to other indicia of the voters intent.people rizo,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,we note that ballot pamphlet materials submitted by proponents of proposition,as well as the nonpartisan explanations of the measure,disclose no intent to limit the statutory rights of domestic partners 
the legislative analyst explained the measure as follows background under current california law,marriage is based on a civil contract between a man and a woman.current law also provides that a legal marriage that took place outside of california is generally considered valid in california.no state in the nation currently recognizes a civil contract or any other relationship between two people of the same sex as a marriage.proposal this measure provides that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.ballot,primary,analysis by legis.analyst,at hereafter ballot pamphlet.
the argument in favor of proposition asserted that even though california law already says only a man and a woman may marry,it also recognizes marriages from other states.however,judges in some of those states want to define marriage differently than we do.if they succeed,california may have to recognize new kinds of marriages,even though most people believe marriage should be between a man and a woman.ballot,supra,argument in favor of,at.
the rebuttal to the opposing argument emphatically stated the truth is,unless we pass proposition,legal loopholes could force california to recognize marriages performed in other states.that why other states and the federal government have passed laws to close these loopholes.california deserves the same choice.ballot,supra,rebuttal to argument against,original italics and capitalization.
and the summary of the ballot measure said a yes vote on this measure means california law will provide that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.the summary continues a no vote on this measure means california law will continue to define marriage based on a civil contract between a man and a woman and generally recognize legal marriages that took place outside of california as valid in california.ballot,supra,what your vote means.
these ballot materials directly support the interpretation that proposition was intended solely to preserve the status of marriage in california for persons of the opposite sex by preventing the recognition of marriages from other jurisdictions if those marriages are between homosexuals.no mention is made of an intent to limit the rights and obligations of domestic partnerships,civil unions,or any other kind of relationship regardless of its characterization.if this were the actual intent of the proponents of proposition,the electorate was not given the opportunity to vote on that undisclosed objective.it is well established that courts may not properly interpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate the voters should get what they enacted,not more and not less.hodges superior court cal th,d.
petitioners note that the argument against proposition in the ballot pamphlet claimed the proponents real purpose in placing proposition on the ballot was to use it as a tool in court to deny basic civil rights to lesbians and gays and their families.ballot,supra,argument against.this,petitioners argue,shows the voters were unequivocally told that the initiative would strip away the existing rights of couples and prohibit the extension of marital rights to such partners in the future.however,in their rebuttal to argument against proposition,the proponents of the initiative denied any intent to take away such rights that absolutely false do they really expect voters to believe that the truth is,proposition does take away anyone rights.whatever you think of marriages,we can all agree that our opponents use of scare tactics and deceit is the wrong way to address important issues.ballot,supra,rebuttal to argument against.this exchange does not support petitioners interpretation of proposition.
indeed,in their rebuttal to the opponents argument,the proponents emphasized only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.that all proposition says,and that all it does.ballot,supra,rebuttal to argument against.
since proposition was directed only at preserving the status of marriage for persons of the opposite sex,and not with limiting or withholding statutory rights relating to other types of legal relationships,section did not amend the initiative measure.
despite the plain,unambiguous language of proposition,and its intent as evidenced in the ballot materials,petitioners persist in contending that the initiative did more than simply preserve the status of marriage for partners of the opposite sex.they argue that proposition protects the institution of marriage itself,which they contend requires that the myriad of rights,benefits,and obligations associated therewith must be reserved only for married persons.
petitioners point to elden sheldon,supra,cal d,hereafter elden,in which the california supreme court said t he state has a strong interest in the marriage relationship to the extent unmarried cohabitants are granted the same rights as married persons,the state interest in promoting marriage is inhibited spouses receive special consideration from the state,for marriage is a civil contract of so solemn and binding a nature that the consent of the parties alone will not constitute marriage the consent of the state is also required.citation.marriage is accorded this degree of dignity in recognition that t he joining of the man and woman in marriage is at once the most socially productive and individually fulfilling relationship that one can enjoy in the course of a lifetime.citation.consonant therewith,the state is most solicitous of the rights of spouses.citation.the state affords similar protection to certain putative relationships in recognition of the good faith in which the innocent party undertook to marry.citation.unmarried cohabitants receive no similar solicitous statutory protection,nor should they such would impede the state substantial interest in promoting and protecting marriage.citation.id.at.
according to petitioners,because elden tied the conferral of marital rights to the state interest in promoting marriage,proposition necessari
