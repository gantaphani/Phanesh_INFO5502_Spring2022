factual and procedural background 
consistent with the standard of review,we set out the facts in the light most favorable to the juvenile court order.see delgado trax bar grill cal th,d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,all of the evidence most favorable to the respondent must be accepted as true,and that unfavorable discarded as not having sufficient verity to be accepted by the trier of fact.
exposed by her birth mother to narcotics in utero,endured years of abuse and neglect at her birth mother hands.her birth mother struck her and reportedly prostituted her to feed a drug habit.vividly remembered being sexually abused by a maternal uncle when she was four years old.ssa removed from her birth mother custody at age five.after two prospective adoptive families disintegrated in divorce,petitioners,who adopted younger,accepted on a trial basis because she had nowhere else to go.petitioners adopted in at age nine.

petitioners grounded on may,after she received a poor report card and a classmate father complained she harassed his daughter with hostile text messages.while the rest of the family attended a birthday party,remained home.later claiming she only intended to cause the two family dogs to have diarrhea for her mother to clean up,fed the animals her adult sister medication,naproxen.the family returned home to find one dog already dead and the other,foaming at the mouth,about to die.petitioners called the police,who arrested for animal cruelty,escorting her out of the house in handcuffs.the police transported to juvenile hall,where she spent two months awaiting a delinquency hearing on two counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty filed by the district attorney.
based on the incident,a social worker filed a child abuse report against for emotional abuse of her siblings.the worker also filed a report against mother because she reacted to the incident by angrily grabbing upper arms hard enough to leave bruises.the social worker counseled petitioners to have an action plan ready to handle if and when she was released from juvenile hall.

on june,the delinquency court sustained the district attorney animal cruelty allegations against and ordered a probation report.based on her interview with the parents,the probation officer concluded they have no desire to reunify with the minor.according to the probation officer,the parents planned to pursue reversal of the adoption.the officer d id not recall that the parents ever referred to the child they have raised for the past seven years as their daughter.it is clear they want no part of a future relationship with her.they proffered no relatives or suitable adults to assume responsibility for 
observing the days in custody have made the desired impact upon the minor,that such thoughtless and cruel behavior will not be tolerated,the probation officer recommended informal probation instead of wardship for.since her adoptive parents will not take her back home,the probation officer observed the minor will again need protective custody,and recommended the services and resources of social services.the delinquency court rejected the district attorney request to declare a ward of the court,ordered informal probation,and released her to orangewood children home.the delinquency court recommended placing in a home without small children or animals.
