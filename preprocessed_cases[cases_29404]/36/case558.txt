family code section,subdivision a section a provides that a transmutation,or an interspousal transaction changing the character of community or separate property,is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration approved by the adversely affected spouse.in estate of macdonald cal d,macdonald,this court held that a writing satisfies the express declaration requirement only if it states on its face that a change in the character or ownership of the subject property is being made.macdonald made clear that this construction of section a precludes the use of extrinsic evidence to prove that the writing effected a transmutation.macdonald,supra,cal d at.macdonald explained that the legislature,in enacting these requirements and abrogating prior case law,sought to increase certainty and honesty in marital property disputes,and to decrease the burden on the courts in resolving such matters.
in this dissolution case,douglas benson husband claims he conveyed to diane benson wife his community property interest in their home after she orally promised to waive,in writing,her community property interest in husband retirement accounts.no such writing was ever made.despite section a and macdonald,supra,cal d,the lower courts ruled that husband performance of his part of the bargain,as evidenced by the deed he signed in wife favor,served as an adequate substitute for wife express written statement changing the retirement accounts into husband separate property.
we disagree.section a does not operate like the general statute of frauds,subd.a civil code section a,in which the requirement of a basic writing is subject to an implied exception for part performance of the contract terms.even assuming husband transfer of the deed constituted part performance of wife promise to transmute the retirement accounts,section a requires such agreements to be both written and express,and seeks to prevent transmutations under circumstances like those present here.by insisting upon a special writing expressly changing the character of the disputed property,macdonald all but decided that section a is not satisfied where no such writing exists at all.thus,the lower courts erred in accepting husband transmutation claim and in denying wife a community property interest in his retirement plans.we will reverse the judgment.
the parties married in.they subsequently had two children,and accumulated property together.separation occurred in.in,wife petitioned for dissolution of the marriage.at trial,the parties litigated various issues,including the division of property.the record contains the following evidence.
during the marriage,husband worked full time as a truck driver for a food wholesale company.through his employer,he participated in a stock ownership plan,and contributed to a k retirement plan.wife worked part time as a nurse at a hospital.she also had a retirement plan through her employer.
at the start of the marriage,wife father,robert maahs,owned the santa barbara house in which the couple lived.husband and wife contributed some money each month towards use of the house.however,it appears these payments did not cover the mortgage bill or reflect the fair rental value of the property.
wife is the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust.her father is the trustee.during the marriage,and apparently for his own estate planning purposes,wife father gave the couple a percent ownership interest in the santa barbara house.this transfer occurred incrementally,over several years.at some point during this process,wife father asked the couple to convey the house to the trust.they agreed.hence,in two transfers occurring in late and early,the couple signed grant deeds giving the trust a percent ownership interest in the house.
the parties disputed the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the house to wife trust.husband offered two different versions of events in the trial court,neither of which matched wife account.
initially,husband maintained that he acquired a community property interest in the house,and that he did not surrender this interest by deeding the property to wife trust.to enforce this claim,husband successfully moved before trial to join the trustee,wife father,as a party to the dissolution proceeding.however,while trial was under way,husband settled all claims against the trust for an amount.the court promptly dismissed the trustee from the case with prejudice.
later,husband testified that an oral agreement between the parties changed the community character of both the house and his retirement accounts,as follows in,when the couple signed the first deed in favor of wife trust,husband agreed to forgo any community interest in the house and wife agreed to forgo any community interest in his retirement accounts.wife said she would sign a writing transforming husband retirement accounts into his separate property.however,no writing was ever made.husband knew that such a document could easily have been prepared and signed at the same time he deeded the house to wife trust.he did not press the issue because he trusted wife,and because they had no plans to divorce at the time.husband admitted at trial that he failed to mention any oral transmutation agreement or to identify the retirement accounts as separate property during discovery and other pretrial proceedings.
wife denied making any promise to waive or change her community interest in husband retirement accounts.she testified that such conversations were limited to the house,and to her father request that it be conveyed to the trust.wife reportedly told husband that they should repay her father generosity by returning the house to him as trustee.
consistent with testimony on both sides,the trial court concluded that husband relinquished his community interest in the house when he deeded it to wife trust.however,the court also agreed with husband that wife relinquished her community interest in his retirement accounts.the court reasoned that section a writing requirement is subject to implied exceptions that traditionally have been applied in other statutory contexts.under this approach,husband act of deeding the house to the trust constituted part performance of the oral transmutation agreement he described,and permitted its enforcement against wife.in all other respects,the trial court judgment resolved property,support,and child custody issues not relevant here.
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment.the appellate court adopted and applied the reasoning of the trial court.
in seeking review,wife claimed the lower courts erred in finding a valid transmutation of husband retirement accounts under section a,and in denying her a community property interest in those accounts.we now address wife concerns.
discussion 
the characterization of property as community or separate determines its division upon dissolution of the marriage.each spouse owns a interest in all community property.in general,community property is divided equally in the aggregate when the marriage ends.see.however,separate property is not subject to a similar division,and belongs only to the owner spouse.
in determining the community or separate nature of property,the statutory scheme starts from the premise that all property acquired during the marriage is community property.as pertinent here,this general rule,or presumption,covers both real property and employee retirement plans.in re marriage of lehman cal th,d,in re marriage of brown cal d.by its own terms,the definition of community property in section applies e xcept as otherwise provided by statute.it therefore exempts property defined as separate under other provisions,property acquired by gift or inheritance,earnings and accumulations while living separate and apart.
individuals may alter their property rights under these statutes.one set of rules authorizes and regulates contracts made by prospective spouses that take effect upon their marriage.critical here is the separate scheme governing transactions between spouses that transmute or change the character of property during an ongoing marriage.
in particular,section allows contracts or other transfers transmuting the separate property of one spouse to either the separate property of the other spouse or the community property of both spouses.community property also may become separate property under this section.consideration may,or may not,be exchanged.ibid.however,a companion statute,section a,imposes certain requirements section a states that a transmutation is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made,joined in,consented to,or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected.
here,there is no dispute that husband retirement accounts much like the house the couple received from wife father were originally community property.the reason is that any right to receive retirement benefits represented deferred compensation for work husband performed during the marriage.see in re marriage of lehman,supra,cal th,d,in re marriage of brown,supra,cal d.however,husband claims the retirement accounts were transmuted into his separate property under an agreement that,in return,he would deed his community interest in the couple home to wife trust.husband concedes the transmutation of his retirement accounts was never reduced to writing,as contemplated by section a.but he argues that any requirement of such a writing was obviated by his performance of his side of the bargain 
wife insists,on the other hand,that husband testimony about an unwritten agreement between the spouses could not establish such a transmutation.section a requirement of an express written transmutation,wife urges,is absolute,and is not subject to an exception for part performance.
the language of the statute,both on its face and as judicially construed,supports wife view.see droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d,embracing plain meaning of community property statute.section a states that an agreement to change the character of marital property is not valid unless it is in writing,contains an express declaration by which the transmutation is made,and is accepted in some fashion by the adversely affected spouse.this multipronged rule is framed in the negative,as though all intendments weigh against finding compliance in the usual case.in addition,no exception to the requirement of an express written declaration appears in the statute.viewed as a whole,these features suggest the legislature envisioned a standard from which married couples could not freely depart.
in macdonald,supra,cal d,this court identified the kind of writing needed to transmute property by means of an express declaration under section a as wife suggests,macdonald confirms that lawmakers contemplated no exception to the special writing requirement like the one urged here.see phillippe shapell industries cal d,declining to create exception that would effectively nullify statutory rule.
in macdonald,margery and robert had been married several years when they learned that margery was terminally ill.they decided to divide their community assets,such as stocks and real property,into separate estates that could be inherited by the children each spouse had from a previous marriage.a short time later,robert received a large cash disbursement from the community pension plan he acquired during his marriage to margery.consistent with the couple general estate plan,the pension funds were deposited into ira accounts opened solely in robert name at three different financial institutions.the designated beneficiary of each account was a revocable living trust that robert had established in his children favor.both robert and margery signed standard form ira agreements.in doing so,margery consented to the designation of robert trust as the sole beneficiary of those accounts the consent paragraphs.macdonald,supra,cal d.
after margery died,the executor of her estate petitioned the court to establish a community property interest in the ira accounts.the trial court found that in signing the ira agreements,margery intended to transmute her community share of those funds into robert separate property.concluding that a valid transmutation had occurred,the trial court denied the petition.the court of appeal reversed on the ground the consent paragraphs did not satisfy section a.this court granted robert petition for review.the court affirmed the judgment.macdonald,supra,cal d,see id.at,conc.opn.of mosk,id.at,dis.opn.of arabian.
macdonald held that notwithstanding evidence that robert and margery intended to divide their community property into separate estates,any attempt to change the character of the pension funds failed under section a.the court acknowledged that the consent paragraphs in the ira agreements satisfied two of the three statutory requirements.specifically,they were in writing,and were accepted,signed by margery,the adversely affected spouse.macdonald,supra,cal d.however,the documents lacked an express declaration by which transmutations must be made.ibid.in defining and applying this phrase,macdonald held that the ira documents needed language expressly stating that margery was effecting a change in the character or ownership of community property.cal d at,italics added see id.at.nothing indicated that she knew the legal effect of her signature might be to alter the character or ownership of her interest in the pension funds.id.at.
macdonald relied heavily upon the legislative history to construe the critical statutory phrase.cal d,fn.the court summarized this history,as follows.
in,the legislature adopted section as recommended by the california law revision commission commission.the commission reported that under california law at the time,spouses could easily transmute marital property,including real estate,without adhering to any rules or formalities.recommendation relating to marital property presumptions and transmutations cal.law revision com.pp.commission report.the commission report made clear that in such cases,transmutations could be based on oral statements,implications from conduct,or documents not manifesting a clear intent to transmute property.id.at,fn,citing reppy,debt collection from married californians problems caused by transmutations,management,and invalid marriage san diego.describing objectionable transmutation cases.according to the commission,the easy transmutation rule generated extensive litigation and unseemly tactics in dissolution cases.com,supra,at.it encouraged spouses to transform a passing comment into an agreement or even to commit perjury by manufacturing an oral or implied transmutation.ibid.
macdonald,supra,cal d,continued the commission drafted section to achieve two basic goals.first,the statute new requirements would increase certainty as to whether a transmutation had in fact occurred.com,supra,at.second,section would overrule existing case law insofar as it did not require a transmutation to be both written and express.com,supra,at.
against this backdrop,macdonald concluded that section blocks efforts to transmute marital property based on,behavioral,or is easily manipulated and unreliable.macdonald,supra,cal d.thus,according to macdonald,the legislature could not have meant to validate any writing offered to prove a change in the character of property.ibid.though no particular terminology is required id.at,the writing must reflect a transmutation on its face,and must eliminate the need to consider other evidence in divining this intent.id.at.macdonald observed that this construction of the statute achieves the stated aims of reducing litigation and discouraging perjury.ibid.
finally,macdonald acknowledged that section might prevent courts from finding a transmutation in cases where some evidence suggests the spouses meant to change the character of their property,but where they failed to follow the statutory requirements.however,macdonald attributed any incongruous results to the manner in which lawmakers ultimately chose to balance the competing policy concerns.macdonald declined to the legislative decision to sacrifice informality in transmutations in favor of protecting community property and promoting judicial economy.macdonald,supra,cal d.
the foregoing principles support wife view that no valid transmutation of husband retirement accounts could occur absent her express written consent transforming them into husband separate property.according to macdonald,supra,cal d,such a transaction necessitates not only a writing,but a special kind of writing,one in which the adversely affected spouse expresses a clear understanding that the document changes the character or ownership of specific property.it follows from this special writing requirement that section a can not be satisfied where there is no writing about the subject property at all,and where a transmutation would have to be inferred from acts surrounding the contract in dispute.
subsequent decisions adhere closely to macdonald,and decline to find a valid transmutation absent express written language to that effect.estate of bibb th,d dmv printout changed vehicle registration,not ownership in re marriage of barneson th,d written brokerage instructions changed possession,not ownership,of stock.other authorities conclude that under macdonald,supra,cal d,section a is not satisfied solely by one spouse detrimental reliance upon the other oral promise to transmute property.in re marriage of campbell th,d campbell wife acquired no interest in husband home where she spent her money remodeling property after he promised to share title cal.community property with tax analysis matthew bender,transmutation of property,b,to.a contrary view would threaten to resurrect the easy transmutation rule that the legislature repudiated when it enacted section years ago.see estate of nelson d.transmutation may be inferred from all the circumstances,including acts and oral statements giacomazzi rowe d,transmutation may occur where one party has performed all that he promises to perform and the other accepts all the benefits.as a result,the lack of a writing expressly changing the character of husband retirement accounts seems fatal to finding a transmutation here.
husband responds that nothing in the statute history or macdonald prevents part performance from excusing the special writing that section a requires.he emphasizes the law revision commission report on the family code,especially the comment to section,which states that the ordinary rules and formalities applicable to real property transfers apply also to transmutations of real property between the spouses,cal.law revision com.com.on,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll,commission comment.the commission comment also cites the statute of frauds in civil code section.west ann,supra.husband theorizes that this language shows the legislature wanted section a to encompass not only the rules and formalities imposed by the statute of frauds,but also traditional exceptions to those rules and formalities,such as the one urged here.
preliminarily,the general statute of frauds in civil code section a was enacted in,and has been expanded over the years to cover various kinds of contracts,most involving real property and commercial matters.the statute requires either a written contract or some note or memorandum subscribed by the party to be charged.ibid.since the statute of frauds primarily serves to prove that a contract exists casa herrera,beydoun cal th,d,the writing need only mention certain essential franklin hansen cal d,or meaningful terms.phillippe shapell industries,supra,cal d.ambiguities can be resolved by extrinsic evidence franklin hansen,supra,cal d at,which serves as a reliable indicator of the parties intent in commercial or other arms length transactions.see casa herrera,beydoun,supra,cal th at,d.
however,where assertion of the statute of frauds would cause unconscionable injury,part performance allows specific enforcement of a contract that lacks the requisite writing.earhart william low cal d.the doctrine most commonly applies in actions involving transfers of real property.code civ,subd.a part performance available to enforce agreement to convey real property absent writing required under of same code paul layne bowler cal d,sutton warner th,d trout ogilvie.yet,part performance also has been used to enforce other contracts that violate the statute of frauds in civil code section a.maddox rainoldi d,see note,part performance,estoppel,and the california statute of frauds stan.in any event,to constitute part performance,the relevant acts either must unequivocally refer to the contract trout ogilvie,supra.at,or clearly relate to its terms.sutton warner,supra,th at,d,citing paul layne bowler,supra,cal d at.such conduct satisfies the evidentiary function of the statute of frauds by confirming that a bargain was in fact reached.see casa herrera,beydoun,supra,cal th,d.
here,we see no evidence the legislature intended to incorporate traditional exceptions to the statute of frauds into section.indeed,the commission comment invoked by husband supports the opposite proposition.
the commission comment distills the earlier commission report.the commission report does not mention part performance under the statute of frauds,or indicate that part performance can supplant the express writing dictated by section a.rather,as discussed in macdonald,supra,cal d,the commission report criticized oral and implied transmutations,and recommended a special writing requirement to reduce confusion and abuse.by alluding to the ordinary rules and formalities in civil code section a,the commission comment merely implies that transmutations no longer entail less formality than transactions subject to the statute of frauds.nor does the commission comment mean that transmutations should be treated the same as transactions subject to the statute of frauds,or that the former is not deserving of greater formality than the latter.husband cites no legislative history to support his part performance claim 
husband next asks us to follow hall hall d.hall,which enforced a premarital contract that violated the applicable writing requirement.see contract between prospective spouses must be in writing and signed by both parties,former same,added by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch.husband claims the policies governing premarital contracts apply equally to postnuptial transmutations,and that the courts should treat these transactions the same in deciding whether and how to enforce them.
in hall,supra,d,the court of appeal upheld a judgment enforcing an oral agreement entered between the decedent and his second wife plaintiff before they married giving her a life estate in his home.the decedent had prepared an amendment to his estate plan granting such an interest,but he died before the documents could be signed.the court of appeal rejected arguments by the representatives and heirs of the estate,the decedent sons from his prior marriage that the premarital agreement was unenforceable because it lacked the writing required under section and its predecessor.the court determined that plaintiff partially performed the contract by taking steps before the marriage that unequivocally refer red to its terms.d at.in particular,she quit her job and retired early in exchange for the financial security of having an interest in the decedent home.in reaching this conclusion,the court characterized section as an ordinary statute of frauds d at.to which traditional exceptions like part performance applied.id.at.
whether or not hall reached a correct result under the statute there at issue,its analysis has no application here.the statutory scheme in hall seeks to enhance the enforceability of agreements entered in contemplation of marriage.in re marriage of bonds cal th,d,bonds see et.uniform premarital agreement act.despite recent changes linking the voluntariness of premarital contracts to the availability of independent counsel,subd.c,added by stats,ch,and despite the noncommercial nature of such contracts bonds,supra,cal th at,d,prospective spouses negotiate at greater arms length than married persons.see,subd.b section b spouses share fiduciary relationship bonds,supra,cal th at,d,persons entering premarital contracts do not share fiduciary relationship glass,trading up postnuptial agreements,fairness,and a principled new suitor for california cal,unique emotional concerns can affect contracts between spouses.hence,contrary to what husband
