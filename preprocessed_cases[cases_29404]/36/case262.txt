in the wake of his divorce,rafik hanna was ordered by an illinois court to make payments to his daughter.for the most part,he flouted this order.after several years of nonpayment and a move to washington state,a federal grand jury in chicago indicted hanna on charges that he willfully failed to pay a support obligation to a child residing in another state,in violation of the deadbeat parents punishment act of,section.a jury convicted hanna,and the district court sentenced him to two years imprisonment and a year of supervised release the court also ordered him to pay in restitution.in this appeal,hanna primarily attacks the sufficiency of the evidence on two income and willfulness.hanna adds that the district court should have instructed the jury on the tax code,that it abused its discretion by admitting unfairly prejudicial evidence,and that it erred by failing to alter the restitution order to reflect a support payment that he made after he was convicted.we conclude that the district court committed no reversible error and thus affirm the judgment.
when his daughter was born in,hanna was earning roughly annually as a pathologist in illinois.shortly after her birth,hanna and his wife sought a divorce,which was finalized in march.in september,an illinois court ordered hanna to make biweekly payments of through august.at times,the court enforced its order by garnishing hanna wages.hanna asserts that in he began having trouble finding steady employment.around that time,he stopped working as a pathologist and left illinois for the pacific northwest.
hanna landed in vancouver,washington,a suburb of portland,oregon.there,for a brief time,he maintained a checking account at bank of america.but then the washington state division of child support sent him a number of notices informing him that he owed over in back payments.he elected not to respond to those notices,and so in december,the washington authorities attached the entire balance just over then in the account.rather than replenishing it and thus making more money available to the state,hanna closed it.a year later,after additional requests for payment,the state suspended hanna license to practice medicine in washington.
in the meantime,hanna was living quite well.hanna took out a lease for a lexus es in october,and paid nearly a month for the car through september.in december,just three months after losing his washington medical license,he leased a porsche boxster s,putting down and agreeing to pay a month for five years.on the lease application,hanna listed an annual income between and.in august hanna leased a third car a jaguar for almost per month,and in march hanna took out a fourth lease of a month for an audi.all the while,hanna spent significant sums on travel,gifts,and entertainment.he vacationed at spa resorts on catalina island in california,on victoria island in british columbia,and at sunriver in oregon he played golf at championship courses he frequented the symphony and professional basketball games he funded expensive shopping excursions for a new girlfriend at clothiers such as bebe and nordstrom and he even took a trip to walt disney world.
to support this lifestyle,hanna maintained two accounts in canada at the bank of nova scotia.between april and april,those accounts took in over,a significant portion of which came from members of hanna family.hanna explained that his family had supported him during this period because he had no income and was unable to secure any form of substantial employment a condition explained in large part by the fact that other states followed washington lead and revoked the remainder of his medical licenses.hanna ability to spend freely,he maintains,was further limited by the gifts themselves because they came with strings attached.the donors,according to hanna,insisted that he use the funds only to cover his own support and his credit card payments apparently they did not want him to keep current with his obligations.
in may,two weeks after his indictment,hanna was arrested.shortly thereafter,special agent robin bonn of the department of health and human services interviewed hanna,who admitted that he had not met his obligations even after receiving notices and warnings about the possible suspension of his medial licenses.when asked why he had not paid,hanna replied defiantly,i am not going to use my life lines to pay child support.i using them to pay myself.at trial,bonn testified about the interview.during closing arguments the government displayed hanna statement beneath photographs of his daughter and a porsche boxster hanna objected to the exhibit,but the district judge overruled the objection.in his closing argument,hanna lawyer referred to the tax code alluding to hanna theory that income for purposes of obligations is identical to income for purposes of federal taxes the lawyer later tried unsuccessfully to persuade the district court to instruct the jury on tax law.the jury convicted,and the court then ordered the usual investigation.just a week before his sentencing hearing,hanna suddenly paid toward his arrearage.as part of the sentence,the court ordered hanna to pay as amount he owed in back support payment as of the day of his conviction,without in so many words taking into account the payment.this appeal followed.
hanna first presents two arguments based on the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.both derive from his assertion that between and he lived almost exclusively on gifts from family members.to succeed,hanna must convince us that even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,no rational jury could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see jackson virginia,united states smith,cir.neither of hanna arguments comes close to meeting that standard.
first,hanna asserts that there was insufficient evidence of his income to sustain his conviction.in his view,gifts do not constitute income under the child support order because they receive special treatment under the internal revenue code it thus follows,he asserts,that he could not have violated section.punishment under section,however,has nothing to do with a defendant income for tax purposes,and the word income is nowhere to be found in the statute.section punishes any person who willfully fails to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than years,or is greater than.a.state law determines which financial resources may be considered in setting a support obligation under the statute we do not have before us the question whether the state court properly applied its own law in setting a support obligation,nor would that be within our jurisdiction in any event.see id.f united states kramer,cir.
though hanna seems to concede the latter point,his argument apparently rests on the fact that illinois courts look at a noncustodial parent net income when computing the amount of child support due.see ilcs a section.though largely beside the point,hanna argument misunderstands illinois law.gifts from family members are part of a parent net income under section and are properly included when an illinois court tabulates how much to require from a parent when ordering child support.see in re marriage of rogers.bequests are also normally income for purposes of child support,even though they receive special treatment under the internal revenue code.
hanna second argument focuses on whether there was enough evidence to permit the jury to find that his conduct was willful.he takes the position that,because his gifts came with strings attached and he was obligated to follow the wishes of the giftors and utilize the funds to pay himself rather than paying his child support,there is no evidence that he willfully avoided paying his support obligation.frankly,this strikes us as frivolous.first,there is no reason why the jury was obliged to credit this explanation,nor is there any reason to think that illinois would enforce this kind of private expectation.we have joined other circuits in holding that the willfulness element u
