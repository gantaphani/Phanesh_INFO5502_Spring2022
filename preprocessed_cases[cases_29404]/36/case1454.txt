tiffany appeals from the termination of her parental rights to nikki r.the sole issue she raises is the failure by orange county social services agency to give notice under the indian child welfare act.we reverse and remand with directions for further proceedings.
nikki was taken into protective custody by the orange county social services agency ssa at the age of six months,after her mother called the child abuse registry for help.nikki is a medically fragile child who has suffered from a gastric reflux condition since birth,resulting in chronic crying,pain,and an inability to keep food down.although the mother was able to care for nikki sister,she was unable to provide nikki with the proper medical care due to her own medical problems,which include crohn disease,panic disorder,and depression.she had failed to take nikki to the doctor for recommended tests and had not refilled the child prescription for medication designed to manage the condition.nikki weighed pounds at the time of detention and had not gained any weight for a month.she was placed in the emergency shelter home of ruth and ronald 
at the detention hearing,the juvenile court asked the mother if she or the alleged father had american indian heritage.the mother replied that she did not,but the father had cherokee heritage.the juvenile court immediately ordered the bureau of indian affairs as well as the cherokee tribe be noticed of the proceedings.the father was incarcerated and had been so since nikki birth.
both parents entered a plea of nolo contendre to the allegations of the petition,and the juvenile court declared nikki a dependent of the court in june.at the dispositional hearing in july,the court denied reunification services to the father but ordered them provided to the mother.the mother case plan required her to participate in counseling,psychiatric care,and programs addressing domestic violence and parenting issues.she was ordered to maintain a stable residence,stay sober,and obtain resources to meet the needs of your children and to provide a safe home.the mother was permitted unmonitored visits of four hours each.
at the review hearing held in january,ssa reported the mother had not complied with her case plan and had missed most of her visits with nikki.the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a permanency planning hearing for may.
by the time of the permanency planning hearing,nikki was eighteen months old and thriving in the home.her gastric reflux condition was under control due to medication and close monitoring by her pediatrician she exhibited no developmental delays.at the outset of the hearing,the juvenile court considered the mother petition under section,filed that day,which requested additional reunification services.the court denied a hearing on the petition,finding there had not been a sufficient change of circumstances and no showing that the requested relief would be in the best interest of the child.the court then terminated parental rights and ordered nikki placed for adoption.
discussion 
the mother appeal raises the sole issue of compliance with the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act et icwa.congress enacted icwa in to protect indian children and their tribes from the erosion of tribal ties and cultural heritage and to preserve future indian generations.in re desiree th,d.because the tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield,d,a tribe has the right to intervene in a state court dependency proceeding at any time c.this significant right,however,is meaningless unless the tribe is notified of the proceedings.dwayne superior court th,d.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under the icwa irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.in re kahlen d.
the notice provision of icwa provides,in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or indian custodian and the tribe.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary a.if the notice provision is not followed,an indian child,parent,or the tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action.
the determination of a child indian status is up to the tribe therefore,the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement.in re antoinette th,d dwayne superior court,supra,th at,d cal.rules of court,rule d a.both the court and the county welfare department have an affirmative duty to inquire whether a dependent child is or may be an indian child.cal.rules of court,rule d.
preliminarily,we address ssa contention that the issue of icwa notice has been waived because the mother knew or should have known at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing that icwa compliance was an issue and failed to appeal from that judgment.ssa contention is not correct.
case law is clear that the issue of icwa notice is not waived by the parent failure to first raise it in the trial court.in re jennifer th,d.and two recent cases have concluded it is not waived by the parent failure to appeal the claimed error at the earliest opportunity.in re marinna th,d dwayne superior court,supra,th,d.in marinna,the court reasoned that a parent could not waive the tribe right to adequate notice because that would make it virtually certain that the tribe could not assert its rights under icwa.under these circumstances,it would be contrary to the terms of the act to conclude that parental inaction could excuse the failure of the juvenile court to ensure that notice under the act was provided to the indian tribe named in the proceeding.our conclusion is consistent with the protections afforded in the act to the interests of indian tribes.in re marinna,supra,th at,d.
dwayne reached the same result but based its conclusion on the icwa provision granting any party the right to petition to invalidate a proceeding if the notice provisions are violated.plus,the court found the notice issue survived the availability of an earlier appeal because the juvenile court has a sua sponte duty to give the requisite notice itself or ensure the social services agency compliance with the notice requirement n otice is intended to protect the interests of indian children and tribes despite the parents inaction.dwayne superior court,supra,th at,d.both cases disagreed with in re pedro th,d,which held a parent failure to timely appeal a notice issue under icwa waived the issue on a later appeal.
the reasoning of marinna and dwayne persuades us.the notice requirement is designed to protect the interests of the tribe to the extent a notice defect impairs the tribe ability to participate,another party can not waive it.
we turn now to the mother claim that the icwa notice here was inadequate.the record before the juvenile court contained no evidence that ssa made any effort to elicit information about nikki indian heritage.although the court ordered ssa to notify the bureau of indian affairs bia and the cherokee nation,ssa did not mention the issue again except to indicate in its reports that the indian child welfare act did not apply.where there is reason to believe a dependent child may be an indian child,defective icwa notice is usually prejudicial in re antoinette,supra,th at,d,resulting in reversal and remand to the juvenile cour
