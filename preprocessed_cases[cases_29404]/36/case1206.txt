in this appeal of the termination of parental rights based on noncompliance with the indian child welfare act icwa et,we are asked to reexamine our practice of limited reversals and remands in which we instruct the juvenile court to correct the icwa notice defect and reinstate the prior judgment of termination if no indian tribe chooses to intervene in the proceeding.
earl and appellate counsel for his dependent child,francisco,contend that we should depart from our usual practice in icwa cases and reverse the judgment without limitation,thereby allowing the juvenile court to revisit dependency issues outside icwa.francisco counsel claims such limited reversals violate due process,are inconsistent with a child best interests,and prevent the juvenile court from considering changes in the child circumstances concerning his or her adoptability.earl has joined in and adopted by reference the brief submitted by francisco counsel.cal.rules of court,rule a.
procedural and factual background 
on the night of november,earl brought his wife corina to the maternal grandmother house and refused to give corina a key to their residence an argument ensued.when earl drove away,corina,who was holding francisco,started chasing her husband.corina fell and dropped francisco on a neighbor lawn.corina continued to pursue earl,leaving francisco on the grass.the maternal uncle found francisco and brought him to the maternal grandmother house.the maternal grandmother refused to give francisco to corina until the police responded because she feared the child was at risk.the paternal grandmother told the social worker that she had native indian heritage through the cherokee tribe.
on november,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed a dependency petition on behalf of francisco,alleging he was at substantial risk of harm because his parents failed to adequately supervise and protect him.welf,subd.b.the original petition listed earl as an alleged father.
in his paternity questionnaire,earl indicated he possibly had cherokee heritage.the court ordered paternity tests and deferred icwa findings until it received the test results.the paternal grandmother,along with numerous relatives,attended the detention hearing.
also in november,the social worker sent icwa notices to the bureau of indian affairs bia and the three federally recognized cherokee tribes.the boxes in the child family history section of the form were largely left blank,and the social worker did not include any background information,birth date,birthplace for the paternal grandmother even though she had made herself available 
on december,corina submitted to the petition,which the court sustained.the court declared francisco a dependent child,placed him in the maternal grandmother home and ordered the parents to comply with their case plans the paternal grandmother attended the jurisdictional hearing.
on january,agency received a response from the cherokee nation of oklahoma,stating the tribe did not consider francisco to be an indian child based on the information supplied to it.
at the review hearing on june,the court ordered six more months of reunification services.the court also ordered agency to renotice the cherokee tribes for the scheduled review hearing in december.
in august,agency mailed notices to the bia and the three cherokee tribes for the second time.the record on appeal contains only a copy of the notice sent to the bia.the name of the paternal grandfather and his cherokee tribal affiliation were included in this notice,but not his birth date or birthplace.most of the boxes requesting information were marked unknown as opposed to being left blank as they were in the first round of notices.neither copies of the notices sent to the cherokee tribes nor certified mail receipts showing when the tribes received the second notices are included in the record.the bia responded that it needed more information to determine if francisco was an indian child.the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians of oklahoma and the eastern band of cherokee indians indicated that based on the information supplied to them,francisco was not a member of their respective tribes and they would not intervene.
subsequently,earl and corina moved to ohio to live with the maternal grandfather.francisco continued to reside with his maternal grandmother in san diego.
on january,the court ordered agency to again send out icwa notices to the cherokee tribes because the court file did not contain copies of the notices previously sent.again,in the new round of notices,most of the boxes requesting information in the pertinent form were marked unknown.the record indicates the cherokee nation received the notice on january,and the eastern band of cherokee indians received the notice on january.the record does not contain a certified mail receipt for the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians.
on january,the court found the cherokee tribes were properly noticed.on february,the court found icwa did not apply after agency indicated no tribes had responded to the latest batch of notices.
on february,the court also terminated services and set a section hearing.
agency assessed francisco as likely to be adoptable,characterizing him as an adorable and sociable in good health,who was attached to his caregiver.for the previous months,francisco had been in the home of his caregiver,who wanted to adopt him.in addition to the caregiver,there were other approved adoptive homes willing to adopt a child with francisco characteristics.
on july,the court found,by clear and convincing evidence,that it was likely francisco will be adopted if parental rights were terminated,none of the statutory exceptions to adoption existed in this case,and adoption was in francisco best interest.the court terminated parental rights.
earl filed a timely notice of appeal.
in january,attorneys for earl,agency and francisco signed a joint application and stipulation for reversal of judgment.the stipulation called for us to reverse the judgment and remand the matter with directions to order agency to renotice bia and the three cherokee tribes in accordance with icwa and case law.the stipulation also provided that if no tribe claimed francisco as an indian child,the judgment terminating parental rights would be reinstated.
on february,we granted the request by francisco counsel to withdraw his consent to the stipulated reversal and ordered the stipulation withdrawn.counsel for earl also filed a request to withdraw his consent for the stipulated reversal.
discussion 
iicwa violations and need for reversal are not disputed 
earl contends the juvenile court erred by proceeding with the section hearing because the icwa notices sent to the bia and the cherokee tribes were insufficient.earl also contends there was insufficient evidence supporting the court finding that timely icwa notice had been given.
in,congress enacted icwa,which allows an indian tribe to intervene in dependency proceedings,to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.
icwa sets forth specific notice requirements 
w here the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.
if the tribe identity can not be determined,notice must be given to the bia.a.the indian tribe determines whether the child is an indian child.in re desiree th,d.a tribe determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.dwayne superior court th,d.
notice must be sent when there is reason to believe the child may be an indian child.rule f.t he juvenile court needs only a suggestion of indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement.in re nikki th,d.
icwa notice requirements are strictly construed.in re karla th,d.the notice sent to the bia indian tribes must contain enough information to be meaningful.id.at,d.the notice must include if known,the indian child name,birthplace,and birth date the name of the tribe in which the indian child is enrolled or may be eligible for enrollment names and addresses of the child parents,grandparents,great grandparents,and other identifying information and a copy of the dependency petition.ibid.to enable the juvenile court to review whether sufficient information was supplied,agency must file with the court the icwa notice,return receipts and responses received from the bia and tribes.id.at,d.
it is essential to provide the indian tribe with all available information about the child ancestors,especially the one with the alleged indian heritage.in re louis th,d.notice to the tribe must include available information about the maternal and paternal grandparents and,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates place of birth and death current and former addresses tribal enrollment numbers and other identifying data.id.at,d.
under icwa,no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding may be held until at least days after the tribe receives notice.a see also rule h.the court must wait at least days following the sending of notice to determine that icwa does not apply based on the lack of a determinative response to the notice.rule f.
agency concedes that the juvenile court rulings regarding the adequacy of the icwa notices were erroneous.we agree.even though agency sent three sets of notices,none of them included sufficient information that would allow the tribes or the bia to determine francisco membership or eligibility for membership.in re karla,supra,th at,d in re louis,supra,th at,d.these defects persisted even though agency easily could have contacted the paternal grandmother for additional pertinent information 
parties dispute propriety of limited reversals in icwa cases 
at issue is the propriety of our well as that of our colleagues in various other dependency cases with icwa notice irregularities to issue limited reversals in which we order the judgment to be reinstated if no indian tribe intervenes after proper notice is given.as explained below,we conclude this practice is legally authorized,consistent with the best interests of children,and in keeping with fundamental principles of appellate practice.further,contrary to the positions advanced by earl and francisco appellate counsel,this approach does not infringe upon due process rights and does with the recent enactment of statutory the juvenile court from considering changes in the dependent child circumstances concerning his or her adoptability.
as an appellate court,we have the power to select among several permissible dispositions of a case on appeal,which are set forth in section of the code of civil procedure.the statute,which dates back to,provides that a reviewing court has authority to affirm,reverse,or modify any judgment or order appealed from,and may direct the proper judgment or order to be entered,or direct a new trial or further proceedings to be had.code of civ.moreover,i t is a firmly established principle of law that t he appellate courts have power to order a retrial on a limited issue,if that issue can be separately tried without such confusion or uncertainty as would amount to be a denial of a fair trial.citation.the underlying rationale is easy to discern to require a complete retrial when an issue could be separately tried without prejudice to the litigants would unnecessarily add to the burden of already overcrowded court calendars and could be unduly harsh on the parties.torres automobile club of california cal th,d.
when a judgment is reversed with directions,the appellate court order is contained in its remittitur,which revests the jurisdiction of the subject matter in the lower court and defines the scope of the lower court jurisdiction.the order of the appellate court as stated in the remittitur,is decisive of the character of the judgment to which the appellant is entitled.the lower court can not reopen the case on the facts,allow the filing of amended or supplemental pleadings,nor retry the case,and if it should do so,the judgment rendered thereon would be void.citation.hampton superior court cal d,bach county of butte d.the reversal of a judgment on appeal with directions to the trial court to enter a specific judgment determines the merits of the cause just as effectively as though the judgment were affirmed on appeal.lial superior court.
the limited reversal approach is well adapted to dependency cases involving termination of parental rights in which we find the only error is defective icwa notice.this approach allows the juvenile court to regain jurisdiction over the dependent child and determine the one remaining issue.the parties already have litigated all other issues at the section hearing,and it is not necessary to have a complete retrial.thus,the child is afforded the protection of the juvenile court,and,at the same time,his or her case is processed to cure the icwa error,which is more expeditious than a full rehearing of all section issues.indeed,a new section hearing would be subject to another appeal by not following our practice we could easily age a child out of adoptability into foster care,which is the least favored permanent plan.further,we know of no rule or law that would prohibit use of this procedure in child dependency cases.see in re zeth cal th,d,review of juvenile dependency cases governed by general rules of appellate procedure.
for some time,we have employed limited reversals in appeals involving defective icwa notice with directions to reinstate the judgment if no indian tribe chooses to intervene.see,dwayne superior court th,d order in re th,d judgment.this practice also is prevalent among the courts of appeal in this state.see,in re marinna th,d dist.in re samuel th,d dist.in re suzanna th,d,div.in re th,d dist.in re glorianna th,d dist.
the limited reversal disposition in defective notice icwa appeals is in keeping with the public policy of our child dependency scheme,which favors prompt resolution of cases.see in re marilyn cal th,d.the objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.id.at,d.delay in this regard does not serve the child best interest.in re emily d.after services have been terminated,dependency actions should be resolved expeditiously.in re jesusa cal th,d.courts should strive to give the child a stable,permanent placement,and a full emotional commitment,as promptly as reasonably possible consistent with protecting the parties rights and making a reasoned decision.in re celine cal th,d.
furthermore,this approach also is in accordance with established principles of appellate practice,which focus on the evidence before the trial court and do not consider postjudgment events.ordinarily,an appellate court is confined in its review to the proceedings that took place in the court below and are brought up for review in the record on appeal.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.thus,m atters occurring after entry of judgment are ordinarily not reviewable the appeal reviews the correctness of the judgment or order as of the time of its rendition,leaving later developments to be handled in subsequent litigation.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,at.as the appellate court in one early case put it 
the function of an appellate court is to review the action of the inferior court in rendering the judgment from which the appeal is taken.for this purpose a record of the proceedings before the inferior court and of the matters presented for its action is brought to the appellate court,and in determining the correctness of the judgment appealed from it is limited to a consideration of that record.if the judgment is affirmed such affirmance is as of the date at which it was rendered.if it is reversed the case stands as if no judgment had been rendered by the inferior court.it is therefore manifest that error on the part of the inferior court can not be predicated by reason of any matter
