appellant patricia robertson appeals the district court dismissal of her claims against appellees jimmy hecksel and the city of gainesville.corey rice,robertson son,was killed by officer hecksel during a traffic stop.as a result of his death,robertson argues she suffered a deprivation of her liberty interest in a continued relationship with her adult son.whether a parent has such a right her adult child is a question of first impression for this court.we hold that the fourteenth amendment substantive due process protections do not extend to the relationship between a mother and her adult son and,therefore,affirm the district court dismissal of robertson claims.
background 
the district court succinctly summarized the facts 
on january,decedent,corey rice decedent rice was pulled over in a traffic stop by city of gainesville police officer jimmy hecksel hecksel.hecksel did not use his police sirens to pull over decedent rice,nor did he use any lights to illuminate decedent rice car.when hecksel approached decedent rice car,he brandished his gun and struck the window with it.then,he moved in front of decedent rice automobile and pointed the gun at decedent rice.decedent rice started to drive away in the opposite direction,and hecksel fired his gun seven times,hitting decedent rice with four bullets.decedent rice was pronounced dead a few hours later.
robertson hecksel,case at.rice was years old at the time of his death.
the personal representative of rice estate reached a settlement with officer hecksel and the city of gainesville,completely releas ing and forever discharg ing the defendant s from any and all past,present or future claims or any future wrongful death claim of plaintiff representatives or heirs,which have resulted or may result from the alleged acts or omissions of the defendant s.the settlement also stated t he parties acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this release is intended nor shall anything be construed to release claims,if any,held by the mother of the decedent,patricia robertson.

ii.standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo,accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.swann health partners,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
constitutional right of companionship 
section is no source of substantive federal rights.instead,to state a section claim,a plaintiff must point to a violation of a specific federal right.whiting traylor,cir citing albright oliver,d plurality opinion.i n cases grounded on alleged parental liberty interests,we are venturing into the murky area of unenumerated constitutional rights.mccurdy dodd,cir citation omitted.when this happens,our first task is to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all.id.at citations and internal quotations omitted.we should tread lightly because b y extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest,we,to a great extent,place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.we must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,lest the liberty protected by the due process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court.washington glucksberg,d citations omitted.
a parent due process right in the care,custody,and control of her children is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by the supreme court.troxel granville,d plurality opinion.while this right provides parents with both substantive and procedural protections,the supreme court cases extending liberty interests of parents under the due process clause focus on relationships with minor children.mccurdy,at see also isaac adams,note,growing pains the scope of substantive due process rights of parents of adult children,vand,reviewing supreme court caselaw and finding no explicit guidance on how to decide the question of whether parents have a right to companionship with their adult children.
the substantive component of a parent right to care,custody,and control of her minor children has been relied upon to strike down several state statutes.the supreme court held a nebraska law,which prohibited the teaching of any foreign languages to students until after the eighth grade,deprived parents of their right to establish a home and bring up children which has been long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.meyer nebraska.citations omitted.similarly,an oregon law requiring parents to send their children to public schools was found unconstitutional by the court because it unreasonably interfere d with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.pierce soc y of sisters.see also wisconsin yoder,d holding application of wisconsin compulsory education law to amish children unconstitutional under the first amendment,in part,because t he history and culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children prince massachusetts.recognizing that the custody,care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents,whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder citation omitted.
a parent right to care,custody,and control of her minor children has also been the source of added procedural protections.for example,the supreme court struck down an illinois statute that made children of unwed fathers wards of the state upon the death of their mother.stanley illinois,d.there,the biological father interest undeniably warrant ed deference and,absent a powerful countervailing interest,protection.id.at.at.in santosky kramer,d,the court held a state is required to show by at least clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated because,among other reasons,t he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,custody,and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents id.at.at see also lassiter dep t of soc,d although refusing to hold the due process clause requires the state to appoint counsel for parents at a termination hearing,noting that a parent interest in the accuracy and injustice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is a commanding one.
it is against this backdrop that we analyze robertson claim.she would have us hold that the parental rights already recognized by the supreme court include a right to companionship with an adult child.robertson claim could potentially involve two very separate questions one,whether the asserted right exists and two,if the asserted right does exist,under what conditions does a deprivation occur,are we looking for negligent behavior,an intentional act.one must have a right before it can be deprived therefore,the of the accused party is irrelevant to the initial inquiry.
there appear to be three possible resolutions of robertson claim she has a right and can recover for incidental deprivations she has a right,but can not recover for incidental deprivations and she does not have a right.
the first,third,seventh,and district of columbia circuits have rejected claims like robertson where the alleged deprivation was incidental to the defendant actions.russ watts,cir mccurdy,at butera district of columbia,valdivieso ortiz burgos,cir less clear is whether those cases recognized
