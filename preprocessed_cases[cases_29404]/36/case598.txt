michael father appeals from an order of the juvenile court on his petition under welfare and institutions code section giving his minor son,korbin korbin,sole discretion whether father will have visits with him.korbin the sole respondent on appeal contends that father had no right to visitation under the circumstances of this case,and that therefore it was not improper to delegate to korbin the decision whether he will visit with father.
as we explain below,we conclude that where,as here,the court has not ordered reunification services because,under section,subdivisions b and d,the parent whereabouts were unknown for more than six months after the child home placement,the parent has no right to visitation.nonetheless,the court may order visitation in the exercise of its discretion under section,subdivision a,on a finding that such visitation will serve and protect the child best interests.but,as is the rule when visitation is ordered as part of a reunification plan,the court can not give the child sole discretion to determine whether such visitation will occur.rather,once the court determines that visitation is in the child best interests,the court must,as part of its duty to protect and serve those interests,ensure that such visitation occurs under terms set by the court.otherwise,by placing sole discretion whether visitation will occur in the hands of the child,the court will have ceded to the child the determination whether visitation is in the child best interests.therefore,we reverse the order regarding father visitation,and remand for the court to reconsider whether to order visitation,and if so,to set the terms of that visitation.
factual and procedural background 
in october,korbin born lived with his mother,mother,his born,and mother male companion,rene on december,the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs or agency filed a section petition on behalf of korbin and his,asserting jurisdiction under section,subdivisions a serious physical harm and b failure to protect.father whereabouts were unknown.
the section petition alleged that mother and rene engaged in a violent confrontation in the children presence mother and maternal grandmother engaged in a violent confrontation in the children presence mother had mental and emotional problems and failed to take her psychotropic medication and mother was a current abuser of marijuana and alcohol.
mother and korbin had not had contact with father since korbin was three weeks old.according to mother,father had made no efforts to contact her or korbin since then.mother told the caseworker that she had obtained a temporary restraining order against father because of domestic violence.
father was not present at the december,detention hearing.he was deemed to be korbin presumed father and was granted reunification services and,if he contacted dcfs,monitored visits.the juvenile court found a prima facie case was established for detaining korbin and ordered him detained with his maternal aunt.
in february,dcfs filed a declaration of due diligence,indicating that the agency had searched numerous sources,including prison,military,voter registration,department of motor vehicles,and records,and found seven addresses for father.see,subd.b a finding that a parent is whereabouts unknown shall be supported by an affidavit showing a reasonably diligent search was performed.the agency mailed certified notices to all seven addresses.
at the february,hearing,the juvenile court found that due diligence as to father whereabouts had been completed.the court found that father was korbin legal father and vacated the prior finding of presumed father status.the court declared korbin a dependent of the court under section,subdivision b,based on the allegation that mother mental and emotional problems rendered her unable to care for the children.the court dismissed the other allegations in the interest of justice.the court did not order reunification services for father but ordered monitored visits once he contacted the court or dcfs 
at the review hearing in august,the court found that mother was not in compliance with her case plan.at the month review hearing in february,the court terminated reunification services for mother and scheduled a section hearing for permanent placement.see,subd.g if court does not return child to parent at month hearing,court may order section hearing.
in july,dcfs mailed notice to father about the section hearing on selection of a permanent plan for korbin.father contacted dcfs and said that he had been trying to contact the agency for a month.he had not seen korbin for nine years,but he expressed willingness to have korbin placed with him.the section report stated that korbin missed mother and wanted to live with her,but he did not wish to have visits with father.
father appeared at the august section hearing.the court continued the hearing and denied father request for dna testing.
father filed a section petition in october,asking the court to set aside its february finding that dcfs issued proper notice to him and to order that korbin be released to his custody.he argued that dcfs should have found his address because he had maintained a current address with child support.he further argued that the requested order would be better for korbin because it would provide him with the love and stability a child deserves.
the court held a hearing on october,and denied father section petition.the court found that the agency exercised due diligence,noting that father address on his driver license still was not correct at the time of the section hearing.the court further concluded that father had not met his burden of showing that changing the prior order would be in korbin best interests,citing the following reasons korbin desire to remain with his maternal aunt and uncle,whom he considered to be his family father lack of a relationship with korbin,due in part to the restraining order against him for three years and korbin age.see in re th,d under section,the parent has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that new evidence or changed circumstances exist,and the proposed change would promote the best interests of the child.
the court concluded that changing the prior order would be too disruptive for korbin but expressed the opinion that as korbin matured,he might want a relationship with father.mother objected to any visits,stating that father had burned her other child with cigarettes and beaten her while she was pregnant.counsel for korbin also stated that korbin did not want any visits with father.the court expressed the desire to allow monitored visits in the future in case korbin changed his mind but explained that the decision to have any visits would be korbin.the court thus ordered dcfs to facilitate monitored visits with korbin and father in a therapeutic setting at korbin discretion.the court found that the permanent plan of legal guardianship was appropriate and continued the section hearing.father appealed.
discussion 
father contends that the juvenile court erred in giving korbin sole discretion over father visitation.we agree.although the court was not required to order visits for father,once it did so,it could not delegate the decision whether visitation would occur to korbin.rather,the court had the continuing obligation to supervise any such visitation and determine the terms under which visitation would occur.we therefore reverse the visitation order and remand for the court to reconsider whether to order visitation,and if so,the terms of the visitation.
case law consistently holds that the juvenile court can not delegate the decision whether visitation will occur to any third party,including the child,the social services agency,or the guardian.see,in re ethan th,d ethan juvenile court may not terminate dependency jurisdiction knowing that child refused to participate in visitation in re th,d the power to determine the right and extent of visitation by a noncustodial parent in a dependency case resides with the court and may not be delegated to nonjudicial officials or private parties.citation.in re kyle th,d juvenile
