patrisha jones seeks redress under for alleged violations of her fourth amendment rights arising from her seizure by two new mexico government officials at the bernalillo high school where jones was a student.this appeal relates to the dismissal of one of the two state officials on the basis of qualified immunity.the second official,a deputy sheriff,remains a party in the proceedings below.jones alleges that alfred haberman,a social worker supervisor for the new mexico children,youth,and families department cyfd,seized her at her high school with no legitimate justification,demanded that she leave her mother care,and insisted that she return to her abusive father.haberman made these alleged demands in the face of an existing court order assigning temporary custody to jones mother and forbidding the father from contacting jones.the district court dismissed her claims against haberman on the basis of qualified immunity,finding that haberman actions did not amount to a seizure and that,even if they did,the law was not clearly established at the time of the incident.accepting jones allegations as true,we conclude that haberman violated jones clearly established fourth amendment rights and reverse the district court order dismissing jones suit.
when reviewing a dismissal pursuant to rule b,we accept the allegations of the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see yoder honeywell,cir.construed in the most favorable light,the complaint reveals the following facts.
jones mother and father are not married and have been estranged for some time.jones had been living with her father for several years when,in the course of an argument,jones father and stepmother struck jones,causing her to sustain cuts on her neck and collarbone and bruising on her face.she was sixteen years old at the time.because her father is a former police officer and her stepmother is a friend of the county sheriff,jones was reluctant to report the incident.she did,however,meet with officials at bernalillo high school to discuss emancipation and revealed the details of the argument during the course of her conversation.as a result of jones disclosure,deputy hunt,a law enforcement officer employed by the sandoval county sheriff office,was dispatched to the school,apparently pursuant to the new mexico abuse and neglect act,stat.ann.to.he took jones to the sheriff department to meet with social worker haberman for an investigatory interview.at the conclusion of the interview,the two officials handed jones over to the custody of her adult sister,where she remained until she moved in with her mother two months later.
based on the incident of violence,jones mother filed for a protective order on her daughter behalf and obtained,on january,a temporary order of protection and order to appear tro against jones father,under the new mexico family violence protection act,to.in the tro,the state court gave jones mother temporary physical custody of jones and prohibited the father from having contact with jones until further order of the court.jones father was not aware that jones was living with her mother until receiving the tro.on the same day that they received the tro,jones father and stepmother met with deputy hunt to seek his assistance.hunt then left that meeting and took social worker haberman with him to the high school.the two officials confronted jones and told her,contrary to the terms of the tro,that she could not live with her mother.they insisted that she either choose to live with her father,again in contravention of the tro,or move into a shelter.
having made these demands,the officials left jones at the high school,at which point she went,to a school resource officer and stated that if she could not live with her mother she would kill herself.consequently,the resource officer referred jones to a school counselor and she promptly reported to his office.after conducting a risk assessment,the counselor determined that jones presented a low risk of suicide.meanwhile,hunt and haberman returned to the high school and,upon finding her in the counselor office,proceeded to threaten and harass her in the presence of the counselor for over two hours.the counselor then left,and the two in to tell jones for an additional hour or two that if she did not return to her father house,hunt would arrest her,that her life would be hell,that hunt and haberman would be her shadow until she was eighteen,and maybe longer,that they would ensure that her mother was sent to prison,that there was a zero percent chance that she would live with her mother,and that when she turned eighteen,she and her mother might be cell mates.jones cried throughout the encounter,and alleged that she was terrified of hunt and haberman and did not even think of challenging them.
by prearrangement with hunt and haberman,jones father and stepmother were waiting at the school.jones emerged from the counselor office and,complying with hunt and haberman demands,went to her father house.the following day,hunt called jones mother and informed her that jones was now living with her father.he also falsely told jones mother that the tro had been reversed and the hearing set for january was cancelled.jones mother learned subsequently that hunt had misled her,and she attended the january hearing,although she did not testify.at this point,the record is unclear as to the result of the january hearing.the complaint alleges,in somewhat confusing fashion,that the special commissioner declined to issue a further restraining order.jones,having contacted attorneys and received assurance that she would not be arrested for refusing to return to her father home,moved into a youth shelter the evening after the hearing.
jones later sued hunt and haberman under,claiming a violation of her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures on the basis of its conclusion that the altercation in the counselor office between jones and the two officials did not amount to an unconstitutional seizure and that,even if it did,haberman did not violate clearly established law,the district court granted haberman motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity.jones appeals that order.
we review de novo a district court ruling on qualified immunity.farmer perrill,cir.qualified immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.mitchell forsyth,d.our threshold inquiry in the qualified immunity analysis is whether,taking jones allegations as true,haberman violated jones fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.hope pelzer,d.if we conclude that jones has alleged constitutionally impermissible conduct,haberman may nevertheless be shielded from liability for civil damages if his actions did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.id.at.citation omitted.
applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment due process clause,the fourth amendment provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated const.amend.iv.because the amendment focuses on safeguarding persons from unwarranted intrusion,and not on regulating the behavior of particular governmental actors,the prohibition against unreasonable seizures extends to civil,as well as criminal,investigations by the government.see,dubbs head start,cir the focus of the amendment is thus on the security of the person,not the identity of the searcher or the purpose of the search.marshall barlow,d if the government intrudes on a person property,the privacy interest suffers whether the government motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards.we have held that the fourth amendment subjects state social workers to its requirements.see dubbs,at there is no social worker exception to the fourth amendment.
a seizure occurs for fourth amendment purposes when a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.michigan chesternut,d.in united states hill,cir,we identified several factors to guide our determination of whether a person was,in fact,seized.they include 
the threatening presence of several officers the brandishing of a weapon by an officer some physical touching by an officer use of aggressive language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with an officer request is compulsory prolonged retention of a person personal effects a request to accompany the officer to the station interaction in a nonpublic place or a small,enclosed place and absence of other members of the public.
hill,at.we have refused to treat any of the factors cited above as dispositive.united states glass,cir united states little,cir en banc only in rare instances will any one factor produce an inexorable conclusion that a seizure has occurred.nor are these factors exclusive.see united states griffin,cir we have avoided hard line rules to govern this analysis,and our opinion today should not be interpreted as an exhaustive pronouncement.rather,we base our fourth amendment analysis on the totality of the circumstances.united states shareef,cir citation omitted.when viewing the totality of the circumstances,it may be that the strong presence of two or three factors demonstrates that a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to terminate an encounter with government officials.
we must view jones encounter with haberman and hunt through the eyes of a reasonable.see little,at whether the person being questioned is a child or an adult is relevant to whether a person would have felt free to leave see also doe heck,cir child was seized with in the meaning of the fourth amendment because no reasonable child would have believed that he was free to leave.seen from a such a perspective,we are inexorably driven to the conclusion that a reasonable would not have felt free to terminate the encounter with hunt and haberman.
jones encounter with hunt and haberman,two government officials,one of whom was in police uniform,took place in a small,confined school counselor office,to which jones had been sent by a school official after threatening suicide.see hill,at.jones was a girl whom these very officials had transported from the high school to the sheriff department for an investigatory interview two months earlier.she knew that they had the authority to determine her custodial care,as they had previously turned her over to the custody of her older sister.finding herself alone with these two officials for an hour or two,jones endured their repeated threats that if she did not agree to live with her father,they would arrest her and follow her for at least the next two years,ensuring that her life would be hell.as evidenced by her crying,she was obviously emotionally fragile and distraught.see little,at a citizen subjective state of mind is relevant to the extent that it may have been known to the officer and influenced his conduct.an emotionally vulnerable would not have felt free to terminate that encounter.
the district court concluded that the threats of arrest did not contribute to the seizure,because a ny compliance haberman demanded concerned jones future living arrangements and did not concern an alleged inability to leave the counselor office at that moment.construing the facts in the light most favorable to jones,the district court conclusion is incorrect.jones was living with her mother at the time of the encounter.a reasonable would have interpreted hunt and haberman threats to mean that if she did not agree to go home with her was waiting at the school to receive her following her encounter with hunt and she would be arrested.jones reasonably believed that leaving the office,and thus refusing to go home with her father,would result in her arrest.
additionally,the court below found that jones went to the counselor office voluntarily,which points away from a seizure.this finding is at odds with the allegation in the complaint.jones claims that the school resource officer referred jones to the counselor to determine if she were at risk of committing suicide.a reasonable high school student would not have felt free to flaunt a school official command,leave an office to which she had been sent,and wander the halls of her high school without permission.it is possible that jones initial encounter with hunt and haberman was consensual.regardless,it was transformed into a seizure through hunt and haberman alleged threats and demands.see little,a consensual encounter between a citizen and police can be transformed into a seizure through persistent and accusatory questioning by police.
our conclusion that the alleged encounter constituted a seizure is but the first part of the constitutional analysis.we must yet determine if the seizure was reasonable,an inquiry that depends on the context in which it took place.new jersey,d.with limited exceptions,a search or seizure requires either a warrant or probable cause.camara municipal court,d except in certain carefully defined classes of cases,a search of private property without proper consent is unreasonable unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant,at.ordinarily,a search must be based upon probable cause to believe that a violation of the law has occurred.however,we have in a number of cases recognized the legality of searches and seizures based on suspicions that,although reasonable,do not rise to the level of probable cause.
the court below relied on one such exception recognized by the supreme court in.in,the supreme court held that where school officials detain and question a child for the purpose of maintaining or restoring order in the school 
the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause to believe that the subject of the search has violated or is violating the law.rather,the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness,under all the circumstances,of the search.
at.adopting the terry standard,the court explained that a search of a student by a school official is reasonable if justified at its inception and reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.id.quoting terry ohio,d.we have held that the same considerations which moved the supreme court to apply a relaxed fourth amendment standard in cases involving school searches support applying the same standard in school seizure cases.edwards rees,cir applying terry standard where a junior high school vice principal seizes a student to question him about a bomb threat.therefore,we have held since that seizures of students by school officials must pass the terry test.
because haberman and hunt seizure of jones took place on public school property,the district court erroneously concluded that the relaxed fourth amendment standard announced in should apply to this case the supreme court fashioned a relaxed standard due to its concern about unduly burden ing the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their schools,at.because the case before us does not involve efforts by school administrators to preserve order on school property,it does not implicate the policy concerns addressed in and therefore does not merit application of the standard 
it is ultimately unnecessary for us to decide what fourth amendment test is most appropriate in this case because the conduct alleged in this case would violate the most minimal standard of which we can conceive.snell tunnell,cir.even applying the terry a seizure must be justified at its inception and reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place haberman violated jones fourth amendment rights.terry,at.
taking the facts as alleged,haberman seizure of jones was not justified at its inception.id.the complaint does not allege that haberman suspected jones mother of abusive or neglectful behavior on the other hand,there was sufficient evidence of her father abusiveness to both warrant transfer from his custody w
