this case presents the issue of whether declaratory relief is available in juvenile dependency cases in the context of a child welfare agency not complying with statutory time requirements for the filing of supplemental petitions.
claudia and her half sister,chloe,sought declaratory relief after the imperial county department of social services department twice removed them from the home of their mother,without timely filing a supplemental petition under welfare and institutions code section.the juvenile court denied the children relief,ruling that the children had not exhausted their remedies.the children appeal.and eric,the alleged father of claudia,join in and adopt the children arguments.cal.rules of court,rule a.
on march,the department took claudia and chloe into protective custody after police arrested and chloe father,albert,for domestic violence and resisting a police officer the department filed dependency petitions on behalf of claudia,then years old,and chloe,then months old,alleging they were at substantial risk of harm because of their exposure to domestic violence,and and albert substance abuse,subd.b.chloe had a positive toxicology screen for drugs at birth.
the juvenile court sustained the petitions as amended,declared claudia and chloe dependent children and removed them from parental custody.the court ordered and albert to follow their case plans.
because claudia wanted to live with her mother and complied with her reunification services,the department returned the children to her before the review hearing.at the review hearing,the court placed claudia and chloe with under a family maintenance plan.subsequently,the court allowed albert to return to the home.
on june,at the review hearing,the court granted and albert an additional six months of family maintenance.
however,on july the department filed a supplemental petition pursuant to section on behalf of claudia and chloe,seeking to remove the children to a more restrictive placement.the petition alleged that and albert had resumed their drug abuse and domestic violence,and albert was verbally abusive toward claudia.claudia and chloe had been removed a week earlier and placed in separate foster homes.the detention hearing for the children was originally scheduled for july,eight days after they were removed,and the matter was continued for an additional day at request.
at the july detention hearing,claudia counsel informed the court that claudia wanted to return home as soon as possible.the court ordered the children be detained and remain in foster care.
on july the court,at the request of the department,dismissed the count involving in the supplemental petition and ordered claudia and chloe returned to her.the court noted had been doing well with her services since the time of the detention.
on october the department filed a second supplemental petition,alleging had a drug relapse and was not adequately caring for the children.claudia and chloe had been removed from custody four days earlier.
at the october detention hearing,the court detained claudia and chloe in a foster home in calexico.
also on october,counsel for claudia and chloe hereafter children counsel sought a declaration from the juvenile court under code of civil procedure section,that the department procedure regarding the filing of supplemental petitions was illegal.the declaratory relief motion by children counsel alleged that the department had a policy of filing petitions as much as a week after removal despite the statutory requirement that petitions be filed within hours after removal the motion sought 
to end the controversy over what procedure is proper when a child is removed from one placement to a more restrictive placement.this issue is important and comes up on a regular basis it is the public defender office position that the social workers do not know the law regarding subsequent,supplemental and modification petitions m any of the social workers are of the erroneous belief that it is proper to remove a child to a more restrictive placement and then file a supplemental petition a week or so later.
the department opposed the motion for declaratory relief.although acknowledging the section petition was filed late because it was not filed within hours of the children removal,the department argued below that a motion for declaratory relief under code of civil procedure section is not available in juvenile court.the department also pointed out that case law allows the juvenile court to proceed on a supplemental petition that is filed late.
on november the court denied the motion for declaratory relief because the proper remedy when the child is detained more than hours before the filing of the supplemental petition is a writ of habeas corpus,which was sought after in this case.the court also said that to obtain declaratory relief you need to exhaust any possible remedies and that would have been the writ of habeas corpus.
discussion 
children counsel contends that the juvenile court erred by refusing to consider the motion for declaratory relief for an invalid,there was no exhaustion of available remedies.we agree.furthermore,we conclude declaratory relief is available in juvenile court if there is an actual controversy between the parties as required under the law.
nature of declaratory relief 
declaratory relief is an equitable remedy,which is available to an interested person in a case of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties code civ,dills delira d.
the purpose of a declaratory judgment is to serve some practical end in quieting or stabilizing an uncertain or disputed jural relation.maguire hibernia soc.cal d.another purpose is to liquidate doubts with respect to uncertainties or controversies which might otherwise result in subsequent litigation.bess park d.the proper interpretation of a statute is a particularly appropriate subject for judicial resolution.smith anderson cal d,fn.additionally,judicial economy strongly supports the use of declaratory relief to avoid duplicative actions to challenge an agency statutory interpretation or alleged policies.bess park,supra,d at,venice town council city of los angeles th,d.
the remedy of declarative relief is cumulative and does not restrict any other remedy.code civ.accordingly,it is difficult to see how a good complaint for declaratory relief can be deemed insufficient because some other remedy is available.witkin,cal.proc.ed.pleading,accord,filarsky superior court cal th,d,mere circumstance that another remedy is available is an insufficient ground for refusing declaratory relief.as the court of appeal noted in jones robertson d,
i t is wrong for courts to decline a declaration on the mere ground that another remedy was available,for declaratory relief was not intended to be exclusive or extraordinary,but alternative and optional.it is only where the court believes that more effective relief can and should be obtained by another procedure and that for that reason a declaration will not serve a useful purpose,that it is justified in refusing a declaration because of the availability of another remedy.
we find the juvenile court erred by rejecting the motion for declaratory relief on the sole basis that counsel had not exhausted any possible remedies.
the department defends the court rationale for denying the declaratory relief motion on the basis that the court determined such relief was not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances.code civ.the department argument presumes that habeas corpus was a more effective vehicle for the relief.see filarsky superior court,supra,cal th at,d.we are not persuaded.children counsel was not seeking release of the children to parental custody as a sanction for the department untimely filing of the petitions rather,counsel was seeking a declaration that the department had misconstrued the statutory time requirements and had an ongoing policy of filing supplemental petitions on a tardy basis.under these circumstances,a writ of habeas corpus to release the children from protective custody would not have been a more effective remedy than declarator
