after colin mcroberts and jean fawcett divorced,mcroberts moved from scotland to virginia with the couple son,travis.fawcett filed a petition in federal court in virginia requesting that the court order travis return to scotland pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction the convention,and the international child abduction remedies act icara,west.the district court granted fawcett petition and mcroberts has appealed.because the district court erred in its interpretation and application of scottish law,we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
mcroberts and fawcett married in scotland in.during their marriage they had two children melody whose custody is not at issue here,in,and travis,in.by,their marriage was experiencing difficulties,and on november,a scottish sheriff court issued a decree divorcing mcroberts and fawcett.this divorce decree made a residence order in respect of travis colin patrick mcroberts requiring that he live with mcroberts,and a contact order that allowed fawcett contact with travis on weekends and other specified times,for two weeks during the summer,and one week during each of the october,christmas,and easter holidays.
over the next two and a half years,fawcett made more than fifty attempts to modify her contact order.the record reveals only two instances in which the sheriff court modified the order in each case,it imposed greater limitations on fawcett contact rights.a february,order restricted fawcett visits with travis to every second saturday between and,and required that the visits be supervised.a june,order created a contact cycle granting fawcett no contact in week,residential contact on the weekend of week,no contact in week,and saturday contact in week.
in february,fawcett grew concerned that mcroberts might take travis to the united states and sought an interdiction order from the sheriff court to prevent mcroberts from doing so.on february,the sheriff court refuse d the same as mcroberts gave an undertaking to the court that he will not remove the aforementioned children from scotland to the united states the court then adjourned the hearing for further evidence to be led.
sometime shortly after this hearing,mcroberts and his second wife,tammy mcroberts,moved to the united states with travis,and took efforts to conceal his whereabouts from fawcett.
in an opinion issued march,the sheriff court,on the motion of fawcett sist ed the cause pending the outcome of a hague convention application to be made by mcroberts.the court held that mcroberts 
unlawfully and wrongfully removed travis outwith the jurisdiction of this court without the express permission of fawcett in contravention of her parental rights in terms of section and of the children scotland act failed to attend the diets of this court on and march without an acceptable excuse removed travis from the jurisdiction of this court by taking him to the united states of america in breach of a specific undertaking not to do so pending determination of the present proceedings and continues to retain travis in the united states of america without disclosing his present whereabouts thereby depriving fawcett of lawful contact with the said child.
the sheriff court then found mcroberts in contempt of court,fined him,and instructed the sheriff clerk to take all necessary steps to recover the fine.
on september,a lawyer acting for fawcett filed a petition for return of child and a request for emergency ex parte hearing in the united states district court for the western district of virginia.the court granted her request for an emergency ex parte hearing,which it held later that day.the court also held a hearing on that same day at which mcroberts was present and testified.in that proceeding,the court verbally ordered mcroberts not to remove travis from the jurisdiction or seek any state court order.on october,the court held another hearing on fawcett petition,at which mcroberts again presented the only testimony.
on october,the district court granted fawcett petition and ordered that travis be taken into custody by the bedford county department of social services and returned to the jurisdiction of the sheriff court in ayr,scotland.fawcett mcroberts,d.mcroberts complied with this order and travis was returned to scotland.the court also ordered mcroberts to pay costs and fawcett attorney fees.mcroberts filed a timely appeal from both orders.
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether mcroberts appeal is moot.we have no authority to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before us.church of scientology united states,d quoting mills green.though fawcett does not contend that the case is moot,a court must resolve issues such as mootness,that concern its own jurisdiction,even when the parties do not raise such issues.see steel citizens for a better env t,d iron arrow honor soc y heckler,d.
of course,compliance with a trial court order does not ordinarily moot an appeal of that order if it remains possible to undo the effects of compliance or if the order will have a continuing impact on future action.charles wright,et,federal practice procedure ed see also graddick newman,d concluding that court had the power to enter an injunction ordering restoration of the prior status quo id.at.rehnquist,writing separately i ssuance of a court mandate or obedience to its judgment does not bar timely appellate review.citations omitted.however,because in compliance with the district court order in this case travis has returned to scotland,we must assure ourselves that a decision by this court can affect the matter in issue.church of scientology,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we believe that a decision favorable to mcroberts can clearly affect the matter in issue in this case.
indeed,our recent opinion in miller miller,cir,is an implicit adoption of this view.in that case we considered the merits of an appeal from an order returning a child to canada,even though the father had complied with the order,and the child was in canada at the time of the appeal.id.at.although we ultimately affirmed the district court order,we could not have considered the merits of the appeal if the case had been rendered moot by the child return to canada pursuant to the district court order.see steel,at.rejecting notion that courts may exercise hypothetical jurisdiction.
the overwhelming majority of other courts have also evidenced their agreement with this position by routinely considering the merits of an appeal from an order returning a child to a foreign country,even when compliance with the order has resulted in the child presence in a foreign country.see,ohlander larson,cir rejecting mother arguments that her petition should be dismissed because it was moot and because the child was no longer in utah and noting that accepting such arguments could give parents an undue incentive to flee from hague convention proceedings janakakis,reviewing merits of an appeal,even after child had been returned to greece in compliance with trial court order made pursuant to convention and icara see also,rydder rydder,cir reviewing merits of appeal from district court order that child be returned to foreign country pursuant to convention and icara and in which no stay appears to have been issued dalmasso dalmasso,same sampson sampson,same harkness harkness,same.
indeed,at least two appellate courts have recently granted the precise relief mcroberts seeks,reversal of a trial court order returning a child to a foreign country even after the child has left the united states.see in re marriage of jeffers,reversing t he portion of the judgment returning the children to greece notwithstanding fact that children had already been returned to greece in compliance with original order bless bless,reversing and remanding to trial court,concluding that jurisdiction has not been obliterated by the child presence in switzerland.obviously these courts too concluded that their decision would affect the matter in issue.church of scientology,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
notwithstanding this wealth of authority,and without acknowledging any of it,the eleventh circuit recently did dismiss as moot an appeal from a district court order that a child be returned to a foreign country.bekier bekier,cir.the district court had ruled that bekier had wrongfully removed the child from his habitual residence in israel.id.at.bekier appealed,requesting that the court reverse the decision below or remand for further evidentiary hearings.id.at.while her appeal was pending,bekier returned to israel with their son.the eleventh circuit held bekier appeal moot because the return of the child to israel left the court powerless to grant the relief requested by bekier.id.at march levine,d,aff,cir granting stay of order to return child,r ecognizing that immediate return of the children to mexico may effectively moot any appeal emphasis added.
it is unclear why the bekier court came to this conclusion.although it cites several cases that purportedly support its mootness holding,all of those cases involve markedly different facts.for example,the bekier court relied heavily on b b chemical,united states epa,cir,a case holding that a challenge to the execution of a warrant to enter property was moot because the warrant had already been executed b b chemical was moot,however,because it would have been literally impossible to the property,even if the court had so ordered.the same logic applied to finding the university appeal moot in university of texas camenisch,d,where the university had complied with a court order to provide camenisch with a interpreter,and camenisch had graduated while the appeal was pending.because the interpreter had already been provided,it would have been literally impossible for the court to the service short of reversing power that,perhaps regrettably,congress has not yet granted the united states courts of appeals.as one court has noted,in some cases,like these,once an action has been taken there is no way to unscramble the egg.in re ford,cir.
such cases,however,present altogether different issues than the case at hand.here,no law of physics would make it impossible for fawcett to comply with an order by the district court that she return travis to the united states.to the contrary,such orders are fully within the district court power and are commonly issued by courts in the united states.see,ohlander,at goldstein goldstein,hernandez branciforte,roszkowski roszkowska,in re vernor,johnson johnson,see also,horlander horlander.concluding that court had jurisdiction to issue custody order even though child was in foreign country ivaldi ivaldi,same middleton middleton,same.
one concern that may have prompted the bekier court decision is that while the remedy bekier sought might not have been impossible to grant,as it was in b b chemical,the bekier court may have believed that there would have been no mechanism for effectively enforcing an order that a child living outside the united states be returned to this country.see bekier,at bekier potential remedies now lie in the israeli courts.any words by us would be merely advisory.
as an initial matter,it is not at all clear to us that a lack of effective methods for enforcing a court order necessarily means that the court opinion can not affect the matter in issue,church of scientology,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,and therefore renders the case moot.in kadic karadzic,cir,for example,there was little hope that any court would be able to enforce a judgment against radovan karadzic,who was,at the time,the president of the republic srpska.see jerry adler,suing bin laden,american lawyer,at noting that even one of the plaintiffs lawyers did really expect the plaintiffs to collect anything from karadzic,who is still a fugitive from the international war crimes tribunal at the hague.nevertheless,the second circuit did not dismiss the plaintiffs claims as moot,but rather after reversing the district court holding that no jurisdiction existed,remanded to allow the case to proceed.kadic,at.nor was enforcement regarded as a stumbling block in the cases cited above in which courts ordered a child returned to the united states from a foreign country.see ante at.
however,even if,hypothetically,the lack of an enforcement mechanism could leave a court completely unable to affect the matter in issue,and render an appeal moot,mcroberts appeal would still not be moot because he does have a mechanism for enforcing a judgment by this court or the district court on remand.the child abduction and custody act,the united kingdom analogue to icara,codifying the hague convention there,provides that a decision to which articles and of the hague convention appl y which was made in a contracting state other than the united kingdom shall be recognized in each part of the united kingdom as if made by a court having jurisdiction to make it in that part,pt.ii.furthermore,that statute explicitly contemplates a revocation or variation of an order issued by a contracting state and previously recognized by a court in the united kingdom,and provides that in such circumstances the united kingdom court shall either cancel its original order,or vary it.see,pt.ii.thus,mcroberts would be able to seek enforcement through the united kingdom courts of an order that fawcett and travis return to virginia,were the district court,on remand,to issue such an order.
although mcroberts could have proceeded directly to the united kingdom courts without seeking a reversal of the district court order in the united states,there can nonetheless be no question that an order from the district court that fawcett return to the united states with travis would affect the matter in issue in this case.church of scientology,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.such an order would permit mcroberts to appear in the scottish courts simply to seek enforcement of the united states judgment,rather than to the merits of any custody dispute respecting travis if,indeed,there even is a dispute over who has the right to custody of travis.
furthermore,even if the united kingdom courts did not recognize the order of a united states court,such an order could still affect the matter in issue.id.for example,fawcett could comply with the court order of her own volition.or,if fawcett failed to comply with the order,she could be held in contempt,and penalties could be assessed.see,ohlander,at hernandez,at.alternatively,it seems not too remote a possibility that fawcett could at some point return to the united states with travis,at which time mcroberts could seek to enforce such an order.michigan doran,d rejecting argument that appeal from order granting writ of habeas corpus was moot because the prisoner had been released and could no longer be located citation omitted eagles united states ex rel.samuels,though the writ has been granted and the prisoner released,the appellate court by what it does is not rendering an opinion and issuing an order which can not affect the litigants in the case before it.affirmance makes the prisoner release final and unconditional.reversal undoes what the habeas corpus court did and makes lawful a resumption of the custody.citations omitted.
in sum,it is clear that a decision reversing the district court order in this case does not violate the prohibition against opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.church of scientology,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we therefore conclude that mcroberts appeal is not moot,and turn now to the merits of that appeal 
in an action under the convention and icara,a petitioner must establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that her child w as wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention.miller miller,cir quoting e a.the convention provides that 
the removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other
