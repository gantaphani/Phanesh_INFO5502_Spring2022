introduction 
an attorney,who represented a client in two divorce cases and a related marvin action without a statutorily required written hourly or contingency fee agreement,sued his client for the reasonable value of the services he rendered in the three cases.the jury,using a multiplier of five to increase the attorney hourly rate to per hour,awarded the attorney million in attorney fees.that amount greatly exceeded the amount that would have been due under an alleged oral hourly rate agreement and the amount to which the attorney would have been entitled under a contingency fee agreement the parties discussed towards the end of the representation,but to which the parties did not agree.on appeal,the client contends,inter alia,that the trial court erred when its instructions allowed the jury to use the lodestar adjustment method including an enhancement or multiplier,in calculating a reasonable fee in attorney quantum meruit action.
we hold that under the circumstances of this case,there was no legal or equitable justification for applying a multiplier to the lodestar amount of attorney fees found by the jury.such multipliers generally are appropriate when,from the outset of an action,an attorney voluntarily assumes the contingent risk of nonpayment for his services a risk not present here.therefore,the trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could apply a multiplier to the lodestar amount.in addition,the jury award was excessive and inequitable.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to enter a new judgment on the special verdict form awarding the attorney a million lodestar amount,minus certain deductions made in the original judgment,based on the jury findings of per hour as the reasonable hourly rate and hours as the reasonable number of hours expended on the two divorce cases and the marvin action.
factual background 
attorney trial testimony 
client and her future husband,burt borman husband,lived together for years,from until they married in.in or around may,client hired attorney to defend her in a divorce action filed by husband.attorney handled that first divorce case,with the assistance of family law specialist hugh john gibson gibson,from approximately may to march.
in march,client and husband reconciled,and as part of the reconciliation,husband offered to pay toward client attorney fees,and dismissed the first divorce case.ultimately,however,the reconciliation failed,and husband never paid the for attorney fees.as a result,in or about may,client asked attorney to initiate a second divorce case.
attorney advised client in connection with the second divorce case that her property claims would require the filing of a marvin action.he explained that pursuing such an action was the only way to make a claim for an interest in what was ostensibly her husband separate property.one of client claims was for an interest in the couple home on broad beach in malibu the beach house.husband purchased the beach house when he was married to a former wife,and considered it his separate property.the other assets that client intended to pursue included a sculpture by donald judd,an american artist,and properties in moorpark,california,and telluride,colorado.attorney explained to client the difficulties in obtaining a recovery based on these assets through the marvin action that he filed on her behalf.
attorney originally told client he would charge her an hour for his time,which would be payable monthly regardless of the result,but there was no written fee agreement.attorney testified that in connection with the first divorce proceeding,client submitted an income and expense declaration to the trial court in which she stated under oath that she had an agreement to pay attorney per hour.but client never paid attorney anything and later told him she could not and would not pay hourly fees.
the parties litigated the second divorce case and the marvin action from approximately may to march or april,when settlement discussions began.the litigation included the taking of the depositions of client,casey borman husband son and an appraiser,as well as the filing of a successful opposition to husband summary judgment motion.
in early march,shortly after the trial court denied the summary judgment motion,attorney dana cole informed attorney that client had retained cole as a consultant.in an effort to resolve the outstanding fee dispute between client and attorney,cole sent a written proposal by to attorney and client for their signatures.attorney claimed client accepted this sliding scale fee proposal but a few weeks later,when client hired attorney stephen johnson,of the law firm of dempsey and johnson,as her second advisor in the underlying litigation,johnson withdrew the proposal.neither client nor attorney signed any contingency fee agreement.
in or about march,attorney received a written settlement offer from husband attorneys.given the difficulty of prevailing at trial and the promising nature of husband settlement offer,client agreed to move ahead with negotiations.those negotiations resulted in a letter agreement in early september settling client marvin claims to the beach house,the moorpark and telluride properties,the judd sculpture,and other works of art.
the settlement was to be formalized in a stipulated judgment in the second divorce case.according to attorney,he and his cocounsel,gibson,arranged for the judgment which attorney valued at million to be filed in the second divorce case,thus making the settlement to client.the status of the settlement was confirmed by gary wolfe,a tax attorney hired by client.wolfe described the tax treatment as a grand slam home run.after client terminated attorney and gibson,the parties ultimately signed a stipulated judgment and submitted it to the court in december to conclude the second divorce case and the marvin action.johnson was client attorney of record at the time of the settlement and judgment.
attorney claimed that he spent hours on the first divorce case and hours on the second divorce case and the marvin action.during his representation of client,however,attorney did not maintain daily time records.rather,he estimated his time but only for important tasks,not for minor ones such as short phone calls.attorney said he usually underestimated his time using this practice,and denied that gibson performed most of the work.attorney claimed he was responsible for the strategy and the majority of the work.he stated he did not delegate the intellectual tasks of the case,including the opposition to the summary judgment motion,on which he did percent of the work.he said he spent to hours on depositions.attorney further testified that for the last years,his clients had paid him per hour.by contrast,according to attorney,husband counsel,quinn,emmanuel,urquhart sullivan referred to as quinn charged its clients per hour.attorney contended that the reasonable value of his legal services was million,representing between percent and percent of the million settlement value that client received as a result of settling the second divorce case and the marvin action.
attorney testified that he had handled some divorce cases,but admitted that he did not do so on a basis.he also admitted that he did not have any track record of winning marvin actions at jury trial.
client trial testimony 
client did not concede that she agreed to pay attorney per hour,and in her verified answer,she denied there was any such agreement and insisted that attorney could only recover the reasonable value of his services.client testified that attorney did not give her a specific estimate of the hours he had worked prior to the settlement of the second divorce case and the marvin action.the first time that attorney estimated his hours for client was after he filed his quantum meruit claim against client.client acknowledged that she owed attorney money,which she was willing to pay him.she explained,however,that each time she attempted to pay,attorney demanded a humongous sum of money that was not feasible for her to pay.if attorney had advised client that he would be seeking over million in attorney fees,she would not have settled with husband.client believed that attorney concealed his fee request until long after he was removed from the case in september.
cole made a proposal to client regarding the payment of attorney fees the proposed contingency fee agreement but she did not accept that proposal.she explained that one of her other attorneys,either dempsey or johnson,advised her that cole proposal was not beneficial for her.
client ultimately terminated attorney after he threatened to withdraw from the second divorce case and the marvin action if she did not settle with husband.client was unhappy with the settlement that attorney negotiated because she did not recover the entire telluride property.she also disputed attorney million valuation of the settlement to which she ultimately agreed after attorney termination.for example,attorney claimed that the value of the judd sculpture was million,but she believed it was worth only million at the time of the settlement.
trial testimony of husband lawyer 
attorney matthew hinks,along with other counsel,represented husband in the divorce cases and in the marvin action.hinks opined that attorney provided grade a representation for client that is,attorney brought the right claims,made the right motions,and achieved a pretty good result.
casey borman trial testimony 
casey borman,acting as trustee of husband trust,asserted that the monthly spousal support of paid to client as part of the settlement was not taxable,and would continue until the sale of the beach house.he confirmed that there were problems with that property,including beach erosion and million in deferred maintenance.he also testified that the listing price was a hope price.
johnson trial testimony 
attorney successor counsel,johnson,testified that the settlement negotiated by attorney was the best result client could obtain because she had no reasonable opportunity to take the case to trial due to attorney failure to prepare the case properly.johnson could have settled the case himself on the same terms within one week because any husband involved in a nasty divorce would happily avoid attorney fees to settle for a box of art and a future interest in his house.in addition,the summary judgment motion brought in the marvin case was not a difficult motion to defend.johnson would not have recommended settling the case if he had any inkling attorney was going to sandbag client and make a claim for over million in fees.
cole trial testimony 
cole testified that by march,client was concerned about the upcoming trial and her unresolved fee dispute with attorney.client explained to cole that attorney had told her that his attorney fees would be paid by husband and,as a result,she was reluctant to enter into a different fee agreement.cole explained that resolving the fee dispute with attorney was challenging.
after cole had made an initial contingency fee proposal to attorney,cole realized that in order to advise client properly about an appropriate fee,cole needed to know the time that attorney spent representing client.attorney told cole that attorney had spent hours presumably on the two pending cases but attorney did not have any documentation to support his claim.
cole believed attorney negotiated a reasonable ballpark settlement of the underlying litigation and he encouraged client to sign the agreement.negotiating a settlement with husband was cole primary concern,after which he intended to meet with attorney to obtain documentation of the time attorney spent,decide upon a fair fee,and advise client to pay it.cole estimated that attorney fee would be somewhere in the medium to large range,but a fee anywhere close to million was never discussed and would,cole said,have been absurd.cole thought a reasonable fee would be no more than.
trial testimony of attorney expert on fees 
attorney called attorney dennis wasser to opine concerning the reasonable amount of fees for attorney work.wasser specialized in family law,including both divorce cases and marvin actions.wasser claimed that attorney was one of the best business litigators in california over the last to years.according to wasser,attorney was a phenomenal trial lawyer with a great reputation and was known for his ability to try cases and to develop novel legal theories.
wasser also claimed that the marvin action that attorney handled for client was a difficult case.according to wasser,client made that case more difficult when she testified at her deposition that she had no agreement with husband.wasser emphasized that one of the primary assets involved in the marvin action was the beach house,which was not only husband separate property,but had been quitclaimed to husband by client.wasser opined that attorney handled the marvin action well.in addition,attorney was a sole practitioner who was litigating against good lawyers from large law firms.
wasser explained that the settlement was structured by attorney to be to client.the status was achieved by filing a stipulated judgment on the settlement in the second divorce case,making the transaction a nontaxable transfer between spouses.this structure was the equivalent of proceeding to trial in the marvin action and obtaining a taxable verdict of million.wasser asserted he could not have achieved such a result himself.wasser also testified that attorney negotiated a spousal support payment for client of per month that did not terminate on husband death,but rather continued until the beach house was sold.
according to wasser,per hour for attorney work on the cases was a reasonable rate for a litigator with attorney skill and ability.wasser added that attorney estimate of hours of work on the second divorce case and the marvin action was probably a low estimate.in determining the number of hours attorney spent on the two divorce cases and the marvin action,wasser did not attempt to itemize the work that attorney performed,as compared to the work that gibson had performed.instead,wasser simply asked attorney what work he performed on those cases.from his experience litigating cases against attorney,wasser believed that when attorney worked with gibson,attorney did the work and was the brains of the outfit.attorney took the laboring oar,while gibson acted as an associate.
wasser recommended a multiplier of six by considering the following factors the risk factor,the result factor,and the difficulty factor.he characterized the results as phenomenal and as a grand slam.wasser concluded that despite the difficulties with the marvinaction,attorney achieved an absolutely spectacular result in surviving the summary judgment motion brought by his opponents and reaching a settlement valued at million.wasser believed that million was a reasonable fee for attorney services,applying a multiplier of six to an hourly rate of per hour 
trial testimony of client fee expert 
attorney michael dempsey testified on behalf of client regarding the reasonable fee payable to attorney.he characterized the settlement as a good settlement,but not a home run,given the position in which client was at the time.he believed that the summary judgment motion was fairly easy to oppose,as it involved an issue of fact,rather than any novel legal issues.he disagreed with attorney valuation of the settlement.he asserted that attorney could put no value on the judd sculpture because the parties had not done so in the stipulated judgment,and that to do so would be speculation,especially as the evaluation would have to be made as of the time of the settlement,which occurred during an economic recession.dempsey explained that client sought the judd sculpture for purely emotional reasons.dempsey also challenged any valuation of client interest in the sale of the beach house because it was a troubled asset.in addition,dempsey downplayed the spousal support element of the settlement as being a provision in a divorce case that was very straightforward and not difficult to obtain.
dempsey challenged wasser conclusions concerning the elements of the reasonable fee payable to attorney.as to the hours,dempsey opined that based on his review of gibson bills,attorney could only have expended half of the hours that gibson recorded.gibson bills showed that gibson performed most of the work,whereas attorney was merely commenting,reviewing,and giving ideas to gibson.dempsey also refuted the notion that the hours spent by husband counsel could be used to determine attorney hours because the nature of the work done by the opposing sides was significantly different.
dempsey concluded that attorney hourly rate should have been per hour.he derived that rate from his review of the prevailing rate range of to for attorneys who specialized in family law and who were in a small firm.next,he reduced that range for attorney because the marvin action that attorney filed was only his second such case as a result,according to dempsey,attorney lacked the required training,skill,sophistication,and experience for that type of case.dempsey further reduced the fee range because gibson performed most of the work.dempsey observed that attorney rate should have been significantly less than the hourly rate charged by wasser,who was highly experienced in handling family law disputes and marvin actions.
dempsey calculated the reasonable fee payable to attorney to be,comprised of the following components already paid by husband to attorney for attorney fees in the underlying divorce litigation pursuant to a court order,plus hours times an hour,or for the marvin action.
trial testimony of attorney art expert 
maurice tuchman,an art curator from a local museum,testified that the judd sculpture was worth million in,the year in which the underlying cases settled.when questioned regarding the foundation for his conclusion,however,he stated that he had looked at the sale prices for judd sculptures sold over the past years,without indicating whether he had looked at any sculptures.in addition,he admitted that he could not remember the sales he considered in reaching his estimated value.
procedural background 
attorney and gibson filed a verified complaint against client to recover attorney fees.according to attorney,at the inception of his representation of her,client agreed to pay him his regular hourly rate of.attorney further alleged that when plaintiff informed him that she was unable to pay his fees,she agreed that attorney would be entitled to reasonable fees,at a minimum,based on his regular hourly rate and that such fees would include additional amounts,by making the total reasonable fees equal to a percentage of the amounts recovered for her attorney also alleged that client subsequently agreed that a reasonable fee for attorney services would not be less than his hourly fee s,but would be equal to a percentage of her ultimate recovery.finally,attorney alleged that when client refused to pay attorney fees after settlement,he became entitled to a reasonable fee.in his prayer,attorney,presumably on behalf of both himself and gibson,asked for million or an amount established by proof.
following demurrer proceedings,client filed an answer and a for professional negligence.in her verified answer,client disputed that there was any fee agreement with attorney and asserted that attorney was only entitled to the reasonable value of his services.after further amended pleadings by client,the trial court held a final status conference at which it considered client motions in limine to exclude evidence of any oral contingency fee agreement between client and attorney and to exclude evidence concerning the value of the settlement agreement negotiated by attorney.the trial court granted the motion concerning any oral contingency fee agreement,but denied the motion concerning the value of the settlement.
client filed a trial brief arguing,inter alia,that attorney should be barred from seeking a recovery because of his failure to comply with the business and professions code section,which requires a written contingency fee agreement.client also filed a motion requesting an evidence code section hearing regarding,inter alia,whether attorney expert,wasser,could testify that a multiplier should be applied to the lodestar,given his failure to testify about a lodestar adjustment computation at his deposition.after an evidence code section hearing,the trial court ruled that wasser could testify concerning a multiplier.
at trial,the trial court submitted a written instruction to the jury on calculating attorney fees that read as follows in calculating a reasonable attorney fee,the following factors should be considered the amount of the fee in proportion to the value of the services performed.the novelty and difficulty of the factual and legal questions involved and the skill necessary to perform the services properly.the likelihood,if apparent to the client,that acceptance of the employment will preclude other employment by the attorney.the amount involved and the results obtained for the client.time limitations imposed by the circumstances.the attorney experience,reputation,and ability.any risk or delay carried by the attorney.the time and labor required of the lawyer.an attorney is not entitled to recover fees from his client for time spent on matters which his client did not prevail or time that simply should not have been spent at all.you may consider whether he overlitigated the cases,spent excessive time,performed unnecessary work,performed duplicative work,or his time.whichever of these factors you may use to increase the hourly rate or decrease it you can not use the factors twice,first in settling the basic reasonable hours and basic reasonable fees and then again to increase or decrease those amounts.
following trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of attorney on the complaint and and awarded attorney the amount of million.according to the special verdict form,the jury awarded attorney for his work on the first divorce case based on an hourly rate of and a finding that attorney had expended hours on that case.on the second divorce case and the marvin action,the jury found that attorney had expended hours on those cases,that his reasonable hourly rate was,and that the rate should be increased to using a multiplier of five,for a total fee on those two cases of million.
after making certain stipulated adjustments in the form of deductions to the million award the trial court entered judgment on the verdict and client filed motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds,including excessive damages.the trial court denied both motions,and this appeal by client followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
client contention that attorney was not entitled to an enhancement or multiplier on the lodestar amount of his attorney fee award raises an issue of law that we decide de novo.an order granting or denying an award of attorney fees is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard of review however,the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs have been met is a question of law.citations.sc manufactured homes,canyon view estates,th,d.carpenter zuckerman cohen th.
applicable legal principles 
lodestar adjustment method 
the lodestar adjustment method contemplates a preliminary determination of the amount of the lodestar the reasonable number of hours expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate and then the possibility of an adjustment of that figure up or down depending upon a variety of factors.californians for responsible toxic management kizer d.client contends,inter alia,that the trial court erred by allowing the jury to adjust the amount of the lodestar found by the jury upward using a multiplier.according to client,the lodestar adjustment method,which includes a multiplier applied to enhance the lodestar amount,is not applicable to cases,such as this one,which do not involve a statute,contingent risk to the attorney,or the enforcement of an important public right or policy.
in ketchum moses cal th ketchum which involved the propriety of an attorney fee award under the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute statute,code of civil procedure section the supreme court explained the rationale for calculating attorney fee awards using the lodestar adjustment method.the court began its analysis with a summary of the applicable law in california concerning the evolution of that method.we quote from that summary at length.in serrano priest cal d serrano iii,we concluded that the court could award attorney fees under a private attorney general theory to public interest law firms that had successfully represented plaintiffs in an action challenging the constitutionality of the then existing california public school financing system.under serrano iii,the lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including,as relevant herein,the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,the skill displayed in presenting them,the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys,the contingent nature of the fee award.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.the purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action.in effect,the court determines,retrospectively,whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.the experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court,and while his judgment is of course subject to review,it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.ibid.ketchum,supra,cal th at,italics added.
the court in ketchum,supra cal th then explained the theory behind a lodestar enhancement.as we explained in rader thrasher cal d,a contingent fee contract,since it involves a gamble on the result,may properly provide for a larger compensation than would otherwise be reasonable.the purpose of a fee enhancement,or multiplier,for contingent risk is to bring the financial incentives for attorneys enforcing important constitutional rights,such as those protected under the provision,into line with incentives they have to undertake claims for which they are paid on a basis.the economic rationale for fee enhancement in contingency cases has been explained as follows a contingent fee must be higher than a fee for the same legal services paid as they are performed.the contingent fee compensates the lawyer not only for the legal services he renders but for the loan of those services.the implicit interest rate on such a loan is higher because the risk of default the loss of the case,which cancels the debt of the client to the lawyer is much higher than that of conventional loans.citation.a lawyer who both bears the risk of not being paid and provides legal services is not receiving the fair market value of his work if he is paid only for the second of these functions.if he is paid no more,competent counsel will be reluctant to accept fee award cases.citations.ketchum,supra,cal th,italics added.
such fee enhancements are intended to compensate for the risk of loss generally in contingency cases as a class.citation.in cases involving enforcement of constitutional rights,but little or no damages,such fee enhancements may make such cases economically feasible to competent private attorneys.citation.m ost lawyers of this quality do seem to consider the prospects of success and the fee recoverable before adding to their crowded calendars a case in which payment is contingent.citation.ketchum,supra,cal th at,italics added.
in serrano unruh cal d serrano iv,applying the same principles to the statutory fee award under code of civil procedure section a private attorney general statute,we reiterated that fee awards should be fully compensatory.we approved the calculation of attorney fees beginning with a lodestar figure based on the reasonable hours spent,multiplied by the hourly prevailing rate for private attorneys in the community conducting noncontingent litigation of the same type.serrano iv,supra,cal d at.we remarked that the reasonable value of attorney services is variously defined as the hourly amount to which attorneys of like skill in the area would typically be entitled.id.at,fn.see also id.at services compensable under code of civil procedure section are computed from their reasonable market value.we noted that the lodestar figure was subject to augmentation based on factors including the contingent nature of the litigation.cal d at,fn.id.at,fn.ketchum,supra,cal th at.
subsequently,in press lucky stores,cal d,we underscored the importance of the proper determination and use of the lodestar figure in calculating awards of statutory attorney fees.we acknowledged the discretion of the trial court in setting attorney fees,but emphasized that because the determination of the lodestar figures is so fundamental to arriving at an objectively reasonable amount,the exercise of that discretion must be based on the lodestar adjustment method.ibid.we also reiterated that the lodestar figure may be increased by application of a fee enhancement,or reduced as appropriate,after the trial court has considered other factors concerning the lawsuit,including the contingent nature of the fee award.ibid.ketchum,supra,cal th at.
maria riles cal d,reaffirmed the use of the lodestar adjustment method first announced in serrano iii.we again explained that the lodestar figure may be increased or decreased on a variety of factors,including the contingent nature of the fee award.ibid.more recently,in plcm group,drexler cal th,d,we instructed t he fee setting inquiry in california ordinarily begins with the lodestar,the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate the lodestar figure may then be adjusted,based on consideration of factors specific to the case,in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.citation.such an approach anchors the trial court analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney services,ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.ketchum,supra,cal th at.
the court in ketchum,supra,cal th then provided guidance to trial courts concerning proper risk assessment and the application of the factor based on extraordinary skill to prevent what the court referred to as improper double counting of fees incurred.in each case,the trial court should consider whether,and to what extent,the attorney and client have been able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment,because the client has agreed to pay some portion of the lodestar amount regardless of outcome.it should also consider the degree to which the relevant market compensates for contingency risk,extraordinary skill,or other factors under serrano iii.we emphasize that when determining the appropriate enhancement,a trial court should not consider these factors to the extent they are already encompassed within the lodestar.the factor of extraordinary skill,in particular,appears susceptible to improper double counting for the most part,the difficulty of a legal question and the quality of representation are already encompassed in the lodestar.a more difficult legal question typically requires more attorney hours,and a more skillful and experienced attorney will command a higher hourly rate.see margolin regional planning com.d.indeed,the reasonable hourly rate used to calculate the lodestar is the product of a multiplicity of factors the level of skill necessary,time limitations,the amount to be obtained in the litigation,the attorney reputation,and the undesirability of the case.ibid.thus,a trial court should award a multiplier for exceptional representation only when the quality of representation far exceeds the quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of comparable skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar calculation.otherwise,the fee award will result in unfair double counting and be unreasonable.ketchum,supra,cal th at,italics added.the court said that in that case,the qualifications of the attorney were presumably included in the hourly rate used to calculate the lodestar.id.at.
the court in ketchum,supra,cal th suggested that in cases that did not involve contingent risk,the application of a multiplier to the lodestar amount may not be justified.the appellant in ketchum contended that,once the special motion to strike had been litigated and granted,applying a multiplier to that portion of the lodestar attributable to the litigation of the subsequent fee motion was unjustified.in that connection,the court in ketchum observed,although the entitlement to attorney fees on the motion to strike was subject to the risk that the moving party and his attorney might not prevail on the special motion to strike and thus not be entitled to attorney fees,once the motion was successful,attorney fees were mandatory under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.an award of fees was,accordingly,no longer contingent.for this reason,it was error for the superior court to apply an enhancement for contingent risk to the fees on fees accrued after the motion to strike was granted.id.at.from the cases cited and this quote,it appears that the contingent nature of fees generally governs the applicability of a lodestar enhancement.
lodestar enhancements,however,might be viewed as appropriate under certain statutes,even without there necessarily being a risk of no attorney compensation.for example,in sternwest ash d,the court held,without discussion,that a trial court had the discretion to enhance lodestar fees with a multiplier in a contract case under civil code section,which statute provides that if there is a contractual attorney fees clause,the prevailing party in a contract dispute is entitled to attorney fees.the court cited vella hudgins d,which involved an award of fees less than the amount incurred.see hill affirmed housing group june,th.lexis assumed that lodestar adjustment method was appropriate.
civil code section is a statute that permits the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party pursuant to a contractual attorney fees provision irrespective of whether the attorney fees clause specifies that only one party is entitled to attorney fees or whether the attorney fees were incurred or paid.civil code section has public policy implications,to ensure mutuality of remedy for attorney fee claims under contractual attorney fee provisions.santisas goodin cal th.the reciprocity provision of that section was designed to prevent overreaching in litigation.international billing services,emigh th.attorney fees clauses can thus be used as instruments of oppression to force settlements of dubious or unmeritorious claims.citations.section was obviously designed to remedy this evil.coast bank holmes d.ketchum,supra,cal th makes clear that the use of the lodestar adjustment method in determining a statutory fee award depends on an analysis of the particular statute.
quantum meruit 
attorney claimed,and the jury award was for,the reasonable value of attorney services,quantum meruit.quantum meruit refers to the principle that the law implies a promise to pay for services performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously rendered.long rumsey cal d.to recover in quantum meruit,a party need not prove the existence of a contract maglica maglica th,d mayborne citizens trust savings bank,but it must show the circumstances were such that the services were rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties that compensation therefor was to be made estate of mumford cal,see long rumsey,supra,cal d at crane derrick cal,see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.huskinson brown wolf cal th.
as the court in maglica maglica,supra,th explained,the classic formulation concerning the measure of recovery in quantum meruit is found in palmer gregg cal d.justice mosk,writing for the court,said the measure of recovery in quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the services rendered provided they were of direct benefit to the defendant.citations.the underlying idea behind quantum meruit is the law distaste for unjust enrichment.if one has received a benefit which one may not justly retain,one should restore the aggrieved party to his or her former position by return of the thing or its equivalent in money.citation.the idea that one must be benefited by the goods and services bestowed is thus integral to recovery in quantum meruit hence courts have always required that the plaintiff have bestowed some benefit on the defendant as a prerequisite to recovery.citation.but the threshold requirement that there be a benefit from the services can lead to confusion,as it did in the case before us.it is one thing to require that the defendant be benefited by services,footnote omitted,it is quite another to measure the reasonable value of those services by the value by which the defendant was benefited as a result of them.footnote omitted.contract price and the reasonable value of services rendered are two separate things sometimes the reasonable value of services exceeds a contract price.citation.and sometimes it does not.id.at.
the court in maglica maglica,supra,th added,the services must be of benefit if there is to be any recovery at all even so,the benefit is not necessarily related to the reasonable value of a particular set of services.sometimes luck,sometimes the impact of others makes the difference.some enterprises are successful others less so.allowing recovery based on resulting benefit would mean the law imposes an exchange of equity for services,and that can result in a windfall as in the present case or a serious shortfall in others.compensation packages are extraordinary in the labor market,and always the result of specific bargaining.to impose such a measure of recovery would make a deal for the parties that they did not make themselves.if courts can not use quantum meruit to change the terms of a contract which the parties did make citation,it follows that neither can they use quantum meruit to impose a highly generous and extraordinary contract that the parties did not make.id.at.
for pleading and other procedural purposes,such as the right to a jury trial,a claim for quantum meruit is considered an action at law,not in equity.as the supreme court explained in philpott superior court cal d,considerable confusion now exists among the bench and bar as to the proper classification of a quantum meruit cause of action,due to the fact that the courts of law administering this relief apply equitable principles and to the further fact that certain expressions found in court opinions and textbooks,on first impression,might seem to classify it as an action in equity.but from what has been said it is clearly one of a special class of cases limited to a specific set of facts which could by supplementary allegations be made an out and out action in equity or else an action ex delicto at law.id.at.equitable principles may,however,apply to an action at law in quantum meruit.the fact that equitable principles are applied in the action does not necessarily identify the resultant relief as equitable.philpott superior court,supra,cal d,mccall superior court cal d.equitable principles are a guide to courts of law as well as of equity.ripling superior court d,mortimer loynes d,fearey gough d.furthermore,the incidental adoption of equitable sounding measures to effect the application of equitable principles in an action at law,such as for damages,does not change the character of that action.johnstone morris cal,lenard edmonds d.paularena superior court d,see jogani superior court th,trial court may submit an equitable defense,such as unclean hands,to the jury in an action at law pond insurance of north america d,unclean hands a defense to suits at law witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
as discussed,the supreme court in ketchum,supra,cal th,emphasized that generally the rationale for applying a multiplier to a lodestar amount is to compensate a skilled attorney who voluntarily assumes a contingent risk of nonpayment at the outset of his or her representation of the client.t he purpose of a fee enhancement is primarily to compensate the attorney for the prevailing party at a rate reflecting the risk of nonpayment in contingency cases as a class.id.at,italics added.
under the undisputed facts of this case,there was no contingent risk voluntarily assumed by attorney at the outset of his representation of client.in his verified complaint,attorney confirmed that he agreed to accept his regular rate of per hour for his representation of client.attorney also testified at trial that he agreed to represent client on an hourly basis at that same rate.moreover,once client failed to honor the hourly rate agreement,attorney stated in his verified complaint that he became entitled,at a minimum,to the reasonable value of the services he had rendered.and,although attorney said he agreed to accept a contingency fee agreement towards the end of his representation of client,she refused to sign such an agreement,attorney was never under a valid contractual obligation to assume the contingent risk of loss.
this is a unique case because attorney had no written fee agreement with client and any oral understanding,based on client position,was not enforceable.this case is also an unusual case in that normally awards of attorney fees are made by the trial court,not a jury.serrano priest cal d,experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court plcm group,drexler cal th,experienced trial judge is in the best position to decide the value of professional services in court cates chiang th.and it is an uncommon case because attorney continued to represent client until just before settlement,even though client did not pay him anything for his services.
in this case,attorney was not entitled to an enhancement on the lodestar amount found by the jury based on the contingent risk factor because he had not voluntarily assumed the risk that if client recovered nothing against husband,attorney would receive no compensation.instead,as attorney conceded,he was entitled to payment at either per hour or,at a minimum,a reasonable rate,regardless of the outcome of the underlying cases.absent such a voluntary assumption of a contingent risk of loss,the primary rationale for an enhancement or multiplier was not applicable to this case.thus,the trial court erred by its instructions that allowed the jury to award a multiplier based on the contingent risk rationale 
the only other rationale stated in ketchum,supra,cal th for awarding an enhancement,the need to attract attorneys with extraordinary legal skill to undertake certain types of cases also did not support the award of an enhancement under the facts of this case.in awarding attorney the per hour that he requested as part of the lodestar calculation,the jury was required to and presumably did consider a multiplicity of factors including the level of skill necessary,time limitations,the amount to be obtained in the litigation,the attorney reputation,and the undesirability of the case,italics added.given the characteristics of the underlying cases each of which was based on a private and unremarkable family law dispute between a wealthy husband and his wife and former cohabitant they were not the type of constitutional or public interest cases that require an exceptionally skilled attorney to assume the risk of representation,an attorney skilled in the type of case for which the representation was sought who would not accept that representation at the outset,unless a substantial enhancement was potentially available at the successful conclusion of the case.to the contrary,these were cases that attorney presumably analyzed at the beginning and voluntarily undertook on a straight hourly basis,without any regard for a potential enhancement.attorney conceded that he agreed at the beginning of his representation,that per hour was sufficient to compensate him for his experience,skill,and reputation in connection with the underlying cases thus,there was no reasonable basis upon which to allow the jury to engage in double counting ibid,to also consider that same skill,reputation,and experience to enhance that hourly rate by a multiplier of five or any other multiplier.therefore,because the stated rationales for enhancing a lodestar contingent risk of loss and need for extraordinary skill beyond that reflected in the attorney hourly rate did not apply to the facts of this case,the jury should not have been allowed to award such a fee enhancement.
even if the jury could have considered awarding a multiplier in the context of a quantum meruit action for reasonable attorney fees when no contingent risk was involved and the attorney skill and experience were adequately compensated by his agreed upon hourly rate the equitable principles underlying the lodestar adjustment method and a quantum meruit claim do not support such an enhancement in this case.as explained in the authorities discussed above,the lodestar adjustment method of calculating attorney fees and the quantum meruit doctrine under which attorney sued are both equitable concepts rooted in notions of fundamental fairness.see ketchum,supra,cal th at fashioning of equitable exceptions to the california rule that parties must bear their own costs is a matter within the sole competence of this court hedging concepts,first alliance mortgage th,a quantum meruit or recovery rests upon the equitable theory that a contract to pay for services rendered is implied by law for reasons of justice.based on attorney concession concerning his hourly rate at the inception of his representation of client,it is reasonable to infer that he agreed that per hour was acceptable compensation for his skill and experience in handling similar cases.
as stated in maglica maglica,supra,th at page,the underlying idea behind quantum meruit is the law distaste for unjust enrichment.whether under this rationale or under other equitable doctrines see kendall jackson winery,superior court th,or because the award is manifestly excessive and shocks the conscience seffert los angeles transit lines cal d,the award is not sustainable.it would be fundamentally unfair and unjust for attorney to recover fees based on a rate in excess of the lodestar amount,much less based on a rate that was five times in excess of that amount.such a windfall recovery,out of all proportion to his regular,hourly rate,would be contrary to the equitable principles under which attorney sued and under which he sought a calculation of a fair and reasonable fee.
moreover,awarding attorney a substantial premium on his attorney fees would,in effect,reward him for his violations of business and professions code sections and although section required,inter alia,attorney original fee for service agreement with client to be in writing,he failed to prepare such writing.similarly,although section required,inter alia,the proposed contingency fee agreement prepared by cole to be executed by client,attorney failed to obtain her signature on that document.and attorney claimed a contingency factor even without a written agreement.had attorney complied with his obligations under either statute,client would have known,at the time she decided to settle,the specific amount she owed to attorney.instead,solely because attorney violated both statutes,client was unaware of the magnitude of her financial obligation to attorney when she settled,she was unable to calculate accurately the amount she would realize from the settlement,net her attorney fee obligation to attorney.
business and professions code sections and were enacted to benefit and protect clients,such as the one sued by attorney here,by informing them at the outset of the representation in a signed writing,inter alia,of the amount of attorney fees they will incur under fee for service and contingency fee agreements.due solely to attorney failure to comply with those statutes,client was denied those benefits and protections.therefore,to allow attorney to recover more fees than he would have recovered had he complied with those statutes would violate the public policies underlying them.see,ferguson lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein cal th,allowing an insurer to assume liability and pay for punitive damages caused and incurred by its insured would violate public policy.
thus,notwithstanding the use of the lodestar adjustment method in other contexts,such as fees awarded under statutes,in contingent risk cases,and in cases of public interest,its use in the context of this action would be inequitable to the extent client would be compelled to compensate attorney at a rate well in excess of the rate he initially agreed to accept.see,closen tobin,the contingent contingency fee arrangement compensation of the contingency fee attorney discharged by the client.the better view would seem to be that the rate established in the original contingency fee agreement should constitute a limit on the discharged attorney compensation under quantum meruit brickman,setting the fee when the client discharges a contingent fee attorney emory,in actions by discharged contingency fee attorneys for quantum meruit,if client recovers in the underlying action,the attorney recovery against the client should be limited to the contract percentage of the client recovery behar root so d,amount recovered by attorney in quantum meruit may not exceed amount for which services were originally contracted with the client arnett johnson,same but see blanchard bergeron contingency fee agreement did not place a ceiling on an award under paulsen halpin,the terms of the retainer contract,now at an end,may be taken into consideration in fixing the value of the lawyer services.therefore,to reward attorney for not complying with the laws requiring written fee agreements would be inequitable and contrary to public policy.see civ.code,no one can take advantage of his own wrong.having sought relief in the trial court that is rooted in equitable principles,attorney must accept equitable conditions on such relief that favor client arising from the same matter in controversy.
in support of his assertion that the trial court was authorized to instruct the jury concerning the use of a multiplier,attorney relies on the decision in fergus songer th fergus.given the unique procedural posture of fergus,and that it involved a contingency fee agreement entered into at the outset of the attorney representation of the client,that case is not controlling here.
in fergus,supra,th,an attorney who had successfully represented a client from the outset of the underlying litigation pursuant to a contingency fee agreement,sued the client,inter alia,for refusing to abide by the terms of that agreement.id.at.prior to trial,the trial court ruled that the contingency fee agreement and a modification thereof were unenforceable because they were contrary to the business and professions code the rules of professional conduct id.at.during trial,as part of an evidentiary ruling,the trial court ruled that because the attorney had violated professional ethical rules his recovery must be limited to quantum meruit based upon a reasonable hourly rate for hours actually worked.ibid.the trial court further ruled that a ny testimony regarding contingent fee recoveries would be inadmissible.ibid.yet,the trial court allowed the attorney to testify that he had a contingency fee arrangement.id.at.
prior to deliberations,the trial court in fergus,supra,th at page,instructed the jury as follows in calculating a reasonable attorney fee,the following nine factors should be considered the amount of the fee in proportion to the value of the services performed.the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill necessary to perform the legal services properly.the likelihood,if apparent to the client,that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the attorney.the amount involved and the results obtained.the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances.the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client.the experience,reputation,and ability of the attorney performing the services.the time and labor required.the informed consent of the client to the fee.the trial court further instructed the jury as follows after considering the nine factors that i have given you,you shall determine the amount of a reasonable attorney fee based upon hours you determine were worked by the attorney and the hourly rate that you determine to be reasonable for his work.
based on the facts presented at trial and applying the trial court instruction,the jury returned a verdict awarding the attorney million in reasonable attorney fees fergus,supra,th at.following entry of judgment,the client in fergus filed a motion for new trial on the grounds that the verdict awarded excessive damages,was not supported by sufficient evidence,and was against the law.ibid.the trial court granted the motion for new trial as to the amount of the damages for attorney fees on all three grounds,including on the ground that the verdict was against the law.ibid.the attorney appealed,inter alia,from the trial court order granting a new trial as to his damages.id.at.
the court in fergus,supra,th,in considering the attorney appeal from the order granting a new trial,concluded that the trial court erred in granting the motion on the grounds of excessive damages and insufficiency of the evidence because the trial court failed to set forth timely its reasons for granting the motion on those two grounds.id.at.as to whether the trial court also erred in granting the new trial motion on the ground that it was against the law,the court in fergus explained,if an order granting a new trial does not effectively state the ground or the reasons,the order has been reversed on appeal where there are no grounds stated in the motion other than insufficient evidence or excessive or inadequate damages.citations.if,however,the motion states any other ground for a new trial,an order granting the motion will be affirmed if any such other ground legally require
