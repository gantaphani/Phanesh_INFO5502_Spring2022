at issue in this case is whether prior rulings rendered by a new york state supreme court in divorce proceedings between appellant michael urfirer and his wife,leslie cornfeld,collaterally estop urfirer from now bringing fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against his wife father and brother,appellees robert and jeffrey cornfeld,in federal district court in the southern district of florida.urfirer claims allege that robert and jeffrey cornfeld fraudulently induced him to sign a provision of his divorce settlement agreement with leslie cornfeld waiving any claims he might have to any of his wife family property and other holdings.
because we find that the prior rulings of the new york divorce court have only interpreted the scope of the ever reaching the question of whether robert and jeffrey cornfeld fraudulently obtained the because urfirer claims against the cornfelds seek damages from nonparties to the divorce proceedings,they are claims that the divorce court did not and could not have previously adjudicated.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment as to counts i and ii of urfirer complaint.as to the remaining claims seeking disclosure of financial information related to the alleged fraud,we hold that collateral estoppel bars only count vi of urfirer complaint,since the new york court has already determined that urfirer waived his right to raise any claims arising out of his status as nominal shareholder of cambridge asset management.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this case has its origins in the complex,protracted,and divorce proceedings between appellant michael urfirer and his wife,leslie cornfeld,who is the daughter of appellee robert cornfeld and the sister of appellee jeffrey cornfeld.urfirer and leslie cornfeld entered into a settlement agreement the agreement or the settlement agreement on june,resolving many of their financial and property distribution issues in anticipation of their divorce.divorce proceedings commenced in the supreme court of the state of new york,county of new york,ias the divorce court in.
pursuant to the settlement agreement,urfirer waived all claims against the real or personal property of his wife family.the waiver,section of the agreement,stated 
the husband hereby waives any claim he has or may have in the future arising out of the wife family real estate or other holdings including,but not limited to,the cornfeld family partnerships,the paul koenig note,the chapel trail investment and cambridge asset management.
a second waiver provision,section of the agreement,provided 
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this agreement,the husband and wife each waives,renounces and releases to the other party any and all rights and claims which the husband or wife now has or may in the future acquire in the real or personal property or estate of the other party,wheresoever situated,whether before or after the date of execution of this agreement,by reason of i inheritance or descent,ii any decedent estate law,iii any other statute or custom,iv the marital relationship,or v any other reason whatsoever.
subsequent disagreement arose between urfirer and leslie cornfeld as to the interpretation of the first waiver provision.as a result,the divorce court issued two orders addressing this question.
first,in an order dated december,which the parties refer to as the discovery order,the new york divorce court rejected urfirer attempt to obtain certain financial discovery pertaining to cambridge asset management,cambridge and ljs investors,ljs.ljs is a partnership in which urfirer had a ownership interest during his marriage.the remainder was owned by members of the cornfeld family,with robert cornfeld serving as general manager and jeffrey cornfeld as general partner.cambridge was owned by urfirer and managed by robert cornfeld.the businesses were not included among the marital assets,and were subject to the waiver provision of the settlement agreement.
accordingly,the divorce court observed,whether urfirer was entitled to discovery regarding these businesses hinge d on the scope of the waiver,since discovery was not appropriate if urfirer retained no interest in those businesses.discovery order at.the divorce court ultimately rejected the discovery request,reasoning 
the waiver is unequivocal and speaks not only in terms of waiver of any future rights but rights that accrued before june,as well.assuming arguendo that the income distributions prior to june,were improper,the waiver precludes defendant from contesting such distributions.he is not entitled to the third party discovery because he has no past or future rights to the assets.
in spite of the divorce court declaration that urfirer had no rights to the assets of ljs and cambridge,urfirer never executed the documents necessary to transfer his titled interests in these and other cornfeld family businesses the cornfeld family holdings to his wife.accordingly,leslie cornfeld moved for partial summary judgment declaring that pursuant to the settlement agreement,urfirer waived his rights and transferred his ownership interests in the cornfeld family holdings to his wife.
urfirer argued that the agreement waiver provision waived only his right to claim that the cornfeld family holdings were marital property that it did not waive any rights he had in the cornfeld family holdings prior to june,and that he retained his ownership interest until he actually signed the documents transferring it to leslie cornfeld.the divorce court,in what the parties refer to as the title order of september,found all of these arguments unsupportable under the plain language of the parties agreement.title order at.the divorce court thus held 
accordingly,plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment is granted to the extent that the court declares that as of june,defendant has no ownership interest in the cornfeld family real estate and holdings,including cornfeld family partnerships,the paul koenig note,the chapel trail investment and cambridge asset management.the court further directs that defendant execute,no later than days from the date of this decision,such documents as may be required to transfer ownership of such holdings to plaintiff as of june.the entry of any judgment hereon,however,shall be held in abeyance pending final adjudication of the instant divorce action.
shortly thereafter,urfirer claims,he inadvertently obtained a copy of ljs tax return and learned for the first time that leslie,robert,and jeffrey cornfeld had concealed from him an ljs bank account containing nearly million in cash.this cash,urfirer argues,should have been included among the marital property to be divided equally between himself and leslie cornfeld.
urfirer attempted to raise this claim against leslie cornfeld in the divorce court,and the divorce court dismissed it without prejudice.in an order dated july,the divorce court stated 
defendant seeks to have this court adjust plaintiff equitable distribution,claiming he is entitled to compensatory and punitive damages because he waived whatever rights he may have had in plaintiff interest in certain family owned businesses based upon plaintiff alleged fraud.he seeks such an adjudication by motion.this motion fails procedurally and must be denied.
procedurally defendant motion for summary adjudication on a claim of fraud is defective because there is no pleading interposed by defendant in which he alleges a cause of action for fraud against plaintiff.a fortiori,if there is no pleading,there is no joinder of issue,which is a necessary predicate to the summary adjudication defendant now seeks.cplr.further,where there is no underlying cause of action,there is no basis for punitive damages.collision plan unlimited bankers trust.even were a proper pleading interposed,the facts claimed arise from a private transaction,and do not rise to a high degree of moral turpitude that would otherwise implicate punitive damages.jgs,lifetime cutlery.finally there is no basis for summary judgment even with a proper pleading,because issues of fraud are almost inevitably questions of fact.derossi rubinstein.
in view of the procedural defects,the court does not reach the issue of whether,if properly interposed,defendant even makes out a claim of fraud.
subsequent to this order,urfirer brought a claim against leslie cornfeld in the new york divorce court alleging fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and unjust enrichment.
urfirer also filed the instant action against robert and jeffrey cornfeld in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.count i of his federal claim alleged breach of a common law fiduciary duty,asserting that robert cornfeld,as managing partner of ljs,and jeffrey cornfeld,as general partner of ljs,owed urfirer a fiduciary duty,which they breached by concealing from him certain business transactions and the existence of a capital account from which urfirer was entitled to withdraw funds.count ii alleged fraud by robert cornfeld in his negotiation of the settlement agreement with urfirer on leslie cornfeld behalf.robert cornfeld assertedly induced urfirer to waive his interest in ljs by concealing material information that he had a fiduciary duty to disclose.count iii alleged that urfirer,as a former ljs partner,had a statutory right under florida statutes and to inspect ljs books.count iv was an equitable demand for an accounting from ljs.count v sought an equitable injunction compelling ljs to disclose its books and records.count vi alleged that urfirer,as a former cambridge shareholder,had a statutory right under florida statutes,and to inspect cambridge books and records.count vii was an equitable demand for an accounting from cambridge.finally,count viii sought an equitable injunction compelling cambridge to disclose its books and records.
the district court,in an order dated september,granted final summary judgment for robert and jeffrey cornfeld on all of urfirer claims,finding them barred by collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.applying new york law of collateral estoppel,the district court concluded that the divorce court discovery order and its title order both conclusively resolved the scope and validity of the waiver provision of the settlement agreement.accordingly,it held,urfirer was barred from bringing in federal court his fraud claims,which sought to relitigate the issue of the waiver validity.
urfirer moved pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure to alter or amend the final summary judgment to reinstate counts i and ii of his complaint the fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims,which,he argued,were not precluded since those claims were never litigated in the divorce court.the district court,in an order dated december,denied this motion,clarifying that final summary judgment was not based on a finding that a new york court previously decided the causes of action contained in counts i and ii,but rather on a finding that all of the causes of action including counts i and ii contained in urfirer complaint are barred by the waiver provisions contained in his june,agreement with leslie cornfeld.order at citation omitted.
urfirer appealed the district court grant of summary judgment and its denial of the rule motion to this court.while urfirer appeal was pending,the divorce court issued another order,dated april,dismissing urfirer fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against leslie cornfeld for failure to state a claim.the divorce court dismissed the claims on the grounds that there was no representation by defendant,let alone a false one,or a material one,which is a necessary predicate for actual fraud,order at leslie cornfeld,as a limited rather than a general partner of ljs,had no duty to disclose operations information the duty of loyalty between spouses was inapplicable and that the alleged concealment was not material in the context of the negotiation of a agreement,order at.
however,the divorce court order specifically rejected leslie cornfeld argument that collateral estoppel barred litigation of urfirer fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims.the divorce court explained 
notwithstanding that urfirer failed to state any causes of action,the court otherwise rejects the argument that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars his claims.
in evaluating whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies,the court looks to see if there is an identity of issue decided in the prior action that is decisive of the present action and whether defendant had a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling.buechel bain,cert,d.collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity.buechel bain,supra.
urfirer contends that no court has expressly addressed his fraud claims,his claims of unjust enrichment,or breach of fiduciary duty.further,he argues that he is not precluded from seeking relief other than recision of their agreement.the court agrees.no order of this court or those of the appellate division of this state reached the fraud and related issues.the orders expressly dealing with the waiver only interpreted its scope.indeed the court could not have reached such issues until the instant pleading was interposed.cplr a valentine transit kernizan.nor can this court give the dismissal of the florida action collateral estoppel effect because it did so based,in turn,on its holding that this court orders had a collateral estoppel effect.since this court does not believe the new york orders collaterally estop defendant,it likewise holds that the florida orders have no preclusive effect.
urfirer moved this court to supplement the record in his case against robert and jeffrey cornfeld with the divorce court april,order.on june,the court denied urfirer motion to supplement the record without prejudice to urfirer right to file a rule motion for relief from judgment in the district court.we also stayed the appeal pending the district court resolution of the rule motion,which urfirer filed on june.urfirer moved the district court for reconsideration pursuant to rule b,which authorizes a court to grant relief from a judgment when a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated.b,and rule b,which authorizes relief for any other reason justifying relief from operation of the judgment.b.
in an order dated august,the district court denied urfirer motion.the district court reasoned that even if the divorce court latest order meant that the district court collateral estoppel ruling was incorrect,urfirer failed to demonstrate that the equities of the case warranted vacating the prior order.vacating that judgment would be an empty exercise,order at,the district court reasoned,since the divorce court latest order reaffirms that the scope of the waiver provisions has been conclusively determined and holds that those provisions are valid and free from fraud or breach of duty by leslie cornfeld,the only other party to the agreement containing the waiver provisions.as held in the prior orders of this court,all of the causes of action contained in urfirer complaint are barred pursuant to urfirer waiver of those claims.order at citation omitted.the district court apparently concluded that even if the divorce court earlier orders did not have a collateral estoppel effect on urfirer fraud claims,the divorce court latest order dismissing urfirer fraud claims against leslie cornfeld did have such an effect,barring his fraud claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld.see id.at t his court will not engage in an empty exercise by vacating its prior decisions only to apply collateral estoppel based on the order rejecting urfirer latest attempt to invalidate the waiver provisions.
in addition,the district court reasoned,the divorce court holding seems untenable in that it suggests that the prior new york court holdings regarding the scope of the waiver provisions did not necessarily find those provisions valid nor did the protracted litigation regarding the waiver provisions scope require urfirer also to challenge the validity of those provisions.id.at.accordingly,the district court denied urfirer motion for relief from judgment.
urfirer appealed from the district court denial of his rule motion,and we,sua sponte,consolidated that appeal with urfirer appeal from the grant of final summary judgment for robert and jeffrey cornfeld.accordingly,three district court orders are now before us the order granting final summary judgment the order denying urfirer rule e motion to amend the summary judgment and the order denying urfirer rule motion for relief from judgment.

as the new york court of appeals has explained 
the equitable doctrine of collateral estoppel is grounded in the facts and realities of a particular litigation,rather than rigid rules.collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party or those in privity ryan new york.the policies underlying its application are avoiding relitigation of a decided issue and the possibility of an inconsistent result new york cent.mut.fire ins.
two requirements must be met before collateral estoppel can be invoked.there must be an identity of issue which has necessarily been decided in the prior action and is decisive of the present action,and there must have been a full and fair opportunity to contest the decision now said to be controlling see,gilberg barbieri.the litigant seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel must demonstrate that the decisive issue was necessarily decided in the prior action against a party,or one in privity with a party see,id.the party to be precluded from relitigating the issue bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.the doctrine,however,is a flexible one,and the enumeration of these elements is intended merely as a framework,not a substitute,for analysis of the facts and realities.in the end,the fundamental inquiry is whether relitigation should be permitted in a particular case in light of fairness to the parties,conservation of the resources of the court and the litigants,and the societal interests in consistent and accurate results.no rigid rules are possible,because even these factors may vary in relative importance depending on the nature of the proceedings see,staatsburg water staatsburg fire,citations omitted.
buechel bain,
applying new york law of collateral estoppel,we consider whether any order of the divorce court precludes urfirer from bringing the instant fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld,or from seeking statutory and equitable disclosure of cambridge and ljs books and records.
collateral estoppel is no bar to urfirer fraud and breach of fiduciary duty i and ii of his the issues underlying these claims were not necessarily decided in any divorce court proceeding.
to have been necessarily decided,an issue must have been material to the first action or proceeding and essential to the decision rendered therein.ryan new york.an issue is necessarily decided only if it was actually before the judge and open to determination when he rendered his decision and necessary to support the result he ultimately reached.whitney holdings,givotovsky.in other words,the collateral estoppel applies only if the issue in the second action is identical to an issue which was raised,necessarily decided and material in the first action.parker blauvelt volunteer fire,see also,nas,transtech elecs.pte,d.
urfirer fraud claims do not raise issues that were necessarily decided by the divorce court.the district court reasoned that the divorce court discovery order and title order necessarily decided the scope and validity of the waiver,see,summary judgment order at,thereby precluding urfirer from arguing that the waiver was fraudulently obtained.we disagree for several reasons.
first,after carefully reviewing the divorce court orders,we are convinced that the divorce court passed only on the the the waiver provision,and thus no identical issue was raised,necessarily decided and material in the prior proceedings.parker,at.the divorce court discovery order addressed only the question of whether,in light of the waiver,urfirer retained any ownership interest in any of the cornfeld family holdings.accordingly,the divorce court stated,t he parties dispute hinge d on the scope of the waiver.discovery order at emphasis added.the divorce court held the waiver to be total and unequivocal,id.at,but never passed on its validity.the title order,similarly,amounted only to a declaration that based on the plain language of the parties agreement,urfirer had waived any claims and interest he had in the cornfeld family holdings.title order at.
the district court,in its summary judgment order,bases its conclusion that the fraud and fiduciary duty claims were necessarily decided on a brief discussion in the title order.in that order,the divorce court observed 
defendant raises a host of collateral issues,which have no bearing on the outcome of this motion.they are specifically addressed below 
d efendant raises speculative issues about whether he was defrauded when making the june,agreement,whether third parties were defrauded by cambridge.the papers contain veiled threats of multiple separate actions that will be brought sometime in the future.right now the june,agreement stands as an enforceable contract.there are no actions pending in which the defendant seeks to set it aside.moreover,this court seriously questions whether defendant claims,that he was unaware of certain acts and information before he signed the june,agreement,are sufficient to set it aside even more speculative is defendant claim that he might at sometime be sued by third parties on account of his prior ownership of cambridge.apparently these unnamed third parties have not yet sued or even threatened to sue defendant.if defendant is sued,his rights of indemnification are still separate from the rights of ownership that he claims in the cornfeld family holdings.
footnote defendant factual claims of ignorance are disputed by plaintiff.the court takes no position on this factual dispute.
title order at emphasis added citations omitted.
this discussion only reinforces the conclusion that the fraud and fiduciary duty claims were never properly before the divorce court,were not decided by the divorce court,and were not necessary or material to anything the divorce court did decide.the divorce court statements that the waiver is enforceable right now,that urfirer had not brought an action to set it aside,and that the speculative fraud issue ha d no bearing on the outcome of this motion,make plain that urfirer fraud and fiduciary duty claims were not necessarily decided by the divorce court.
additionally,although the district court did not discuss it,the divorce court july,order,addressing urfirer initial attempt to raise his fraud allegations in the divorce court,further illustrates that the divorce court explicitly left all fraud questions undecided.in that order,the divorce court declined to address the merits of urfirer fraud claims,finding them not properly before the court.the order states procedurally defendant motion for summary adjudication on a claim of fraud is defective because there is no pleading interposed by defendant in which he alleges a cause of action for fraud against plaintiff in view of the procedural defects,the court does not reach the issue of whether,if properly interposed,defendant even makes out a claim of fraud.order at.in light of these statements making clear that urfirer fraud claims were not properly before it,the divorce court can not be said to have necessarily decided those claims.
the only divorce court order to decide any fraud claim brought by urfirer is the divorce court most recent order,dismissing urfirer fraud claims against leslie cornfeld for failure to state a claim.notably,the cornfelds do not argue that this order has a preclusive effect on urfirer fraud claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld.the district court,however,suggested that the order had such an effect,declaring,this court will not engage in an empty exercise by vacating its prior decisions only to apply collateral estoppel based on the order rejecting urfirer latest attempt to invalidate the waiver provisions.order at.
after careful review of the latest divorce court order,we are convinced that it has no collateral estoppel effect on urfirer fraud and breach of fiduciary duty claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld,since the divorce court did not necessarily decide any issue material to these claims.the divorce court ruled only on whether leslie cornfeld defrauded or breached a fiduciary duty she owed urfirer.the grounds on which the divorce court dismissed the claims against leslie cornfeld included the fact that the duty of loyalty between spouses was inapplicable that there was no representation by leslie cornfeld,let alone a false one,or a material one,which is a necessary predicate for actual fraud,order at that leslie cornfeld was a limited rather than a general partner of ljs and therefore owed no duty to disclose operations information and that the alleged concealment was not material in the context of the negotiation of a agreement,order at.
the first ground is irrelevant to urfirer claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld,since no spousal relationship existed among those parties.as to the second ground,the fact that leslie cornfeld made no false representation to urfirer regarding ljs does not mean that the same is true of robert and jeffrey cornfeld.this is a factual question not previously addressed by the divorce court.as to the third ground,robert and jeffrey cornfeld are general partners of ljs,and therefore the duties they owed urfirer plainly differ from the duties leslie cornfeld owed him.
the fourth ground is the only one that may have some bearing on urfirer action against robert and jeffrey cornfeld.the divorce court reasoned that the allegedly concealed consisted of the sales of ljs property and deposit of the proceeds into ljs capital not material in the context of the negotiation of the agreement since w hether ljs held assets as real estate or in a cash account,it still had the same value at the time the waiver was agreed to.thus the change in value of the waiver due to the undisclosed sale was zero.order at.however,this determination by the divorce court does not have a collateral estoppel effect on urfirer fraud claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld.because the claims against robert and jeffrey cornfeld are not clearly limited to precisely the same transactions at issue in the case against leslie cornfeld,and because urfirer alleges that the fiduciary duty robert and jeffrey cornfeld owed him arose out of their positions as general partners of context broader than the negotiation of the agreement the divorce court did not necessarily decide that anything robert or jeffrey cornfeld may have improperly concealed from urfirer was immaterial.
the effect that the latest order of the divorce court does have is to clarify that under new york law,neither the discovery order nor the title order has any collateral estoppel effect on urfirer fraud and fiduciary duty claims.in fact,the divorce court stated unambiguously that these claims were never necessarily decided by any new york court,declaring no order of this court or those of the appellate division of this state reached the fraud and related issues.order at.its prior orders expressly dealing with the waiver only interpreted its scope.id.at.indeed the court could not have reached such issues until the instant pleading was interposed,id.at,because the fraud allegations were never properly before the divorce court.in addition,the divorce court noted that the relief sought was different,agreeing with urfirer that he was not precluded from seeking relief other than recision of their agreement.id.at.this discussion explicitly rejects the outcome of the district court action which it refers to as the florida action,making plain that the district court conclusion that the new york orders collaterally estop defendant was erroneous under new york law.see id.at.
moreover,the divorce court rulings in the divorce dispute between urfirer and leslie cornfeld can not fairly be held to preclude urfirer claims for damages against robert and jeffrey cornfeld since the cornfeld defendants were never parties to those divorce proceedings or to the settlement agreement and could not have been sued for damages in that proceeding.as nonparties,the issue of whether the cornfelds may be liable for damages arising out a breach of fiduciary duty or fraudulent misrepresentation to urfirer was not actually before the judge and open to determination when s he rendered her decision,nor was such a determination necessary to support the result s he ultimately reached in ruling on the scope of the waiver provision of urfirer settlement agreement with leslie cornfeld.whitney holdings.at.
the cornfelds argue,however,that the fact urfirer is seeking damages rather than rescission of the agreement demonstrates that he has ratified the waiver provision and thus can no longer challenge it on the ground that it was fraudulently obtained.they quote urfirer reply affidavit,in which he stated i am not seeking to rescind the june,agreement.i am not seeking to vitiate my agreement to waive my interest in the cornfeld family holdings.i am narrowly tailoring the relief i am seeking to simply undo the fraud,and include the cash in the ljs account as of june,in the marital pot for ultimate equitable distribution.this statement is borne out by urfirer complaint,in which he requests only compensatory and punitive damages,not rescission of the agreement.
however,under new york law,a plaintiff is not precluded from bringing an action for damages for deceit although he or she has affirmed the contract subsequent to discovering the fraud a n affirmance of the contract is consistent with such action for damages.jur d fraud and deceit.the law is well settled in new york that one who is induced by fraud to enter into a contract may pursue one of three remedies he may rescind the contract absolutely,and sue in an action at law to recover the consideration parted wit
