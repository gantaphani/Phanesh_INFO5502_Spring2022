background 
appellant leonard armato and respondent elizabeth stewart are former spouses.on december,their marriage was dissolved by a judgment of dissolution entered in this case.the judgment included provisions obligating leonard to pay child support for the couple sons,anthony armato,then age six,and elio armato,then age four.
more specifically,the judgment required monthly child support in the amount of per child from july,through december.beginning january,monthly child support increased to per child.payments were to continue until each child attains the age of nineteen years or attains the age of eighteen years and is not a high school student or until said child enters into a valid marriage is on active duty with any of the armed forces of the united states of america or receives a declaration of emancipation under california law,or further order of the court,whichever first occurs.
as stated in the judgment,leonard and elizabeth were awarded shared physical custody of the minor children,elizabeth primary and leonard secondary,pursuant to their present arrangement.with respect to custody on holidays,the judgment recited that t he parties shall continue to share custody of the children for all holiday periods equally as they have previously done.
the judgment also provided that t he court in the pending action has continuing jurisdiction to effectuate the terms of this judgment no separate proceedings,partition,or otherwise shall be required.
in,three years after the entry of judgment,leonard filed an order to show cause re modification of child custody and visitation.the matter was heard in may and june.by order dated december,the trial court increased leonard time with the children and imposed a detailed schedule of custody applicable to holidays.
in late and early,elizabeth attorney contemplated filing an order to show cause to obtain an increase in child support.elizabeth could not afford to pay the boys school tuition and was already delinquent in that regard.on several occasions,counsel for the respective parties discussed aspects of the case.meanwhile,elizabeth and leonard talked to each other about child support.in march,they reached a voluntary arrangement.leonard agreed to increase monthly child support from per child to for a period of two years.after that,leonard would resume paying.elizabeth agreed to take responsibility for meeting all of the boys needs,including the payment of tuition.leonard,an attorney himself,reduced the agreement to writing in the form of a letter agreement dated march,which he and elizabeth signed.
leonard made the higher support payments from march until april.on april,he sent elizabeth a letter,stating that he could no longer afford the increased payments.leonard attributed the change in his financial situation to an earlier decision in which he had assumed sole liability for one of elizabeth business debts,a failed real estate deal.as he explained in the letter 
a ll the claims in the real estate case relate to the construction work on the property performed solely by you i agreed to assume your liabilities in return for your full cooperation throughout the case and based upon your representation that there was little wrong with the construction work performed on the property.without addressing the fairness of that arrangement,the accuracy of your representation,or the fulfillment of your obligation,suffice it to say that this matter has been and continues to be extremely burdensome to me,both financially and otherwise.
beginning may,leonard resumed paying monthly child support of per child.in essence,he offset the loss on the real estate deal against the child support payments due under the march,letter agreement.
on january,elizabeth filed a motion in this action to enforce the march,letter agreement pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.that statute provides if parties to pending litigation stipulate,in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court,for settlement of the case,or part thereof,the court,upon motion,may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement hereafter section.
leonard opposed the motion on the ground that,when the letter agreement was executed,there was no pending litigation.he asserted that,instead of filing a section motion in this action,elizabeth was required to file a new civil action alleging breach of contract.
the motion was heard on february.after argument from both sides,the trial court granted the motion,stating i believe that they were parties to a pending action inasmuch as there was continuing jurisdiction to modify a support order in a family law case.and,therefore,there was a pending action.the trial court instructed elizabeth counsel to submit a proposed order.
on march,the trial court entered an order granting elizabeth motion to enforce the agreement.leonard was directed to pay monthly child support of per child from march,through february.thereafter,the payments would revert to.the order also instructed elizabeth to take full responsibility for the children financial needs,including the payment of tuition for school.on may,leonard filed a timely appeal from the trial court order.
discussion 
because this appeal involves the application of various statutes to undisputed facts,we review the trial court decision de novo.state farm mut.auto.ins.department of motor vehicles th,d.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.bodell construction trustees of cal.state university th,d,citations omitted.
in this case,the dispute rests on the meaning of pending litigation as used in section.leonard argues that there was no litigation pending when the letter agreement was executed,and,as a result,section does not apply.he contends that to enforce the agreement or to recover damages for its breach,elizabeth had to file a separate civil action for breach of contract.he does not challenge the formation or validity of the agreement,only the manner in which it was enforced.for several reasons,we conclude that the trial court properly enforced the agreement under section.
terms of the judgment 
the judgment of source of leonard obligation to pay child that t he court in the pending action has continuing jurisdiction to effectuate the terms of this judgment no separate proceedings,partition,or otherwise shall be required.italics added.thus,the judgment provided that any future child support issues would be decided in this action,not a separate civil suit.
section and family law 
the use of section in conjunction with the family code would promote one of the primary goals of family simple and expedient resolution of disputes that arise after the dissolution of marriage.
section was enacted in p rior to the courts of appeal had expressed conflicting views concerning the proper procedures to enforce settlement agreements in pending litigation.
under one line of authority,settlement agreements preceding the enactment of section in could be enforced only by a motion for summary judgment,a separate suit in equity,or an amendment to the pleadings.this became the dominant view it was based on the theory that nonstatutory motions to enforce settlements were motions based on facts outside the pleadings and,under the supreme court decisions had to be treated as motions for summary judgment that could be granted only if all of the papers submitted showed there was no triable issue of fact 
a second line of authority permitted motions to enforce settlements based on facts outside the pleadings if the fact of settlement and the terms of the settlement were not subject to reasonable dispute the theory underlying this approach was that the statutory means of enforcing settlements by motions for summary judgment,separate suits in equity,or amendments to pleadings were inadequate,and that a court therefore must have authority to enforce settlements as a means of controlling proceedings before the court and protecting the interest of the parties 
the conflict was resolved in when the legislature enacted section,which created a summary,expedited procedure to enforce settlement agreements when certain requirements that decrease the likelihood of misunderstandings are met.levy superior court cal th,d,citations omitted,italics added see city of fresno maroot d.section is an expedient and cost effective means of enforcing a settlement agreement.
similarly,with respect to modifying child support orders,the legislature,the judicial council,and the courts have expressed a preference for simple and expedited proceedings.
public policy places a high priority on enforcement of child support awards.the legislature and the judicial council have expressed that policy by creating simplified methods for enforcing and modifying support awards 
that the court may retain jurisdiction to modify or enforce support awards following the final decree of dissolution reinforces the policy of preserving access to the courts and to modification and enforcement mechanisms.furthermore,f lexibility in the administration of judgments which will affect the lives of the parties far into the future,especially after very lengthy marriages,is to be encouraged in few other fields do the equities scream quite so loudly as they do in family law.
thus,a strong policy favors access to the court in family law matters the courts must remain open to claims seeking to modify or enforce spousal support or similar awards.chauncey niems d,citations omitted,italics added.
in,the legislature declared there is currently no simple method available to parents to quickly modify their support orders when circumstances warrant a change in the amount of support.the lack of a simple method for parents to use to modify support orders has led to orders in which the amount of support ordered is inappropriate based on the parents financial circumstances.parents should not have to incur significant costs or experience significant delays in obtaining an appropriate support order.therefore,it is the intent of the legislature that the judicial council adopt rules of court and forms for a simplified method to modify support orders.this simplified method should be designed to be used by parents who are not represented by counsel,added by stats,ch.
the judicial council carried out its legislative mandate by creating a set of forms,two of which are instructional sheets containing procedural information.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group to,to,forms b to e,to.the forms offer the parent a simplified means by which to obtain modification of a support order.the simplified procedures were adopted to create a relatively quick way to modify child support awards in a proceeding at which neither party need engage an attorney.in re marriage of damico cal th,d,dis.opn.of baxter,italics added.
in the same vein,the legislature has streamline d the enforcement of child support orders by preventing the parties from raising unrelated claims to reduce or eliminate their support obligations.by prohibiting the consideration of factually or legally unrelated claims,the family code focuses the attention of the parties and of the court on the most important issue the financial support of a child.keith suzanne th,d,italics added see.
several provisions of the family code emphasize the value of an effective,expedient resolution of child support issues.for instance,a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a.child support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support reflecting the state high standard of living and high costs of raising children,subd.l,italics added.in addition,the statewide uniform guideline on child support,seeks to encourage fair and efficient settlements of conflicts between parents and seeks to minimize the need for litigation,subd.j,italics added.
further,while the statutory duty to support a child generally terminates upon the age of majority see,subd.a,n othing in the statute limits a parent ability to agree to provide additional support or the court power to inquire whether an agreement to provide additional support has been made,subd.b,italics added.
and,after the entry of a judgment of dissolution,a custodial parent is entitled,upon written request,to an annual declaration of income and expenses from the parent paying child support,regardless of whether a notice of motion or order to show cause has been filed.see.by mandating the production of such information,the family code provides the parties with a means to resolve support issues without judicial intervention,permits the parties to reassess on a periodic basis whether a modification is warranted,discourages the filing of meritless claims for a change in support,and encourages the use of voluntary agreements to modify support payments.
plainly,the need for simplicity and expediency in family law matters suggests that,in a dissolution action,section should apply to the parties signed agreement modifying child support.in this case,for example,elizabeth section motion was filed on january.the trial court ruled on the motion one month later.no doubt,if elizabeth had been required to comply with leonard proposed a civil action for breach of dispute would not have been resolved as quickly.
moreover,if leonard believed that he could not afford the higher payments required by the letter agreement,he could have filed an order to show cause or a notice of motion,asserting a change of circumstances.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,to,to,to,to.
no offset against child support 
a parent who is ordered to pay child support can not offset a business debt against that obligation.see williams williams d.in re marriage of stutz d.s ince a child support obligation runs to the child and not the parent,a debt owed by the custodial parent to the supporting parent generally can not be offset against child support arrearages.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,see.
as leonard would have it,elizabeth only means of seeking relief for a breach of the letter agreement was to file a new civil action,thereby giving him an opportunity to reduce child support by way of a seeking to recover damages on the real estate deal.see keith suzanne,supra,th at,d.while we express no view as to whether such a reduction would have been allowed,we conclude that elizabeth could seek relief in the present action.
w hen the fact of settlement and the terms thereof are not subject to reasonable dispute,to require a party to bring a separate suit in equity to enforce the agreement would defeat the very purpose that the settlement is designed to achieve,avoiding the time and expense of trial in re marriage of assemi cal th,d.
by insisting that elizabeth had to file a separate civil action in which he could have filed a,leonard hoped to accomplish an around established principles of family law that bar an offset of business debts.for that reason,among others,disputes over the modification of child support should ordinarily be heard in the family law action in which the original support obligation was imposed.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,to,to.
historical treatment of support orders 
in deciding whether the letter agreement was executed during pending litigation,it is helpful to review the history of support orders in california.
for decades,the courts of this state have held that they retain jurisdiction over support orders even after a judgment of dissolution has become final and is no longer appealable.as early as,the supreme court stated i t is certain that the trial court may fix a specified sum for the support of the child as a matter of administrative convenience and may vary its amount from time to time in the exercise of its sound discretion.sherer.industrial acc.com.cal,hereafter sherer.
in lamborn lamborn cal,the supreme court addressed the question of whether a trial court could enter a support order after a decree of divorce had become final.there,the wife moved for an order of support to cover the attorneys fees and costs she had incurred in the divorce action.the husband opposed the motion,relying on section of the code of civil procedure.that statute provides an action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed,unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.
the husband argued that because the time to appeal the divorce decree had expired in accordance with section,the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion for support.the trial court rejected the husband argument and granted the motion.on appeal,the supreme court agreed,stating 
it is true that an ordinary action is deemed to be pending only until the appeal from the judgment is determined or until the time for an appeal has passed,code civ.proc,but this general provision of the statute with reference to ordinary judgments is modified in the case of divorce actions by the provisions of the code authorizing the modification of an award for alimony at any time after the final decree is entered.lamborn lamborn,supra,cal.at,italics added,applying former,now,see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,to,to.
although lamborn involved spousal support,the same analysis applies to child support.as with an award of spousal support,a trial court is authorized by the family code to modify child support after a judgment of dissolution has been entered.see,subd.a hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,to,to.thus,notwithstanding section of the code of civil procedure,a dissolution action remains pending for purposes of child support.clayton clayton d,see,code of civil procedure and rules governing civil actions apply to family law cases unless family code provides applicable procedure or rule.
in jacobs jacobs,the wife moved for an award of attorneys fees incurred in successfully opposing the husband motion to modify the decree of divorce.the trial court granted her motion,and the husband appealed.the court of appeal found no error,saying the husband only argument is that the divorce decree had become final prior to the time the motion for attorneys fees was heard and that there was,therefore,no divorce action pending.from this it is argued that the court was without power to award counsel fees to the wife the precise point has been ruled on adversely to the husband in lamborn lamborn,supra,cal,where the supreme court held that because of the power to modify orders relating to alimony,a divorce case was deemed to be pending after the time for appeal had expired so that the court had jurisdiction to allow the wife counsel fees to resist a motion for modification of the alimony order and to prosecute an appeal from an order reducing her alimony.at,italics added,applying former,now.
in moore superior court cal,the wife moved for an increase in child support after the entry of a final decree of divorce.the husband made a special appearance,arguing that the trial court had lost personal jurisdiction over him upon the entry of the final decree.the trial court found otherwise and granted the motion.the supreme court affirmed,explaining 
t he entry of a decree of divorce,in so far as it relates to the custody,care,and maintenance of the minor children of the parties thereto,is not a finality,but over whom,during their said minority as well as over their parents,the trial court retains a continuing jurisdiction which is as complete as that possessed by it prior to the entry of said final decree as it seems to us,the true basis upon which the power to modify the decree rests is that out of the marital relation springs a new relationship,that of parent and child the courts may decree that the marital tie shall be absolutely severed and the parties be placed,so far as the law is concerned,in the same situation that they occupied prior to the solemnization of the marriage ceremony but they can not alter or modify the fact that a father is the parent of his offspring the court,therefore,acting upon this relationship as one of the things brought to it by the divorce action,has the power to modify or alter its decree so long as there are minor children under the protection of the court.moore superior court,supra,cal.at,italics added.
in rosher superior court cal d,a decree of divorce provided that the husband would pay child support while his daughter was a minor under age.by the time the daughter turned,the legislature had raised the age of majority for women to.the trial court ordered the husband to continue paying child support for the extended period.the husband refused and was found in contempt.he appealed.the supreme court concluded that the finding of contempt was proper,stating 
it is settled that the power of the court to make and modify orders for the support of minor children is independent of any reservation of authority in the original decree that proper provision for their support may be made at any time during the period of minority and that the propriety of the provision to be made is to be determined in the light of the circumstances existing at the time the application is made 
such an order can not,therefore,be considered a judgment in the sense of its being a final adjudication of the rights and duties of the parent and the minor child.it was not intended to and does not operate to crystallize or limit the duty of the parent to support his minor child,but merely defines the extent of his duty during the life of the order the divorce decree and support order neither separately nor in conjunction constitute a permanent and final adjudication of the extent of his obligation to support his minor child.rosher superior court,supra,cal d at,italics added,applying former,now.
in reynolds reynolds cal d,the trial court entered a final decree of divorce in.six years later,the wife sought an increase in child support and served the motion papers by mailing them to the husband attorneys of record in the divorce action.the question before the supreme court was whether the service of the notice and order to show cause upon the attorneys who represented the defendant in the divorce action was valid as a service upon attorneys then of record.id.at,hereafter reynolds.at the time,an attorney could withdraw from a case only with the consent of the client or pursuant to court order.see amendments,deering civ.proc.ed.foll.in addition,a notice of withdrawal had to be served on the adverse party.
in finding that service was valid,the supreme court observed after appearance in an action a defendant or his attorney is entitled to notice of all subsequent proceedings of which notice is required to be given 
a client may of course discharge his attorney at any time,but during the course of a proceeding service of pa
