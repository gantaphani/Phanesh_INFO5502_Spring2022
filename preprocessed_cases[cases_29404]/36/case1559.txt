renee petitions for extraordinary relief from the trial court order terminating her reunification services with her daughter,sayrah,and resetting the matter for a permanency planning hearing.she contends the trial court erred in applying the california supreme court interpretation of welfare and institutions code section,former subdivision b,adjudged in an earlier phase of this case renee superior court cal th,d,because the california legislature almost immediately overrode that interpretation by amending the statute.in the unusual to say the least circumstances of this case,we agree.we conclude the legislature intended its statutory amendment to be a clarification,and applied to all cases still pending,including this one.that retroactive clarification of the law provides an exception to the doctrine of law of the case.although the trial court had no way of knowing about the statutory change at the time it ruled,and thus can not be faulted for that ruling,it is proper for renee to raise the legal argument for the first time at the appellate level,and proper for us to reverse the trial court ruling.
this case,and more specifically the issue of providing reunification services,has a unique history in the annals of california jurisprudence.renee earlier petitioned this court for relief when the trial court denied her reunification services at the dispositional hearing pursuant to former subdivision b.in that earlier petition,the primary issue was whether former subdivision b authorized the court to deny reunification services to a parent who had previously failed to reunify with another child,even without an additional finding that the parent had not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problem which led to the removal of the prior child.the orange county social services agency ssa contended that the no reasonable effort finding was required only in the case of a parent who had had his or her parental rights terminated in the case of a prior child,but that no such finding was necessary to deny reunification services to a parent who had previously failed at reunification.
we concluded that a proper interpretation of the language in former subdivision b required the court to make a finding that the parent had not made a reasonable effort to treat the problem which had led to the prior removal of another child,before denying services to either a parent who had failed to reunify with the other child or a parent who had rights terminated to the other child.on the basis of that interpretation,we determined that former subdivision b did not authorize denial of services on the evidence which had been presented in this case,and ordered the case remanded with instructions to hold a new dispositional hearing at which reunification services would be offered.
during the time her petition was pending before us,renee made efforts,albeit imperfect ones,to demonstrate her commitment to sobriety.after her release from jail in april of,she began looking for employment.she also began a perinatal drug program,and was given referrals to parenting classes.however,during june and july of,renee missed several scheduled drug tests,and then tested positive for methamphetamine on july.renee drug counselor was concerned that t hings are slipping.
ssa petitioned the california supreme court for review of our writ decision.in september of,while the case was pending before the supreme court,the trial court went ahead and ordered that reunification services be provided in accordance with our opinion.the court noted we can not have,in the best interests of this child,this child sit in limbo while the supreme court decides the petition,which may be remanded back to the appellate court,who knows,and it could be anywhere from six months to a year i have not heard from the california supreme court.and so i following the court of appeals sic,which says,provide mother reunification services,which i intend to do.
perhaps confounding the expectations of some,renee has performed quite well under her reunification plan.although she initially had a positive drug test in november of,and consequently spent a bit more time in jail for the probation violation,her conduct since then has been nearly flawless.renee participated in a drug treatment program upon her release from jail,and reportedly did well.thereafter,renee was accepted into a sober living home,the eleventh step house.although renee made efforts to locate a sober living home which would allow her to have sayrah with her,she was unable to do so.at its status review hearing in march of,the court found that continued supervision was necessary,that returning sayrah to renee would cause a substantial risk of detriment,but that there was a substantial probability that sayrah would be returned to renee custody within six months.the court ordered additional reunification services and set the matter for a status review hearing on october.
renee continued to improve in her performance under the reunification plan.she was living successfully in the sober living home,regularly drug testing,attending meetings,going to drug court,and working.both her probation officer and the director of her sober living home were effusive in their praise for her efforts.the probation officer stated s he has never submitted a dirty test and never received even minor consequences in the program.she is doing everything so far as we can tell,perfectly.all of the team members have been very impressed.as an example of renee newfound sense of responsibility,the sober living home director related how renee had been working at target,which required a bus ride.since that distance proved too far to manage without a car,renee waited until she could obtain another job closer to home,before resigning from target to continue the new employment.the director stated renee is approaching things in a responsible way she is willing to do anything to get her child back.
on august,the supreme court reversed our decision.renee superior court cal th,d.in the supreme court view,the language of former subdivision b was ambiguous in the relevant respect and the canons of construction of little assistance in resolving the question renee superior court,supra cal th at,d.it determined,however,that the legislature intent could nonetheless be discerned f rom recent legislative trends toward restricting the circumstances in which reunification services must be provided ibid.based upon those trends,the supreme court concluded the legislature would not have intended the no reasonable effort clause to apply to subpart a of former subdivision b.in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court expressly acknowledged that its interpretation might be incorrect,and invited the legislature to clarify the law in sum,we interpret the clause as applicable only to subpart b of section,subdivision b.if we have failed to discern correctly the legislature intent in enacting the statute,that body may clarify the statute accordingly.id.at,d.
the legislature did so,with alacrity.approximately three weeks after the supreme court rendered its opinion,the legislature introduced an amendment to assembly bill.that amendment restructured the clauses of subdivision b,creating a new subparagraph b,to clarify that the no reasonable effort clause did apply to both former subparts a and b.as explained in an analysis from the senate rules committee,i n current law,a court may choose to not provide reunification services when a parent previously failed to reunify with a sibling of the child in question and when a parent parental rights have been terminated with a sibling of the child in question.the law also requires a finding that the parent has not made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling.these amendments clarify that the requirement of a finding that the parent had not made reasonable efforts to treat the problems applies to both situations above,failure to reunify and permanent severance of parental rights.this is being done in response to a state supreme court opinion that states that this requirement only applies to cases in which parental rights have been terminated,and also suggests that the legislature clarify the law.according to the author,it was the intent of the legislature that the requirement apply to both situations described above.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
assembly bill,including the clarification of former subdivision b,was passed by the legislature and then signed into law as an urgency measure by governor davis on october.it consequently took effect on that date.in an improbable coincidence,that was the very same date the court had scheduled the status review hearing which is at issue in this writ proceeding.
the october hearing,as originally contemplated,has been referred to by the parties as both a hearing and an hearing,because it fell roughly months after renee began her reunification plan,but months after sayrah was initially detained.however,the court did not actually hold the status review hearing.instead,the court concluded that in light of the supreme court ruling affirming the initial denial of reunification,it had no choice but to terminate the process without actually conducting the review hearing.t he effect of the supreme court decision is to reverse the court of appeals sic decision to vacate the disposition findings and to reverse the order of services which follow from the vacating of the disposition because the initial disposition was not to offer services pursuant to section subdivision b and the construction of that language.based upon that analysis,the court simply terminated the reunification services and scheduled a section hearing for january,without actually conducting the review hearing or considering renee progress toward reunification.
because neither the parties nor the court was aware of the amendment of subdivision b at the time of the october hearing,it was not discussed.however,when renee became aware of the amendment,she promptly sought reconsideration of the court order pursuant to code of civil procedure section the court scheduled a hearing date of november,for the reconsideration motion,and invited the parties to file further briefing.at the november hearing,the court considered the parties arguments,and took the matter under submission.
while waiting for the court to issue its decision on the reconsideration motion,renee petitioned this court for relief.she acknowledged that if the trial court granted the reconsideration and changed its prior ruling,her petition would become moot.however,she explained that with the permanency planning hearing scheduled for january,she could not safely wait longer before petitioning for relief.
ultimately,the court denied the motion for reconsideration.it held that a motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section was not an available remedy in a juvenile dependency proceeding.it also concluded that the legislature amendment of subdivision b was not retroactive and had no effect on the supreme court decision in the earlier writ proceeding.the court noted,however,that renee is not prohibited from filing a section motion to modify the setting of the section hearing and using the benefit of the reunification services received as the basis of her request to modify.
renee contends that the trial court erred in terminating her reunification services based upon the supreme court decision,because the legislature clarification of the statute in question,which was effective on the date the trial court made its order,governed her case.of course,renee did not initially raise that issue before the trial court,because the brand new legislation was unknown to any of the participants at the october,hearing.however,renee did promptly raise the issue before this court,and we have discretion to consider it.a litigant may raise for the first time on appeal a pure question of law which is presented by undisputed facts.sanchez truck ins.exchange th,d,quoting b p development city of saratoga d.see also people superior court zamudio cal th,d.
in this case,if renee is correct and the legislature intended to give the statute retroactive effect,then the legislation applied to this case and the trial court erred in terminating the previously ordered reunification services.
ssa contends that the legislative amendment can not be construed as retroactive,and thus applicable to this case,because the legislature did not expressly declare it so but that is not the standard.in western security bank superior court cal th,d,the supreme court addressed the effect of a statutory amendment,under circumstances very similar to those presented here.
in western security bank,the court of appeal had interpreted laws as prohibiting enforcement of standby letters of credit given as additional security in a real estate transaction.immediately thereafter,and while the case was pending before the supreme court,the legislature acted to amend the laws and make clear that enforcement of a letter of credit did not run afoul of the laws.the supreme court then remanded the case to the court of appeal with directions to vacate its prior decision and reconsider the cause.on reconsideration,the court of appeal reaffirmed its prior decision,concluding that the new legislation represented a substantial change in the law which was not entitled to retroactive effect.our supreme court then reversed the court of appeal.its analysis was thorough,and we will quote it at length.
a basic canon of statutory interpretation is that statutes do not operate retrospectively unless the legislature plainly intended them to do so.citations.a statute has retrospective effect when it substantially changes the legal consequences of past events.citation.a statute does not operate retrospectively simply because its application depends on facts or conditions existing before its enactment.citation.of course,when the legislature clearly intends a statute to operate retrospectively,we are obliged to carry out that intent unless due process considerations prevent us.a corollary to these rules is that a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment.we assume the legislature amends a statute for a purpose,but that purpose need not necessarily be to change the law.citation.our consideration of the surrounding circumstances can indicate that the legislature made material changes in statutory language in an effort only to clarify a statute true meaning.citations.such a legislative act has no retrospective effect because the true meaning of the statute remains the same.citations.one such circumstance is when the legislature promptly reacts to the emergence of a novel question of statutory interpretation an amendment which in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act,where the amendment was adopted soon after the controversy arose concerning the proper interpretation of the statute.if the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act,it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original formal the presumption of substantial change.citation.citation.even so,a legislative declaration of an existing statute meaning is neither binding nor conclusive in construing the statute.ultimately,the interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power the constitution assigns to the courts.citations.indeed,there is little logic and some incongruity in the notion that one legislature may speak authoritatively on the intent of an earlier legislature enactment when a gulf of decades separates the two bodies.citation.nevertheless,the legislature expressed views on the prior import of its statutes are entitled to due consideration,and we can not disregard them.a subsequent expression of the legislature as to the intent of the prior statute,although not binding on the court,may properly be used in determining the effect of a prior act.citation.moreover,even if the court does not accept the legislature assurance that an unmistakable change in the law is merely a clarifica
