we review the propriety of actions taken during the course of a child abuse investigation and subsequent dependency proceedings.matilda mabe sued,on various state and federal grounds,the social worker conducting the investigation,certain supervisors and colleagues,the county agency that employs them,and two individuals who later provided foster care to mabe minor daughter.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on all claims.mabe argues that appellees are liable for damages under for their actions in removing mabe daughter md from her home without a warrant and subsequently placing her in foster care.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part because there is a material question of fact regarding the liability of the investigating county social worker.
background.
on july,the san bernardino county sheriff department received a call from stephanie rumpler that her younger sister,md,at the time a year old minor,had been molested by her stepfather,mabe husband.md reported that the stepfather had touched her breasts and crotch area through her clothing at night in her bedroom and that this had been occurring every other night for the past two or three months.at the time of the initial telephonic report to police,md was visiting her sister in northern california.a few days later,md returned to the home shared by mabe and the stepfather in san bernardino county.
the deputy sheriff who took md complaint contacted mabe,who responded that md made up stories and embellished facts.next,the deputy spoke to the stepfather,who stated that md was lying.no criminal charges were ever filed against the stepfather.
appellee karen perry,a san bernardino county social worker with the department of social services,was assigned the case.perry spoke with the deputy sheriff regarding his conversations with rumpler,md,mabe,and the stepfather.perry learned that the stepfather had also allegedly mooned md on some prior occasion when he exposed his buttocks to her.
nearly one month after the initial telephonic report was made,on august,perry interviewed both mabe and md at their home.according to perry,mabe claimed that no abuse had occurred and that the mooning incident by the stepfather was md fault because she had done it to him first.md told perry that no further acts had occurred since her return to their residence after the initial police report was made.perry maintains that at the time of this interview she believed that there was child abuse in the home,that there was pressure being exerted on md in retaliation for reporting the touching to authorities,and that the stepfather still had unrestricted access to.nonetheless,perry decided to leave md in the home shared by mabe,the stepfather,and.md testified on deposition that during this interview perry told md that she would see whether she needed to remove md from the home.
on august,four days after leaving md in the home,perry presented her report of md situation to an agency case review committee for evaluation.the committee recommended that md be placed out of the home and that a california welfare and institutions code child dependency petition be filed with the juvenile court.after receiving this recommendation,perry and a sheriff deputy went to mabe home later that day without a warrant and removed.
both sides agree that mabe did not consent to the officials warrantless entry into her home.nor did perry give advance notice to mabe that she would return to the home at this time.mabe strongly objected to md removal from the home.perry alleges that mabe was very upset,allegedly harassing md during the removal.mabe insists that the stepfather told perry that he was willing to leave the house if necessary to allow md to remain in her mother home.
the california juvenile court later found that there was substantial danger to the physical of md and that there were no reasonable services that would have allowed for her to remain safely in her mother home.md was initially placed in foster care and then the court gave temporary custody to rumpler.md placement was monitored by perry and other social workers for four years until dependency proceedings were dismissed when md turned.
mabe lawsuit seeks damages from perry,certain supervisors and colleagues,san bernardino county,md initial foster mother,and rumpler.the district court dismissed several of the counts alleged in the original complaint against some of the defendants for failure to state a claim.mabe second amended complaint contained causes of action including federal civil rights claims and state law claims.the county appellees and rumpler separately filed motions for summary judgment claiming immunity.a magistrate judge recommended that the defendants motions be granted and the action be dismissed in its entirety.the district judge granted summary judgment to all defendants on all claims based in part upon a finding that the defendants were entitled to immunity.mabe appeals.
ii.discussion.
scope and standards of review.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see balint carson city,cir en banc.the type of immunity to which a public official is entitled is a question of law also reviewed de novo.see greater los angeles council on deafness,zolin,cir.
whether governing law was clearly established is a legal determination reviewed de novo.mitchell forsyth,d qualified immunity.whether specific facts constitute a violation of established law is a legal determination reviewed de novo.armendariz penman,cir en banc assuming facts in light most favorable to nonmoving party.when examining the validity of a warrantless search and seizure,exigent circumstances present a mixed question of law and fact reviewed de novo.united states hudson,cir.
liability of the individual appellees under section.
section creates a cause of action against any person who,acting under color of state law,violates the constitutional rights of another person.see.the individual appellees say that either they did not personally cause mabe alleged constitutional violations or that they are immune from suit for their official actions,which precludes mabe recovery under section.
when deciding whether a public official is immune from liability for acts performed in her official capacity,qualified immunity is the general rule and absolute immunity the exceptional case.see zolin,at citing harlow fitzgerald,d.it is that the immunity to which a public official is entitled depends not on the official title or agency,but on the nature of the function that the person was performing when taking the actions that provoked the lawsuit.see id.
mabe claim against the individual appellees involves official conduct encompassing two different functions conduct relating to the removal of md from her home and conduct involving the dependency proceedings.because the immunity inquiry under section is different for the two governmental functions performed,we address each separately.
a.the removal of.
liability of perry for the removal of.
mabe argues that social worker perry is not entitled to qualified immunity because her conduct in removing md without a warrant was unlawful under the constitution.qualified immunity shields a government official from liability for civil damages if the law governing the official conduct was clearly established and under that law,the official objectively could have believed that her conduct was lawful.see ram rubin,cir involving the qualified immunity of a social worker and a police officer.
government officials are required to obtain prior judicial authorization before intruding on a parent custody of her child unless they possess information at the time of the seizure that establishes reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury.wallis spencer,cir citing mincey arizona,d.
the first prong of the qualified immunity test focuses on whether the law governing perry removal of md from the mabe home was clearly established.the constitutional right of parents and children to live together without governmental interference is well established.see santosky kramer,d.the fourteenth amendment guarantees that parents will not be separated from their children without due process of law except in emergencies.see stanley illinois,d ram,at cir holding that in it was clear that a parent had a constitutionally protected right to the care and custody of his children and that he could not be summarily deprived of that custody without notice and a hearing except when the children were in imminent danger.
the second prong of the qualified immunity test focuses on whether a reasonable official could have believed her conduct was lawful.see id.whether perry could have believed that removing md under the facts of this case was lawful depends on whether a reasonable social worker could have believed that exigent circumstances existed on august,sufficient to override the warrant requirement.see white pierce county,cir citing payton new york,d.two relevant cases involving the availability of qualified immunity based on claims of exigency for officials conducting child abuse investigations bracket the facts in this case.
in white,exigent circumstances excused the need for a warrant.we concluded that the deputies had probable cause to believe the child had been abused and that the child would be injured or could not be taken into custody if it were first necessary to obtain a court order.id.applying a washington state child abuse statute directing immediate seizure if officers had probable cause to suspect imminent danger.accordingly,we reversed the district court denial of defendant motion for summary judgment upon a finding of qualified immunity.id.
an opposite result was reached in calabretta floyd,cir.in calabretta,the summary judgment motion filed by the social worker and police officer,on the grounds of qualified immunity,was denied by the district court.we affirmed because a reasonable government official would have known that exigent circumstances justifying warrantless entry into the parents home did not exist that consent or a warrant was required for entry and that qualified immunity was not available with respect to the coerced strip search of a child.see id.
the social worker in calabretta,investigating allegations of child abuse,went to the residence and spoke to the mother.id.at.ten days later,the social worker returned to the residence with a police officer and made a coerced,warrantless entry into the house.id.at.the social worker also coerced the mother to pull down the pants of one of the children so the social worker could check for signs of abuse.id.at.under these facts,the calabretta court,citing white,held that the government officials were not entitled to qualified immunity because there was no showing of imminent danger to the children.id.at,nn.
the facts in this case appear to fall somewhere in between calabretta and white.the record shows that the mother,mabe,was hostile to the social worker,perry,and to her daughter,md,during perry investigation,which is arguably similar to the father hostile behavior in white,giving rise to a reasonable fear that the child was in imminent physical danger.however,in white,the officers had a reasonable fear that because the father,the potential abuser,was hostile about the investigation,the child would be harmed in any time it would take to obtain a warrant.see white,at.in contrast,perry concerns that mabe was hostile to the veracity of md allegations against her husband are not directly related to how he himself might react when faced with md allegations of sexual abuse.
both calabretta and white are distinguishable from this case because the allegations of abuse being investigated in those cases were not provided by the victim or people with personal knowledge of any abuse.in this case,perry had the victim report of abuse.this is significantly more compelling evidence to support the social worker reasonable belief that abuse had occurred and that the child was still in danger of future harm than in calabretta or in white,where a neighbor report formed the basis of suspicion of child abuse.
nonetheless,imminent danger of future harm is required to show exigency.several facts,viewed in the light most favorable to mabe,undermine a reasonable belief of exigency here.first,and most importantly,perry opted to leave md in the residence after interviewing md and mabe about the alleged molestation.perry told md at the end of the interview on august,that she would see if md needed to be removed from the home.this demonstrates perry intent to delay the removal,which raises a serious question about perry reasonable belief that md was in imminent danger on august,similar to the delay in calabretta.
second,perry concedes that the improper touching had not been recurring since md returned home over a month after the initial police report was made.unlike white,this case does not present the concern that the child would be concealed or further abused during the time it would take to get a warrant because such retribution had not happened to md since her return home after mabe and the stepfather were both told that a police report had been filed.
third,the type of abuse here is qualitatively different than that under investigation in both white and calabretta.here,the allegations were not of physical beatings that could happen at any time of the day.although the conduct by the stepfather was clearly inappropriate,it did not involve violence or penetration and the only time it had taken place was at night when md was in her bedroom.assuming that perry could obtain a warrant the same day as the case review committee recommended that md be removed,it is difficult to understand how the further delay of a few hours necessary to obtain the warrant would have put md in imminent danger of serious physical injury.
whether reasonable cause to believe exigent circumstances existed in a given situation,and the related questions,are all questions of fact to be determined by a jury.wallis spencer,cir citing mckenzie lamb,cir.accordingly,s ummary judgment in favor of the defendants is improper unless,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,it is clear that no reasonable jury could conclude that the plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated.id.under this standard,we found summary judgment to be improper in wallis in part because a material question of fact exists regarding whether there was reasonable cause to believe,on the basis of the information in the possession of the police officer,that the children faced an immediate threat of serious physical injury or death.id.
similarly,there exists a question of material fact here whether a reasonable social worker could have believed that her conduct was lawful because it is unclear on summary judgment whether md faced an immediate threat of serious physical injury.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of perry was erroneous because,viewing the exigency evidence in the light most favorable to mabe,a reasonable jury could conclude that mabe constitutional rights were violated by perry warrantless removal of.see id.
ii.liability of the supervisor for the removal of.
mabe also sued perry supervisor,jeff luther,for the warrantless removal of md from her home.however,no evidence was presented to show a causal connection between any personal conduct by luther and the alleged constitutional violation.the supreme court has concluded that in enacting section congress did not intend to impose liability vicariously on employers or supervisors solely on the basis of the existence of an relationship with a tortfeasor.palmer sanderson,cir quoting monell department of soc.servs.of new york,d.therefore,the conduct of perry can not be imputed to luther.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on this claim.
b.the dependency proceedings.
separate from mabe complaint about the warrantless removal of md from her home,mabe argues generally that the county social workers did not conduct the investigation properly,were allowed to submit false evidence during the juvenile court proceedings,and interfered with her custody rights.the district c
