introduction 
nickolas seeks writ review of juvenile court orders made at the review hearing terminating family reunification services and setting a hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section nickolas contends that the juvenile court erred when it granted petitions for modification,filed pursuant to section,to deny him family reunification services.he maintains that under section,the juvenile court does not have the discretion to modify its previous orders unless the court first determines either that there has been a change of circumstances,or that new evidence justifies the modification,as required under section.nickolas further contends that he did not receive reasonable reunification services as the court initially ordered,and that the court modification of the disposition order substantially impaired his rights.
we conclude that the juvenile court has the statutory authority,pursuant to section to change,modify,or set aside a ny order made by the court in the case of any person subject to its jurisdiction sua sponte after providing the parties with notice and the opportunity to be heard.lefrancois goel cal th,d,lefrancois.the juvenile court authority to modify a previous order that the court independently recognizes as having been erroneously,inadvertently or improvidently made is not contingent on a party seeking a modification pursuant to section.
we further conclude that the juvenile court has inherent authority,pursuant to california constitution,article vi,section,to reconsider its prior interim orders when necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice,provided that in so doing,the court does not violate the constitutional rights of the parties.
although a section petition for modification is the appropriate procedural mechanism to use when a party seeks a modification of a court order based on new evidence or changed circumstances,we are reluctant to endorse a procedure in which the court requests that a party file a petition pursuant to section in order to allow the court to modify an order it considers to have been erroneously,inadvertently or improvidently made.proceeding in this manner is particularly problematic where,as here,the evidence presented at the disposition hearing was sufficient to apprise the juvenile court that section,subdivision b,c or e might apply to preclude a routine order for reunification services.however,we conclude that the court denial of reunification services to nickolas,through the procedural mechanism of a section petition,did not result in a miscarriage of justice.thus,any error was harmless.accordingly,we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
in march,nickolas sons,joshua and matthew together,the children,who were then ages three years,and months,respectively,were detained by the san diego health and human services agency agency after their maternal tested positive for methamphetamine at birth.the agency filed petitions pursuant to section,subdivision b alleging that there was a substantial risk that the children would suffer serious physical harm or illness due to their mother drug use,unsanitary conditions in the home,and her inability to care for the children.the petitions further alleged that nickolas was unable to protect and supervise the children.
in its jurisdiction and disposition report,the agency reported that it had learned from,the children mother,that nickolas was serving a sentence in arizona for abusing the children paternal.that child suffered a broken hip,collarbone and ribs,and other injuries as a result of abuse by nickolas.told the social worker that nickolas had introduced her to methamphetamine use,and that he had physically abused her during their marriage.the agency also reported that nickolas had a criminal record that included charges or convictions for aggravated assault on a minor,possession and use of a dangerous drug,unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under age,oral copulation with a minor under age,and burglary 
the agency contacted nickolas in the arizona state prison system prior to the jurisdiction and disposition hearing.in a letter to the social worker dated april,nickolas stated that he would be incarcerated until may or august and asked the agency to consider placing joshua with his mother 
the agency did not include nicholas expected release date in its report to the court.while the agency did not develop a case plan for nickolas,it did not explicitly recommend that the court deny nickolas reunification services.at the disposition hearing,the court ordered the agency to provide reunification services to the parents consistent with their case plan s and specifically ordered the agency to provide services to father.
in its status review report,the agency stated that it had had no contact whatsoever with nickolas.it had not prepared a case plan for nickolas,nor had it offered him services.in an addendum report prepared for the november review hearing,the agency included a letter from nickolas dated november,in which he stated that he was scheduled to be released in august,and again asked the agency to evaluate his mother for placement of the children.despite the agency report of having had no contact with nickolas,the court found that reasonable services had been offered or provided to the parent s,and continued services as previously ordered 
in april,the case was assigned to a new social worker.the day before the scheduled review hearing,the social worker sent nickolas a prison parenting packet and a letter inquiring about his access to programs and services at the facility in which he was incarcerated.in a letter to the social worker dated april,nickolas provided information about programs that were available at the prison,and expressed his willingness to participate in services.he reiterated his wish to involve his mother in the children care.
the social worker contacted nickolas mother,who was the guardian of his youngest son.she told the social worker that as a result of physical abuse,that child had suffered a skull fracture,had developed hydrocephalus and had been diagnosed with mild mental retardation.
in its april status review report to the court,the agency recommended that the court terminate family reunification services and set a permanency plan hearing under section.had not resolved her substance abuse issues.her cousin planned to adopt the children maternal and was interested in adopting joshua and matthew as well.believed the proposed adoption by a family member was in the children best interests,and she did not intend to contest the agency recommendations.
at the review hearing,nickolas moved for a directed verdict,arguing that the agency had not met its burden to show that it had provided him reasonable reunification services.the court denied the motion.the court reasoned that even under the best circumstances,it would not be possible to return the children to nickolas custody,due to his incarceration.the court also determined that the agency had provided services to nickolas in that it had made efforts to locate nickolas and to advise him of the children status throughout the proceedings.the court found that under the totality of the circumstances,the agency had provided services to nickolas and that the services provided were reasonable.
nickolas,through his counsel,objected to the finding that he had been provided reasonable services.nickolas attorney pointed out that at the disposition hearing,the court had specifically ordered the agency to provide nickolas reunification services,and argued that the agency had a duty to follow the orders of the court.counsel maintained that the evidence established that the agency had not offered or provided reasonable reunification services to nickolas,and pointed out that the court orders requiring the agency to provide services remained in effect because no other party had filed a formal petition pursuant to section to modify the orders granting nickolas reunification services.
although the court believed its judgment as to the substantive issue was correct,it found that nickolas procedural objection had merit.the court continued the proceedings in order to allow the agency time to file a petition for modification.both the agency and subsequently filed petitions pursuant to section requesting that the court modify its disposition orders to deny reunification services to nickolas.in her petition,alleged that there was new evidence in that,at the time of the disposition hearing,the court was not aware of the details of the crime for which nickolas was incarcerated or his release date.she also argued that circumstances had changed because she now agreed to submit to the proposed adoption of the children by her cousin.asserted that providing reunification services to nickolas would be detrimental to the children,and asked the court to deny nickolas reunification services under section,subdivision e the agency alleged in its petition that there was new evidence before the court because the court had not had information at the disposition hearing concerning the exact nature of nickolas crime or the length of his prison sentence in arizona.the agency requested that the court deny reunification services to nickolas pursuant to section,subdivisions b and e.
in may,at a combined hearing on the merits of the modification petitions and the continued review,the agency presented evidence expanding on the minimal information it had presented to the court at the disposition hearing regarding nickolas conviction and incarceration.the evidence established that nickolas had assaulted his then son,fracturing the child ribs,arm and skull.the medical examination revealed that the child had multiple skull fractures that were in various stages of healing.as a result of complications from the most recent injuries,the child had suffered brain swelling that caused mental retardation.the child had to wear a brace to hold his skull together.
nicholas was indicted on three counts of felony child abuse for causing serious physical injury to the child,and one count of felony child abuse for failing to obtain medical treatment for the child injuries.after the suicide of the child mother,who would have been a material witness at nickolas criminal trial,nickolas pled guilty to one felony count of attempted child abuse,pursuant to a plea agreement.he was sentenced in february to five years in prison,with credit for time served,and eight months of community supervision.
after hearing this evidence,the court stated that at the time it ordered the agency to provide reunification services to nickolas,it was not aware of the grievousness of nickolas abuse of his son because the information the agency presented at the disposition hearing was incomplete.the court determined that although the evidence pertaining to nickolas abuse of the children could have been known at the time of the disposition hearing,it was in fact not known.on this basis,the court concluded that the petitioners had met their burden to show that there was new evidence,as required by section,subdivision a.the court also found that the requested modification was in the children best interests.specifically,the court concluded that providing reunification services to nickolas would be detrimental to the children because of their ages,the lack of a bond with nickolas,the anticipated length of his incarceration,and the nature of nickolas crime against his other son.the court modified the disposition order to deny nickolas reunification services under section,subdivision e,terminated family reunification services to,and set a permanency plan hearing pursuant to section.
nickolas petitions for review of the court orders,subd.l cal.rules of court,rule this court issued an order to show cause,and the agency responded.the parties waived oral argument.
appellate proceedings 
on september,this court asked the parties to submit simultaneous letter briefs within days,addressing the following 
assuming arguendo that a section petition was not the proper procedural mechanism by which to modify the court disposition order under the particular circumstances in this case,is there constitutional or other statutory authority that would permit the juvenile court to modify its prior order 
did the juvenile court have the inherent authority to modify its disposition order sua sponte if it believed that order was erroneous,after providing the parties with notice and an opportunity to be heard 
on september,we granted nickolas leave to file a supplemental reply brief.
discussion 
ithe petition for writ of mandate is not moot 
the agency requests that nickolas petition be dismissed as moot.it argues that because the juvenile court did not explicitly order the agency to continue to provide reunification services to nickolas between the and the reviews,the court effectively terminated nickolas reunification services at the review hearing.the agency posits that the court was not required to consider modifying the disposition order at the review hearing pursuant to section because nickolas was not entitled to receive reunification services after the review hearing and that the petition for relief is therefore moot.we reject this argument.
unless the court specifically modifies the terms and conditions of a parent reunification services at the review hearing,any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent,subd.e in re alanna th,d.here,pursuant to the court order at the disposition hearing,the agency had a continuing duty to develop a case plan for nickolas and to offer or provide him reunification services during the second review period.see fn,post.for these reasons,the petition is not moot.
nickolas contends that the court finding that he was provided reasonable reunification services is not supported by substantial evidence.the agency concedes that it did not provide nickolas with reunification services,but argues that the court implicitly withdrew its finding that nickolas was provided reasonable services when it asked the agency to file a petition for modification under section.see in re alanna,supra,th at fn,d.because we conclude that the court modification of its disposition order to deny nickolas reunification services,through the procedural mechanism of section,did not result in a miscarriage of justice see part iii,post,we need not address this issue.
the court did not err in modifying the disposition order to deny nickolas reunification servicesa.the parties positions 
nickolas contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion when it granted the petitions for modification under section,because neither the agency nor the children mother presented any change of circumstance or new evidence as required by section,subdivision a.drawing an analogy to case law interpreting code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,nickolas argues that a petitioner who seeks modification of a previous order must be held to a basic measure of diligence,and can not introduce evidence at the eleventh hour that was available all along,to the unjust detriment of another party.
while the agency concedes an initial lack of diligence,it argues that the information it presented to the court at the hearing for modification of the court disposition orders nevertheless constitutes new evidence within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and also maintains that the proposed modification was in the children best interests.the agency thus contends that the court correctly modified the disposition orders.
the agency further argues that the juvenile court has the statutory authority,pursuant to section,to change,modify,or set aside any previous order,sua sponte.citing case lazben financial th,d case lazben,the agency also contends that in extraordinary circumstances,when necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice,the california constitution confers on the juvenile court the inherent authority to repair an erroneous order or judgment,provided that in so doing,the court weighs and protects the constitutional rights of the parties.
nickolas responds that the juvenile court may exercise the authority it is granted under article vi,section of the california constitution only in the absence of any previously established procedural rule,citing in re amber th,d.he argues that,by its express terms,section limits the juvenile court authority to modify its prior orders to the procedural mechanism of a petition for modification filed pursuant to section,and notes that code of civil procedure section,subdivision a authorizes the juvenile court to correct only clerical errors on its own motion,as discussed in bloniarz roloson cal d.citing hess gross d,and smith superior court d,nickolas argues that the juvenile court did not have authority to modify the disposition order because the modification did not constitute the correction of a clerical error,and seriously prejudiced his constitutional interests in family reunification.
we examine these arguments,bearing in mind that t he objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent,stable homes if those children can not be returned home within a prescribed period of time.citations.in re marilyn cal th,d,marilyn 
under the circumstances presented in this case,section was not the appropriate procedural mechanism by which to modify the disposition order 
section applies when any parent or other person having an interest in a dependent child,or the child,collectively,party seeks a modification of a previous order based on a change of circumstances or new evidence and the pertinent statutes do not otherwise provide for modification.see in re lance th,d sheila superior court th,d.it is the appropriate procedural mechanism to use when a party seeks modification of a previous order.see marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.however,under the circumstances presented in this case,a section petition was not the appropriate means by which to modify the disposition order.
at the review hearing,the juvenile court realized that even the minimal evidence pertaining to nickolas conviction for child abuse and his incarceration that was presented at the disposition hearing should have caused the court to examine the facts underlying the conviction,and determine whether providing reunification services to nickolas would be detrimental to the children pursuant to section,subdivision e.we agree with the trial court assessment that it improvidently directed the agency to provide reunification services to nickolas at the disposition hearing.
the information in the jurisdiction and disposition report concerning nickolas criminal history and incarceration should also have put the court on notice that section,subdivision b might apply to nickolas,and that the court should not issue a routine order that the agency provide nickolas reunification services.rather,at a minimum,the court should have considered whether reunification was in the children best interests pursuant to section,subdivision c.
section,subdivision c states in pertinent part the court shall not order reunification for a parent or guardian described in paragraph,or of subdivision b unless the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interest of the child.emphasis added.when this subdivision applies,the juvenile court lacks the authority to order reunification unless it expressly makes such a finding by the requisite standard of proof.ibid.
section,subdivision b provides that reunification services need not be provided to a parent who has been convicted of a violent felony,as defined in penal code section.the definition of a violent felony includes rape,oral copulation by force,lewd acts on a child under the age of years,and any felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice,subd.c.great bodily injury means a significant or substantial physical injury,subd.f.
the jurisdiction and disposition report included information that nickolas had inflicted significant physical injury on the children paternal,including a broken hip,a broken collar bone and rib,and other fractures,and that nickolas was currently incarcerated for that crime.other information in the report suggested that nickolas might have been convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under age and oral copulation with a minor under age 
when information presented at the disposition hearing suggests that the court does not have the authority to order reunification pursuant to section,subdivision c unless the court makes an express finding by clear and convincing evidence that reunification is in the child best interests,the juvenile court must not order reunification services without making the required finding.this is particularly true where,as in this case,the lack of a case plan indicates that the agency has not yet completed its investigation and assessment.
the agency has a duty to apprise the court of all relevant facts and circumstances when issuing reports.in re joshua th,d citing in re john th,d.at each stage of the dependency proceeding,the social services agency is statutorily mandated to prepare social study reports and make recommendations to assist the court,subd.b,subd.b,subd.c,subds.c,e,f,subd.a,subd.b.in this role,the social services agency acts as an impartial arm of the court in assisting the court to carry out the juvenile court law.in re ashley th,d citing in re malinda cal d,fn,and seiser kumli,cal.juvenile courts practice and procedure,see also,subd.a.
the record in this case leaves no doubt that the evidence that was presented to the court at the section hearing was available prior to the disposition hearing.nickolas crime,conviction and sentencing all preceded the children detention.at the time of the disposition hearing,the agency had in its possession information about nickolas conviction and his term of imprisonment,but failed to fully report that information to the court.the agency did not request that the court determine whether providing services to nickolas would be detrimental to the children under section,subdivision e,or whether section,subdivision c applied to prohibit the court from entering a routine order for reunification services for nickolas.
the juvenile court has an obligation to ensure that the agency,as an arm of the court,has followed required statutory procedures,which are designed to provide the court with the information and material it needs in order to make a reasoned and informed judgment,subd.a.in this case,the court belatedly,but independently,realized that the evidence presented at the disposition hearing,although minimal,was sufficient to apprise the court that it should not have issued a routine order for reunification services pursuant to section,subdivision e.in order to remedy this error,the court requested that the parties seek a modification pursuant to section on the ground that there was new evidence pertinent to the issue.at the hearing on the section petitions,the agency presented facts that it had not previously presented to the court,such as the age of the child nickolas assaulted,the full extent of the injuries the child suffered as a result of the assault,and the particulars of the criminal charges against nickolas,his plea bargain,and his expected release date 
where,as here,the court independently recognizes that it improvidently directed the agency to provide reunification services to a parent,requiring that a party file a petition under section before the court may modify the order,or worse,requiring that the parties comply with the erroneous order,would constitute a waste of time and resources.case lazben,supra,th at,d forcing the parties to proceed where there is recognized error in the case would result in an enormous waste of the court and the parties resources.we conclude that in dependency proceedings,when the court recognizes that a previous order was erroneously,inadvertently or improvidently granted,it is not necessary that a party file a section petition in order to provide the court with the authority to modify that order.
c.the juvenile court has both statutory and constitutional authority to modify its prior orders sua sponte 
all courts have inherent powers that enable them to carry out their duties and ensure the orderly administration of justice.the inherent powers of courts are derived from california constitution,article vi,section,and are not dependent on statute.le francois,supra,cal th at,d,walker superior court cal d,case lazben,supra,th at,d in re amber,supra,th at,d.the juvenile court derives its general judicial authority from the california constitution.in re amber,supra,at,d.
while article vi,section of the california constitution vests the court with inherent authority to decide controversies and control the proceedings,the legislature may regulate the exercise of the court constitutional powers by all reasonable means.lefrancois,supra,cal th at,d,superior court county of mendocino cal th,d.however,in exercising its power,the legislature may not defeat or materially impair the court exercise of its inherent constitutional authority to reconsider its own interim orders.lefrancois,supra,at,d,people bunn cal th,d.such regulation violates the separation of powers doctrine embodied in the california constitution.lefrancois,supra,at,d.
the juvenile court jurisdiction is limited to hearing cases concerning delinquent and dependent children.the legislature has vested the juvenile court with the authority to fashion orders concerning the welfare of a dependent or a delinquent child,see,subd.a.within its limited jurisdiction,the authority of the juvenile court is extensive in addition to all other powers granted by law,the juvenile court may direct all such orders to the parent,parents,or guardian of a minor who is subject to any proceedings under this chapter as the court deems necessary and proper for the best interests of or for the rehabilitation of the minor.recognizing the juvenile court special role in dependency proceedings,the california supreme court has noted,the juvenile court has a special responsibility to the child as parens patriae and must look to the totality of a child circumstances when making decisions regarding the child.in re chantal cal th,d.
this general grant of authority is tempered by more specific statutes.a statutory mechanism is the preferred means by which to modify a prior order of the court.see in re dennis th,d.the legislature has defined the juvenile court statutory authority to modify its previous orders in welfare and institutions code,article,sections through.see marilyn,supra,cal th at,d,briefly describing through.
section provides that any court order in a dependency case may at any time be changed,modified,or set aside,as the judge deems meet and proper,subject to such procedural requirements as are imposed by this article.section mandates that the court refrain from exercising its discretion under section unless the court has provided prior notice of the application to the social worker and the child counsel of record or,if there is no counsel of record,to the child and his parent or guardian as discussed in part,ante,section provides that a party may seek a modification of a previous order by filing a verified petition based on new evidence or changed circumstances.
nickolas maintains that section does not grant the juvenile court the authority to modify a previous order sua sponte.he argues that the phrase subject to such procedural requirements as are imposed by this article means that the court may not modify a prior order unless a party or interested person has filed a petition for modification pursuant to section.in support of this interpretation,he points to marilyn,in which the california supreme court stated,section clearly does not give the juvenile court the discretion to modify its previous order in the absence of compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in article,which includes section requirement of filing a verified petition for modification based on changed circumstances.marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.
the california supreme court holding in marilyn was more nuanced than nickolas posits.the phrase subject to such procedural requirements as are imposed by this article does not mean that the procedures set forth in section are necessarily imposed on the court every time the court contemplates modifying a prior order.further,to the extent the holding in marilyn can be interpreted to preclude the juvenile court from modifying a prior order sua sponte,the validity of that reasoning has been disapproved by the more recent decision of the california supreme court in lefrancois,supra,cal th,d.
in marilyn,the parent asserted that even though section expressly limits the actions the court may take at that hearing to select and implement the child permanency plan,section gives the juvenile court the inherent discretion to modify the prior order referring the case to a permanency plan hearing,and to consider returning the child to parental custody.marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.the california supreme court held that pursuant to the statutory framework of welfare and institutions code,article,when a parent asks the court to modify a previous order based on changed circumstances,the parent must proceed under section.marilyn,at,d.thus,the holding of marilyn applies to a request by a parent that the court modify a prior order,and does not apply when the court determines on its own that modification of a prior order is required.
the difference between nickolas argument and the california supreme court holding in marilyn becomes evident when both are reduced to syllogisms.nickolas argues 
section requires that the court follow such procedures as are imposed by welfare and institutions code,article.
section describes a procedural requirement that is imposed by welfare and institutions code,article.
therefore,the court must follow the procedure set forth in section 
however,the marilyn court reasoned 
section requires that the court follow such procedures as are imposed by welfare and institutions code,article.
section describes a procedural requirement that is imposed by welfare and institutions code,article when a party seeks a modification of a prior order based on new evidence or changed circumstance.
therefore,the court must follow the procedure set forth in section when a party seeks a modification of a prior order based on new evidence or changed circumstance.marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.
when the juvenile court contemplates modifying a previous order,either pursuant to a request by a party or on the court own motion,section does not impose any particular procedural requirement described in welfare and institutions code,article.rather,as indicated by the phrase subject to such procedural requirements as are imposed by this article,the type of procedural mechanism required by section depends on the type of modification sought,italics added.the use of the word such means that the procedural requirement is definite but not specified.random house dict.ed,see also black law dict.ed,of this or that kind.by its terms,section applies only when a party petitions the court for modification based on new evidence or changed circumstances.nothing in marilyn or in the plain language of section indicates that the legislature intended to limit the juvenile court authority to reconsider its previous orders to circumstances in which a party has filed a petition pursuant to section.
this conclusion is consistent with the california supreme court reasoning in lefrancois.in that case,the court rejected the argument that code of civil procedure section,subdivision f,which governs motions for summary judgment,and code of civil procedure section,which generally governs procedures for reconsideration of any previous interim orders,prohibit the court from reconsidering its previous interim orders on its own motion the lefrancois court held that statutes that deal with reconsideration of motions may constitutionally limit the ability of the parties to file repetitive motions,but may not impede the trial court ability to reconsider its prior interim orders on its own motion so that it may correct its own errors.lefrancois,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned that if the statutes at issue were interpreted to limit the trial court authority,the statutes would directly and materially impair and defeat the court most basic functions,exercising its discretion to rule upon controversies between the parties and ensuring the orderly administration of justice,and would thus violate the separation of powers doctrine embodied in the california constitution.lefrancois,supra,at,d,quoting case lazben,supra,th at,d miscarriage of justice results where a court is unable to correct its own perceived legal errors.
the california supreme court rationale in lefrancois applies with equal force to nickolas argument that section limits the court ability to reconsider its prior rulings sua sponte.code of civil procedure section and welfare and institutions code section are similar in that each governs procedures for reconsideration of previous interim orders.interpreted as nickolas suggests,section would significantly diminish the juvenile court general authority to ensure the orderly administration of justice,and would undermine the court statutory authority to direct such orders as the court deems necessary and proper for the best interests of the dependent child.a legislative restriction of a juvenile court ability to reconsider its own rulings sua sponte would impair and defeat the juvenile court most basic functions to meet its special responsibility to determine the best interests of the dependent child,to exercise its discretion to rule upon controversies among the parties,and to ensure the orderly administration of justice.lefrancois,supra,cal th at,d.
under nickolas reading,if a juvenile court realizes that it has misapplied the law,or that the court processes have otherwise been deficient the court is prohibited from revisiting its ruling no matter how obvious its error or how draconian the effects of its misstep.lefrancois,supra,cal th at,d,quoting case lazben,supra,th at,d.if section were interpreted to limit the court ability to reconsider its own ruling,it would violate the separation of powers doctrine embodied in the california constitution lefrancois,supra,at,d,and would leave the juvenile court without any statutory authority by which to correct its own errors on its own motion.
in an effort to avoid constitutional difficulties,nickolas posits that the juvenile court has the statutory authority to correct its previous orders,on its own motion,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,but contends that this authority is limited to the correction of clerical errors.the argument that code of civil procedure section,subdivision a applies to modifications of prior orders in juvenile court is without merit.
this court has previously held that code of civil procedure section,subdivision a is inapplicable in dependency proceedings at the trial court level.in re joshua,supra,th at,d.dependency proceedings are special proceedings that are governed,in general,by their own rules and statutes.et rule et in re chantal,supra,cal th,d.unless made expressly applicable,statutes that govern civil cases do not apply to dependency actions.in re joshua,supra,at,d in re daniel th,d.further,nickolas ignores rule f,which provides that,pursuant to section,the juvenile court may correct clerical errors in judgments,orders,or other parts of the record on the court own motion,and that such corrections may be entered nunc pro tunc 
we conclude that the juvenile court has the authority pursuant to section to change,modify or set aside its prior orders sua sponte.see in re cal th,d,section allows any parent to petition the juvenile court and section allows the court on its own motion to change,modify,or set aside any order previously made by the court italics added in re hirenia th,d section gives the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to modify its dependency orders sua sponte.under this section,the juvenile court may modify an order that contains a clerical error,but may also reconsider the substance of a previous order the court considers to have been erroneously,inadvertently or improvidently granted.rule f see in re jamika th,d juvenile court had authority to correct its own erroneous ruling.in circumstances such as are presented in this case,section is the procedural mechanism by which the juvenile court may modify a previous order,sua sponte,in dependency proceedings.
d.the juvenile court also has inherent authority under the california constitution to modify its prior orders under extraordinary circumstances 
the constitution vests each branch of the government with certain core or essential functions that may not be usurped by another branch.lefrancois,supra,cal th at,d,people bunn,supra,cal th at,d.the core function of the court is to decide controversies between the parties and to ensure the orderly administration of justice.case lazben,supra,th at,d.this power is not confined by or dependent on statute id.at,d quoting walker superior court cal d.t he court,by virtue of its status as one of the three constitutionally designated branches of government,has the power to act even in the absence of explicit constitutional or legislative authorization.superior court county of mendocino,supra,cal th at,d,see also people ex rel.morgan hayne cal.
while nickolas concedes that the juvenile court might have the constitutional authority to modify a previous order when necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice,he asserts that the court may not use such constitutional authority to correct an error of judgment.specifically,nickolas argues that the court may not invoke this authority when,as here,such modification affects his constitutional interest in maintaining his parental rights and continuing his relationships with his children.nickolas contends that the inherent power of the court to adopt an innovative rule or procedure applies only where the legislature has not provided a statutory means by which the court may act,and that before improvising a procedure in juvenile dependency proceedings,the court must consider the primary objective of the proceeding,which is the promotion of the best interests of the child,but it must also weigh and protect the constitutional rights of the parents which necessarily are implicated.in re amber,supra,th at,d.
in in re dakota,supra,th at page,d,this court described the constitutional rights and interests that are at stake in a dependency proceeding 
a parent interest in the companionship,care,custody and management of his or her children is a fundamental civil right.in re cal d.children,too,have a compelling independent interest in belonging to their natural family.adoption of kay d.in addition,each child has a compelling interest to live free from abuse and neglect in a stable,permanent placement with an emotionally committed caregiver.in re david d.the government interest in a child welfare is significant.the welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right,but a duty,to protect.in re marilyn cal th,d,citing in re david,supra,d at,and stanley illinois,d.
assuming arguendo that there is no applicable statutory mechanism by which the court could properly have modified the disposition order,in this case,the court nevertheless had inherent authority to make such a modification to avoid a miscarriage of justice.the modification of the disposition order in this case meets the stringent constitutional standards that a court must meet when it exercises its inherent authority under the california constitution.
before modifying the disposition order,the juvenile court provided nickolas with notice and an opportunity to be heard,including the right to present evidence and to confront witnesses regarding the provision of reunification services that might facilitate his ability to maintain his fundamental interest in his relationships with his children.the court weighed the children best interests,and in particular,their interest in a stable,permanent home,against nickolas fundamental interest in parenting his children.in doing so,the court considered nickolas past actions as a parent,the nature of his existing relationships with the children,and the likelihood that reunification services would result in family reunification within the statutory limitations on the length of time children may remain in temporary placement,subd.g.further,nickolas remained free to participate in services offered at the facility in whi
