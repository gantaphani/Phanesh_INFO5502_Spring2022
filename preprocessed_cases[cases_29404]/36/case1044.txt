appellant adrian executed a voluntary declaration of paternity upon the birth of and lived with and his mother,kristi mother,for the first year of life.when was months old,adrian and mother left without warning on a trip to mexico,abandoning with friends.as a result,the solano county health and social services department agency detained and filed a petition under section of the welfare and institutions code.
within two weeks after was abandoned,before adrian and mother had returned from mexico,christopher appeared at a hearing and told the juvenile court that he suspected he was biological father.after the results of a paternity test confirmed these suspicions,the court adjudged christopher to be legal father.
because adrian had been jailed immediately upon his return from mexico on the basis of mother allegations of kidnapping,adrian claim to presumed paternity arising from the voluntary declaration was not brought to the court attention until substantially later in the proceedings.after being informed of adrian claim,the juvenile court set aside its voluntary declaration of paternity,reaffirmed christopher status as presumed and legal father,and granted custody of to christopher.we affirm.
background 
in june,when was just over a year old,the agency filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b alleging that mother was unable adequately to supervise and protect 
at the time of birth in may,mother was unwed but involved with adrian.mother and adrian executed a voluntary declaration of paternity,and adrian was identified as father on the birth certificate.for the next year,adrian acted as father,living with and financially supporting mother and 
prior to birth,christopher suspected he might be the baby father,but mother repeatedly told him he was not when christopher tried to do something about his status as father,adrian visited christopher place of work and warned him to stay away from mother.following birth,adrian continued to harass christopher,visiting his home and threatening him.christopher eventually moved to texas,primarily to get away from adrian.while living in texas,christopher married.
adrian had a history of violent and obsessive behavior.he was the subject of a domestic violence restraining order and criminal charges associated with stalking an in.in december,when was seven months old,adrian disappeared with mother and after an argument,causing mother family to file a missing person report.the three were found a week later living at a hotel.on june,after first birthday,mother filed a police report claiming that adrian had hit her and attempted to take.after mother escaped to her father home later that day,adrian went to the home and,while confronting mother father at knifepoint,ran off with.the next day,mother sought an emergency restraining order against adrian.the same day,the police located adrian and returned to mother.
four days later,on june,while two friends were visiting mother at her home,adrian arrived and persuaded mother to leave with him.was left with mother friends.after mother stopped answering her cell phone under ominous circumstances,the police were called.it was not until six days later,june,that mother was located in mexico.in the meantime,mother friends had taken to mother father home,and the agency was notified of the situation.when mother returned home,many days later,she claimed that adrian had forced her to go to mexico,and he was taken into custody in southern california.
the juvenile court held a detention hearing on june,in the absence of mother and adrian,who presumably were still in mexico.the court appointed counsel for each of them,ordered that adrian be denied contact with and that mother have only supervised visits,and scheduled a further hearing for july.the court expressly reserved the issue of paternity,and no mention was made of adrian execution of a voluntary declaration of paternity 
christopher attended the july hearing,but mother and adrian did not.their appointed counsel had been unable to get in touch with them and speculated that they were still in mexico.christopher informed the court that mother had called him in texas a few weeks prior,apparently when she was being threatened by adrian in june,and acknowledged for the first time that he was biological father.christopher had returned to california in response to this call.since arriving,christopher had contacted mother father and begun visiting christopher asked the court to order a paternity test.the court granted the request and appointed counsel for christopher.
mother and christopher attended the next hearing,held five weeks later.adrian attorney,only recently having learned that adrian might be in custody,asked to be relieved of his representation until and unless adrian expressed an interest in the proceedings.neither mother nor any of the attorneys involved brought adrian declaration of paternity to the court attention,and counsel request was granted.
at the next hearing,held on august,in the absence of adrian and his relieved counsel,the court learned that the genetic test had confirmed christopher paternity.the court,without objection,declared christopher a presumed father,and a judgment declaring christopher to be legal father was entered soon after.a contested jurisdictional hearing was held on september.at the hearing,counsel revealed that adrian was in custody on the charge of kidnapping mother.in adrian absence,the juvenile court sustained the allegations of the petition and found to be a child described by welfare and institutions code section.
the dispositional hearing,postponed several times,was commenced on november.the dispositional report prepared by the agency disclosed that adrian was listed as father on his birth certificate.at the hearing,the juvenile court recognized that adrian designation on the birth certificate could only have occurred if he had executed a voluntary declaration of paternity.the court informed counsel that adrian execution of the declaration made him a presumed father,thereby leaving with two presumed fathers,and the hearing was continued until proper notice had been given to adrian.it was eventually learned that adrian was in federal custody in sacramento.two orders were issued to secure his attendance at the proceedings,but efforts to secure his presence ceased when the federal authorities holding adrian refused to comply with the orders.
in late january,christopher counsel filed a request to set aside adrian voluntary declaration of paternity in favor of christopher claim.adrian counsel,who had been,filed a declaration opposing the request,arguing that adrian had acted as father from the time of his birth and had bonded with.at a hearing on february,the juvenile court granted christopher request and designated christopher presumed father.as explanation,the court written order stated only that christopher made greater efforts.
at the next hearing,the juvenile court awarded custody to christopher pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,which requires placement of a section child with a noncustodial,parent if no detriment would result from the placement.a final judgment was entered awarding to christopher legal and physical custody of 
ii.discussion 
adrian argues,for a variety of reasons,that the juvenile court erred in its conduct of the proceedings,in setting aside his declaration of paternity,and in awarding custody to christopher.adrian also argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.
the uniform parentage act,et act provides the statutory framework by which california courts make paternity determinations.dawn superior court cal th,d,subd.b.under this statutory scheme,california law distinguishes alleged,biological,and presumed fathers.francisco superior court th,d.a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status,is an alleged father.citation.in re zacharia cal th,fn,d.a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status.ibid.
presumed fathers are accorded far greater parental rights than alleged or biological fathers.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.presumed father status is governed by section,which sets out several rebuttable presumptions under which a man may qualify for this status,generally by marrying or attempting to marry the child mother or by publicly acknowledging paternity and receiving the child into his home.in re jerry th,d,subds.b d.biological fatherhood does not,in and of itself,qualify a man for presumed father status under section.on the contrary,presumed father status is based on the familial relationship between the man and child,rather than any biological connection.in re th,d.
section also recognizes two other grounds for qualification as a presumed father that are outside of the act.these are an executed voluntary declaration of paternity et and the conclusive presumption of paternity dawn superior court,supra,cal th at,d,which dictates the finding that a mother husband is her child father,provided the mother and her husband were married and cohabiting when the child was conceived.in addition,as discussed in more detail post,an unmarried biological father may,under narrow circumstances,assert constitutional paternity rights,even though he does not qualify under any of the presumptions listed in section.adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey gabriel suedi th,d.
occasionally the complicated pattern of human relations gives rise to more than one legitimate claimant to presumed father status,and the juvenile court must resolve the competing claims.as the supreme court explained in in re jesusa cal th,d,jesusa,a lthough more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity,there can be only one presumed father.citations.the procedure for reconciling competing presumptions is stated in section,which provides a a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.b if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.see jesusa,at,d.
jurisdiction to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity 
adrian first contends that the juvenile court was without jurisdiction to set aside his voluntary declaration of paternity because christopher lacked standing to challenge it.
the purpose of a voluntary declaration of paternity is to permit unwed parents to acknowledge the man biological paternity of their child.after a birth by an unmarried mother,section requires the hospital to inquire about the execution of a voluntary declaration of paternity by the mother and the man identified by the natural mother as the natural father,subd.a.the text of the voluntary declaration requires the mother to swear that the man who has signed the voluntary declaration of paternity is the only possible father of her child,subd.b.once executed,a voluntary declaration of paternity establish es the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
recognizing the possibility of second thoughts and error,the act permits a voluntary declaration of paternity to be rescinded by either parent within the first two months.it also requires the court to set aside a voluntary declaration upon conclusive proof that the man signing the declaration was not,in fact,the biological father of the child,unless the court finds that setting aside the declaration would not be in the child best interests,subd.b,gabriel suedi,supra,th at,d.a motion to set aside a voluntary declaration may be filed only within the first two years after the child birth by a local child support agency,the mother,the man who signed the voluntary declaration as the child father,or in an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship pursuant to section or in any action to establish an order for child custody,visitation,or child support based upon the voluntary declaration of paternity,subd.b.
adrian contends that the juvenile court erred in permitting christopher to move to set aside his voluntary declaration of paternity because subdivision b a of section restricts the right to contest such a declaration to the three parties expressly mentioned in the statute a local child support agency,the mother,the man who signed the voluntary declaration as the child father.in support,he cites in re christopher th,d christopher,in which the court refused to grant a claimed biological father request for genetic testing to challenge a voluntary declaration of paternity in a proceeding under welfare and institutions code section.the court held,without explanation or analysis,that with limited exceptions not applicable here,a motion for testing may be brought only by a child support agency,the child mother,or the man who signed the voluntary declaration,subd.b.christopher,at,d.
to the extent it implies that christopher would lack standing to challenge adrian voluntary declaration in this proceeding,we respectfully disagree with christopher interpretation of section subdivision b a states that a motion for testing may be filed by a local child support agency,the mother,the man who signed the voluntary declaration as the child father,or in an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship pursuant to section or in any action to establish an order for child custody,visitation,or child support based upon the voluntary declaration of paternity.italics added.the listing of the two types of proceedings in addition to the three specific parties,all connected by or,indicates that a voluntary declaration may be challenged by the three specific parties or during the listed proceedings.the plain meaning of this language is that a motion to set aside can be filed by one of the three listed parties,or by a participant in a section paternity action,or by a participant in any action to establish an order for child custody,visitation,or child support based upon the voluntary declaration of paternity.the language places no constraint on the nature of the challenging party when the request for testing is made in the context of the listed proceedings.
we find support for this reading in the structure of section,governing paternity actions.section permits a paternity action to be brought by a child,the child natural mother,a man presumed to be the child father,an adoption agency to whom the child has been relinquished,or a prospective adoptive parent of the child,subd.a.if the language of section,subdivision b were to be interpreted as adrian claims,the only parties who would be entitled to challenge a declaration of paternity in a section paternity action would be a local child support agency,the mother,and the man who signed the voluntary declaration as the child father,despite the express authorization in section for other parties to file a paternity action.in other words,while a child,a man presumed to be the child father,an adoption agency to whom the child has been relinquished and a prospective adoptive parent of the child would be entitled to file a paternity action,adrian reading of section would bar them from challenging a declaration of paternity asserted in that action.adrian suggests no policy reason for granting these parties the right to file a paternity action,on the one hand,and drastically limiting the scope of issues they can raise in that action,on the other.on the contrary,the use of the first or in section,subdivision b a was presumably intended to indicate that the initial listing of three parties did not restrict the type of parties who may file a motion to set aside in a section action.
similarly,the second or in section,subdivision b a indicates that a participant in any action to establish an order for child custody,visitation,or child support based upon the voluntary declaration of paternity may also move to set aside a declaration of paternity.this interpretation
