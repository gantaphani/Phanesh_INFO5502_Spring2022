arthur bruno smelt and christopher david hammer,two men who wish to marry each other,appeal the district court orders which a abstained as to their claim that three sections of the california law relating to marriage are unconstitutional and b ruled adversely to them on their claims that two sections of the federal defense of marriage act doma are likewise unconstitutional.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for dismissal of both doma claims.
background 
it is agreed smelt and hammer are both males who wish to obtain a california marriage license and to marry each other in that state.they applied to the county clerk of orange county,california,for issuance of a marriage license on two occasions.they were denied a license both times because they are of the same gender.were it not for that,they meet the qualifications for issuance of a marriage license.they applied for and received a declaration of domestic partnership from the state of california dated january.
smelt and hammer then brought this action against the county of orange and the orange county clerk collectively the county and the state registrar of vital statistics,california department of health services the state the amended complaint alleged that to the extent that california family code sections and preclude them from obtaining a marriage license,those sections violate equal protection due process the right to life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness the right to be free from an undue invasion of the right to privacy the ninth amendment right of reservation of all rights not enumerated to the people,and the right to travel,and the right of free speech.the complaint also asserted that section violates the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution 
additionally,the complaint raised federal constitutional challenges to doma.specifically,it alleged that section of doma violates the united states constitution due process cause fifth amendment,equal protection rights fifth amendment,the right to privacy,and the full faith and credit clause.finally,it alleged that section of doma violates the liberty interests protected by the due process clause discriminates on the basis of gender and sexual orientation in violation of equal protection and violates the privacy interests protected by the right to privacy.
to rectify this myriad of alleged constitutional violations,smelt and hammer sought a declaratory judgment that the relevant sections of the california family code and doma are unconstitutional.they also sought injunctive relief m andating the use of terms and issuing a marriage license to them.
the state defendants then filed an abstention motion based on pending litigation in the california state courts on the issue of whether the california family code sections that limit marriage to couples consisting of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman comply with the provisions of the california constitution the marriage cases equality california,which is involved in the marriage cases,filed an amicus brief in support of abstention.the district court took the motion to abstain under submission.in addition,cross motions for summary judgment were filed by smelt and hammer,the county,the united states,prop fund,and ccf.
the district court ultimately issued a published order abstaining pursuant to railroad commission of texas pullman,from deciding the constitutionality of the challenged sections of the california family code until the marriage cases had been concluded deciding that smelt and hammer have no standing to challenge section of doma and finding that smelt and hammer have standing to challenge section of doma,but that the section does not violate the united states constitution.see smelt i,d at.
needless to say,smelt and hammer disagreed this appeal followed.

discussion 
i.the california family code sections abstention 
as already noted,the district court abstained on smelt and hammer attacks on the california family code sections.see smelt i,d at.it did so pursuant to the pullman abstention doctrine.the source of the doctrine is found,not surprisingly,in a case involving pullman sleeping cars,where the federal courts were asked to restrain an order of the texas railroad commission regarding the use of attendants in railroad sleeping cars.pullman,at.at.a court one circuit judge and two district judges issued an injunction,and an appeal to the supreme court followed.id.at.at.the court noted that the supreme court of texas would have the last word on whether the commission had even acted within the scope of authority given to it by the laws of texas.id.at.at.it saw nothing to preclude an action which could be brought with reasonable promptness,in the state court.id.at.at.thus,the supreme court determined that the federal courts should retain the action,but abstain while that state court process went forward because the case touched a sensitive area of social policy the state decision could obviate the need for federal constitutional adjudication and any federal construction of the state law might,at any time,be upended by a decision of the state courts that,over time,has been distilled into the factors that go into a determination of whether the pullman abstention doctrine can be utilized.those factors are usually rendered as follows 
the complaint touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open.
such constitutional adjudication plainly can be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy.
the possibly determinative issue of state law is doubtful.
dev.city of redlands,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also porter,at.and it is not even necessary that the state adjudication obviate the need to decide all the federal constitutional questions as long as it will reduce the contours of the litigation,at.finally,the issue here is not one of jurisdiction it is ultimately a question of the exercise of discretion.see columbia basin apartment ass city of pasco,cir ripplinger,at.we turn,then,to the situation presented by smelt and hammer claims in this case.
we must first consider whether the complaint touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which we should not enter unless we have no real alternative.it does,for it can not be gainsaid that in our social and legal traditions the institution of marriage has been considered to be an integral part of the foundation of a and viable society,the sinew that strengthens society,the glue that holds society together.in an unbroken line of cases,the supreme court has recognized that.
for example,in reynolds united states,the supreme court noted that 
marriage,while from its very nature a sacred obligation,is nevertheless,in most civilized nations,a civil contract,and usually regulated by law.upon it society may be said to be built,and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations and duties,with which government is necessarily required to deal.
id.at.ten years later,the court further explicated that view when it said 
marriage is something more than a mere contract.the consent of the parties is of course essential to its existence,but when the contract to marry is executed by the marriage,a relation between the parties is created which they can not change.other contracts may be modified,restricted,or enlarged,or entirely released upon the consent of the parties.not so with marriage.the relation once formed,the law steps in and holds the parties to various obligations and liabilities.it is an institution,in the maintenance of which in its purity the public is deeply interested,for it is the foundation of the family and of society,without which there would be neither civilization nor progress.
maynard hill.more recently,the court has noted that marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man,fundamental to our very existence and survival.loving virginia,d.and still more recently,the court reiterated that marriage is fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.zablocki redhail,d.
because of its vital importance to society,while the people through their governments have always encouraged marriage,they have always regulated it.generally that has been at the state level.as the court noted as long ago as,t he state has absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens shall be created,and the causes for which it may be dissolved.pennoyer neff,overruled on other grounds by shaffer heitner,d.then,in,the court had this to say 
marriage,as creating the most important relation in life,as having more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution,has always been subject to the control of the legislature.that body prescribes the age at which parties may contract to marry,the procedure or form essential to constitute marriage,the duties and obligations it creates,its effects upon the property rights of both,present and prospective,and the acts which may constitute grounds for its dissolution.
maynard,at.at.again,the state court is no doubt correct in asserting that marriage is a social relation subject to the state police power.loving,at.at.similarly,where the territories were concerned,the court held that congress may impose limitations on marriage.see reynolds,at.
california has exercised that undoubted police power,and in so doing has expressed its concerns and beliefs about this sensitive area.thus,as this case shows us,the people of the state of california have defined what marriage is,viz.a consensual,contractual personal relationship between a man and a woman,which is solemnized.cal.see also cal,by the same token,california has regulated and limited the institution in a number of ways.for example those under can not marry without somebody else consent to marry,you must be unmarried in other words,no polygamy or polyandry marriages within certain degrees of consanguinity are forbidden 
but as important as the institution of marriage is,our purpose here is not to write a paean to its past and contemporary glories it is the more mundane purpose of pointing to the fact that it is difficult to imagine an area more fraught with sensitive social policy considerations in which federal courts should not involve themselves if there is an alternative in short,the first pullman factor is easily met,and we now turn to the second one.
when we do so,we think it is equally apparent that the resolution of the marriage cases in the california courts may not only narrow,but even eliminate,any need for federal constitutional adjudication regarding smelt and hammer attacks on the california statutory provisions in this case.if the california courts ultimately determine that the sections in question violate the california constitution,we will have no need to consider the federal constitutional claims regarding those sections.that brings us to the third pullman factor.
again,the third factor is easily satisfied in the context of this case.we simply can not predict with any confidence how the california supreme court would decide the state constitutional questions.pearl inv.city county of,cir see also fireman fund,at.especially is that true where,as here,the california supreme court will be faced with a constitutional issue that presents difficult questions of state constitutional law,which it has not yet passed upon added to that is the fact that a california superior court has found the state statutes to be unconstitutional,and review of that decision is now pending in a california court of appeal in the marriage cases.
therefore,all factors in the pullman analysis point toward abstention.nor have we any reason to assume that the california supreme court will construe the california constitution in the same way as the federal courts construe the united states constitution that makes this a particularly good case for pullman abstention.see columbia basin,at.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it abstained.
ii.doma standing 
as we earlier noted,smelt and hammer have attacked both of the operative sections of doma however,no state has determined that they are married for state purposes,and they do not suggest that they have applied for and been denied some federal benefit.thus,we are necessarily faced with the issue of standing.we would be,even if neither the district court nor the parties had addressed that issue.see arakaki,at wmx,miller,cir en banc.that,of course,is because our jurisdiction is limited to cases and controversies.see const.art.iii,cl.
as the supreme court has pointed out the standing requirement is born partly of an idea,which is more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and explicit theory,about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected,unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d internal quotation marks omitted.
over the years,the supreme court has established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.those are 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at.at citations omitted see also cetacean cmty.bush,cir.the burden of showing that there is standing rests on the shoulders of the party asserting it.defenders of wildlife,at.at.
but there is still more to standing requirements because,beyond constitutional standing,there are prudential standing principles to which the federal judiciary has also adhered.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.as the supreme court has put it 
t his court has held that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.in addition,even when the plaintiff has alleged redressable injury sufficient to meet the requirements of art.iii,the court has refrained from adjudicating abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances,pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.finally,the court has required that the plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.
id.at.at citations omitted see also elk grove,at.at.
with those principles in hand,we can approach smelt and hammer attacks on doma.we must decide whether smelt and hammer have established constitutional and prudential standing as to
