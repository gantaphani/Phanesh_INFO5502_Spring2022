these are several appeals from a disposition order in a juvenile dependency case.welf,et the order includes a finding of paternity and presumed father status in favor of the respondent.the appellants are a dependent minor child,the minor mother,the person denied presumed father status and instead given de facto parent status,and the local government agency responsible for dependent children all four appellants contend the trial court erred when it denied presumed father status to the man granted de facto parent status.the minor mother raises a second the court erred when it determined that the respondent qualifies for presumed father status 
our review of the facts of this case and the relevant law convinces us that respondent does not qualify for presumed father status,and the appellant who was designated a de facto parent does qualify as a presumed father.we also find that the trial court erred when it construed one of the statutes governing presumed father status.we therefore reverse the disposition order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
background of the case 
the minor child at issue in this appeal is appellant the minor.she was born in early.her mother is mother.is the appellant claiming he is entitled to presumed father status rather than de facto parent status.the local government agency is the los angeles county department of children and family services the department.respondent is,the man whom the dependency court determined is the minor biological and presumed father respondent.
the first dependency petition in this case was filed on april.it addresses the minor and mother two other children,and e.the petition listed appellant as the father of both the minor and r,but did not designate him as a presumed father or a biological father.
at the detention hearing,the court found a prima facie case for detaining the three children and finding they are persons described by section of the welfare and institutions code.on may,the court released the three children to mother and,the minor stepfather,and the department dismissed its petition without prejudice.this was done pursuant to a mediation agreement,and a welfare and institutions code section contract for informal department supervision of the family,under which the department would provide voluntary family maintenance services.a completion date of october,was set,at which time child welfare services would be terminated.
when this arrangement for informal department supervision proved unsuccessful within two months if its initiation,the department filed a second dependency petition which restated the allegations made in the original petition.a detention hearing was held on june,and once again the court found prima facie evidence that the children are persons described by welfare and institutions code section and removal was necessary.all three children were released to appellant,with monitored visits with mother and the.family maintenance services were ordered for,and family reunification services for mother and the stepfather.
by the time of the august pretrial resolution conference,respondent had contacted the department and asserted that he is the minor father.the court addressed the subject of presumed father status for each child individually.finding no objection,the court made two findings under family code section appellant is the presumed father of r,and that stepfather is the presumed father of regarding the minor,the court observed that both appellant and mother indicated on their paternity questionnaires that held the minor out as his child and accepted her into his home.however,the court indicated it would not make a paternity finding about the minor until human leukocyte antigen hla testing had been done on her,and on appellant,respondent,and mother.
at subsequent hearings,the court dismissed most of the allegations in the department second dependency petition,adjudicated the remainder to be true,found that and are persons described by subdivision b of section,and declared them dependents of the court.it placed them outside of mother care and with their respective presumed fathers,ordering family maintenance services for the fathers,and family reunification services for mother.the minor remained released to appellant,and her case was put over for disposition and resolution of her presumed father issue.
on november,the court indicated the results of the hla tests show that respondent is the minor biological father.while the attorneys for,mother,and the minor asserted that should be found to have presumed father status,the court disagreed,finding that respondent is the minor presumed father under family code section.
the court proceeded to disposition of the minor,declaring her to be a dependent child of the court,and placing custody of her with the department for suitable placement with appellant,whom the court referred to as an alleged father,and to whom it granted de facto status and standing the court ordered reunification services for mother and respondent,and family maintenance services for even though someone else is a presumed father.
thereafter,mother,the minor,the department,and filed their appeals.

the issues in this appeal address the matter of statutory presumed father status.did the dependency court err in denying presumed father status to appellant did the court err in finding that respondent is the minor presumed father 
discussion 
relevant terminology in dependency cases 
in dependency proceedings,fathers are divided into four,presumed,alleged,and de facto.in re jerry th,d.a natural father is one who has been established as a child biological father.id.at,d.use of the term natural father means that while the man biological paternity has been established,he has not achieved presumed father status as defined in former civil code section.in re zacharia cal th,fn,d.
presumed fatherhood,for purposes of dependency proceedings,denotes one who promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to paternal,financial,and otherwise.in re jerry,supra,th at,d.a natural father can be a presumed father,but is not necessarily one and a presumed father can be a natural father,but is not necessarily one.id.at,d.
an alleged father may be the father of a dependent child.however,he has not yet been established to be the child natural or presumed father.in re jerry,supra,th at,d.a de facto father is someone such as a stepparent who has,on a basis,assumed the role of a parent for a substantial period of time.id.at,d in re crystal th,d cal.rules of court,rule,a.use of the word parent in the dependency statutes does not include de facto parents.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d,observing that de facto parents are not parents for purposes of reunification services.
relevant statutory and case law respecting presumed father status in dependency cases 
presumed fathers are accorded greater rights than are mere natural fathers.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.for example,section,subdivision a of the welfare and institutions code provides that except in circumstances not relevant here,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.upon a finding and declaration of paternity by the juvenile court or proof of a prior declaration of paternity by any court of competent jurisdiction,the juvenile court may order services for the child and the biological father,if the court determines that the services will benefit the child.italics added.
in dependency cases,one means of obtaining a presumed father status is to meet the conditions set out in any of the four subdivisions of section.they are a the man and the child natural mother are,or have been married to each other and the child was born during the marriage or within days after the marriage is terminated or there is a judgment of separation,b before the child birth,the man and the natural mother have attempted to marry each other by a marriage solemnized in apparent compliance with the law,and the child is born within a certain period of time,c after the child birth,the man and the natural mother have married or attempted to marry each other by a marriage solemnized in apparent compliance with law,and with his consent he is named on the child birth certificate as the child father,or he is obligated to support the child because of a written voluntary promise or a court order,or d the man receives the child into his home and openly holds the child out as his natural child.subdivision d is the portion of section under which both appellant and respondent assert they qualify for presumed father status for the minor 
subdivision a of section provides that a presumption arising under these subdivisions of section may be rebutted,in an appropriate action,by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a.use of the word may and the requirement of an appropriate action denote the state preference to not remove children from homes where they have a strong emotional bond with a man who is not the child biological father but who has met the statutory requirements for presumed father status.california recognizes that developed relationships that afford children social and emotional strength and stability can substitute for biological ties,and in such cases it may not be appropriate to find that the presumption of paternity has been rebutted.in re nicholas cal th,d,et 
in re nicholas presented the question whether a man section,subdivision d presumed father status is necessarily rebutted,under subdivision a of section,by his admission that he is not the child biological father.the court held it is not.rather,whether a particular dependency case is an appropriate action in which to find that such a presumption is rebutted under subdivision a of section is a matter for the trial court sound discretion.in re nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.in that case,there was no other man who was claiming parental rights to the child,and the court said it was unlikely that the legislature had in mind that type of situation when it used the phrase in an appropriate action in subdivision a,since a finding that the appellant section presumed father status had been rebutted by his admission of nonpaternity would render the child fatherless.the court said that instead,the legislature was addressing an action in which another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section d presumption in order to perfect his claim,or in which a court decides that the legal rights and obligations of parenthood should devolve upon an unwilling candidate.cal th at,d.
another aspect of section is its provision that when two or more presumptions arise under section and those presumptions conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls,subd.b.this legislative directive to weigh considerations of policy and logic gives recognition to the fact that t he paternity presumptions are driven by state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concern for the welfare of the child.steven matthew th,d steven the directive reflects california preference for preserving an existing relationship that affords a child social and emotional strength and stability.ibid.
in steven,two men,steven and matthew,had presumed father status of the same child.while blood tests established that matthew was the child biological father,the trial court determined steven presumption of paternity should prevail because he had developed the enduring relationship with the child,and therefore the conflict between the presumptions weighed in his favor.steven,supra,th at,d.likewise,in in re kiana th,d,we said that if genetic testing had been performed in that case and had shown that one of the two presumed fathers was the biological father and the other was not,the latter would not necessarily lose his presumed father status.id.at,d.
in in re nicholas,supra,cal th at,d,the court said that because there was only one presumed father claiming parental rights in that case,it was not necessary for the court to decide the question addressed in steven and kiana,namely,whether under subdivision b of section,a presumed father biological paternity of a child necessarily defeats a nonbiological father presumed father status because the court did not decide that issue,the holdings in kiana and steven are still viable.since our review of the record convinces us that appellant is a presumed father under section,we would apply those holdings to the instant case and send the case back to the trial court to have the court conduct a section,subdivision b weighing process were it not for the fact that our review of the record also convinces us that the facts of this case do not support respondent claim to presumed father status for the minor.those conclusions are addressed next.
standard of review 
as noted above,the statutory provision under which both respondent and appellant claim presumed father status for the minor is subdivision d of section.to support their claim,each had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that there were present two elements necessary to invoke the presumption reception of the minor into his home and openly and publicly acknowledging paternity.in re spencer th,d.section states that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he meets those elements.
in considering appellants challenge to the trial court finding that is not a presumed father,and in considering mother challenge to the court finding that respondent is a presumed father,we apply the substantial evidence test.in doing so,we are required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to those determinations.we draw all reasonable inferences,and resolve conflicts in the evidence,in favor of the trial court findings,and we do not reweigh the evidence.in re spencer,supra,th at,d.
analysis of appellant claim of presumed father status 
factual background of claim 
when mother filled out a paternity questionnaire,she stated that is the father of the minor,and that he held himself out as the minor father and accepted the minor into his home.likewise,indicated on his own paternity questionnaire that he holds himself out as the father of the minor and accepts her into his home.
when the social worker interviewed for the april,detention hearing on the first dependency petition,indicated he had last seen the minor and his son on march of that same year.he stated that while he will not give mother money for the children,he buys them clothes and keeps the receipts and other things they need,and has told mother to call him if the children need anything.he stated he always stays in touch with his children no matter where mother lives.he was employed by his father in a painting business at that time.
told the social worker that after he ended his relationship with mother,he visited with the minor and his son every other weekend,and on their birthdays and holidays.after he was incarcerated from to,he visited the children at least once a month.he indicated that while he understood that respondent could be the minor father,he has always thought of the minor as his daughter and he loves her as his own.in a declaration he filed with his motion for presumed father status,stated it is his wish to have custody of the minor and have her be a part of his family with his son,r.he disputed that respondent had ever provided for the minor child or been involved with her.
mother told the social worker that when she informed that respondent did not want to have anything to do with the minor,treated the minor as if she were his own child.he takes the minor and his son,to his home for visits and buys them clothes,food,toys and other essentials.
prior to respondent coming forward,all parties and the court referred to as the minor father.at the june detention hearing on the second petition,the three children were released to.the minor counsel indicated to the court that the minor wished to stay with her brother,and with 
in the department disposition report for the second petition,the social worker stated it is apparent that has cared for and provided for the minor since her birth and he continues to care for her needs.additionally,the minor is residing with her brother,r with whom she is bonded.the social worker opined that i t is not in the minor best interest to remove her from whom she has known since birth and with whom she has a close relationship in order to place her with another alleged father whom she barely saw as a toddler,with whom she does not have a relationship and who apparently has not provided for her needs.
analysis of facts 
the record is clear that the minor never actually lived with however,when a mother and father of a child are not inclined to live with each other,their child often lives with only one of the parents and visits the other.here,there is evidence to support a finding that is what occurred between mother,the minor,and although the minor was not received into home to live with him on a full time basis,he was involved with the minor from the very beginning,with mother blessing.he took this interest in the minor even though he was not convinced she is his biological daughter.thus,when his own son,came to visit him,so also did the minor child,whom the record shows was bonded with additionally,provided financially for the minor needs,buying her clothes,toys and food,and other essentials.it thus was quite natural for to step up to the plate and take the minor as well as his own son into his home when the children were removed from mother care.both he and mother indicated on their paternity questionnaires that he holds himself out as the minor father,and he was referred to as the father of the minor during much of the time the case was pending in the trial court.the department was of the opinion that the minor and have a close relationship,and the minor preferred to be placed with him even though she is aware that respondent is her father.
thus,we conclude the evidence is not sufficient to support the trial court determination that has not obtained presumed father status under subdivision d of section.as a matter of law,he has met the elements of that statutory presumption.as next discussed,the same can not be said for respondent.
analysis of respondent claim of presumed father status 
factual background of respondent claim 
at the august,preresolution conference,respondent attorney represented to the court that respondent gave him the following chronology regarding respondent contacts with the minor.mother,the respondent and the minor lived together for one to three months in,and respondent visited the minor every other weekend from when the minor was one year old until approximately may when respondent became involved with another woman,at which time mother stopped letting respondent visit the minor,and respondent last saw the minor around march.respondent mother has pictures of the minor in her wallet,and he is held out to be the minor father.
the department report for the september mediation hearing contains respondent statement that after november did not see the minor anymore because mother made it difficult for him to visit with her because he had a girlfriend.however,prior to that time,he saw the minor twice a month,although not in his home,and sometimes the minor visited his parents on the weekends.he stated that he and his parents bought the minor clothes,toys and food approximately two times a month,but he did not give mother financial assistance for the minor.respondent filled out a paternity questionnaire in which he stated that he held himself out as the minor father and accepted her into his home.
in papers submitted by respondent attorney to the court in october,it was represented that respondent visited the minor on a fairly regular basis,occurring for the most part at the maternal grandmother residence.this type and frequency of visitation continued through.this representation of events was made in points and authorities,not in a declaration signed by respondent.
at the mediation hearing,mother stated that respondent visited the minor when she was one or two years old but he denied that she was his child and he always stated he wanted a paternity test,and that is why mother did put his last name.apparently mother meant that is why she did not give respondent last name to the minor.the minor bears mother last name.mother stated respondent own mother did come and visit the minor but when mother invited respondent to come and visit the child,he declined.the department reported that mother made similar representations to the social worker regarding respondent denial of paternity,and she stated he visited the minor in mother home when she was two years old and then stopped visiting,and when mother asked respondent own mother why he had stopped visiting the minor,his mother stated she did not know where he was.additionally,mother told the social worker that the minor visited respondent parents at their home and on one such visit in the minor saw respondent and he hit her because she called him by his first name instead of daddy.after that,the minor refused to go to the home of respondent parents and so respondent parents would drive to mother home to see the minor.mother indicated that respondent had two visits with the minor at his parents home between and,and he not come to see the minor at mother home.according to mother,respondent never provided for the minor in any way.
when the minor was interviewed by the children social worker during the pendency of the initial dependency petition,she stated respondent is her father but he never comes to visit her,and the last time she saw him was when she was one year old.at the november,disposition hearing,respondent attorney represented to the court that his client had recently reestablished his relationship with the minor,had seen her four times since the prior court hearing,was telephoning her every other evening,and the minor enjoys the visits and refers to respondent as daddy and responds to him as such.
analysis of respondent claim 
mother contends the record is insufficient to support the trial court determination that respondent met the section,subdivision d requirements for presumed father status.mother is correct.the evidence does not support a finding that respondent is a statutorily presumed father 
there is no evidence the minor was received into respondent home.the record shows merely that respondent represented to his attorney,who then represented to the court,that mother,respondent and the minor lived together in somebody home for one to three months in.besides being evidence,this period of time is exceedingly small.
nor is there evidence that the minor was received into respondent home on a consistent visitation basis.while there was a significant difference in the information given to the court by mother and by respondent regarding the span of time during which respondent visited with the minor,even resolving that conflict in favor of respondent representation that he visited the minor on a fairly regular basis whatever that means in after she was born in april of that year,and then visited with her every other weekend from to may and last saw her around march the visits were in other people homes,not in respondent home.absent any other reasonable explanation for this to which we are not made privy,such visitation can be seen as a matter of convenience for respondent.in re spencer,supra,th at,d.by visiting the minor at the maternal grandmother home and at his parents home,respondent could avoid the constant tasks that come with having the child in his own as feeding and cleaning up after the minor,changing her clothing,bathing her,seeing to her naps,putting her to bed,taking her for outings,playing games with her,disciplining her,and otherwise focusing on the child.indeed,there is no indication of what he did with the minor during his visits.also lacking is evidence that respondent took an interest in the minor schooling,health,recreation.
further,even accepting as true respondent representation that visitation between himself and the minor stopped because mother ended it,there is no evidence that thereafter he asserted a right to custody or visitation,or eve
