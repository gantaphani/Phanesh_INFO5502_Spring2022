in this dependency proceeding,the alleged father of the minor appellant appeals from the juvenile court order terminating his parental rights.welf,undesignated statutory references are to this code.appellant contends the juvenile court erred by failing to order paternity testing and by failing to appoint counsel to represent him.we conclude that the juvenile court failure to comply with the statutory provisions for giving an alleged father notice and an opportunity to elevate his paternal status mandates reversal in this matter.
factual and procedural background 
a dependency petition was filed in june concerning the newborn minor,after the minor and the mother tested positive for methamphetamines at the time of the minor birth.according to the petition,the mother had failed to reunify with six other children,and had tested positive for methamphetamines when two of these children were born.
initially,the mother identified joe as the minor father.however,at the detention hearing,the mother advised the juvenile court through counsel that another individual was the minor father.efforts by the social services agency to contact this individual before the detention and jurisdictional hearings were unsuccessful.
appellant appeared for the first time at the jurisdictional hearing in august and indicated he might be the minor father.prior to addressing appellant claim of possible paternity,the juvenile court sustained the petition,denied reunification services and set a hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for the minor pursuant to section.
next,in response to the juvenile court inquiry,appellant acknowledged he had never attempted to marry the minor mother,had never lived with her and was not present at the minor birth.according to appellant,he found out about everything when he spoke to the social worker the day before.
appellant was provided a paternity program packet,which the juvenile court described as documents that may be able to assist you in establishing paternity,if you interested in doing so.the court advised appellant that he need ed to work immediately toward establishing his paternity,after which consideration would be given to offering him reunification services.the court instructed appellant work quickly,take care of that paperwork,ask the da to test you and we go from there.also,according to the minutes from this proceeding,appellant was served with w rit n otification in open c ourt.
according to the report for the section hearing,appellant subsequently contacted the social worker several times and asked her to make a paternity test appointment for him.after consulting with county counsel,the social worker advised appellant to follow the directions in the paternity packet and contact the district attorney office.the social worker also sent appellant a letter instructing him to contact the district attorney office and tell them that you believe you might be the father of paul,born minor date of birth,and that you would like to be paternity tested.a letter from the social worker to appellant three weeks later stated she had received his message indicating he was unable to locate a telephone number for the district attorney office in the paternity packet.in the letter,the social worker suggested that appellant obtain the number from the telephone directory.
the social worker reported that appellant contacted the p rogram m anager for a doptions a few days later and said that he did not know where the district attorney office was located and that he wanted a paternity test arranged for him.he was told he would need to arrange for paternity testing on his own because the court had not ordered testing.appellant was provided an address and telephone number and was told to immediately arrange for testing.
shortly thereafter,an attorney contacted the social worker on appellant behalf to confirm there was no order for paternity testing.the attorney told the social worker that appellant would contact her once an appointment for testing had been arranged.
according to the social worker,she received a letter from appellant approximately one month later requesting simultaneous testing of himself and the minor as he did not trust the department to produce dna from the minor appellant requested he be contacted by certified mail regarding the arrangements for testing because his past experience working with the social worker on this case have sic achieved no successful outcome.a subsequent letter to appellant notified him that his request was denied,and he was again provided the address and telephone number to contact to arrange for paternity testing.the letter also stated that appellant could not have contact with the minor until his paternity was established.
meanwhile,the minor had been placed in a prospective adoptive home and the social worker deemed it highly likely he would be adopted if parental rights were terminated.
at the section hearing in december,appellant reported he had taken a s many steps as he could to establish paternity,but he ke pt going in circles in his efforts to complete the testing.appellant said he wanted to find out whether he was the minor father and that f rom the first day he had always wanted the kid as his.
appellant asked the juvenile court to accept an envelope containing documentation of his efforts to complete paternity testing.after finding the minor adoptable and terminating parental rights,the juvenile court directed the court clerk to t ake appellant envelope,and noted for the record that the court clerk has accepted the folder and would make copies for counsel.the record does not reflect that the court reviewed any of the documents presented by appellant during the hearing.
appellant documentation included a log of his efforts to set up paternity testing,which efforts included numerous calls to social workers,adoptions workers,the district attorney office and the department of child support services dcss.according to the log,appellant called the number provided by the adoptions worker to set up paternity testing and was told he needed a case number to initiate testing.appellant wife spoke to someone at county adoptions who confirmed that appellant was not named in their file as a possible father.appellant then left a message with the director of the social services agency to determine how to go about setting up an appointment.he also made numerous calls to the district attorney office and the court but was unable to obtain any further information.
appellant corresponded with dcss by,requesting specific information to help him schedule a dna test.the correspondence contained appellant name,address and birth date,and the juvenile court case number,and stated that appellant had attempted to call their office a number of times with no success.dcss responded by,stating they were unable to locate any such case.appellant wife attempted to call the number left in a message from dcss,and was informed,presumably by a recorded message,that the office call volume was too heavy,the message required a return call later,and she was not able to leave a voicemail message.
appellant confirmed he had consulted an attorney who advised him to contact the adoptions worker to schedule paternity testing.he also confirmed the adoptions worker would not set up a test without a court order.appellant indicated that,eventually,he received a letter from the adoptions worker providing a telephone number to call to set up paternity testing,which was the same telephone number appellant wife had called the previous month without results.appellant wife again tried calling the number and was told they could not pull up information on appellant or the minor.
also included in appellant documents was a letter from appellant to the juvenile court.in the letter,appellant explained he had met the minor mother while he was working as a food vendor at a ballpark,and they got together the same evening and had sex.according to the letter,the minor mother called him a few weeks later and told him she missed her period but,later,she informed him she had gotten her period.subsequently,she told appellant she was pregnant.later,appellant
