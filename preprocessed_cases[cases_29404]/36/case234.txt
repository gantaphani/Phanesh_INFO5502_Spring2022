background 
this case is before us on an appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in reviewing such a dismissal,we must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.inge rock financial,cir citing turker ohio of rehab,cir.in the instant case,the facts alleged in dubay amended complaint are not in dispute.
in the fall of,dubay and wells became involved in a romantic relationship.at that time,dubay informed wells that he had no interest in becoming a father.in response,wells told dubay that she was infertile and that,as an extra layer of protection,she was using contraception.dubay,in reliance on these assurances,participated in a consensual sexual relationship with wells.
the parties relationship later deteriorated.shortly thereafter,and much to dubay surprise,wells informed dubay that she was pregnant,allegedly with dubay child.wells chose to carry the child to term and the child,egw,was born on an unspecified date in.during the pregnancy and birth of the child,dubay was consistently clear about his desire not to be a father.
a few weeks after egw birth,the county brought a paternity complaint against dubay in the saginaw county circuit court under the michigan paternity act.wells and the county sought a judgment of filiation,child support,reimbursement for delivery of the child,and other statutory and equitable relief.dubay requested a stay so that the constitutional issues presented by the litigation could be resolved,but the trial court denied that request.dubay thereafter brought this action against wells and the county in federal district court,seeking relief under.
in his amended complaint,filed on march,dubay alleged that the application of the michigan paternity act to his case violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as article,section of the michigan constitution,which loosely parallels the equal protection clause.dubay also requested costs and attorney fees under.the county answer asked the district court to dismiss dubay complaint and requested attorney fees pursuant to.
on april,the attorney general moved to intervene.the attorney general also filed a motion to dismiss dubay complaint.on april,the district court granted the attorney general motion to intervene.

the parties argued the motion to dismiss before the district court on june.on july,the court issued an opinion and order dismissing dubay complaint with prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.dubay wells,d.the district judge also concluded that the attorney general was entitled to attorney fees.id.at.
following the entry of this order,wells and the county moved for attorney fees on july.the attorney general also formally moved for attorney fees on july.on august,dubay filed a timely notice of appeal.on september,the district court granted the county motion for attorney fees in full and wells and the attorney general motions in part.
on appeal,dubay challenges the district court dismissal of his claim under rule b,and the district court award of attorney fees to defendants.in addition to disputing these arguments as groundless,defendants have also filed a motion requesting us to award them costs and attorney fees for this appeal pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure.
ii.discussion 
a.the michigan paternity act does not violate dubay right to equal.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of a defendant motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.directv,treesh,cir.the motion should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief.ricco potter,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.in analyzing the complaint,all the factual allegations must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and the plaintiff must receive the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts in the complaint.bd.of educ.of tipp city exempted village sch,cir.we do not apply a heightened pleading standard for claims arising under.id.
dubay seeks relief under,which provides a remedy against e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution.in support of his claim,dubay alleges that the michigan paternity act violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment which guarantees that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.
though dubay does not specify which sections of the michigan paternity act he challenges,a review of the statute reveals two primary contenders.first,establishes the duty of unmarried parents to support their children.this section states,in relevant part,that t he parents of a child born out of wedlock are liable for the necessary support and education of the child.comp.laws.second,requires the court to enter an order of filiation declaring paternity and providing for the support of the child if the court determines that the defendant is the father of the child,if the defendant acknowledges paternity,or if the defendant has a default judgment entered against him on the issue.comp.laws.the statute directs the court to specify the sum to be paid weekly or otherwise in the order of filiation.comp.laws.the amount of support is determined according to a formula established by the state friend of the court bureau,but can be modified by the court upon a showing that the amount calculated by the formula would be unjust or inappropriate.comp.laws.a defendant who fails to comply with an order to pay child support faces serious consequences,including wage garnishment,suspension of drivers or professional licenses,or jail.see generally michigan support and parenting time enforcement act.comp.laws.
dubay argues that the enforcement of the michigan paternity act against him denies him the equal protection of the law in two ways first and foremost,dubay argues that the michigan statutes deny him the equal protection of the law by affording mothers a right to disclaim parenthood after engaging in consensual sex,through abortion while denying that right to fathers.second,dubay contends that michigan law denies men equal protection by making it easier for a woman to place a child in adoption or drop the newborn off at a hospital or other social service agency.an examination of these claims under our equal protection jurisprudence,however,reveals that they lack merit.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.city of cleburne cleburne living center,d citing plyler doe,d.however,the fourteenth amendment does not deny to the state the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways.eisenstadt baird,d.in reviewing state legislation for an equal protection violation,we apply different levels of scrutiny to different types of classifications.clark jeter,d.in general,we start with the presumption that the statute is valid.city of cleburne,at.to overcome this presumption,the party challenging the statute must demonstrate that the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.clark,at.citing san antonio indep.sch.dist.rodriguez,d.if the legislation official classification is based on gender,however,the justification must be exceedingly persuasive.united states virginia,d citing mississippi for women hogan,d.for such classifications,the burden is on the state to demonstrate that the legislation serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.id.internal quotation marks removed accord nguyen ins,d hogan,at.craig boren,d.finally,classifications affecting fundamental rights are given the most exacting scrutiny.clark,at.under strict scrutiny,a regulation infringing upon a fundamental right will only be upheld if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.see,reno flores,d.
dubay can not prevail under any of these equal protection theories.first,strict scrutiny does not apply because the michigan paternity act does not affect any of dubay fundamental rights.in hedges,we found that the right to privacy,articulated in the supreme court substantive due process jurisprudence,does not encompass a right to decide not to become a parent after conception and birth,cir.see also rivera minnich,d finding that a putative father has no legitimate right and certainly no liberty interest in avoiding financial obligations to his natural child that are validly imposed by state law.in doing so,we explicitly rejected the argument,which dubay raises in his brief,that fairness dictates that men should receive a right to disclaim fatherhood in exchange for a woman right to abortion hedges,at.our discussion clarified that it is not a fundamental right of any parent,male or female,to sever his or her financial responsibilities to the child after the child is born.see id.thus,to the extent that dubay claims that michigan is not affording him equal protection of the law by denying men,but not women,the right to initiate consensual sexual activity while choosing to not be a parent,see pl.br.at,his argument must fail.
second,we do not need to apply intermediate scrutiny because the michigan paternity act does not discriminate on the basis of gender.the statutory provisions that impose the obligation of support upon dubay,and similarly situated fathers,are gender neutral.see.comp.laws the parents of a child born out of wedlock are liable for the necessary support and education of the child.emphasis added.likewise,while the provision allowing for a judgment of filiation is technically based upon gender as it only provides for an order establishing that a man is the legal father of the child see.comp.laws,this provision must be read in light of michigan entire statutory scheme which also requires the identification of a mother at the child birth,see.comp.laws,and establishes a judicial remedy to ensure that this mother is providing adequate support to the child.comp.laws.by requiring the identification of a mother and a father for the child and by demanding that both these parents provide support to the child,the michigan statutes do not discriminate against either sex in imposing parenting obligations and,thus,do not need to be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny.
finally,the michigan paternity act withstands rational basis review because it is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.clark,at.the underlying purpose of the paternity act is to ensure that the minor children born outside a marriage are provided with support and education.crego coleman.this is undoubtedly a legitimate,and an important,governmental interest.kulko superior court of california,d recognizing that a state interest in protecting the welfare of its minor residents is unquestionably important.moreover,the means that the statute uses to achieve this support from the legal parents,and determining legal fatherhood based on the biological substantially,let alone rationally,related to this legitimate,and probably important,government purpose accordingly,we find that dubay has raised no viable equal protection challenge to the michigan paternity act.
however,undeterred by this lack of legal authority,and failing to cite the specific statutes that he challenges,dubay further argues that u nder michigan safe haven and abandonment laws,a mother can also unilaterally drop off a newborn at the hospital,police department,or clinic without any legal or financial recourse whatsoever,something not afforded men.it is also easier for a woman to place a child for adoption,and again avoid being forced into unwanted parenthood.pl.br.at.as with his challenge to the paternity act,this argument lacks legal foundation.
by failing to cite a single challenged statute,dubay has essentially waived the argument.see indeck energy,at.in any event,the laws that dubay appears to be challenging are gender neutral and are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.see,safe delivery of newborns act.comp.laws.dubay has produced no evidence that any of these acts were motivated by a discriminatory intent or for a discriminatory purpose.see bennett city of eastpointe,cir.accordingly,we again find that dubay can not demonstrate that the challenged michigan laws violate the equal protection clause.
because dubay has no legal basis for his claim that the michigan paternity act and other unspecified statutes violate the equal protection clause,he can not show that the county application of these laws to his case has deprived him of his constitutional rights as required for this action.therefore,we hold that the district court properly dismissed dubay case for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting attorney fees to defendants under b 
standard of review 
we review the district court award of attorney fees to a prevailing party under for abuse of discretion.revis meldrum,cir citing berger city of mayfield heights,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.id.citing berger,at.
the district court awarded attorney fee to wells,the county,and the attorney general under b.section b states,in relevant part,that i n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.
dubay does not challenge the district court substantive decision to grant defendants attorney fees under b instead,dubay contends that we should reverse because the district court awarded attorney fees without providing him with due process of law.specifically,dubay argues that the district court awarded sanctions without any advance notice or opportunity to be heard.pl.br.at.
this argument lacks merit.dubay does not cite a single case concerning the award of attorneys fees under.instead,the precedent upon which dubay relies concerns sanctions under rule,see ted lapidus,vann,cir simmerman corino,cir,or the district court inherent ability to sanction parties.chambers nasco,d.unlike the issues presented in the aforementioned cases,an award of attorney fees under b is not an award of sanctions.we have not previously specified what,if anything,due process requires in the context of a b award.
even assuming,however,that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before awarding attorney fees under b,dubay challenge to the district court would fail on its facts.the attorney general moved for attorney fees in his motion to dismiss and the district court addressed this issue in oral argument.the county and wells moved separately for attorney fees on july,and the attorney general again formally moved for attorney fees on july.dubay was pr
