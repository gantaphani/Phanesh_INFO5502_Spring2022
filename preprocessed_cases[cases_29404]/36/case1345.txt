introduction 
in this writ proceeding we hold that a family law petition for dissolution of marriage which does not allege a community interest in specific real property does not state a real property claim so as to support the filing of a notice of lis pendens with regard to that property.the plain language of the governing statute,section of the code of civil procedure,requires a pleading which alleges a claim that affects title or possession to specific real property.the common practice of family lawyers in this state of being deliberately cagey or noncommittal in the family law petition or response by not specifying items of community and separate property,such assets as may be discovered at a later date or the full nature and extent of petitioner community property is unknown at this time does not comply with the statutory requirements allowing the filing of a notice of lis pendens,and consequently will not support such a filing.
ii.background 
lee gale husband and laura gale wife were married in.prior to the marriage,husband was the trustee of a living trust that owned three expensive houses in newport beach,two of which were on balboa island.during the marriage,in,the trust conveyed title to the three homes to management vi properties,llc,which was formed to manage the properties.during the marriage wife attended to many of the details of that management,including making arrangements to keep the properties in repair and rented out.she also drew a salary from the company.husband,however,had percent of the voting rights in the firm.
wife filed for dissolution in in a petition that did not mention anything at all about management vi or the three properties it owned.rather,the petition followed the common practice of not listing any specific assets as community or separate.instead it only stated that there were such community assets as may be discovered at a later date the right to amend being reserved.management vi was not joined as a party to the proceedings.
in the spring of,management vi was in the process of selling one of the balboa island properties.according to the husband,the purpose of the sale was to obtain the funds to fulfill an one he unilaterally undertook on the company invest in a mobile home park,an investment on which he hoped to receive a higher return on capital.wife,herself a former real estate agent,thought the company was selling the property for too low a price,and should have held out for another.she thought the value to be million instead of the million selling price.so she filed a notice of lis pendens on the property.
the trial court judge denied husband subsequent motion to expunge,opining that he was not sure that maybe the automatic restraining orders issued at the outset of the case had not been violated by the mere attempt to sell.husband then brought this writ petition to challenge the trial court refusal to expunge the notice of lis pendens.
iii.discussion 
a.the restraining orders 
preliminarily,we must deal with the issue raised by the trial court comments that the automatic restraining orders typically included in the summons in a divorce case might have been enough,by themselves,to prevent the sale of one of the balboa houses.see,subd.a.we are forced into this detour because if the standard restraining orders do preclude the sale,then the case would not merit our discretionary writ review.even a determination that husband was entitled to have the notice of lis pendens expunged would not afford him effective relief.he or more precisely,management vi still would be able to actually sell the property.
read literally,the restraining orders forbid a divorcing spouse from even buying groceries you and your spouse are restrained from transferring or in any way disposing of any property,real or personal unless one reads further and realizes the blanket preclusion is qualified for disposals of property either in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life.besides being a matter of common sense,these qualifiers are mandated by a formidable body of constitutional law precluding the summary deprivation of property without due process,without notice and hearing.that law was forged in the context of overreaching creditor remedies in which alleged debtors found themselves summarily deprived of the use of their property without deliberative court proceedings.see randone appellate department cal d,prejudgment attachment procedure unconstitutional without notice and hearing blair pitchess cal d,same for claim and delivery see also sniadach family finance,d summary attachments without notice and hearing unconstitutional.
the record before us contains the fairly hefty formal operating agreement for management vi.while the agreement is relatively brief on the purpose of the company merely that the purpose is the management of the properties,the agreement also gives the manager of the company,husband all necessary powers to carry out the purposes of the company,including,but not limited to,the right to enter into and carry out contracts of all kinds and to own,manage,sell,lease,mortgage,pledge or otherwise acquire or dispose of company property.emphasis added.
the record also includes wife declaration,which only strengthens the conclusion that management vi is a bona fide business entity.she recognizes she was paid a salary for her services in collecting the rent and managing the company bank account,and all but avers that the corporation was anything but an alter ego of the couple.
on such a record,then,we may confidently say that usual course of business language exempted from the automatic operation of the restraining orders the attempt to sell the balboa house by the company.on the most elementary level,title to the balboa property is held by a third party,and that third party was not joined to the proceeding.while the trial court could issue restraining orders against management vi without formal joinder see,subd.a,it would be a contravention of basic due process to hold management vi itself accountable for restraining orders of which it never had notice.
on a more substantive level,even if we were,as an academic exercise,to disregard the separate identities of the company and husband and there is no basis to do that,the reallocation of assets to obtain a better return on capital is most assuredly in the usual course of business for a company whose business it is to hold and manage property.
now,none of this is to say,of course,that wife could not have sought a restraining order specifically targeted at the company disposition of the balboa property.but,to return to the basic theme of randone,blair and sniadach,obtaining such order would have necessarily entailed the elementary due process of notice and a hearing,in which the merits of any application could be argued before the trial court.that scenario is quite different from the idea that mere automatic no hearing restraining orders issued against a divorcing spouse somehow can constrain a property management company merely because it is managed by that spouse 
the lack of notice makes this case unlike one of the two major published family law decisions dealing with the language in restraining orders,lee superior court d.there,the appellate court refused to disturb a trial court decision allowing the sale of a major community asset an apartment house,but granted a writ vacating the decision to the extent that it allowed the proceeds to be used for an apparently much needed infusion of capital to pay the debts of a business of disputed character a floor covering business.see id.at.the appellate court reasoned that allowing the infusion effectively settled the disposition of the proceeds because if the business were one spouse separate property,the other spouse would have nothing more than a bare right to demand an accounting and to obtain a surcharge against any existing asset.id.at.
while one might construct a superficial parallel between lee and the present case if one were inclined to equate a and probably separate property business lee with a brand new investment in a mobile home park this case,the point is that the orders attacked in lee w
