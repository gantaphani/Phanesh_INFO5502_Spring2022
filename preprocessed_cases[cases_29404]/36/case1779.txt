after the trial court in this case made an initial determination,the children lived with their custodial parent in four different states over a five and year period while the parent remained in texas.in this modification suit,we must decide whether significant connections with texas exist or substantial evidence is available here such that the initial trial court retained exclusive continuing jurisdiction under section a of the texas family code.based on the record presented,we hold that the trial court retained exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the modification proceedings and the court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise.wl.because the relator lacks an adequate remedy by appeal,we grant the petition for writ of mandamus and order the court of appeals to vacate its order directing the trial court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
ann marie and robert joseph forlenza were divorced in collin county,texas,on march.on july,the trial court signed an agreed modification order,modifying the original divorce decree,that granted robert primary custody of their two children,now ten and fourteen years old,and the exclusive right to establish their primary physical residence.that same month,the children moved with robert to issaquah,washington.over the next five years,robert moved with the children three more august,they moved to ohio,on february,they moved to virginia,and on august,they moved to colorado where they now reside 
the current dispute arose in when robert lost his job in virginia and was offered a contract job in taipei,taiwan.claiming that she had experienced difficulty in exercising her possession rights,ann filed this suit on september,seeking to modify the prior agreed possession order.she also requested a restraining order prohibiting robert from relocating the children outside the united states,which the trial court granted.robert filed a to clarify and,alternatively,to modify prior orders.in his motion,robert averred that the collin county court had exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the suit as a result of prior proceedings.shortly thereafter,on october,robert filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue an initial order,and alternatively requesting the trial court to decline jurisdiction in favor of virginia,where the children then resided with their father and his new wife.after a hearing on november,the court denied robert motion and the parties proceeded to prepare the case for trial,which was ultimately set for february.
during a pretrial conference seven days before the scheduled trial date,robert filed a second motion to dismiss alleging that the court did not have exclusive continuing jurisdiction under texas family code section a to modify its previous order.the trial court conducted another evidentiary hearing and denied the motion the court of appeals,however,concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion and granted robert petition for writ of mandamus,ordering the trial court to vacate its prior order and dismiss the case.wl.we granted ann petition to determine whether the trial court retained exclusive continuing jurisdiction under the uniform child custody jurisdiction enforcement act uccjea.
effective september,texas adopted the uccjea,replacing the previous uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja.the uccjea was designed,in large part,to clarify and to unify the standards for courts continuing and modification jurisdiction in interstate matters.the act that the uccjea replaced,the uccja,was drafted in as a model act designed to prevent repeated custody litigation.but even though all fifty states adopted the uccja,some did so with significant departure from the original text.as a result,states often interpreted the act inconsistently and determinations made in one state were often not accorded full faith and credit in another.
to address some of these problems,in congress enacted the parental kidnaping prevention act pkpa,which requires states to accord full faith and credit to custody decrees issued by sister states that substantially comply with the pkpa.the pkpa authorizes exclusive continuing jurisdiction in the state that issued the original decree as long as one parent or child remains there and that state has exclusive continuing jurisdiction under its own law.id.d.the uccja,though,which the states had adopted,does not clearly articulate when a state retains exclusive continuing jurisdiction.as states adopted different interpretations of continuing jurisdiction and reached conflicting conclusions about the circumstances under which it endures,the law uniformity diminished,often resulting in simultaneous proceedings and conflicting custody decrees.see generally linda girdner patricia hoff,obstacles to the recovery and return of parentally abducted children research summary.the uccjea was designed to eliminate inconsistent state interpretations of the uccja jurisdictional aspects and to harmonize the uccja with the pkpa.see id.
article of the uccjea specifically grants exclusive continuing jurisdiction over disputes to the state that made the initial custody determination and provides specific rules on how long this jurisdiction continues.see unif.child custody jur.enf.actct,supp.rules that prevent another state from modifying a determination while exclusive continuing jurisdiction remains in the state complement these provisions texas adopted article without substantial variation from the uccjea.
robert challenge involves the proper interpretation of section a,which governs the duration of the state exclusive continuing jurisdiction.that section provides that a court of this state that has made an initial determination consistent with section has exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the determination until 
a court of this state determines that neither the child,nor the child and one parent,nor the child and a person acting as a parent,have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child care,protection,training,and personal relationships or 
a court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child,the child parents,and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.
a emphasis added.robert does not challenge the prior order compliance with section.and section a does not apply because ann continues to reside in texas.therefore,we must decide whether the trial court properly applied section a in deciding that it had exclusive continuing jurisdiction over these modification proceedings.statutory construction is a question of law that we review de novo.mcintyre ramirez.
robert jurisdictional plea contends that ann failed to establish that a significant connection with texas exists and that substantial evidence is available here concerning the children care,protection,training,and personal relationships.as a preliminary matter,robert asserts that,in making this determination,the court may not consider any contacts that occurred or any evidence that was created after september.we agree that jurisdiction must be determined at the proceeding commencement,which section defines as the filing of the first pleading b in this instance,ann motion to modify the prior agreed possession order.see.however,we disagree with robert contention that it was ann burden in the first instance to establish that the children have a significant connection with texas and that substantial evidence is available here.as a general matter,the pleader must allege facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court jurisdiction to hear the case.see.ass of bus.air control.under the statute,a court acquires exclusive continuing jurisdiction by virtue of a prior determination.a.by alleging that the court prior orders conferred exclusive continuing jurisdiction,ann satisfied her initial statutory burden.the statute specifically provides that a court retains exclusive continuing jurisdiction until it determines that the and requirements are no longer met.id.robert may challenge whether the statutory elements are satisfied,or the court may conside
