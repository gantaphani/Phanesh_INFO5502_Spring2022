family law courts have a difficult task.they must characterize property,divide community property,and award spousal and child support.this undertaking becomes even more challenging when a party submits misleading or false information to the court.where the trial court recognizes deception,it may draw adverse factual inferences and even refer the matter for perjury prosecution.as we said in in re marriage of chakko th,d,the courts will not tolerate those who interfere with the function of the trial court.here the trial court expressly opined that appellant,omid badakhsh father,committed perjury father appeals from the order increasing his child support obligation from per month to per month.he contends the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court determination of his income,the trial court erroneously refused to accept a proposed modification of the dissomaster calculation of child support,the trial court erred in not imputing income to mother of per month based on her earning capacity,and the trial court should have evaluated mother fitness as a parent.these contentions are premised upon evidence that was not credited by the trial court.we do not retry cases on appeal and we affirm the child support modification order.
