this case reaches the court after a full trial on the merits in the eastern district of north carolina.james dotson dotson brought suit against his employer,pfizer,pfizer,for violations of the family and medical leave act of,et the fmla.the jury awarded dotson on his fmla interference claim and on his retaliation claim.the district court awarded dotson in statutory liquidated damages,in attorneys fees,and in costs.each party appealed different rulings of the district court.finding error with the district court decision to deny interest,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand.
pfizer terminated dotson shortly after he and his wife returned from russia with their child.prior to his termination,dotson had worked at pfizer for approximately fifteen years.he began his career there in at an sales position.in he was promoted to district manager seven years later he became a regional manager responsible for more than sales representatives.
in,dotson took on a new position as an institutional healthcare account manager in pfizer national healthcare organizations nho division.there,he dealt with managed care organizations,insurance companies,and large employers rather than healthcare providers.the parties dispute the facts related to dotson reassignment.pfizer characterizes the new job as a demotion for unsatisfactory performance.dotson notes that he did not take a pay cut and that he received no information indicating performance deficiencies.approximately one year later,dotson was reassigned again,this time as a regional account manager in the same institutional healthcare division.in his new position,dotson immediate supervisor was chris kennedy kennedy,who reported to regional manager patrick mcelerney mcelerney.
as part of his training as a sales representative,dotson was instructed in the proper handling of sample packs of pfizer products,called starters.sales representatives provide starters to doctors,who give them to their patients in order to get a patient started on a drug for which the doctor will then write prescriptions.the food and drug administration regulates the use of starters.the prescription drug marketing act,et the pdma,covers their distribution.the pdma requires pfizer to track and account for any starters given to physicians.pfizer uses electronic tracking and starter activity forms to fulfill its responsibilities under the statute.
the pdma also requires pharmaceutical companies to report any improper diversions of starters or intentional falsifications of starter forms.violations can result in sanctions ranging from fines and the loss of drug distribution rights to imprisonment for some criminal violations of the statute.under its starter policies,pfizer can discharge employees for violations however,at the time dotson was fired,the company did not provide specific details of its standards for discharge.the nho division was not responsible for handling starters and did not receive starter activity forms or shipments of starters.
in early,dotson and his family began working with an adoption agency to adopt a child from russia.dotson called a pfizer benefits contractor to inquire about adoption benefits provided by the company.later that year,dotson and his wife learned that they could adopt a baby girl but would have to make at least two trips to russia to complete the adoption.dotson spoke with a pfizer human resources hr representative about taking leave during the adoption process.testimony differed as to what the hr representative,amy burnell burnell,told dotson about his intention to use accrued vacation time and the applicability of fmla benefits.burnell referred dotson to another hr officer whom dotson never contacted.he used accrued vacation time to take his first trip to russia.both parties agree that,around this time,dotson relationship with his immediate supervisor,kennedy,was deteriorating.
around august,dotson obtained starters from a pfizer sales representative that he intended to give to the director of medicine for the north carolina highway patrol.pfizer alleges that dotson request for and subsequent handling of the starter violated company protocol.later,after finding out that he was eligible to adopt and learning from the agency that it was customary to bring gifts for the orphanage,dotson decided to obtain a case of starters of the antibiotic zithromax to take to the orphanage in russia.in connection with this decision,the parties dispute dotson intent,his familiarity with starter protocol,and whether he knew that such an endeavor violated company policy.dotson delivered the zithromax to the orphanage on his first trip to russia.
during a performance review shortly after that first trip,dotson two immediate supervisors informed him that they were unhappy with his job performance and expressed concern about his use of the zithromax.dotson later contacted his regional hr director,ann hodges hodges,to discuss the negative performance review.hodges also said she was concerned about dotson handling of starters.after speaking with hodges,dotson left with his wife for a second trip to russia.pfizer then began an evaluation of dotson actions.as part of that evaluation,mcelerney related a summary of dotson actions to steve harper,a pfizer vice president,who believed that the use of the zithromax could be viewed as a prohibited quid pro quo with the russian orphanage.harper determined that dotson conduct warranted discharge,and an executive group within pfizer management concurred.pfizer terminated dotson on november,than three weeks after dotson and his wife returned from russia with their adopted child.dotson claims that the starter issue was used as a pretext to fire him and that the policy against his use of the starters was unknown to anyone outside the group that made the decision to terminate him.pfizer did not report dotson alleged pdma violation until.
dotson filed suit in september.in october,pfizer amended its answer to assert an evidence defense against dotson.the new defense related to dotson delivery of starters to the north carolina highway patrol and to his purported misleading of a pfizer starter control official,which pfizer claims led to its late reporting of the pdma violation.a jury trial began in may and lasted eight days.the jury found that pfizer interfered with dotson rights to fmla leave and that it discharged dotson in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.it awarded him on his claim of interference and on his retaliation claim.pfizer filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and an alternative motion for a new trial in june.after the trial,dotson filed a proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding front pay and a motion for liquidated damages,attorneys fees,and costs.the court denied pfizer jmol motion and awarded dotson in liquidated damages,as well as attorneys fees and costs.it denied dotson motion for front pay and prejudgment interest.on appeal,pfizer challenges the court denial of its jmol motion,the award of liquidated damages,and the amount of attorneys fees awarded.dotson appeals the court denial of interest and front pay,and contends that the award of attorneys fees was inadequate.
pfizer argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.rodriguez smithfield packing,cir citing austin paramount parks,cir.a trial court may grant judgment as a matter of law when it finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party.a see brown csx,cir.a court,however,may not disturb the verdict where there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in the favor.lack stores,cir.a trial court may not appropriately enter jmol unless it concludes,after consideration of the record as a whole in the light most favorable to the,that the evidence presented supports only one reasonable verdict,in favor of the moving party.williams cerberonics,cir citation omitted.
pfizer raises three grounds on which it contends the district court should have granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law on dotson fmla retaliation claim.first,it argues that the fmla does not provide for the type of intermittent leave that he took.second,pfizer claims that dotson did not request fmla leave,and so a rational jury could not hold it liable for retaliating against him for exercising his fmla rights.third,pfizer argues that dotson could not show retaliatory animus by the persons who decided to fire him and that there was no evidence that the firing was pretextual.
intermittent leave under the fmla 
the fmla allows eligible employees weeks of leave during any period b ecause of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care.a b an employee can not take such leave intermittently unless the employee and the employer agree otherwise.id.at b.
the parties do not dispute that dotson took intermittent leave.pfizer,though,suggests that dotson absences were taken intermittently without pfizer consent and thus fall outside the fmla.testimony showed,however,that dotson kept the company informed of his need for leave.in its brief,pfizer acknowledged that other than for one dinner,it permitted dotson to take all of the leave that he requested.pfizer claims that even though it allowed dotson to take accrued leave intermittently,it could not have approved intermittent fmla leave because he never specifically requested the use of intermittent fmla leave.
pfizer argument fails because the fmla does not require dotson to specifically invoke its protections in order to benefit from it.regulations promulgated by the department of labor repeatedly emphasize that it is the employer responsibility to determine the applicability of the fmla and to consider requested leave as fmla leave.price city of fort wayne,cir citing b.read in context,subsection b to does not create an additional hurdle for employees asking for leave beyond the requirement that they make a request or requests for leave that is intermittent.instead,the statutory language makes it clear that employers may,at their option,require that employees take fmla leave for certain reasons birth,adoption or foster care placement under a a b in one block of up to twelve weeks rather than intermittently.the requirement that employer and employee must agree on intermittent leave means that employers can refuse to allow this type of leave in birth,adoption and foster care placement cases.by contrast,employees have an unfettered right to take fmla leave because of a serious health condition intermittently when medically necessary,with or without employer consent a c d.when the provisions are read side by side in this manner,the requirement that employer and employee must agree on intermittent leave does not clash with the position that no magic words are necessary to invoke the protections of the fmla.see sarnowski air brooke limousine,cir see also rhoads,cir.pfizer could not point to any evidence showing that it refused to allow dotson to take leave intermittently.
courts that have allowed employers a defense based on the statute requirement that the employer and employee agree on intermittent leave have done so when the employer expressly refused to agree to intermittent leave.see maynard town of monterey,cir beyst pinnacle airlines,wl at,june,granting an employer motion for summary judgment on an intermittent fmla claim where the employer expressly forbade intermittent leave in its employee handbook 
here,evidence showed that pfizer agreed that dotson could take his leave intermittently.dotson kept his supervisors informed about his need for absences,which included two separate trips to russia.no one at pfizer suggested he could not take either trip.dotson also contacted pfizer employee benefits contractor with questions related to his planned adoption.during the trial,he offered evidence that a pfizer hr official misinformed him about available fmla benefits,after which he did not seek to designate any of his time off as.the jury,then,heard evidence from which it could reasonably infer that pfizer either granted dotson requests for intermittent leave or failed to properly inquire concerning the designation of leave.if dotson was improperly dissuaded from pursuing his fmla options,he could not have come to an agreement on a more formal intermittent leave schedule in either case,pfizer can not now claim that it did not agree to allow dotson to take the intermittent leave he requested and took.
request for fmla leave 
pfizer submits that the district court should have granted judgment in its favor because no evidence suggested that dotson applied for fmla leave or exercised his fmla rights.the company argues that it could not have intended to retaliate against dotson for using his fmla rights when he did not actually exercise those rights.
in addition to providing a substantive or prescriptive right to unpaid leave in certain situations,the fmla also provides proscriptive rights that protect employees from discrimination or retaliation for exercising their substantive rights under the fmla.yashenko harrah nc casino,cir citing hodgens general dynamics,cir.section of the fmla makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter.a.while the fmla does not specifically forbid discharging an employee in retaliation for his use of fmla leave,c states that employers are prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used fmla leave and that employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as hiring,promotions,or disciplinary actions.courts have recognized that the fmla provides a cause of action for retaliation.blankenship buchanan,d.
relying principally on a case from the eleventh circuit,strickland water works sewer,cir,pfizer argues that for dotson to establish unlawful retaliation under the fmla,he must show that pfizer had notice that he was specifically invoking an fmla right.simply asserting that an employer had notice of an employee need for leave for an reason,pfizer suggests,can not open the employer to fmla retaliation liability.
case law and federal regulations make it clear,however,that employees do not need to invoke the fmla in order to benefit from its protections.the regulations do not require the employee to expressly assert rights under the fmla or even mention the fmla instead,the employee may only state that leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption,for example.c.after the employee makes such a statement,the responsibility falls on the employer to inquire further about whether the employee is seeking fmla leave.id.in providing notice,the employee need not use any magic words.sarnowski,at.
there is no question that dotson gave pfizer adequate notice of his need for leave during the adoption process.after he provided this information,the burden shifted to pfizer to determine whether he was requesting fmla leave.pfizer has not shown that it made any inquiry into whether his leave should have been classified as protected under the fmla.pfizer legal argument would allow it to use its own failure to determine whether leave should be designated as to block liability for retaliation.we decline to allow an employer to take advantage of its own lapse in such a way.
language in strickland does appear to countenance the view that,for a retaliation claim to proceed,an employer must be on notice that an employee specifically invoked the protection of the fmla.see at.in strickland,the employee had an argument with his supervisor and then left work.the employee claimed that he told his supervisor and another individual responsible for recording work absences that he was leaving because he was having trouble with his diabetes.id.at.on these facts,the court found that the employer did not have notice that the employee was taking leave it did,however,allow the employee to press a fmla interference claim.thus,the strickland court appeared to embrace a higher burden for making a retaliation claim under the statute.in our view,any such elevated evidentiary burden contrasts with the applicable fmla notice regulations,which do not differentiate between the notice required to make interference claims and other claims under the fmla.to the extent that strickland stands for a higher retaliation burden,we decline to follow it.
in contrast to the,confusing statements made by the employee in strickland,however,dotson gave clear and advance notice that he was pursuing adoption,an event.his testimony could lead a reasonable jury to find that pfizer was on notice that he was inquiring about his fmla options and that pfizer did not fulfill its duty to inquire about whether his leave should be classified as.dotson also proffered evidence showing that he asked about the fmla and received incorrect or misleading advice from a pfizer hr official that led him to believe the law could not benefit him.thus,even if we accepted the higher standard for a retaliation claim implied in strickland,we would still find that dotson presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to believe that he was improperly prevented from invoking his fmla rights and fired in retaliation for actions that should have been protected under the statute.pfizer can not use its own oversight to escape liability for retaliation by claiming it had no warning that the statute protected dotson.
retaliatory animus and pretext 
in order to prevail on a fmla retaliation claim,dotson must have shown evidence linking the adverse employment action taken against him to a protected activity,in this case his leave.see yashenko harrah nc casino,cir analyzing fmla retaliation claim under title vii framework.when we review a finding of retaliation after a full trial on the merits,our sole focus is discrimination vel non that is,whether in light of the applicable standard of review the jury finding of unlawful retaliation is supportable.cline stores,cir quoting jiminez mary washington,cir.
pfizer position at trial was that it fired dotson because his delivery of a starter to an orphanage in russia created the impression of a quid pro quo,which could have had serious legal repercussions for pfizer.this explanation,if believed by the jury,would have rebutted dotson prima facie case of retaliatory firing following the framework of mcdonnell douglas,which allows a finding of discrimination when the supposedly nondiscriminatory reason for termination is shown to be pretextual,dotson then put on evidence to show that pfizer reasons for firing him were a mere pretext for unlawful discrimination.see yashenko,at citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.
pfizer now argues that dotson failed to prove retaliation at trial for two reasons first,he did not show that any member of the group of pfizer executives that made the decision to fire him bore any retaliatory animus toward him for his leave second,dotson did not show that the reason pfizer gave for firing him was pretextual.we believe,to the contrary,that under the standard of review for a jmol decision,dotson put on sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find both retaliatory animus and pretext.because the evidence in the record before us shows that a jury could rationally find that pfizer stated reason for firing dotson was pretextual,we decline to address pfizer first argument in any detail 
dotson put on sufficient evidence of weaknesses and inconsistencies in pfizer account of its decision to fire him for a jury to find pretext.see richmond oneok,cir blankenship buchanan,d.first,pfizer starter policies were not so clearly drawn that dotson handling of starters was obviously wrongful.dotson put on evidence showing that some pfizer personnel were unaware that nho division employees could not handle starters.most importantly,none of the pfizer employees who knew in advance about dotson plan to donate the zithromax kennedy,his direct supervisor,and mcelerney,a member of the executive group that fired any action to stop him from donating the zithromax.neither kennedy nor mcelerney was disciplined for failing to stop him.a jury could rationally conclude that if such a donation constituted a violation serious enough to merit permanent dismissal,pfizer would have known to stop dotson from going forward with it or,alternatively,would have suffered some consequence for their inaction.
the evidence also showed that the other two persons directly involved in obtaining starters for dotson were not disciplined.pfizer argues that the level of misconduct by these two persons and dotson two supervisors on one hand,and dotson on the other,were quite different and should not be weighted equally under moore city of charlotte,cir.even if the conduct was not precisely analogous,of the five persons involved directly or tangentially in mishandling starters,one was fired and the other four were not disciplined at all.that fact,taken in combination with other pfizer employees confusion over the company starter policies and the timing of dotson firing,could lead a reasonable jury to find that dotson firing under these circumstances was pretextual.
pfizer suggests that the district court should have granted its motion for jmol on dotson claim for fmla interference because dotson did not show that he incurred actual damages as a result of any interference with his rights under the fmla.dotson,however,put on sufficient evidence for a jury to find that he suffered a cognizable injury because of pfizer interference.
dotson incurred actual damages when he was asked to work while traveling to russia on leave that should have been for which pfizer did not give him a full day credit.had pfizer treated the day dotson spent working as a work day,rather than as paid vacation,dotson would have been paid for an additional day of accrued vacation when he was terminated.a day paid vacation is not valueless it is a tangible employment benefit providing full pay for a day when no work is performed.as such,it should be considered a form of compensation subject to valuation.the section outlining damages for fmla interferences explains that employers are liable for damages in the amount of any wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation.a a i i.in our opinion,the amount of employment benefits or other compensation lost here is equal to the amount dotson would have been paid on a day of paid vacation.while dotson has raised a number of arguments that would support a finding of damages,the loss of paid vacation is sufficient to overcome any hurdle to an fmla interference claim.
during the trial,pfizer introduced evidence,discovered after the commencement of litigation,of what it claimed were dotson misrepresentations to pfizer personnel regarding the doctor signatures he obtained on the forms used to track starter distribution.during the performance review held in october,dotson two immediate supervisors instructed him to contact pfizer starter administration department to further discuss his distribution of starter drugs in russia and north carolina.pfizer evidence showed that during dotson conversation with jim batura batura,a pfizer employee dotson reached on the compliance hotline,dotson told batura that he had received a signature from his family pediatrician,a foster,acknowledging receipt of the zithromax that he eventually donated to the russian orphanage.batura determined that while dotson actions may have violated pfizer policy,they did not constitute a reportable offense under the pdma.
during the course of litigation,pfizer realized that foster dated her signature after dotson trip to russia.it questioned dotson about the timing of the signature dotson then claimed that a rusher had signed for the zithromax prior to dotson trip to russia,but that he had lost the starter form and sought a replacement form from foster after he returned.in an affidavit,rusher testified that he had no recollection of discussing dotson plan to donate the zithromax or of signing a starter form.after receiving this new information,batura determined that he had a duty to report several of dotson misrepresentations to the fda.pfizer argued that it would have fired dotson for these misrepresentations,independent of its stated reason for terminating him in november.after the jury returned its verdict,which indirectly indicated that it credited pfizer defense,dotson moved for judgment as a matter of law on the evidence defense 
an evidence defense limits an employer liability when the employer discovers evidence of wrongdoing of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the discharge.mckennon nashville banner publ g,d.in evaluating an defense,a court must look to the employer actual employment practices and not merely the standards articulated in its employment manuals.sellers mineta,cir citing mcdonnell douglas helicopter,cir.
dotson argues that the district court should have rejected pfizer evidence defense because the evidence acquired was in pfizer possession before his termination and,in any event,dotson alleged conduct would not normally have warranted discharge.he emphasizes a note from kennedy to mcelerney pointing out a discrepancy in the timing of dotson starter authorizations.dotson contends that this note shows that pfizer was aware of the starter problem,allegedly uncovered during the discovery process,before it fired dotson.
what was discovered during dotson deposition,however,was that he had misled batura,the starter compliance official,by telling him that foster had signed a starter form prior to dotson trip to russia.this conversation,pfizer claims,led it to refrain from contacting the fda to report a problem with its handling of starters.dotson argument that the evidence is not truly is specious.his supervisors,who may have known that something was amiss with dotson starter forms,directed him to call pfizer compliance department.pfizer put on evidence showing that dotson misled a compliance official and that the extent of the purported deception did not become clear until after litigation began and pfizer obtained a new explanation from dotson,which it later discovered was also questionable.the evidence was dotson misleading of batura was revealed only after dotson filed suit.
the second question,which we decide using the same standard as the trial judge,is whether a reasonable jury could have found for pfizer on its claim that it would have terminated dotson for his allegedly misleading conversation with batura.pfizer argues that it would have terminated an employee for misrepresenting material facts to a company official investigating starter misuse.at trial,pfizer introduced the testimony of dawn rogers,the human resources vice president for pfizer,who stated that dotson would have been terminated based on what pfizer discovered after the commencement of litigation.we conclude that this testimony would allow a reasonable jury to agree with pfizer on this element of its evidence defense,and so the district court correctly denied dotson motion for judgment as a matter of law.
because we reject dotson assertion that the district court should have granted his motion for judgment as a matter of law on pfizer evidence defense,it is clear that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing pfizer to amend its answer or in denying dotson motion in limine to exclude the evidence from trial.
both parties question the district court decisions related to damages and compensation.pfizer appeals the liquidated damages award and argues that the court awarded excessive attorneys fees in light of dotson limited recovery.dotson claims that he is entitled to interest,front pay,and additional attorneys fees.

dotson appeals the district court denial of his request for front pay.he asked for approximately million in front pay,including lost future earnings and benefits stretching fifteen years into the,as dotson explained,a planned early retirement at age.
under the fmla,a wronged employee is entitled to such equitable relief as may be appropriate,including employment,reinstatement,and promotion,along with damages.a b.the statute does not identify front pay as an equitable remedy,but we have recognized it as a proper form of relief that is an alternative and complement to reinstatement.cline stores,cir.determinations of front pay are made by the trial court sitting in equity.id.at citing duke uniroyal,cir.a trial court must temper the use of front pay by recognizing the potential for windfall to the plaintiff.duke,at.we review the denial of an award of front pay for abuse of discretion.see nichols ashland hosp,cir.
the district court believed that front pay from the date of termination until dotson planned retirement was simply too speculative to award.the court cited peyton dimario,a title vii case which held that front pay for years was unduly speculative the peyton court also noted that the balance of authority suggested that courts disfavored lifetime front pay awards for plaintiffs in their forties.peyton dimario.the district court stated that it would have been inclined to award front pay for a more limited as the approximately three years between dotson termination and the point at which he secured a similar though job at the jury award plus liquidated damages not made dotson whole by covering his projected losses over those three years.
dotson objects to the district court characterization of what he claimed would be uninterrupted future employment with pfizer as speculative.he also disputes its determination that liquidated damages made him whole for his future losses.dotson suggests that,since he has not found a position as remunerative as the one he held with pfizer,he will not be made whole unless he receives compensation to make up the difference,starting at the date of his termination and looking more than a decade into the future.
under these circumstances,we do not believe the district court abused its discretion in denying dotson front pay.at the time the court ruled on dotson request for front pay,dotson had secured employment in the pharmaceutical services industry,making approximately less than the approximately in salary and benefits he made prior to his termination.thus,he had secured comparable,if not precisely equivalent,work at another major drug company.
dotson goes to great lengths to show that front pay in his case would not be unduly speculative.the speculative nature of the inquiry,though,does not stem just from the question whether dotson would have stayed with pfizer through the end of his career had he not been fired.it also necessarily involves speculation as to what dotson future holds.the court was within its discretion to refuse to assume that dotson would never earn a salary comparable to what he made at pfizer,given his relative youth and education level.considering that the determination of front pay is inherently speculative dotson was of a relatively young age when terminated he is highly educated and experienced and he sought front pay from the date of his termination until the date he claims he would have retired,fifteen years in the future,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying front pay.
finally,dotson finds error in the court consideration of the role played by the liquidated damages in making him whole.if,as he argues,the remedial intent of the fmla is to make wronged employees whole,it is difficult to understand why a lower court can not consider the role of liquidated damages in reaching this overarching goal.other courts have allowed such a consideration,although some have cautioned that the award of liquidated damages should play only a minor role in determining whether front pay is appropriate.see,palasota haggar clothing,cir downes volkswagen of,cir.given the relatively short gap of two years that the court observed between dotson termination and his securing of roughly
