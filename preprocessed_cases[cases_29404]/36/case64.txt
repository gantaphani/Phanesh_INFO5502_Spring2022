this case comes before us following the district court entry of summary judgment adverse to richard hatch,and the court concomitant refusal to grant leave to amend.on appeal,hatch challenges only the latter ruling.concluding,as we do,that amendment would be futile because the qualified immunity of the prospective defendant would render nugatory the proposed amended complaint,we affirm.
background 
we divine the following account of the facts from the record below,drawing all reasonable inferences in the appellant favor.
in the spring of,the appellant inquired about adopting a child.two months later,he accepted an emergency placement of john doe,then age seven,at the behest of the rhode island department for children,youth and their families dcyf.while in the appellant custody,john exhibited serious behavioral and emotional problems stemming from past that the appellant alleges were known to dcyf at the time of the placement.in particular,john tended to be deceitful and to fly into tantrums often hurting himself during bouts of uncontrolled rage.despite these problems,the appellant adopted john in august of.
in the two years following his adoption,john demeanor improved,and the appellant attributes that improvement to his parenting skills.then came a chain of events that culminated in john temporary removal from the appellant custody.that chain was forged when the appellant left john with a friend for seven weeks to participate in the television show survivor.john gained weight during that interval and the appellant,upon his return,decided to institute a fitness regime.
the first step in this initiative occurred at on april,when the appellant directed john to accompany him on a run.during this excursion,john began to complain.the appellant responded by declaring that the length of the run would be extended.john then threw a tantrum and the appellant pulled back his arms and jacket to keep him from harming himself.at some point,john fell to the ground and bumped his forehead.after things had quieted down,the appellant took john to school.
at the start of class,john teacher noticed the bump and questioned john about its origins.john replied that he had fallen on cement.the teacher sent john to the school nurse,who applied an ice pack and inquired about the bump.john repeated the same story.the nurse also observed red marks across john neck and asked about those as well john told her that he had scraped himself during the run.although the nurse doubted this account,she sent the lad back to the classroom with the ice pack and instructions that he report to her at recess.
within the hour,john teacher also remarked the red marks on his neck.john told her that he had been scraped by branches during the run.the teacher and the nurse conferred later that morning,and the nurse indicated that she would telephone the appellant to secure his explanation of what had happened.for whatever reason,she did not make the call.
john returned to the nurse at noon with a very different version of the facts.he stated bluntly you saw all this stuff that happened to me,my father did it.when asked to amplify,he claimed that,during the run,he could not continue and fell to the pavement as his father pulled him by the earlobe.john further claimed that his father compelled him to do pushups by manipulating his neck and pushing his head into the cement surface.he added that he had been hit in the past and that he was afraid to return home.
alarmed by this account,the nurse took john to the principal office.john told the principal what he had told the nurse.the principal then sent john back to class,but telephoned dcyf and related the details of john statement.
dcyf assigned appellee steven brown,an investigator,to follow up on john allegations of abuse.brown called the school shortly before and spoke with the principal.she advised brown that the school was closing soon and expressed fear that the appellant might come for his son before dcyf had a chance to interview the boy.brown advised the principal to put matters in the hands of the local constabulary pending his brown arrival.
the principal followed this advice and called the police.the officers responded immediately.john again related his tale of abuse and the officers transported him to the middletown police station.brown arrived at the station at approximately.he intended to interview john there,but the boy complained of dizziness and headaches,so brown arranged for him to be taken to newport hospital.john told the rescue personnel essentially the same story that he had told to the nurse,the principal,and the police.the appellant appeared at the police station at about the same time as brown.he was unceremoniously arrested for felony child abuse.
meanwhile,brown had followed john to newport hospital.john was seen by an physician,altreuter,who found his injuries consistent with his tale of abuse.altreuter placed john under a physician hold pending the institution of proceedings before the family court.see laws a granting to physicians who encounter injuries consistent with abuse the right,without parental consent,to place an injured child on a hour hold pending an adjudicative hearing.the doctor then notified brown of his action and gave brown a copy of his report.brown immediately placed the child under the protective custody of dcyf 
brown proceeded to interview the boy,heard his account of abuse at first hand,and took photographs of his injuries.brown also learned of the appellant involvement in survivor,prompting him to call his supervisor,mary mckee,to warn her that this might prove to be a case.he then attempted to interview the before or after he repaired to the courthouse is not the appellant refused to speak with him on advice of counsel.at the close of his investigation,brown sought the aid of the family court,which issued an ex parte order of temporary custody.
john remained in dcyf custody pending a further adjudication.on may,the family court heard testimony and determined that there was no probable cause to believe that john had been abused.the court therefore concluded that returning home would not place john at risk,rescinded the order granting provisional custody to dcyf,and restored john to the appellant care.
the matter did not end there.on july,the appellant filed suit against dcyf in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.the complaint sought monetary damages under for,inter alia,dcyf alleged violation of the appellant constitutional rights to familial integrity and to freedom from undue interference in the care,custody,and control of his child.after the completion of pretrial discovery,dcyf moved for summary judgment on the ground that the eleventh amendment protects states and,therefore,state agencies from section liability.relying on the supreme court decision in will michigan department of state police,d,the district court granted this motion.
the appellant sought to resuscitate his action by moving to amend his complaint,essentially by substituting brown and mckee as parties defendant.the district court denied the motion to amend as futile,emphasizing that the doctrine of qualified immunity safeguarded the proposed defendants against liability for money damages.this timely appeal followed.in it,the appellant challenges only the district court denial of leave to file an amended complaint against brown.
ii.standard of review 
as a general rule,we will reverse a district court decision granting or denying a motion to amend a complaint only for abuse of discretion.see aoude mobil oil,cir.we view the court exercise of discretion in this area of the law through the prism of federal rule of civil procedure a,which indicates that leave to amend a complaint shall be freely given when justice so requires.in practice,this means that the denial of such a motion will be upheld so long as the record evinces an arguably adequate basis for the court decision,futility,bad faith,undue delay,or a dilatory motive on the movant part.grant news group boston,cir,cir.
here,the district court cited the first of these the linchpin of its ruling.in the abstract,futility is fully sufficient to justify the denial of a motion to amend.see,at where an amendment would be futile or would serve no legitimate purpose,the district court should not needlessly prolong matters.the question,then,is whether the circumstances of this case justify the court characterization.
before addressing this question,we pause to identify the yardstick by which futility is to be measured.the appropriateness vel non of a district court decision denying a motion to amend on the ground of futility depends,in the first instance,on the posture of the case.if leave to amend is sought before discovery is complete and neither party has moved for summary judgment,the accuracy of the futility label is gauged by reference to the liberal criteria of federal rule of civil procedure b.see glassman computervision,cir.in this situation,amendment is not deemed futile as long as the proposed amended complaint sets forth a general scenario which,if proven,would entitle the plaintiff to relief against the defendant on some cognizable theory.see rose hartford underwriters ins,cir explaining that,in such a posture,a proposed amendment is futile only if it could not withstand a b motion to dismiss.if,however,leave to amend is not sought until after discovery has closed and a summary judgment motion has been docketed,the proposed amendment must be not only theoretically viable but also solidly grounded in the record.resolution trust gold,cir.in that type of situation,an amendment is properly classified as futile unless the allegations of the proposed amended complaint are supported by substantial evidence.id.
in the case at hand,discovery had closed and dcyf had moved for summary judgment before the appellant filed his motion for leave to amend the complaint.since the appellant has had the full run of discovery and all the pertinent evidence is in the appellant does not suggest that additional discovery would reveal new facts sufficient to put the case in a different apply the more rigorous substantial evidence standard.
iii.analysis 
persons acting under color of state law are liable under for infringing on the constitutional rights of private parties.but this liability is not absolute the doctrine of qualified immunity provides a safe harbor for a wide range of mistaken judgments.see malley briggs,d explaining that qualified immunity provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.through this doctrine,the law strives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which,though unfounded,may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.buenrostro collazo,cir.
determining whether qualified immunity is available to a particular defendant at a particular time requires a trifurcated inquiry.we ask,first,whether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a constitutional right.if so,we then ask whether the contours of the right were sufficiently established at the time of the alleged violation.finally,we ask whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken or omitted violated that right.starlight sugar,soto,cir.we make these three inquiries in sequence,mindful that a single negative answer suffices to defeat the plaintiff claim for damages.id.
we start,as the supreme court has suggested,with the question of whether the appellant has alleged the violation of a constitutional right see wilson layne,d county of sacramento lewis,d.the appellant predicates his claim on what he visualizes as the right to familial integrity and,as a subset of that right,the parental interest in the care,custody,and control of children.
at a certain level of generality,this right is plainly of constitutional dimension.the interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their children is among the most venerable of the liberty interests embedded in the constitution.troxel granville,d.as such,it is protected by the due process clause.id.at.we must go further,however,because a right can not be stated at so high a level of generality for the purposes of a qualified immunity inquiry.see anderson creighton,d.
in this vein,the law recognizes that the protection afforded to the parents interest must be balanced against other valid interests,particularly the best interests of the child and the interest of society in the maturation of children as future citizens.see frazier bailey,cir.thus,the state may freely investigate allegations of child abuse,watterson page,cir,and if,as a result,it develops clear and convincing evidence of parental unfitness,it may move to terminate the relationship between parent and child.santosky kramer,d.as an interim measure,the state may separate the child from the parent,prior to a hearing,for cause shown see cecere city of new york,cir.
the appellant proposed amended complaint focuses on such a temporary custodial interruption brown decision to take john into state custody prior to obtaining a family court order.the court has not had occasion to formulate the contours of the constitutional rule under which a state official lawfully may take temporary custody of a child during an investigation of abuse or neglect,nor has this court dealt definitively with the issue.other courts have grappled with it,however,and most of them have concluded that a case use that term place a child in temporary custody when he has evidence giving rise to a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the child has been abused or is in imminent peril of abuse.see,brokaw mercer county,cir croft westmoreland county children youth,cir gottlieb county of orange,cir manzano dep t of soc,cir.the justification for such a rule is easily grasped where a state official has a reasonable basis to suspect abuse,the interest of the child as shared by the state as parens patriae in being removed from that home setting to a safe and neutral environment outweighs the parents private interest in familial integrity as a matter of law.thomason scan volunteer,cir.
the appellant argues that the constitution imposes a higher standard on the state.he would have us adopt the minority view,espoused on the appellate level only by one court,which requires that prior to assuming temporary custody,a case worker have reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury.wallis spencer,cir.this rule borders on an obligatory showing of probable cause or something fairly close to probable cause.equally as important,the ninth circuit has required case workers,as an adjunct to this showing,first to exhaust all reasonable avenues of investigation.id.
we think that this sets the bar too high,and that the majority rule better balances the competing interests of the child,the parents,and the state.because the welfare of the child is paramount,an objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse justifies protective measures.see lossman pekarske,cir when a child safety is threatened,that is justification enough for action first and hearing afterward.indeed,evidence of even a single instance of abuse may constitute an exigent circumstance sufficient to warrant immediate state action on a child behalf.see jordan jackson,cir holding that,in such circumstances,the interest in familial integrity may be infringed for a short time given the unthinkable consequence of a premature,erroneous return of a child to the custody of parents in whose custody the child life might be in imminent danger.
moreover,the government has a compelling interest in safeguarding children that it suspects are victims of abuse and in acting quickly on their behalf.we live in an era in which case workers operate under enormous pressure,confronted with the necessity of making judgments on the basis of limited and often conflicting information.circumstances frequently force them to make difficult choices without time for extensive investigation.when presented with evidence of apparent chi
