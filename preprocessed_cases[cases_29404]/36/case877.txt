in this dependency case welf,et victor father,has appealed from an order that denied his section petition and terminated his parental rights.father contends he was never given proper notice of certain hearings and therefore his section petition requesting that the trial court vacate orders from hearings dating back to the adjudication and disposition hearing should have been granted.he asserts that the court abused its discretion in not granting his petition and he has suffered prejudicial error because notice provisions in the dependency court statutes and penal code were not followed on his behalf.
we find that although there was a failure to follow certain notice provisions,the error was not prejudicial moreover,denial of father section petition was not an abuse of discretion.the order denying his section petition and terminating his parental rights will be affirmed.
background of the case 
a dependency petition was filed on november,by the los angeles county department of children and family services the department after the department was notified by personnel at a local hospital that mother had tested positive for amphetamine and marijuana when giving birth to baby michael baby michael.mother had two other children at the time,and marcos marcos.father asserts he is the biological father of marcos father was incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility when marcos was born.
although baby michael and were detained by the department on november,mother had not brought marcos to the department office by then.three days later she had no explanation for his whereabouts and so he was determined to be at large and a protective custody warrant was requested for him.
father whereabouts were also unknown by the department at that time.mother told the department case social worker that father was currently incarcerated,however she stated she did not know his birth date and did not know the address or phone numbers of any of father family members.the department detention report states that without father birth date the department was not able to submit a parent locater search for him.
the section petition filed by the department on behalf of marcos,and baby michael alleges that mother and her male companion michael have a history of domestic violence with a violent altercation as recent as november,the male companion michael has engaged in violence against his own mother mother has a history of illegal drug use and currently was using amphetamine and marijuana and used those drugs during her pregnancy with baby michael the male companion michael has a history of illegal drug and was currently using methamphetamine and these matters endanger the minors physical and emotional health and safety and place them at risk of such harm.the petition does not allege that father is an offending parent.
at the november,detention hearing the court made a proper notice finding,found that father is the alleged father of marcos and detained the three children in shelter care.no attorney was appointed for father at that time.the department was ordered to present evidence of due diligence in attempting to locate the fathers of the children by the next hearing.there is also an order that a county jail removal order be prepared for father,but there is no indication which of the fathers is meant 
a report for a december,investigation hearing on the minors adult family members who might be able to care for the children shows that two members of father family were interviewed,one on december,marcos aunt,and the other on december,marcos paternal grandmother and grandfather,with whom marcos had been living off and on since he was born,a fact not revealed to the department by mother.by that time marcos had been located and was in shelter care.thus,by at least the december,hearing the department had information regarding father relatives.the homes of the relatives were found not suitable for placing marcos with them.
the report for the january,pretrial resolution conference prc,signed by the social worker on january,shows that marcos and had been placed together in a foster home and baby michael in a separate foster home.the report states the concurrent plan for the minors was adoption.marcos paternal grandmother indicated she was no longer interested in having him placed in her home and he should remain in his current placement.father had been located and found to be incarcerated at a youth correctional facility in stockton.according to the report,the social worker tried to locate him at the correctional facility using the name he apparently goes by daniel but initially was unable to find him.with the assistance of the department of justice it was found that father legal name is victor daniel o.the report states the social worker sent a letter to father requesting that he contact her for an interview but as yet father had not made the contact.the report states the social worker submitted an in and out for father but there was insufficient time to process it and therefore father would not be transported to court.the social worker faxed a letter to father asking that he contact the social worker and that if he did not wish to attend the court hearing he sign a waiver of appearance.the social worker had yet to receive a waiver.she recommended that father receive no reunification services as the court had previously found him to be an alleged father.
a proof of service for father shows notice of the january prc hearing was served on him by certified or registered mail sent to the stockton juvenile correctional facility on january,and a copy of the dependency petition was attached to the notice.the notice advised father,among other things,that he had the right to be present at the hearing,present evidence,be represented by a court appointed attorney if he could not afford his own attorney,the hearing may proceed even if he is not there,and the court may determine if the allegations in the petition are true and declare the minors dependents and remove them from the custody of parents or guardians and make orders concerning placement,visitation and services.father was also advised by the notice who he could contact if he had questions,and that person phone number was provided.
the january,prc was continued to march,for proper notice to parents of the minors and for a further icwa report.notice of the march,hearing was sent to father on january,by certified or registered mail,with a copy of the petition attached.the notice contains the same advisements as given to him by the notice of hearing for the january,hearing.a post office receipt shows the mail was addressed to father at the stockton facility,was delivered on february,and was signed for by a kathy maldonado.the record contains a statewide tracking sheet for father dated march,that was issued in response to an order for prisoner appearance at hearing affecting prisoner parental rights,which the dependency court issued on january,for the march,hearing.that order is directed to the warden of the youth correctional facility and it orders the warden to deliver father to the custody of the los angeles county sheriff so that father could be transported to the dependency court for the march,hearing unless father executed the waiver of appearance or declined to execute the waiver but also declined to be transported to the hearing.the statewide tracking sheet states that the court order for father appearance at the march hearing was received by the statewide office and was being returned because there was insufficient time to pick up father prior to the hearing date,and father had been transferred to the ventura camp.a document in the appellate record refers to it as the ventura fire camp.however,a supplement report prepared for the march,hearing states that on march,the social worker made contact with the youth correctional facility in stockton and was told that father had been transported,for the hearing,to a correctional facility in chino.
father did not appear at the march,hearing.the department attorney indicated to the court his understanding that father was incarcerated beyond the time of reunification,observed that father had been found to be an alleged father only,and indicated that the department would not be offering him reunification services.however,the attorney noted that father has a right to be present at the hearing.the court indicated it did not see the necessity of having father brought in since he unnamed as a perpetrator in the dependency petition and an alleged father.the department attorney observed that father would be entitled to services if he comes in and establishes presumed fatherhood.
mother waived her rights and submitted on the matter.the court sustained the allegations in the dependency petition,adjudicated the minors dependent children of the court,ordered a case plan for mother and father michael,and ordered that reunification services would not be ordered for father pursuant to section,subdivision a and in re zacharia cal th,d,alleged father status.monitored visits for father,mother,and father michael were ordered,with the fathers visits to begin after they contacted the department.a copy of the march,minute order was sent to father at the stockton facility.
a status review hearing was set for september.notice was sent to father at the stockton facility.the proof of service states the notice was mailed on september,but it was apparently meant to say august,because it was signed on august.father did not appear for the hearing.the september hearing was continued to november,because the department had changed its recommendation regarding mother reunification services.
the november,status review report states that the persons caring for the three children marcos and at one foster home and baby michael at another home all reported an interest in adopting the children for whom they were caring,the children were well adjusted in their respective placements,and they were bonded with each other.further marcos and appeared to be very bonded with their caregiver and called her momma.mother turned years old on may.the department recommended that reunification services be terminated.
notice of the november,status review hearing was sent to father at the stockton facility on october.the notice states that the social worker was recommending that the court t erminate family reunification services for both parents.father did not appear at the hearing.the court minute order states father mother and sister were present in court.the department was ordered to them for possible placement of marcos and for taking marcos to visit with father,and the department was given discretion to allow such visits.marcos paternal grandmother and aunt were given unmonitored weekly visits within marcos caretaker schedule.
the status review hearing was continued to december.based on the paternal relatives criminal backgrounds,the department recommended that marcos not be placed with them and that they have monitored visits with the minor.they in turn,indicated they wanted to adopt the child.mother faxed the department a letter indicating that if the children are to be adopted she wanted their caregivers,not the paternal grandmother or aunt,to adopt them.at the december,hearing the court terminated the reunification services previously ordered for mother and father michael,ordered the department to initiate a home study,and set a section hearing for april.a copy of the december,minute order was sent to father at the stockton correctional facility on that same day.the record does not indicate that as of that date he had made any contact with the department or the court.
the department report for the april,section hearing shows that on february,father was personally served with notice of the hearing at his place of incarceration the ventura youth correctional facility in camarillo.he signed the notice of hearing and the proof of service the notice advised him the court would terminate parental rights and place the children for adoption or order a guardianship or some other placement,and advised him he had a right to attend the hearing and present evidence and a right to an appointed attorney if he could not afford an attorney.he was further advised that the social worker recommended termination of parental rights and adoption and he was provided with a copy of the social worker report.an order directing the warden or director of that facility to deliver father to the los angeles sheriff for transportation to the hearing is in the record but it is not signed by the court.father did not appear at the hearing.at that point in time he had never appeared at a hearing and never made contact with the department.the section hearing was continued to may.
marcos and continued to reside in the home of the foster parents who expressed an interested in adopting them and with whom they had been living since november.the children viewed the foster parents as their parents and were very attached to them and to their prospective adoptive siblings.the home study was in its final stages.

notice of the new hearing date august,was served on father by mail sent to both his camarillo address and his chino address on july.the home study for marcos and was approved.the record does not show that a removal order was made for father for august,and he did not appear on that day.the section was continued to october,because of the illness of one of the attorneys and the court made a removal order for father appearance for the new hearing date.the minute order indicates father was being detained in ventura at the youth correctional facility there.
father appeared in custody at the october,section hearing.his attorney had filed a section petition the previous day on his behalf.in the petition father asked that the court vacate prior proper notice findings as to him hold a disposition hearing for him,find him a presumed father,find he had made an appropriate plan for marcos,release marcos to him,and take the section hearing off calendar.father provided a second form jv form in which he asserted he has told his family and community that marcos is his child,the child paternal relatives had provided him with a home and necessities of life until marcos was detained and would like to provide him with a home again,and the relatives visit the minor weekly.the attorney indicated father would be released from correction in december before christmas.the section was continued to december,the date of the hearing on father section petition.the court indicated it would also address father presumed father status claim at that same time.a statewide removal order for him was ordered.
the department prepared a report for the december,hearing.it shows a criminal history for father,and marcos paternal grandparents.on december,the case was continued to december and again to february.father waived his appearance for the december and court hearings and was represented by his attorney at those hearings.
an in and out for father was ordered for the february,hearing.he was served by mail with notice of that hearing and the social worker report was attached to the notice.the notice was sent to a correctional facility in chino on december.a report from the department indicates that the inmate appearance request for father for the february,hearing was returned to the department because father had been paroled.the report states that neither father nor the paternal grandparents of marcos had contacted the department.none of the parents or alleged parents appeared for the february,section hearing and the matter was continued to march.father appeared for that march hearing and was granted twice weekly monitored visits with marcos.the case was continued to april,and father was ordered back for that hearing without further notice.nevertheless,notice was mailed to him at two different addresses on march.
reports from the department for the april,section hearing indicate the children were all reported to be doing well in their prospective adoptive homes and well bonded to their caregivers.mother and father michael were in agreement that their children should be adopted.father had not contacted the social worker.father mother told the social worker that father was in agreement that marcos prospective adoptive parents should adopt him because the child had made a parental bond with the caretaker family.father failed to appear on april,and his attorney requested a continuance to verify that father did wish to relinquish parental rights.the matter was continued to april,to permit the attorneys to contact the various parents and obtain their signatures on relinquishment forms.
father appeared at the april,hearing on the section issue and on his own section petition.argument was taken on his petition and it was denied.regarding the issue of permanent placement,father called his mother as a witness and he also testified.the paternal grandmother testified father visits with marcos began approximately five months prior to the hearing and he visits the child once a week for six to eight hours.the paternal grandmother stated she is always present during the visits.father plays with marcos,talks with him,and has sometimes fed him.
father testified he was released from the chino youth authority on december and he began visiting marcos right away.he stated the visits are monitored by the paternal grandparents and last eight hours.whereas the paternal grandmother does most of the feeding because she the one that cooks,he is there when marcos is eating and marcos is able to feed himself.he stated most of the time i play and stuff.he acknowledged that the paternal grandmother is the primary caretaker during the visits.marcos calls him danny,and father tells marcos on each visit that he is his father.he described the child as quiet and shy,and stated that marcos is shy to walk up and so he tries to talk to marcos to come to him.father stated his opposition to having his parental rights terminated.

contentions on appeal 
father contentions in this appeal concern notice requirements set out in the welfare and institutions code,the penal code,and the california rules of court.he asserts that lack of proper notice and failure to provide him with a court form wherein he could assert a presumed father status were prejudicial to his right to assert such status and required the dependency court to vacate the disposition order and subsequent orders regarding him and to take the section hearing off calendar.
discussion 
standard of review 
the essence of a section petition is the petitioner assertion that she or he can demonstrate,by a preponderance of the evidence,that new evidence or a change of circumstances exists warranting a finding that the best interests of the minor child will be served if a previous order of the court is changed,modified or set aside.the petition is addressed to the dependency court discretion and in an appeal from the order on the petition,the task of the reviewing court is to determine whether that discretion has been abused.in re jasmon cal th,d.
father asserts that the question whether it would be in marcos best interests to grant father petition is different in this case because father is not an offending parent that is,not alleged in the petition to be an offending parent and there was no compliance by the dependency court and the department with a penal code statute,nor with section and a corresponding rule in the california rules of court all discussed infra,which require that father be notified of his right to be present at the adjudication hearing to assert his paternity claim,and also require that he be served with form jv.father asserts that in such a case where there is an alleged procedural error,the reviewing court must examine the entire record and determine whether there has been a miscarriage of justice such that the failure to comply with a mandate can not be said to be a harmless error.in re jesusa cal th,d.
in examining this record,we find that the failure to provide father with notice of his right to change his status from alleged father to presumed father is a harmless error and we further find that it would not be in marcos best interest to set aside the disposition order so that father asserted presumed father status could be established and pursued.we make the same findings regarding the failure of the court to have father at the adjudication hearing.
statutes and rules regarding notice in dependency cases 
alleged fathers 
father was determined to be an alleged father at the detention hearing in november.there was no indication that marcos had ever lived with him.father name is not on the child birth certificate.only presumed fathers are parents entitled to reunification services.merely being a biological father is not sufficient.if a man has not legally married or attempted to legally marry the mother of his child,he can only be a presumed father if he has received the minor into his home and openly held the child out as his natural child.in re emily th,d.while a biological father is not entitled to custody under section at the disposition hearing,or reunification services under section if he does not attain presumed father status prior to the termination of any reunification period,he may move under section for a hearing to reconsider the juvenile court earlier rulings based on new evidence or changed circumstances to revive the reunification issue.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
section,subdivision b states that when a man is identified as an alleged father he is to be provided,at his usual place of abode by certified mail return receipt requested,with a notice that alleges that he is or could be the father of the minor child,and that states the child is the subject of proceedings under section and such proceedings could result in the termination of parental rights and adoption of the child.additionally,the notice shall include judicial council form jv paternity waiver of rights.form jv contains important information for an alleged father.among other things,it tells him that as an alleged father he will not receive reunification services and will not automatically get the child to live with you or your relatives.he is also told that he can have a trial on the issue of parentage and an attorney may be afforded him if he can not afford one for himself,and if he wants the court to decide if he is the minor parent he should fill out form jv.
california rules of court,rule a provides that juvenile courts have the duty to inquire about and attempt to determine the parentage of a child for whom a section petition has been filed.subdivision g of that rule provides that when an alleged parent is identified,the clerk must provide such person,at their last known address by certified mail return receipt requested,with a copy of the petition,notice of the next scheduled hearing,and form jv unless certain matters which are not relevant in the instant case have occurred.subdivision h of the rule states that when a person appears at a dependency hearing and requests a judgment of parentage on jv,the court must determine if that person is the minor biological parent,and if requested to do so determine if he is the child presumed parent.
thus,section,subdivision b and rule provide an alleged father with the notice and procedural means to attempt to change his paternity status.in re th,d.
general notice provisions 
certain statutes address service of notice on both alleged and presumed fathers.section,subdivision a provides for notice of the detention hearing when the address of alleged presumed fathers is known.here,father whereabouts were unknown at the time of the detention hearing.
section,subdivisions a and c provide that after the initial petition hearing,if the minor is detained as marcos was in this case,the notice of hearings to alleged and presumed fathers shall be given as soon as possible,and at least five days before the hearing,unless the hearing is set less than five days and then at least hours prior to the hearing.subdivision d of section sets out specific information that must be included in the notice and here,the appellate record shows that the department form notices include that information.notice of a hearing is important to an alleged father because it enables him to choose whether to appear at the hearing and assert a position on dependency matters,including establishing his paternal status.in re,supra,th at,d.
penal code section provides that when a proceeding is brought under the family code or under section to terminate the parental rights of a prisoner,or brought under section to adjudicate whether a child of a prisoner is a dependent child of the court,the court shall order notice of any court proceeding regarding the proceeding transmitted to the prisoner.service of notice shall be made pursuant to section or of the family code or section,or of the welfare and institutions code,as appropriate,subds.b c.these provisions encompass the jurisdictional hearing,which may precede the formal adjudication of the petition at the dispositional hearing,as well as the dispositional hearing.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,fn,d.subdivision a of section provides that the term prisoner includes persons who are wards of the department of the youth authority.
subdivision d of section provides that when the court receives a statement from a prisoner or his or her attorney that the prisoner wishes to be present during the court proceedings,the court shall issue an order for the temporary removal of the prisoner from the institution,and for the prisoner production before the court.no proceeding may be held under section and no petition to adjudge the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court pursuant to subdivision a,b,c,d,e,f,i or j of section may be adjudicated without the physical presence of the prisoner or the prisoner attorney,unless the court has before it a knowing waiver of the right of physical presence signed by the prisoner or an affidavit signed by the warden,superintendent,or other person in charge of the institution,or his or her designated representative stating that the prisoner has,by express statement or action,indicated an intent not to appear at the proceeding.italics added.in in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d,based on the legislative history of section,the court held that the word or in subdivision d that we have italicized must be read to mean and,and must be read to mean that both the prisoner and his or her attorney must be present at the hearing at which the dependency petition is adjudicated.additionally,the court observed that by requiring that the prisoner be present or waive his or her own presence,the trial court can be sure that the prisoner actually received the notice required by subdivision b of section.id.at,d.
however,the jesusa court stated that when the terms of the statute requiring the presence of both the prisoner and counsel are not met,the reviewing court will apply a harmless of justice analysis to determine whether the prisoner was prejudiced by his involuntary absence at the adjudication hearing.the court rejected the argument that a dependency court acts in excess of its jurisdiction,and thus has no power to hold an adjudication hearing,when it conducts the adjudication hearing without having both the prisoner and the attorney present.the court also observed that the interest and goal of resolving dependency matters expeditiously would be thwarted if the proceeding had to be redone without any showing the new proceeding would have a different outcome.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.a challenge on due process grounds was also rejected.id.at,d.the court held that prisoners do not have a constitutional right to be present at every type of hearing and what due process guarantees is notice and an opportunity for hearing that is appropriate to the nature of a case.there can be meaningful access to a court through appointed counsel where the prisoner is given an opportunity to present testimony in some form and witnesses.id.at,d.here,of course,father was not present at the adjudication hearing and there was no appointed counsel for father at that time.
subdivision e of section provides that i n any other action or proceeding in which a prisoner parental rights are subject to adjudication,an order for the prisoner temporary removal from the institution and for the prisoner production before the court may be made by the superior court a copy of the order shall be transmitted to the warden,superintendent,or other person in charge of the institution not less than days before the order is to be executed.italics added.thus,only in proceedings to adjudicate a child of a prisoner a dependent of the juvenile court or to terminate parental rights must a court order production of a prisoner for the hearing.for all other proceedings,the trial court has discretion whether to order removal of a.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.
additional matters regarding notice 
f or purposes of due process,actual notice does not require actual receipt or actual knowledge notice by mail or other means reasonable calculated to provide actual notice is sufficient.in re emily,supra,th at,d.
with respect to the notice requirements of california dependency statutes,although section,subdivision e requires either personal service or service by mail,return receipt requested if the minor is detained and the person to be served was not at the initial petition hearing,there is no requirement in that provision that the social services agency receive a return receipt signed by the parent.lack of a signed return receipt is not proof that a parent did not receive a notice evidence code section provides a presumption that letters that are correctly addressed and properly mailed have been received in the ordinary course of mail.in re th,d.however,the law is otherwise regarding section hearings.the notice provisions in section regarding notice of section hearings require that when service is by certified mail,return receipt requested,the social services agency must receive the return receipt signed by the parent.in re,at,d.
when there is no attempt to serve a parent with notice the error is reversible per se when there is error in a notice the question is whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.in re,supra,th,d.
father contentions 
a.the department non compliance with section 
father contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his section petition asking that the disposition hearing and subsequent hearings be set aside and the section hearing be taken off calendar.he contends he was not properly noticed of hearings,was not provided with transportation to hearings,and was not provided with notice of his right to be present to assert his paternity claim.
regarding paternity claims,as noted above,section,subdivision b states that when a man is identified as an alleged father he is to be provided,at his usual place of abode by certified mail return receipt requested,with a notice that alleges that he is or could be the father of the minor child,and that states the child is the subject of proceedings under section and such proceedings could result in the termination of parental rights and adoption of the child.addition
