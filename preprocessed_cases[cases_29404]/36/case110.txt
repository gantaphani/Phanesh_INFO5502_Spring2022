introduction 
tina phifer phifer appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,dismissing her federal claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the doctrine.phifer filed the instant civil rights action under and on behalf of herself and her minor daughter amkia,alleging that the defendants violated their constitutional rights when they removed amkia from phifer custody and deprived phifer of the custody of her daughter for over two years.we agree with the district court that the doctrine bars any challenge by the plaintiff to the state court rulings regarding neglect,custody and visitation.we further find that bars the plaintiff claim of racial discrimination by certain defendants during the pendency of the family court proceedings.however,phifer claim that the initial decision by the medical defendants and the new york city administration for children services acs to remove amkia from her mother custody,made during the august to september,time period,was motivated by racism is not barred by.as for the other claims stemming from amkia stay at defendant the montefiore medical center montefiore or the hospital from august to september,we find that phifer substantive due process claim and amkia fourth amendment claim are barred by,but that phifer and amkia procedural due process claims are not precluded.finally,we conclude that does not bar amkia substantive due process claim based on allegations that she was mistreated while in the custody of defendants acs and the children aid society cas.we therefore affirm the district court judgment in part,reverse the judgment in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
amkia was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis,a serious,chronic and disease,in november of,when she was eight years old.on august,phifer took amkia to see edward nichols,amkia primary care physician,and explained that amkia had experienced blood in her stool and was fatigued.a blood test indicated that amkia was severely anemic.on august,nichols advised phifer that amkia was in urgent need of a blood transfusion and that phifer should take amkia to the emergency room to be admitted for an immediate blood transfusion.phifer took amkia to montefiore that evening,at which time it was determined that amkia hemocrit level had dropped to a dangerously low level.amkia received a blood transfusion that night.thereafter,a disagreement arose as to how amkia care should proceed.according to phifer,amkia was out of danger and not in any imminent risk of harm shortly after the blood transfusion.phifer alleges that the medical defendants,including defendants dyan hes,paul levy,and william spivak,began blaming her for amkia medical condition and insisting that amkia was in imminent danger in order to cover up nichols alleged malpractice or because of racist assumptions that because plaintiff was of decent sic she was not qualified to make reasonable parental decisions about recommendations for treatment pl.compl.
phifer alleges that amkia condition continued to deteriorate while in the care of the medical defendants.phifer further alleges that when she sought to have amkia discharged from montefiore on august,hospital security guards were placed outside amkia hospital room and in front of the elevators on that floor.according to the plaintiff,defendant beth yurdin,a hospital social worker,told phifer she could not leave the hospital with amkia and filed a report of suspected child mistreatment with acs on august,stating that the plaintiff had attempted to leave the hospital with amkia and was preventing amkia from receiving necessary medical attention for her ulcerative colitis.
over the next several days,the hospital staff refused to allow phifer to take amkia from the hospital and threatened to call a child protective agency in order to obtain plaintiff consent to additional medical procedures.on september,after amkia parents would not consent to further medical procedures,yurdin made a second report to acs,stating that the plaintiff was attempting to remove amkia from the hospital.on september,defendant delano saunders,a caseworker for acs,filed a petition in the bronx county family court alleging that amkia was in imminent danger and that phifer was neglecting amkia medical condition.on this same day,the family court granted temporary custody of amkia to acs so she could receive the necessary medical treatment.during the next two months,amkia received medical treatment at montefiore.upon release from the hospital,amkia was placed with her maternal grandparents under the supervision of acs.
the neglect case against phifer proceeded in family court.at a november,hearing,the family court judge found that phifer had engaged in r epeated bizarre statements and behavior,ordered a competency evaluation of phifer,and adjourned the case until february for fact finding.tr.of,hr g at.amkia was readmitted to montefiore in february of due to a deterioration in her condition,and she remained in the hospital until april.on february,the court heard acs request that amkia be returned to acs custody because amkia condition had deteriorated while under her grandparents care.upon discharge from montefiore,amkia was placed in foster care through cas.
in march and april of,the family court held evidentiary hearings pursuant to phifer application under section of the family court act for the return of amkia to her custody.after three days of testimony,the family court denied phifer request for custody,concluding that amkia would be in imminent risk to her health and life if she were returned to her mother.on august,phifer petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus for the return of amkia.this motion was also denied.on september,acs moved to suspend phifer visitation with amkia.the family court judge issued an order of protection ordering phifer to stay away from amkia and her foster mother,but urged the parties to reach a resolution on the issue of visitation.on september,phifer submitted an order to show cause seeking a variety of relief,which was denied.at some point thereafter,visits between amkia and her mother resumed.
on april,the state supreme court dismissed a second petition by phifer for a writ of habeas corpus for the custody of amkia and remanded the petition to family court.the family court denied the order to show cause and petition for a writ of habeas corpus on april.the court stated that t here is no doubt whatsoever in this court mind that anthea sic is lawfully in the custody of the administration for children services.tr.of,hr g at.the court stated that amkia was removed by acs from her mother in a lawful manner and that the court previously had an opportunity to review the continued lawfulness of that custody during the section hearing,which resulted in a conclusion that amkia would be in imminent risk to her health and life if she were returned to her mother.the court also denied phifer order to show cause,noting that the court had no bias against phifer and that the delays in the case were caused in large part by phifer and her several attorneys.the court also rejected phifer accusations of racism against those involved in the proceedings.
fact finding in the neglect case against phifer continued.on november,the family court judge rendered his final decision and concluded that acs met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that amkia parents neglected her.the court found that phifer neglected amkia from december to approximately august,by failing to provide amkia with adequate medical care despite knowing that amkia was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in november of,and that this failure resulted in the impairment of amkia physical condition.furthermore,the court found that from the time amkia was hospitalized at the montefiore medical center on august,until the petition was filed on september,phifer interfered with the medical treatment provided by amkia doctors and this interference placed amkia physical condition in imminent danger.
phifer began the instant civil rights action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on june.her complaint alleges violations of the first,fourth,fifth,ninth,and fourteenth amendments of the constitution,as well as state law claims for medical malpractice,lack of informed consent,and breach of contract the district court dismissed the plaintiff request for injunctive relief on september,pursuant to the younger doctrine.phifer city of new york,civ,wl,at,phifer i.after further briefing,the district court dismissed the plaintiff claims for damages,holding that the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims pursuant to the doctrine.phifer city of new york,civ,wl,at,phifer ii.the court found that all of the plaintiff claims were inextricably intertwined with the various state court decisions related to the neglect proceedings against phifer and that her claims could not be heard without a review of the rulings of the family court.id.because it dismissed under,the court did not reach whether dismissal was warranted on alternative grounds raised by the defendants.see also phifer i,wl,at referring to defendants argument that phifer claim for money damages should be dismissed for failure to state a claim or under the immunity provisions of the child protective services act.amkia was returned to her mother custody in january of after phifer complied with a number of requirements established for amkia care.
discussion 
a challenge under the doctrine is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.moccio new york state office of court,cir.we review de novo a district court determination that,as a matter of law,it lacks jurisdiction over the case.rivers mcleod,cir per curiam moccio,at.because the defendants challenge is to subject matter jurisdiction,we may consider materials extrinsic to the complaint.united states vazquez,cir.a plaintiff asserting subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it exists.makarova united states,cir.
this appeal requires that we determine whether the doctrine bars the lower federal courts from reviewing the plaintiff constitutional claims.we do not examine here the merits of those claims.the doctrine holds that inferior federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of state courts and that federal review,if any,can occur only by way of a certiorari petition to the supreme court.moccio,at.in rooker fidelity trust company,the supreme court explained that the jurisdiction of the district courts is strictly original and no federal court,other than the supreme court,can consider a claim to reverse or modify a state court judgment.in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,the supreme court expanded upon this principle and held that to the extent that the plaintiff claims before the district court were inextricably intertwined with the state court determinations,the district court did not have jurisdiction to entertain those claims.id.at.
our circuit has noted that the supreme court has provided little guidance in determining when claims are inextricably intertwined with a prior state court judgment and that this lack of guidance has resulted in inconsistency in the lower federal courts.moccio,at.we have held that i f the precise claims raised in a state court proceeding are raised in the subsequent federal proceeding,plainly will bar the action.on the other hand,where the claims were never presented in the state court proceedings and the plaintiff did not have an opportunity to present the claims in those proceedings,the claims are not inextricably intertwined and therefore not barred by.id.at.
the moccio court recognized that not all cases fall neatly into one of these extremes.id.at.to address situations that fall between these two poles,moccio articulated the following definition inextricably intertwined means,at a minimum,that where a federal plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate a claim in a state proceeding,subsequent litigation of the claim will be barred under the doctrine if it would be barred under the principles of preclusion.id.at citing pennzoil texaco,d marshall,concurring t he federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the judgment if the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.see also rivers,at quoting moccio for the definition of inextricably intertwined.thus,the court must consider two categories of preclusion res judicata and collateral estoppel.moccio,at people united for children,city of new york,d.while res judicata does not bar the plaintiff section claims in the instant case as the family court does not have the power to award monetary damages,id.at see also fay colonie cent.sch,cir holding that plaintiff was not barred from pursuing his section claims for damages because the article court was without power to award monetary damages,collateral estoppel can be applied to the plaintiff section claims to determine whether they are barred by,moccio,at people united for children,d at.
under new york law,collateral estoppel will apply only if the issue in question was actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding,and the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding.moccio,at citation and internal quotations marks omitted.the court in moccio applied the collateral estoppel test to the plaintiff section claims and found that barred all of the plaintiff causes of action because the issues raised by the plaintiff in his federal action challenging his termination were previously decided by the state court in his article proceeding.id.at.
two years after deciding moccio,the second circuit considered whether the doctrine extends beyond preclusionary rules.hachamovitch debuono,cir holding that did not bar jurisdiction over due process challenge to the unavailability of any procedure for reopening a concluded physician disciplinary proceeding.the court in hachamovitch noted that since feldman,the supreme court has cautioned the courts against categorical diminution via doctrines of the power granted to the federal courts by congress and concluded that we are disinclined at present to extend or amplify the doctrine beyond the minimum specified in moccio,absent circumstances not presented by this case.id.at.the court left open the possibility that a case might arise that would directly challenge a state court judgment in a way that the supreme court clearly envisioned would be barred by and yet for some reason not be precluded.id.at.we do not think this is such a case,and thus we apply the collateral estoppel elements to the plaintiff claims.
plaintiff claims directly attacking the family court decisions regarding custody,neglect,and visitation are barred by 
this court may not review the family court determinations regarding custody,neglect and visitation,as those issues were decided by the family court after providing phifer a full and fair opportunity to litigate those issues.see moccio,at stating that inferior federal courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of the state courts.during the course of the family court proceedings,the family court found,inter alia,that phifer had neglected her daughter medical condition from december of to august,this neglect resulted in the impairment of amkia health phifer interfered with the doctors attempts to provide amkia with necessary medical care during her initial stay at montefiore from august,to september,this interference placed amkia in imminent danger amkia was properly in acs custody and amkia would be in imminent risk to her health and life if she were returned to her mother.the family court also made determinations as to phifer visitation rights and at one point ordered phifer to stay away from amkia and her foster parents.phifer nevertheless directly attacks the family court findings regarding custody,neglect,and visitation in her complaint.phifer request for an order from the district court directing acs to return amkia to her custody illustrates that her complaint is an attempt to obtain relief from the federal court that she has been denied in the state court proceedings.there is no question that bars phifer challenges to the family court decisions regarding custody,neglect,and visitation.
next,we must determine whether phifer other claims are inextricably intertwined with the issues decided by the family court and thus also barred by.see moccio,at.
plaintiff claims of racial discrimination 
phifer asserts claims of racial discrimination under the fourteenth amendment against the medical defendants and the city defendants.the defendants counter that phifer claims of racial discrimination are barred by the doctrine because they were considered and rejected by the family court.the record shows that the family court judge made the following statement at an april,hearing on phifer motion for an order to show cause and motion for a writ of habeas corpus 
i also should note that i am troubled by the baseless and meritless contentions by both benjamin and phifer in their present papers,that phifer is being treated in the manner she claims that she being treated,because they great inaudible 
both benjamin and phifer made some representations,on information and belief.notably,however,the source of such information and the basis for any such beliefs are nowhere stated in these papers.and that is entirely understandable because,in fact,in this courtroom,nobody associated with these proceedings has attempted to or has treated phifer and amkia in the manner claimed by phifer.
i think the allegations are hurtful.they are untrue.they serve no useful purpose.and i am sorry,that,in fact,they were raised.because there is no truth whatsoever to them.
tr.of,hr g at.to the extent that phifer alleges in her complaint that certain defendants who were associated with amkia case in the family court were motivated by racism in their recommendations,representations,or requests to the family court,we find that bars these claims.the family court rejected phifer claims of racism,and thus this question was actually and necessarily decided by a prior court.moccio,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.phifer has not met her burden of proving that the family court did not provide a full and fair opportunity to litigate this issue.see id.at.the court considered phifer papers on this issue and also had the benefit of having previously conducted a hearing on phifer request for custody of amkia,at which the time the court was able to assess the credibility of several witnesses involved in amkia case.
however,it does not appear,based on the record before us,that the family court considered whether the initial decision by the medical defendants and acs to remove amkia from her mother custody,made during the august to september,time period,was motivated,at least in part,by racism.phifer alleges that the city has a policy that presumes that parents are unfit and that children of parents are taken into custody without the time,effort,and resources that would be utilized in an investigation alleging the same type of neglect or abuse when committed by a white parent.pl.compl.as to the medical defendants,phifer alleges that they determined that phifer was not able to make decisions about her daughter care based on racist assumptions and that these assumptions led the medical defendants to contact acs.because the family court did not,as far as we know,actually and necessarily decide the issue of whether the decision to remove amkia was motivated by racism,would not bar this claim.see moccio,at citation and internal quotations marks omitted see also ernst child and youth servs.of chester county,cir.finding that plaintiff claim that defendants violated her right to substantive due process by making recommendations to the state court out of malice and personal bias were not barred by as plaintiff did not articulate those concerns in constitutional due process terms in the state court and plaintiff substantive due process rights were never decided by the state court,cert.denied,d.
at first blush,such a determination that does not bar claims of racial discrimination with regard to the initial decision to remove amkia might seem inconsistent with our conclusion that the family court rejected phifer claims of racism in the defendant recommendations,representations or requests to the family court.however dubious the claims might appear with regard to the initial decision to remove in light of the family court determination with respect to the proceedings,we can not find at this stage that bars those claims.first,as far as we can discern,the family court statements were directed only at those participating in the court proceeding itself such individuals may have been different from those involved in the initial decision to remove amkia.second,the initial decision to remove was made nineteen months before the proceeding at which the family court actually and necessarily decided the specific question as to whether those participating in those hearings were motivated by racism.although one might be skeptical about the claims of racial discrimination regarding the initial decision to remove amkia,cautions that at this point we can not bar them when they have not been actually and necessarily decided by a prior court.rather,we are constrained to leave to the district court the task of further evaluating those claims 
we note that even if the district court were to find that phifer claim has is,that the medical defendants and acs suspected phifer of neglect more readily because of her race and removed amkia more hastily than they would have if phifer were decision would not call into question the family court decisions regarding neglect,custody and visitation as those decisions are based on the parents conduct,the harm to the child,and what is in the best interest of the child.see ernst,at neither an adjudication of dependency nor a determination of the appropriate disposition of a dependent child is based on the intentions or states of mind of the party seeking the dependency adjudication.see generally fam.e,f defining abused child and neglected child friederwitzer friederwitzer,discussing a child best interest in re christopher jj,dep t discussing neglect standard.logically,the fact that the family court found that the accusations of neglect were true does not necessarily mean that the defendants initial suspicions were not colored by racism.indeed,in order to succeed on her equal protection claim,phifer need not show that the medical defendants or city defendants were motivated solely,primarily,or even predominantly by race.people united for children,d at citing united states yonkers bd.of,cir,cert.denied,d.in other words,this would not be a case in which the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.pennzoil texaco,d marshall,concurring offering a definition of inextricably intertwined 
the fourth amendment,procedural due process,and substantive due process claims arising from amkia initial stay at the montefiore medical center 
phifer claims that the medical defendants violated her substantive and procedural due process rights,as well as amkia fourth amendment and procedural due process rights,by detaining amkia in the hospital from august,until september,without any probable cause that either mother or daughter had committed a crime or that the infant was in any imminent danger of harm pl.compl.phifer alleges that on august,two weeks before the family court september,order temporarily placing amkia in acs custody,the plaintiff sought to have amkia discharged,but that security guards were placed outside amkia room and she was de facto imprison ed.id.as a result of these events and other events,phifer asserts that she and amkia were denied their constitutional rights of privacy,association,due process and her rights.id.
we find that bars phifer substantive due process claim,as well as amkia fourth amendment claim.in considering a substantive due process claim in this case,the federal court would have to determine whether the hospital acted with a reasonable basis when it refused to allow phife
