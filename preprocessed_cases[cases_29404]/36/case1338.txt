appellant richard wilcox appeals the trial court order denying his motion to vacate the renewal of a judgment entered against him in favor of his former wife,carol wilcox.richard contends the trial court erred in ruling the judgment did not constitute a judgment for the possession or sale of property under the meaning of family code section,which would have subjected it to the renewal requirement of section of the code of civil procedure we conclude appellant contentions are without merit and accordingly affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
richard and carol wilcox divorced in.on june,the trial court,in its attachment to findings and order after hearing,entered a judgment against richard and in favor of carol for a total of.the attachment read in part 
judgment is hereby entered in favor of petitioner,carol wilcox,and against respondent,richard wilcox,in the sum of.this judgment results from respondent default on the payments on the principal obligation referred to in the addendum to judgment of dissolution of marriage.
judgment is hereby entered in favor of petitioner,carol wilcox,and against respondent,richard wilcox,in the sum of.this judgment results from respondent default on the payments required of him under the obligation referred to in the addendum,as specifically defined in paragraph of the pmsa.
on november,the court entered a second judgment against richard.however,the parties disagree as to the nature of this order.carol contends that the november order amended the june order and added to it an additional,for child support,spousal support,attorney fees,costs and interest.richard agrees this was the amount of,and reason for,the november order,but contends it was a new order and did not amend or modify the june order.it should be noted that the november order is not included in the appellate record.despite this,both parties mention both its form and content throughout their appellate briefs.while richard makes no citation to the record in this respect,carol merely cites to a fictitious exhibit.
ten years passed and richard still had not satisfied the judgment.on august,carol filed an application for renewal of her original judgment under section.on the renewal form,carol listed she was renewing the court order entered on june,as amended november.carol renewal was granted on august,for a total of.this amount included for the june and november orders,plus an additional for interest and filing fees.carol renewal was filed more than years from the date of entry of the june order,but less then years from the date of entry of the november order.
shortly thereafter,richard filed a motion to vacate renewal of judgment with the trial court.in his points and authorities richard argued carol renewed money judgment should be vacated under sections and because it was filed more than years after entry of the june order and therefore should not have been renewed by the clerk.
carol responded by arguing that section specifically excludes family code judgments from the time limit for renewal under section and therefore renewal was proper.
in his reply papers in the trial court,richard argued for the first time that carol june order was not a money judgment,but rather a judgment for the possession or sale of property under the meaning of family code section and thus subject to the time limit for renewal under section.richard further asserted that the november order did not amend the june order but rather merely granted several new awards for interest,attorney fees,and support.
the trial court denied richard motion ruling that family code section is specifically limited to judgments for the sale or possession of property,and therefore,because the june order is a family code money judgment,it is not subject to the time limit for renewal under section.because the trial court ruled the june order was not subject to the time limit for renewal under section,it did not determine the nature of the november order.
discussion 
icarol procedural contentions 
carol challenges richard appeal on the grounds that the trial court order is not an appealable final judgment,and that she was not timely served.both contentions are frivolous,and in the interests of clarity and economy they are disposed of quickly at the outset before discussion of the substantive issues.
a postjudgment order,such as the one here,which affects the judgment in some way or relates to its enforcement,is appealable so long as the appeal involves issues other than those decided by the judgment,subd.a see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
additionally,richard appeal was both timely and properly filed the court entered its order denying richard motion to vacate the judgment on january,and richard promptly filed his notice of appeal with the superior court on february,
richard substantive contentions 
on appeal richard contends that the trial court erred in ruling the june order was a family code money judgment exempt from the time limit for renewal under section,and that because the november order did not amend the june order,carol august renewal was untimely with respect to the june order.
at the outset it should be mentioned that richard had a duty to provide this court with an adequate record on appeal.calhoun hildebrandt d.however,in this task,richard has woefully failed.richard has failed to provide this court with,among other things,the november order,the addendum to judgment of dissolution of marriage,and the marital settlement agreement.despite this,richard argues how their content affected the trial court decision to deny his motion to vacate renewal of judgment.although we chose to analyze the case with the materials provided to us,the inadequacy of the record alone provides a basis to dismiss richard appeal.
character of the june order 
richard argues the june order resulted from his failure to timely make community property equalization payments,and thus the judgment is for the possession of property under the meaning of family code section.neither the law nor the facts support richard position.to begin with,nothing in the record includes a single instance where the trial court determined,or even stated,the june order was premised on richard failure to make community property equalization payments.richard claims this was implied in one of the trial court statements during the hearing richard further suggests that if we are unconvinced by the court single statement we should review the trial court records for ourselves and confirm that the judgment stemmed from his failure to make community property equalization payments.we decline richard invitation to independently acquire the records of the trial court.richard had adequate time to compile a complete record for appeal and we will not take it upon ourselves to fulfill his responsibilities 
section defines a money judgment as that part of a judgment that requires the payment of money.the june order which is all we have to base our decision on ordered richard to pay carol and,respectively.it is therefore unequivocally a money judgment.
interpretation of family code section 
the issue thus becomes whether family code section subjects family code money judgments to the time limit for renewal under section.we conclude it does not.
interpretation of a statute entails the resolution of a pure question of law which we review de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of a particular law.of course our first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.when the words are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.noel river hills wilsons,th,d,quoting national technical systems commercial contractors,th,d.
the plain language of family code section leaves no doubt that the legislature did not intend to subject family code money judgments to the time limit for renewal under section.
