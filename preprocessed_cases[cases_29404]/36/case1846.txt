background 
the record reveals that on november,the department of children and family services dcfs took protective custody of respondent four children and filed petitions for adjudication of wardship,alleging that the children were neglected and were exposed to an injurious environment pursuant to section of the juvenile court act of,ch,par.following an adjudicatory hearing,the trial court found that twins aiesha and felicia were neglected and had been exposed to a controlled substance at the time of their births through respondent drug usage,ch,par.c.the court further found that india and dell had been neglected and exposed to an injurious environment by respondent,ch,par.b.on june,the children were adjudged wards of the court,and dcfs was appointed guardian with the right to place the children.over the next five years,respondent progress toward reunification with her children was largely unsatisfactory.
on august,the state filed petitions seeking to terminate respondent parental rights and to appoint a guardian with the right to consent to the adoption of the children.the petitions alleged,inter alia,that respondent had abandoned the children had failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern or responsibility for them and had failed to make reasonable efforts or progress to correct the conditions which caused their removal.
the state termination petitions were set for a hearing to be held on may.to secure respondent presence and testimony at the scheduled hearing,both the state and the public guardian served respondent with a notice to appear pursuant to supreme court rule b b.the notices warned that respondent would be subject to sanctions under supreme court rule c c if she failed to appear for the hearing.
on may,the hearing was continued by agreement of the parties until july,at.the court specifically continued to july,all subpoenas and all notices to appear for the hearing.respondent and her attorney were present in court on may,and neither of them objected to the continuation of the notices to appear.
on july,respondent failed to appear for the termination hearing.respondent public defender told the trial court that he had not had any contact with respondent and had not received any information about her whereabouts.the state and the guardian ad litem informed the court that they were ready for trial,but respondent counsel stated that he was not ready for trial.the trial court passed the case to allow the public defender to contact respondent.when the case was recalled,respondent was still not present.the public defender stated that he could not reach respondent and that he had not received any messages from her.
the trial court then granted the state and the guardian ad litem requests for sanctions pursuant to rule c for respondent failure to appear.in rejecting respondent counsel request for imposition of one of the lesser sanctions available under rule c,the court stated the following 
the notice was not only prepared,but so that she may be called as a witness by the state and the gal in their cases,the public defender has had no contact from respondent.she left no messages regarding any emergencies,regarding any explanations why she is not here today the matter was set for trial at.the notice to appear was for.the record will reflect that the case was originally called at approximately passed.it was recalled at.it is now in the afternoon,respondent is still not in court,nor has she left any messages for her attorney requesting a continuance on her behalf or explaining her absence today.
i therefore find that the matter be scheduled for trial,respondent having full notice that today was the day for trial,and not being here in court in response to the motion and the notice.the state and the gal requests for sanctions under will be granted.all sanctions requested will be granted.the mother will be barred from presenting any further pleadings.she will be barred from presenting her defense.she will be barred from testifying,and she will be placed in default.
the trial court then required the state and the guardian ad litem to present stipulated evidence of respondent unfitness.respondent counsel made no objection to the evidence stipulated to by the state and the guardian ad litem.the evidence presented showed that respondent was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in november because she was suicidal and was suffering from major depression.she had had two previous admissions before this time.after leaving the hospital on december,respondent was again admitted to the hospital on december.at that time,she exhibited major depression,abuse,and suicidal and homicidal ideations.
yvette harris,a dcfs caseworker,established a service plan for the respondent on november.harris social investigation revealed that the respondent had been using cocaine since.the service plan required respondent to complete a drug and alcohol evaluation,sign releases of information,cooperate with recommendations,submit to random urine drops for drug testing,participate in psychological counseling to learn alternative ways of dealing with stress,and participate in weekly visitation.
respondent was released from the psychiatric hospital on december.on march,a psychological evaluation was performed on respondent,concluding that she was not emotionally or intellectually capable of caring for her children.the evaluation further revealed that respondent had impulsivity and anger toward others and had a borderline psychotic functioning.
after the trial court adjudged respondent children wards of the court and found that she was unable to parent her children,respondent began a counseling program at mercy hospital in july.her attendance,however,was inconsistent over the next year and a half.
on february,the trial court found that respondent had not made reasonable progress toward the return of her children.although she was involved in some services,she had not obtained stable housing,had not completed drug treatment,and had not completed counseling to address her mental health issues.
a dcfs case report from september revealed that the respondent was not involved in services and was not visiting her children.the dcfs caseworker attempted to contact respondent,but respondent phone had been disconnected.from august until november,respondent was allowed to have weekly visits with her children,but during that time,she visited them only once every three or four months.
in may,respondent received an unsatisfactory rating from her caseworker for failing to visit her children,failing to obtain stable housing,and failing to participate in services.at this time,the trial court admonished respondent that if she did not regularly visit her children and complete reunification services,the permanency goal of returning the children to her would be changed.
respondent failed to appear for a july urine test,and her urine tests in august and october of yielded positive results for the presence of controlled substances.in december,respondent admitted to her dcfs caseworker that she had a problem with drugs.as of january,respondent had not enrolled in a plan despite three referrals from her caseworker.
the april service plan rated defendant progress as unsatisfactory because she failed to visit her children or engage in services.on may,the court changed the permanency goal to foster care.
in august,respondent completed a bonding assessment with her children.the examiner at the bonding assessment observed that respondent paid little attention to the behavior of the children and made few efforts to redirect them.the examiner concluded that a close bond had not formed between respondent and the children.case reviews in november,may,and november continued to rate respondent progress as unsatisfactory because respondent was not visiting the children regularly and had not completed counseling or drug treatment.
after hearing the stipulated evidence,the trial court found that,based on clear and convincing evidence,respondent was unfit because she failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern,or responsibility as to her children and failed to make reasonable efforts and progress towards the return of the children.the case then proceeded to the best interest portion of the hearing.
the state and guardian ad litem stipulated to the testimony of two dcfs caseworkers who would have testified that the children had been in their current foster homes for a number of years,those homes were safe and appropriate,and the foster parents wished to adopt the children.both caseworkers would further testify that it would be in the children best interest to terminate respondent parental rights.finally,both caseworkers were called at the hearing to testify before the trial court that the stipulated evidence was a true and accurate characterization of their testimonies.
the trial court then granted the state petition to terminate respondent parental rights additionally,the court appointed jean,the dcfs guardianship administrator,as guardian of all four children with the right to consent to each child adoption.
thereafter,respondent never sought an order to stay the enforcement of the july,order terminating her parental rights and appointing a guardian to consent to the adoption of the children.instead,respondent filed a motion on august,to vacate the default judgment.that motion was denied on september,following a hearing.at the hearing on the motion to vacate the default judgment,respondent did not testify and did not present any witnesses.additionally,respondent did not offer any explanation for her failure to appear at the hearing on july.in denying respondent motion to vacate,the trial court stated 
o n the four corners of the motion itself,there is no explanation as for respondent at trial on july,only that she did not appear,and,for some reason,in paragraph of the pleadings,it goes on to state that respondent did appear in court on july of,and neither the pleadings or arguments go to explain why she would have come to court on some other day than the scheduled court date.
the court further acknowledged that default was the most severe sanction it could impose,but then noted the following 
even though a default order was entered against respondent,the court still required the state to present its evidence before any findings of unfitness were made and,based on the stipulations that were entered between the state and the gal,the court then,based on the evidence presented,entered findings of unfitness against respondent.
the court also noted that a delay or continuance of the trial would not have been in the best interests of the children and that the state had every right to require respondent appearance in order to elicit her testimony as it might pertain to the petition to terminate her parental rights.
on october,respondent filed a notice of appeal of the order denying her motion to vacate.adoption orders were entered for india,felicia,and aiesha on october,and for dell on september.the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court denying respondent motion to vacate the default judgment.unpublished order under supreme court rule.the appellate court found that the default judgment in this case did not violate respondent due process rights and did not amount to too severe a sanction for respondent unexplained failure to appear in the face of a rule b notice to appear.we granted respondent petition for leave to appeal.
on appeal to this court,respondent argues that the trial court termination of her parental rights by default judgment for her failure to appear violated her due process rights and her right to counsel where her attorney was not allowed to present a defense or witnesses.in response,the state contradicts respondent arguments that her due process rights and her right to counsel were violated,noting that the default judgment barring was the only realistic sanction that could have been granted for respondent failure to appear given that it was the respondent testimony that the state was seeking to compel and respondent does not indicate that she intended to call any witness to testify on her behalf.
the state has also filed a motion to dismiss this appeal as moot in light of this court recent decision in in re tekela.in tekela,this court held that where a parent appealed but failed to obtain a stay of an order terminating her parental rights,and where the children adoptions were completed more than one year before the appellate court issued its ruling reversing the termination order,the appeal was moot and the appellate court order had to be vacated.tekela,at.the state argues that given the holding in tekela,the present appeal is also moot.we agree.
in tekela,the mother parental rights were terminated following a dubious summary judgment procedure.the appellate court,however,reversed the termination order.at the time of the appellate court decision reversing the termination order,more than one year had passed from the date of the adoptions of the two minors in that case.tekela,at.we granted leave to appeal and then vacated the appellate court order and reinstated the circuit court termination order,finding that because the mother failed to obtain a stay to prevent enforcement of the termination order,the circuit court had authority to move forward with the adoption proceeding and the lapse of the period to petition for relief from a final order under the adoption act see ilcs west ilcs west precluded this court from granting any relief.tekela,at.
similarly to the summary judgment procedure employed in tekela,the circuit court in the instant case terminated respondent parental rights based on a default judgment without allowing her attorney to introduce any evidence.additionally,the present case is factually similar to tekela in that here more than three years have now elapsed from the dates of the adoptions of the four children and they have been residing in the homes of their adoptive parents for over seven years now.
respondent argues that a significant difference between this case and tekela is that here the final adoption order for one of respondent children was entered prior to the timely filing of her notice of appeal and the adoption orders for the remaining children were entered on the same day that her notice of appeal was filed,while in tekela the adoption orders were entered a couple of months after the mother filed her notice of appeal.
contrary to respondent argument,we find that the significant fact is not the timing of the notices of appeal,but rather that the mothers in both cases failed to obtain stays of the termination orders.that the respondent in the present case filed her notice of appeal after or on the same day that the adoption orders were entered is not legally significant because a notice of appeal clearly does not operate as a stay so as to impact the enforcement and effect of the judgment.tekela,at,quoting steinbrecher steinbrecher.thus,it is completely irrelevant that the adoption orders were entered before or on the same day that respondent notice of appeal was filed when the notice of appeal would have had no impact on enforcement of the judgment.respondent ignores the fact that she had days to seek a stay from the time the termination order was entered on july,until the first adoption order was entered on september.
her argument also ignores the fact that the critical point in time in this case is not the date of the adoptions themselves but rather one year after the date of the adoptions,as it is on this latter date that the adoptions became unchallengeable.section of the adoption act provides as follows 
a petition for relief from a final order or judgment entered in a proceeding under this act,after days from the entry thereof under the provisions of of the code of civil procedure or otherwise,must be filed not later than one year after the entry of the order or judgment.ilcs west.
as tekela noted,a petition for relief from a final order under the adoption act must be filed within one year after entry of the order thereafter the adoption becomes unchallengeable,making it impossible to grant a party effective relief with respect to the termination order.tekela,at,citing ilcs b west.this is supported by public policy considerations,requiring that adoptions be accorded a certain degree of finality and stability.tekela,at.given our conclusion that the respondent notice of appeal in this case did not operate as a stay,and could not operate as a stay even if it was filed before the adoption orders were entered see tekela,at,the termination order of july,necessarily became fully enforceable and the circuit court had authority to move forward with the adoption proceeding see tekela,at.in fact,section of the adoption act specifically requires that the proceedings to adopt children be commenced by the prospective adoptive parents within days after such child becomes available for adoption.ilcs west.here,the children became available within the meaning of the statutory scheme on the date that the respondent parental rights were terminated,july.see ilcs f b,a west.thus,it was incumbent upon respondent to seek a stay of the enforcement of the termination order.this the respondent did not do.
arguably,enforcement of the termination order was automatically stayed for a brief time from august,when respondent filed her motion to vacate until september,when the circuit court issued its order denying the motion to vacate.section of the code of civil procedure the code provides that i n all cases tried without a jury,a timely filed motion to vacate stays enforcement of the judgment.ilcs west.after the circuit court denied respondent motion to vacate,however,the termination order became fully enforceable once again.the circuit court was not precluded from entering the adoption orders after september.
respondent argues in her reply brief that the trial court barred her counsel from seeking a stay on her behalf and,at any rate,she did not have enough time to seek a stay.at oral argument before this court,respondent took a new position on this matter,contending for the first time that her counsel sought a stay at the time the default judgment was entered on july,but that the trial court denied the request.
we first note that respondent mistaken claim that she sought a stay at the time of the july,default judgment seems to be the result of her confusion over the difference between a stay of the enforcement of a judgment ilcs west d and a stay of the proceedings until a party can comply with a notice to appear for a hearing,which is one of the available sanctions under supreme court rule c c.from our perusal of the record,it is clear that respondent did not at any time seek a stay of the enforcement of the default judgment entered on july.instead,respondent counsel merely sought to avoid an adverse sanction by requesting a continuance of the proceedings before any judgment would be entered to allow respondent to appear at a later date for trial.
there is also no merit to respondent argument that her counsel was barred from seeking a stay on her behalf or that counsel could not request a stay on her behalf because it was too late.first,the trial court never barred respondent counsel from seeking,as she now claims,a stay or other relief on the mother behalf.rather,the trial court,in the context of placing respondent in default,barred her from testifying and presenting a defense or further pleadings.the judge did not and could not have prevented her from attempting to stop or stay enforcement of the default judgment it is undisputed that she was allowed to file a motion to vacate that judgment and nothing in the record indicates that she was barred from seeking a stay.
moreover,she could have sought the effects of a stay almost immediately after the default judgment.section of the code provides in relevant part 
motion to stay.a party intending to move to set aside any judgment may apply to the court or to the judge in chamber for a certificate which the judge may,in his or her discretion,grant that there is probable cause for staying further proceedings until the order of the court on the motion.service of a copy of the certificate at the time of or after service of the notice of the motion stays all further proceedings accordingly.ilcs west.
respondent insinuation that a request for a stay would have been a waste of time is without merit.tekela rejected precisely the same argument,noting that persuasive arguments exist to support a stay request in the context of cases involving a termination order with an adoption looming.tekela,at.this is because a stay may be necessary to preserve the status quo pending appeal.tekela,at.we also note that under supreme court rule,a motion for a stay may be made to the reviewing court if the trial court denies the application for a stay or application is not practical.rs.b,d.thus,her argument that she was somehow prevented from seeking a stay by the trial court or by a lack of time is without support in fact or in law.
respondent argument that she had barely hours to file her notice of appeal and win her case after her motion to vacate was denied is mistaken.again,that argument ignores that she had days to seek a stay from entry of the default judgment to the first adoption order.additionally,her argument incorrectly assumes that adoption orders become unassailable immediately upon entry.tekela,however,held only that,in the interest of finality and stability,such orders are unchallengeable after the lapse of the statutory period for challenging adoption orders.tekela,at.in tekela,the appellate court was never informed that,at the time its decision was filed reversing the termination order,nearly months had elapsed from the final orders of adoption.the appellate court opinion reversing the termination order would not have been erroneous based on mootness had it been issued within one year of the adoptions because,until that point,the adoptions would have been subject to a petition to vacate upon a showing that there was no valid termination of parental rights in force.see tekela,at.
aside from the prospect that respondent could have sought a stay of the july,order,we also note that she could have sought an expedited appeal by requesting that the case be placed on an accelerated docket in the appellate court pursuant to supreme court rule and by requesting an expedited briefing schedule pursuant to supreme court rule c c.this could have ensured that the appellate court would hear her case in a timely fashion to make meaningful any relief potentially granted to her.
respondent does not cite any persuasive authority for her proposition that she would not have standing to collaterally attack the adoptions if the termination order had been timely overturned.she cites section of the juvenile court act ilcs west to support her argument,but that section merely provides in relevant part that a parent whose parental rights have been terminated has no right to notice of the petition for adoption.that section,along with provisions of the adoption act defining a legal adoption,actually defeats her argument.if the termination order was vacated within one year of the adoption orders,then the respondent argument would be that she,as a parent whose parental rights had not been validly terminated and who had not consented to the adoptions,could not have been subjected to having her children adopted at all,let alone without notice of the adoption.given those hypo
