tonisha via worked as a teacher at kindercare learning centers,in elgin,illinois,where madison was enrolled.during the afternoon of april,while changing madison diaper,via noticed madison acting as if she were experiencing pain in her left leg.via also claims that madison was unusually upset earlier that day and the previous day.via notified another daycare worker and the facility director that madison seemed to be in pain.after examining madison,the director called her mother who picked madison up and took her to the hospital.doctors determined that madison had a broken leg.
sandra lagrand,a dcp investigator for the illinois dcfs,was assigned to the case involving madison broken leg.following her investigation,lagrand determined that credible evidence supported an indicated report against via for child abuse or neglect of madison lagrand supervisor,roi montalvo,approved the report,and it was officially entered against via on may.the dcfs notified kindercare of the indicated finding against via and kindercare responded by firing via.the indicated finding was also posted on the child abuse and neglect tracking system cants.the dcfs did not provide via with a hearing before entering the indicated finding on cants.
via appealed the indicated finding to an administrative law judge alj.via claims that during the appeal process the alj repeatedly advised the dcfs to expunge the indicated report from its record,but that the assistant associate deputy director for child protection in cook county,mary ellen eads,refused to expunge the report.via further alleged that the associate deputy director for child protection,john goad,supported eads decision not to expunge the indicated report during the appeal process.on january,exactly twenty months after the dcfs initially indicated via,the indicated report was expunged,after the alj issued a written recommendation for expungement.
after the expungement,via sued lagrand,montalvo,eads,and goad under,alleging they violated her constitutional right to due process.via also alleged a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against the four defendants.the district court granted qualified immunity on the constitutional claims for defendants montalvo,eads,and goad,but denied lagrand claim of qualified immunity.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of goad on via state law intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,but denied lagrand,montalvo,and eads motions for summary judgment on that state law theory.lagrand filed this interlocutory appeal,claiming she is entitled to qualified immunity,which is the only issue before us.
on appeal,lagrand claims that she is entitled to qualified immunity on via due process claim.section provides that 
e very person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
to state a claim under,then,via must allege she was deprived of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states,and the deprivation was visited upon her by a person or persons acting under color of state law.jones wilhelm,cir.

in this case,the district court agreed with lagrand that if credible evidence supported an indicated finding against via,lagrand would be entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitutionality of that standard was not yet clearly established at the time of the investigation of via.district court opinion at.the district court,however,also concluded that signing a report indicating someone for child abuse or neglect without any supporting evidence is conduct so egregious that no reasonable person could have believed that it would not violate clearly established rights.district court opinion at.as the district court further explained in other words,any reasonable person in lagrand position would have known in that indicating via for abuse or neglect in the absence of evidence of abuse or neglect was a clear violation of via right to due process.district court opinion at.
