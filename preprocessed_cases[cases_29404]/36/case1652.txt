ii.procedural history 
this is the third appeal arising from two separate,but related,actions between appellant patricia cochran appellant and respondent johnnie cochran,respondent arising out of their,nonmarital relationship.
the first action,no.was filed in march.the operative,first amended complaint of april was primarily concerned with respondent alleged breach of a supposed agreement to provide appellant with lifetime support.in cochran cochran th,d cochran i,we held that the statute of limitations for breach of a marvin agreement did not begin to run until the defendant failed to perform as the agreement required.id.at,d.as a result of our decision,all that remained of the complaint in cochran i were causes of action based on the alleged marvin agreement.
the second action,no.was filed in november while the appeal in cochran i was still pending.the original complaint in the second action included a cause of action seeking to rescind a property settlement agreement because the agreement was induced by fraud.the operative first amended complaint omitted the rescission claim,but sought damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on a message left on a telephone answering machine which appellant construed as a death threat.in cochran cochran th,d cochran ii,we held that the message was not actionable as a death threat.
after our decision in cochran i became final,that action was remanded to the trial court.on january,respondent against appellant,contending she had breached the confidentiality provisions of their property settlement agreement by appearing on television to discuss their relationship.appellant answered the on february,and filed a of her own the fraud,seeking to rescind the settlement agreement because it allegedly had been induced by respondent fraud.respondent dismissed his without prejudice on march.he then demurred to the fraud,contending among other things that it was barred by the statute of limitations and was contrary to certain verified allegations in the cochran i complaint concerning the validity of the settlement agreement.by minute order dated april,the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend on two grounds the fraud was barred by appellant earlier allegations and the action was also barred under the law of the case doctrine by our decision in cochran 
in november respondent moved for summary judgment on the cochran i complaint,contending appellant could not prevail on her remaining marvin claims because the parties were not cohabiting when the agreement was made the alleged promise of support was made under circumstances which made it unreasonable to believe the statements were a contractual offer the alleged promise to support was too uncertain to be enforced and in any event,the claim was barred by the statute of limitations.the motion was granted and judgment for respondent was entered december.this appeal followed.
iii.demurrer standard of review 
iv.summary judgment standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we must assume the role of the trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion.in doing so,we must strictly scrutinize the moving party papers.the declarations of the party opposing summary judgment,however,are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable,issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.while the appellate court must review a summary judgment motion by the same standards as the trial court,it must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented.barber marina sailing,th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets his burden of proof showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o.once the defendant does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or to a defense to the cause of action.in doing so,the plaintiff can not rely on the mere allegations or denial of his pleadings,but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists see union bank superior court th,d.
