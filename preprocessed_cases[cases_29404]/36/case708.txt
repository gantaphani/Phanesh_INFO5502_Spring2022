introduction 
are the proceeds of a term life policy community property or separate property of the spouse who pays the final premium our answer is an all too familiar one it depends.we hold that the characterization will depend on the premium for the final term of the policy.minnesota mut.life ins.ensley cir,minnesota mut.life ins.the effect of the rules governing characterization of term life insurance proceeds depends on multiple factors,including whether the policy contains certain contractual provisions,and the insurability of the insured spouse.the result is an unfortunately intricate methodology for allocating proceeds of term life insurance policies.were we free to abandon community property jurisprudence and craft a simpler holding we might do so.we are not.
here,the trial court failed to make findings sufficient to determine proper characterization of the proceeds.therefore,we vacate the court order,and remand for further factual findings and application of the rules we set forth herein 
in,during the marriage of becky burwell and gary burwell,a term life insurance policy was purchased hereafter the term life policy or the policy.gary was the insured and becky was the named beneficiary until october.
in september,becky petitioned for dissolution of her marriage with gary.
automatic temporary restraining orders 
gary was served with a summons along with becky petition.the summons contained a number of automatic temporary restraining orders atros.see,cal.rules of court,rule b.the atros included the following text 
starting immediately,you and your spouse are restrained from 
cashing,borrowing against,cancelling,transferring,disposing of,or changing the beneficiaries of any insurance or other coverage including life,health,automobile,and disability held for the benefit of the parties and their minor child or children 
transferring,encumbering,hypothecating,concealing,or in any way disposing of any property,real or personal,whether community,or separate,without the written consent of the other party or an order of the court,except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life and 
creating a nonprobate transfer or modifying a nonprobate transfer in a manner that affects the disposition of property subject to the transfer,without the written consent of the other party or order of the court.before revocation of a nonprobate transfer can take effect,or a right of survivorship to property can be eliminated,notice of the change must be filed and served on the other party.
gary remarries 
a judgment of dissolution was entered in august,and the court retained jurisdiction over all other issues.in november gary married cynthia burwell cynthia.
august stipulated judgment 
in august,gary and becky stipulated to a further judgment resolving some property issues.though the stipulated judgment indicates that the parties have reached an agreement with regard to the division of their marital property,five issues were explicitly reserved for a trial.one of the issues reserved for trial was claims for breach of spousal fiduciary duty.
the stipulated judgment,signed by both parties,also states 
full disclosure of assets and gifts.each party has warranted to the other that he or she has no ownership interest in or claim to any property of any kind,other than the property described in this further judgment,and that he or she has not made,without the knowledge of the other,any gift or transfer of community property within the past five years for less than full and adequate consideration.
after discovered and concealed assets.if additional assets of a community property nature are subsequently discovered,the existence of which were in good faith unknown or forgotten by both parties,such assets shall be divided equally between the parties.all other assets shall be divided as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.this court specifically retains jurisdiction over all concealed or assets.
the judgment also fixed the separation date at september.
change of beneficiary 
on october,gary changed the beneficiary on the term life policy from becky to cynthia.gary had not listed the policy in his preliminary or final disclosure declarations in the dissolution action.see.
trial on reserved issues 
the trial on reserved issues contemplated by the prior stipulated judgment commenced in june before judge john somers and continued over several months.several issues were adjudicated at the trial.the most contentious issue involved a business called burwell concrete,bci.the court was tasked with deciding whether approximately million in postseparation income from bci was community income or gary separate income.the trial also dealt with claims of breach of fiduciary duty.
the court eventually issued its ruling on may.first,the court ruled that bci had been awarded to gary on august,and postseparation income from bci prior to august,was community income.
the court then ruled on the breach of fiduciary duty claims as follows 
t he court does not find a breach of fiduciary obligation in this case.there is no evidence that petitioner failed to meet her obligations of disclosure,or of good faith and fair dealing,in any way.respondent,gary conduct is more problematic.despite counsel best efforts,there were often significant delays or problems in the disclosure of relevant financial information the disclosure issues,while problematic,are not sufficient in the court view to establish breach of a fiduciary obligation in this case.
the court also ruled that gary owed becky in back spousal support payments and interest in attorney fees in reimbursements and credits for becky portion of community property less in gary reimbursements and in previously ordered equalization payments.
gary suicide and becky civil and probate actions 
in april,after trial had commenced,but before the court had issued its aforementioned ruling,gary committed suicide.shortly after gary death,becky filed a civil action to prevent the term life policy proceeds from going to cynthia.becky also filed a probate action seeking letters of administration for gary estate.
becky moved to consolidate the civil action with the dissolution proceeding.cynthia opposed consolidation.in her opposition papers,cynthia argued that there were no remaining issues left to be determined in the family law matter.her opposition papers further stated that she is not a party to the action nor does she have any real interest in the outcome.the court denied the motion to consolidate,but ordered the civil action stayed.
becky motion regarding the insurance policy 
concurrent with her motion to consolidate,becky filed a motion seeking adjudication of the insurance policy as an omitted asset.see.becky contended that she was entitled to percent of the proceeds.she acknowledged that she was aware of the policy when it was purchased,but assumed gary had let it lapse.
becky argued she was entitled to the proceeds under three legal theories.first,gary purported change of beneficiary from becky to cynthia was void because it was made in violation of the atros.as a result,becky was still the operative beneficiary under the policy.second,gary failure to disclose the insurance policy in his disclosures violated family code section,and therefore the proceeds should be awarded entirely to becky under subdivision h of that section.third,the court retained jurisdiction over omitted community property assets under the august stipulated judgment.she argued she was entitled to half the proceeds as her share of the community asset.she also claimed the other half of the proceeds because they exceeded the amount of debt gary owed her.these included amounts gary allegedly owed her under the august stipulated judgment and anticipated amounts gary will owe becky once judge somers makes his ruling after the trial on reserved issues.becky subsequently filed a supplemental memorandum of points and authorities raising a fourth theory of recovery.in that filing,becky argued that gary purported change of beneficiary must be set aside as a fraudulent transfer under section of the civil code.
cynthia filed briefing in opposition to the motion and her counsel appeared at oral argument.she contended that the policy was gary separate property.she also argued that to the extent the atros apply to separate property,they conflict with family code section.cynthia contended that section provides that the court has no jurisdiction over a spouse s separate property.
court november,order 
judge susan gill ruled on the motion in an order dated november,it is from this order that both parties appeal.
the court found that gary failed to disclose the policy and thereby violated his fiduciary duty to becky.as a result,the policy was deemed an omitted asset and was neither distributed in the judgment on reserved issues,nor included in judge somers ruling of april.therefore,the atros continued to apply to the asset,and gary change of beneficiary to cynthia is void.
the court ruled that the policy was a community asset.the ruling contained no analysis of the characterization issue,but did cite to estate of logan d,logan and in re marriage of gonzalez d.
the court ordered of the million proceeds distributed to becky as her share of this community property asset.the court ordered that the remaining half of the proceeds shall become part of gary estate.the order notes that becky is a creditor of the estate and the probate court must resolve the issue of what priority to give becky creditor claims against gary estate.
postruling filings below 
cynthia filed a notice of intent to move for a new trial,seeking an order setting aside the ruling signed on november,that awards of the term life insurance proceeds to becky and granting a new trial.see fn,post.
cynthia also filed a notice of appeal from the november,order.becky filed a notice of from the same order.
motions filed on appeal 
cynthia filed a motion to augment the appellate record with an october,transcript of testimony from the trial on reserved issues.becky opposed the motion to augment and requested that we strike certain portions of cynthia opening brief referencing the transcript and certain portions of appellant appendix,volume ii.becky contends these documents pertained to the trial on reserved issues before judge somers and were not before judge gill when she issued the appealed order.we granted the motion to augment the record,but did not resolve the transcript relevance to any issue on appeal or whether the court will consider the reporter transcript on review.we previously deferred ruling on becky motion to strike pending further order of this court.we now deny it see people preslie,supra,d at.
becky moved this court to dismiss cynthia appeal for lack of standing.we previously deferred ruling on the dismissal motion.for the reasons explained below,we now deny that motion as well.
discussion 
is a party for purposes of appellate standing 
in california,the right to appeal civil actions is statutory.jordan malone th.in order to exercise that statutory right,an appellant must have standing.ibid.
appellate standing is conferred by section of the code of civil procedure.rao campo d see code civ.that statute provides,in relevant part,that a ny party aggrieved may appeal code civ.by its plain language,code of civil procedure section limits appellate standing in two important ways.to have appellate standing,one must be a party and be aggrieved.see also conservatorship of gregory th.
in her motion to dismiss,becky argues cynthia was not a party to the action below and therefore lacks standing.she does not contend cynthia was not aggrieved by the order from which she ostensibly appeals.
the general rule is that only a party of record to the proceedings in the trial court may appeal.newman wells fargo bank cal th,fn.but,a party of record includes one who takes appropriate steps to become a party of record in the proceedings.in re silvia th,fn.for example,when a person or entity moves to vacate a judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,they become a party for purposes of appellate standing.county of alameda carleson cal d,carleson.
the california supreme court held in carleson that one who is legally aggrieved by a judgment may become a party of record and obtain a right to appeal by moving to vacate the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure,section.carleson,supra,cal d at.as becky argues in her motion,cynthia did not move to vacate the judgment under code of civil procedure section.but,cynthia did file a motion seeking to set aside the subject order under code of civil procedure section thus,if the carleson rule applies to any motion to vacate or set aside an order and is not limited to motions brought under code of civil procedure section,then cynthia would be a party of record for purposes of appellate standing.in accordance with the general rule that doubts as to standing are resolved in favor of the right to appeal apple,franchise tax bd.th,we hold that the carleson rule does apply here.
for the reasons explained below,we view the supreme court reference to code of civil procedure section in carleson carleson,supra,cal d as merely identifying one type of motion to vacate that will confer party status on the movant for purposes of appellate standing.in this context,we see no relevant distinction between a motion seeking to set aside a decree code civ,and a motion seeking to vacate a decision code civ.thus,we believe the most faithful application of carleson would permit an appeal here,where the appellant moved to set aside the judgment in the lower court.
in support of its holding in carleson,the supreme court cited to five cases eggert pac.states cal d,eggert in re elliott cal.elliott in re estate of partridge d estate of partridge in re estate of sloan d estate of sloan and butterfield tietz d butterfield.carleson,supra,cal d at.
in all of these cases,there was no indication that a person must file a motion seeking to vacate the judgment under a particular statute.to the contrary,in estate of sloan,the court described eggert and other cases as holding that a party must move to vacate or otherwise formally oppose the judgment appealed from below.estate of sloan,supra,d at,italics added.likewise,the remainder of the cases do not require the motion to vacate be made pursuant to any particular statute 
thus,we view carleson reference to code of civil procedure section as merely identifying the statute under which that case particular motion was brought.we do not view the statutory citation as limiting the scope of carleson holding.carleson,supra,cal d.
the fourth district arrived at a similar conclusion in shaw hughes aircraft th hughes aircraft.the court of appeal applied the carleson rule where the appellant had moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.hughes aircraft,supra,th at.in hughes aircraft,the appellant motions challenging the judgment below were brought under code of civil procedures sections and,not code of civil procedure section.hughes aircraft,supra,at.nonetheless,the court held that motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial are similar to the code of civil procedure section motion in carleson,in that they ask the trial judge to vacate a verdict or judgment and enter a new one.hughes aircraft,supra,at.we agree with this approach,where reviewing courts determine the applicability of the carleson rule by looking to the nature of the underlying motion,not its statutory basis.carleson,supra,cal d.
here,cynthia motion sought to set aside the ruling signed november,and was therefore a motion seeking to vacate the order for purposes of the carleson rule.contrary to becky contention in her motion to dismiss,cynthia is a party for purposes of appellate standing.see carleson,supra,cal d at.
next,we address the characterization of term life insurance proceeds.
the policy proceeds can not be characterized on this factual record 
unless otherwise provided by statute,all property acquired during marriage while domiciled in california is community property.one category of separate property is the earnings and accumulations of a spouse while living separate and apart from the other spouse,are the separate property of the spouse,subd.a.but,property attributable to community earnings must be divided equally when the community is dissolved.in re marriage of brown cal d,marriage of brown,italics added.
here,we must apply these principles to term life insurance proceeds.
term life insurance policies typically contain two elements,dollar coverage payable in the event of death and a right to renewal for future terms without proof of current medical eligibility.logan,supra,d at.at the expiration of the term of years,the policy expires without retaining cash value.ibid.
there is a split of authority in california regarding the characterization of term life insurance proceeds as community or separate property.see in re marriage of spengler th,marriage of spengler.on one side is logan,supra,d at page.
logan decision 
in logan,the first district held that term life insurance policies only remain community property after separation for as long as community funds are used to pay the premium.logan,supra d at.otherwise,if the insured remains insurable,the term policy is not a divisible community asset because the policy is of no value and the community has fully received what it bargained for.id.at.in dictum,logan indicated that i f the insured becomes uninsurable during the term paid with community funds,then the right to future insurance coverage which can not otherwise be purchased is a community asset to be divided upon dissolution.id.at.in marriage of spengler,supra,th,the third district agreed with the holding of logan but disagreed with its dictum.marriage of spengler,supra,at.
biltoft and woodmen decisions 
conversely,in biltoft wootten d biltoft,the fourth district held that proceeds from term life insurance must be apportioned between community and separate property in the same ratio that the amount of premiums paid from community earnings bears to the amount of premiums paid from separate property.id.at.it rejected the notion that no person has an interest in a term life insurance policy beyond the date the premium is due id.at.it disagreed with the argument that each premium payment is a new contract,citing modern woodmen of america gray.modern woodmen.biltoft,supra,at.
with a few exceptions,we agree with logan.the coverage and premium provisions of term life insurance policies provide dollar coverage only for the specific term for which the premium was paid.logan,supra,d at.therefore,the characterization of the proceeds will depend on the premium for the final term of the policy.minnesota mut.life ins,supra,at.when the final premium is paid solely with community property,the proceeds of the policy are community property.logan,supra,d at p.conversely,when the separate estate pays for the final premium with no help from the community,the proceeds are a separate asset.id.at.
we believe biltoft and woodmen err in analyzing the relevant property interests at the wrong level of abstraction.that is,those opinions generally identify the property interest as the entire insurance policy.we believe the proper unit of analysis is the individual contractual rights conferred by the policy.as was said in an analogous context,t he court of appeal analysis rests on the erroneous legal assumption that the asset was unitary and indivisible it is not.in re marriage of sonne cal th.similarly,a term life insurance policy is not a unitary and indivisible asset giving rise to a unitary and indivisible property interest.rather,the relevant property interests are the individual enforceable contractual rights derived from the policy.see,marriage of brown,supra,cal d at a contractual right is a chose in action,a form of property see.
an insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and an insured,the insurer making promises,and the insured paying premiums,the one in consideration for the other,against the risk of loss buss superior court cal th,citations omitted.one of the insurer promises in a term life policy is the agreement to pay the policy proceeds if the insured dies between dates x and y.the payment of the subsequent premium is consideration for another promise from the insurer to pay the proceeds if the insured dies between dates y to z.in other words,the premium is the amount paid for a certain period of coverage.troyk farmers group,th,italics added.
each premium payment gives rise to an enforceable contractual right of coverage for an additional period of time.as premiums are paid over the life of the policy,distinct property interests in coverage for various periods of time arise.of those distinct property interests,only one is worth anything in hindsight coverage for the term during which the insured dies thus,the relevant inquiry is who obtained the specific contractual right to coverage for the final term and how.minnesota mut.life ins,supra,at characterization of proceeds will depend on the premium for the final term of the policy.
as we will explain,biltoft and woodmen misidentification of the relevant property interests leads to their erroneous characterization of the proceeds and the needless deaths of countless straw men.
biltoft and woodmen first reject the argument that each premium payment does not create a new contract.they are correct to discredit this notion.the relevant property is not a unitary and indivisible interest in the entire policy contract,but in the individual enforceable contractual rights derived from it.see,marriage of brown,supra,cal d at a contractual right is a chose in action,a form of property see.while each premium payment does not create a new contract,it does give rise to a new enforceable contractual right and thus a distinct property interest.by way of analogy,consider a apartment lease.each rent payment does not create a new lease,but paying january rent does not entitle a tenant to live there in october 
biltoft and woodmen next assert it would be unreasonable to hold that the payment of the premiums would convert the entire proceeds biltoft,supra,d at woodmen,supra.at.this is true,as far as it goes.the separate estate subsequent payment of the premium does not convert the community proceeds.but the point is they were never the community proceeds to begin with.the proceeds belong to whomever the insurance company is contractually obligated to pay.in other words,the valuable property interest is the enforceable contractual right to compel payment of the proceeds.see,marriage of brown,supra,cal d at a contractual right is a chose in action,a form of property see.in this context,that contractual right is the coverage during which the insured dies.the community did not acquire this contractual right.instead,the community paid for,and received in full,a different contractual right the right to be paid upon a contingency that ultimately failed.the important aspect of this contractual right is not that it has been converted or appropriated by the separate estate it has not.the pivotal attribute of the community interest is its complete lack of value.it does not entitle its holder to the policy proceeds and never will.the right to be paid if the insured dies between january and becomes forever worthless on february if the insured is alive.that is how term insurance works.
even logan briefly falls prey to this erroneous conversion theory.logan states if,as is usually the case,the insured is insurable at the end of the term purchased with community funds,the renewed policy,that is,the term policy purchased by the payment of the premium with postseparation earnings which are separate property changes character from community to separate property.logan,supra,d at,italics added.we disagree.the reason the community is not entitled to the proceeds is not because contractual rights have changed in character.it is because the separate and community estates have different contractual rights one valuable and the other not.the community has the worthless right to payment upon a contingency that has failed.the separate estate has the valuable right to payment upon a contingency that has occurred.the point is the community has fully received everything it bargained for,not that the community rights have become separate property.
these principles only bring us so far.it is clear that characterization of the proceeds as separate or community will depend on the premium for the final term of the policy.minnesota mut.life ins,supra,at.complications arise when the separate estate uses a community asset to acquire the final term of coverage.
i t is well established that,upon separation of the parties or dissolution of marriage,one spouse is not entitled to appropriate a community asset for his or her own use without reimbursing the community for the value of the appropriated asset.in re marriage of elfmont cal th,conc.dis.opn.of george,marriage of elfmont.the community must be reimbursed to the extent it owns or has an interest in the contractual rights used by the separate estate to obtain the final coverage term.as explained,post,this concept is relevant where the insured spouse becomes medically uninsurable during a term paid for by the community.
medical uninsurability and the right of renewal 
a person is medically uninsurable if they are unable to obtain individual life insurance.spengler,supra,th at.a person may become uninsurable because of the condition of their health.united states ryerson.sometimes,a person who becomes medically uninsurable may nonetheless continue existing coverage by virtue of a contractual right to renew their policy.marriage of elfmont,supra,cal th at.this is referred to as the right of renewal.ibid.
the right of renewal is an enforceable contractual right and a property interest.see,see also marriage of brown,supra,cal d at a contractual right is a chose in action,a form of property see.the community initially purchased this right of renewal,and maintained it for a period of time through subsequent premiums.the right of renewal is therefore,at least in part,community property.
when the insured spouse becomes medically uninsurable during the community terms of coverage,his or her separate estate can only acquire subsequent terms of coverage by appropriating the community contractual right to renew.by definition,the uninsurable spouse would be unable to continue coverage without it.thus,the acquisition of the final coverage term is dependent on both the separate estate payment of premiums and the community renewal right.both the separate and community estates are contributing towards the purchase of subsequent coverage terms including the final coverage term.the community contribution is represented by the premiums it has paid over the life of the policy,which are the funds expended to acquire and retain the renewal right.once the premiums are paid solely by separate funds,it is the separate estate that is maintaining the renewal right.given the joint effort of community and separate assets in acquiring the relevant asset,the final coverage term,the proceeds obtained therewith must be apportioned.i t is well established that,upon separation of the parties or dissolution of marriage,one spouse is not entitled to appropriate a community asset for his or her own use without reimbursing the community for the value of the appropriated asset.marriage of elfmont,supra,cal th at conc.dis.opn.of george.
this view is consistent with dicta from the supreme court decision in marriage of elfmont.in discussing term life insurance,the supreme court stated to provide for a former spouse participation in the proceeds,when premium payments from community funds have purchased policy renewal rights necessary to keep the insurance in force,may well be appropriate.marriage of elfmont,supra,cal th at.
in this situation,where the insured spouse becomes uninsurable during a term paid for by the community,the proper apportionment of the proceeds is between community and separate property in the same ratio that the amount of premiums paid from community earnings bears to the amount of premiums paid from separate property.biltoft,supra,d at.
premium caps 
there is another scenario wherein the separate estate could appropriate the community contractual rights.over time,a spouse may remain insurable but become more expensive to insure because of advancing age or declining health.in re marriage of gonzalez,supra,d at.that is why some term insurance policies,like the policy at issue here,provide for a cap on premiums during a particular period of time.with a cap provision,the premium for a particular term may not solely reflect actuarial considerations relative to the insured likelihood of dying during that term.the price may be artificially low in accordance with the premium cap.the cap has value when the premiums would otherwise exceed the maximum it allows.
the cap itself is a contractual right to be charged premiums at or below a maximum amount.both the separate and community estates have paid premiums to maintain this contractual right.thus,if the insured spouse renews the policy postseparation,and the premiums would have been higher without the premium cap,the insured spouse has necessarily appropriated property which the community acquired and helped maintain 
as noted ante,the characterization of the proceeds as separate or community will depend on the premium for the final term of the policy.minnesota mut.life ins,supra,at.in the case of lessened insurability,the final premium obligation is met by the joint effect of the funds expended by the separate estate to pay the premium and the discount embodied in the premium cap,which is a asset.thus the community should receive a fraction of the proceeds based on two factors the community role in maintaining the contractual right to a premium cap and the premium cap role in the separate estate acquisition of the final term of coverage.that fraction would be calculated as follows 
percentage of total premiums paid by community 
x effective premium discount for final term of coverage 
actual premium paid for the final term of coverage 
effective premium discount for final term of coverage 
for example,consider the following hypothetical.the community pays percent of the premiums over the life of a policy.without the premium cap,the insured spouse would have had to pay for the premium for the final coverage term.however,because of the premium cap,the insured spouse only had to pay a premium for the final coverage term.
in this scenario,the community would be entitled to,or percent,of the proceeds.
in sum,the proper characterization of term life insurance proceeds depends on a number of factors.the proceeds are entirely community when the final premium is paid solely with community property.logan,supra,d at.the proceeds are entirely separate property when a separate estate has paid the final premium with separate funds and the insured spouse was insurable at the end of the last term paid for by community funds and either a the insured spouse health was such that he or she could have purchased a comparable policy at a comparable price when the separate estate began paying the premiums,or b the policy did not contain a premium cap when the separate estate began paying the premiums.the proceeds are part community and part separate where the separate estate has paid the final premium with funds that are part community and part separate or the insured spouse has become medically uninsurable before he or she began paying the premiums with separate property or the insured spouse could not have purchased a comparable policy at a comparable price when he or she began paying the premiums with separate property see appendix a,post.
we can not apply these principles to the proceeds at issue here because there is an insufficient factual record.to determine which characterization apportionment method applies,there must be findings of fact on whether gary paid the postseparation premiums with a separate funds,b funds attributable to his community estate with becky,or c funds attributable to his community estate with cynthia or some combination if gary paid the premiums with separate funds,whether he was medically insurable when he began doing so and,if so,whether gary could have purchased a comparable policy at a comparable price when he began paying premiums with separate funds and if not,how much more expensive would the premiums have been without the premium cap.
we therefore vacate the order adjudicating the policy proceeds.we remand for the trial court to make these factual findings,and to apply the law as expressed in this opinion to the facts so found.
none of the parties remaining contentions alter this disposition,as we will now explain in the unpublished portion of the opinion.
we can not resolve becky claim on cross appeal that she is entitled to percent of the proceeds as the sole valid beneficiary on the factual record before us 
there are a number of contentions that becky raises on that we can not address given that we remand for reconsideration of the characterization issue.becky claims she is entitled to percent of the proceeds because she is the effective beneficiary on the policy.she argues that while gary purported to change the beneficiary from becky to cynthia,that designation was void because it violated the atros.see.she also contends the designation is independently void because it was a fraudulent conveyance.see,subd.a.as explained post,we can not determine whether becky is entitled to percent of the proceeds on these theories.
under the principles outlined in section ii,ante,it is possible that gary and cynthia community estate has an interest in the insurance proceeds.if so,then cynthia may have a right to some of the proceeds even though gary change of beneficiary from becky to cynthia was voided by the trial court.cynthia interest in the proceeds may not be defeated by a gift of the policy proceeds to a third party named as beneficiary without her consent.see life insurance of north america cassidy cal d.the surviving spouse is therefore entitled to set aside his or her community share in life insurance proceeds even where the decedent spouse designated another person as beneficiary.citations this rule applies to term life insurance policies emard hughes aircraft cir,abrogated on other grounds by egelhoff egelhoff.
thus,the resolution of cynthia claim to percent of the proceeds must await proper characterization of the proceeds.
we can not resolve cynthia claim that even if the proceeds must be split,she should receive half 
cynthia claims that even if the trial court properly split the proceeds between gary and becky,it should have awarded gary share to cynthia.we can not reach this claim either.if the proceeds were property of gary and cynthia community estate,then cynthia herself is entitled to at least a portion of the proceeds.see,subd.a see also part iii,ante.but if the proceeds are entirely property of gary and becky community estate,then cynthia may not be entitled to the requested relief because the trial court voided the change of beneficiary.therefore,this issue may need to be considered on remand depending on the ultimate characterization of the proceeds.
we note that the parties,in their opening appellant briefs,do not challenge the trial court finding that gary violated the atros,nor its ruling that the change of beneficiary from becky to cynthia is void.those rulings remain intact on remand.the trial court will determine the practical effect of those rulings,if any,once it characterizes the policy proceeds 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion by leaving becky creditor claim against gary estate to the probate court 
as an alternative argument,becky claims the trial court should have awarded her percent of the proceeds because she was entitled to percent for her portion of the community interest and percent as a creditor of gary estate.the family court did award becky percent as a member of the community,but left it to the probate court to adjudicate becky creditor claim.becky claims it was error for the court not to award her the balance of the policy to offset her existing judgment 
first,we note that this particular issue may become moot depending on proceedings following remand.however,if on remand the court again arrives at the conclusion that becky is entitled to less than all of the proceeds,then this issue will remain relevant.therefore,we discuss it briefly.code civ.
becky postjudgment motion to adjudicate the life insurance proceeds was brought under family code section.that section requires the court to equally divide omitted or unadjudicated community assets,unless the court finds upon good cause shown that the interests of justice require an unequal division of the asset.because the trial court equally divided the asset,it necessarily did not find upon good cause shown that the interests of justice require an unequal division of the asset.instead,the court determined that becky was entitled to percent of the proceeds.it left the adjudication of becky claim to the remainder of the proceeds on a theory to the probate court.we find no abuse of discretion.
the family court would have likely violated due process if it had simply awarded the proceeds to becky as a creditor without proper notice to other claimants against gary estate.see tulsa professional collection services,pope.moreover,becky provided no evidence to the trial court regarding the priority of her debt vis other creditors.see.it was appropriate for the family court to have the probate court determine the resolution of becky claims as a creditor of gary estate.
disclosure requirements are set by statute,not the format of a judicial council form 
cynthia argues that gary did not improperly fail to disclose the policy during the dissolution proceeding.she contends that the judicial council form for disclosures form no.fl,only contemplates disclosure of life insurance policies with a cash surrender value.and,because the policy had no cash surrender value,gary failure to specify the term life policy was consistent with the form.
disclosure requirements are set by statute,not by the format of judicial council forms.see.the statutes require disclosure of all assets in which the declarant has or may have an interest regardless of the characterization of the asset as community or separate,subd.c,italics added.the format of a judicial council form does not change statutory requirements for a particular filing.people ex rel.of transportation superior court th,adoption of official forms for the most common civil actions has not changed the statutory requirement that the complaint contain facts constituting the cause of action.
even if the form wording had been determinative,cynthia argument fails.at most,the form language regarding cash surrender value suggested the policy should not be listed in that particular section.but the form also had a section entitled other assets.in sum,the form does not prohibit the listing of life insurance policies with no cash surrender value,and the family code requires it.see,subd.c.we see no basis for disturbing the trial court finding that gary violated disclosure requirements.
family code section sanctions
