under supp.ii,a person owing more than in child support may be punished by two years imprisonment if she willfully fails to pay that child support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state.a,c emphasis added.venturella argues the term resides denotes domicile.specifically,she contends that the government could not establish that she resided in florida without proving she intended to live there permanently.
background 
venturella and james ferretti divorced in.the new york supreme court,suffolk county,awarded ferretti custody of their children,james ferretti,and justin ferretti,and ordered venturella to pay james ferretti in child support once every two weeks with the first payment due february.
venturella refused to pay child support.the only payment received was an involuntary garnishment of her wages in of.at that time,she earned over a year teaching in a new york public school.venturella thereafter informed her employer she would quit her job if she could not avoid paying child support.
venturella succeeded in that regard by leaving first her job and then new york.she immediately asked the school district for an unpaid leave of absence and expressed concern about resuming teaching in new york for fear that the child support garnishment would be taken out if she returned to work.in the fall of,she took a job at the broward children center in pompano beach,florida.when she applied for that job in october she listed her home address as pembroke pines,florida.she began work at broward in november.that same month,she applied for and was issued by the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles a driver license,stating that she had residence,employment or military assignment in th e state.venturella then applied for a teaching position with huntington learning center in pembroke pines in late november,listing the same home address.she worked as a tutor for huntington throughout december and january.
venturella lived in in pembroke pines or fort at least may.although there is some evidence that venturella returned to new york on various occasions while she lived in florida,a neighbor testified that from january through may of that year she saw venturella at venturella home all the time.
a grand jury indicted venturella on the charge that,between january and october,she resided in florida and knowingly and willfully failed to pay a past due support obligation greater than with respect to her children who resided in new york,in violation of a the trial focused on where venturella resided,specifically,whether she resided in florida at any time during that period.the parties vigorously disputed the proper interpretation of that term venturella asked the district court to adopt the definition of resides enunciated in united states,wl,which would require the jury to find that venturella left the state of new york with an intention not to return to the state of new york,and to live permanently in florida.the government asked the court to employ the definition of residency articulated by this court in rosario ins,cir.that definition has no reference to an intent to remain permanently or indefinitely and would have simply required the jury to determine whether venturella had her principal,actual dwelling place in florida.
over venturella objection,the district court adopted the government definition the jury found venturella guilty.the court sentenced her to fifteen months imprisonment followed by one year of supervised release venturella appeals from the judgment of conviction and we now affirm.
discussion 
venturella argues the district court jury instruction defining resides was erroneous and prejudicial,is unconstitutionally vague as applied,the district court failure to charge the jury on a dual residency defense constituted plain error,and she was denied the effective assistance of counsel.the first three arguments are without merit,and we decline to resolve the fourth.
the resides instruction properly adopted a definition based on residency rather than domicile 
the parties do not dispute that a applies where the child and obligated parent reside in separate states.united states sage,cir.venturella,however,contends that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the term residence sic as used in should be interpreted synonymously with the term domicile,and,specifically,that the court erred in permitting the jury to find that venturella could reside in florida even if she did not intend to live there permanently.we disagree.
principles of construction dictate that statutory analysis necessarily begins with the plain meaning of a law text and,absent ambiguity,will generally end there.collazos united states,cir.although resides usually denotes residence,see,united states namey,cir,cert.denied,d,it may also denote domicile,see,webster third new international dictionary defining reside,as,in part,to have one residence or domicile.for the most part,residence and domicile are two perfectly distinct things.delaware,petrowsky,cir.residence is t he act or fact of living in a given place for some time,while domicile is a person true,fixed,principal,and permanent home,to which that person intends to return and remain even though currently residing elsewhere.black law dictionary,ed.in rosario,we explained the terms different common law meanings 
domiciliaries are those who have a fixed,permanent and principal home and to which,whenever absent,they always intend to return.at the opposite end of the scale are transients,those persons who are just passing through a locality.in between these notions of permanence and transience are residents.residency means an established abode,for personal or business reasons,permanent for a time.a resident is so determined from the physical fact of that person living in a particular place.one may have more than one residence in different parts of this country or the world,but a person may have only one domicile.a person may be a resident of one locality,but be domiciled in another.
rosario,at internal citations omitted.accordingly,while residence generally does not require an intent to remain or return,domicile does.yet as resides can mean either residence or domicile,definitions alone do not resolve the dispute.
of course,we can not abandon our inquiry simply because the determinative word is susceptible to two definitions.see united states dauray,cir.as judge learned hand noted in cabell markham,cir,aff,one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence is not to make a fortress out of the dictionary.thus,where a statutory term is reasonably susceptible to two or more meanings,we turn to the canons of statutory construction.see natural res.def.council,muszynski,cir.
use of the same language in various enactments dealing with the same general subject matter is a strong indication that the statutes should be interpreted to mean the same thing.hargrave oki nursery,cir.we have found only one other federal provision using the term resides to define a crime,and that provision uses the term as set forth an interstate element.in,resides denotes residency.the statute provides,inter alia,that it shall be unlawful 
for any person,other than a licensed importer,licensed manufacturer,licensed dealer,or licensed collector to transport into or receive in the state where he resides or if the person is a corporation or other business entity,the state where it maintains a place of business any firearm purchased or otherwise obtained by such person outside that state,except that this paragraph a shall not preclude any person who lawfully acquires a firearm by bequest or intestate succession in a state other than his state of residence from transporting the firearm into or receiving it in that state,if it is lawful for such person to purchase or possess such firearm in that state 
a emphasis added.section expressly ties resides to residence.we have interpreted those terms not to require a domicile type intent.in united states matteo,cir,we spoke of a defendant having dual residency,in both the state in which he purchased the guns and the state into which he transported the guns,id.at,and rejected the defendant contention that his dual residency exempted him from the proscriptions of.we explained that,if dual residency were a valid defense,one could easily circumvent the sweep of the statute by establishing residency in two states between which he intended to run guns.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we thus began with the premise that a person may have dual residency in fact,and then concluded that such dual residency was an invalid defense.implicit in our starting premise was the understanding that resides in has no element of an intent to remain.if it did require such an intent,of course,dual residency would be impossible,just as dual domicile is impossible.see,rosario,at a person may have only one domicile.we believe that congress used the term resides in consistently with how it used that term in denote residence rather than domicile.
a statute should be interpreted in a way that avoids absurd results.dauray,at see also united states wilson,d noting that absurd results are to be avoided armstrong paint varnish works.t o construe statutes so as to avoid results glaringly absurd,has long been a judicial function.the absurd results canon cited in dauray and relied on in wilson and armstrong paint is a rule of statutory construction that serves to help resolve ambiguity.dauray,at see also wilson,at.armstrong paint,at.
requiring the government to prove domicile could produce absurd results.consider annabelle and barry,both of whom have child support obligations regarding their respective children in new york and are in default on those obligations in excess of.annabelle lives only in new york.barry lives only in florida.if we assume that resides does not require an intent to remain,then,quite logically,only barry has criminal exposure under.
however,if we assume that resides requires an intent to remain,we must query the intents of annabelle and barry.assume now,additionally,that annabelle is from richmond,virginia,intends to return there,owns a home there,and has never had any intention of remaining permanently in new york.in fact,she hates new york and is quite vocal about it.assume also that barry is living in florida only because he could not find work in new york,but that barry is from new york city,thinks that life outside the city is boring,and intends to return there when the year is out.if resides denotes domicile,then annabelle may fall within the proscriptions of,simply because she loves richmond and has ties to her old home.barry,on the other hand,may escape the reach of,because he desperately hopes to return to new york at the end of the year.that annabelle may be prosecuted over barry on the basis of her longing for richmond is preposterous.it is also at odds with the focus of the offer federal criminal penalties against parents who willfully fail to honor their child support obligation and live in another state.regional affections may be many things,but rarely are they criminal.venturella conceded at oral argument that these results are absurd,and we can think of no way to rationalize them.
other courts share our appreciation of the absurdity of venturella view.at the district court,judge hurley illustrated the absurd results flowing from such an interpretation with the following hypothetical 
assume a parent resides in new york.he or she is the subject of a support obligation.assume further that the child is years of age.assume further that the obligation for support would terminate at the child birthday.now,if residence means domicile,it means that the parent would be able to move to utah and stay there for a year with no intention of having it as the permanent home.it is clearly not a domicile,and wait it out and come back to new york or go somewhere else.
judge hurley concluded that to interpret reside in to denote domicile,would essentially eviscerate the statute.likewise,the sixth circuit in namey noted 
a parent who dwells,but is not domiciled,in a different state from his children is nonetheless absent from the child state,and enforcement presents difficulties i t would make no sense to read the statute as imposing the strict domicile test,which excludes parents who merely reside in another state but present the same enforcement difficulties as if they were domiciled there.
at.the namey court thus concluded,nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended that the prosecution must prove a defendant domicile.id.at.we agree.
nonetheless,venturella suggests that the legislative history supports her interpretation of.it does not.section is the product of the child support recovery act of the csra,stat,as amended by the deadbeat parents punishment act of the dppa,stat.the legislative histories of these statutes confirm that targets those parents taking up residences away from their children rather than those parents intending to remain in,or return to,domiciles.thus,despite venturella contention that congress intended the proscriptions of to apply only to domiciliaries,we find,as the namey court found,no evidence that this is what congress intended.at.
the earliest versions of were not limited to domiciliaries or even residents.these drafts had no requirement that an obligation be with respect to a child who resides in another state.instead,the bills extended to any defendant outside the state in which such obligation is imposed,so long as the defendant fled a state for the purpose of avoiding child support.for instance,in march,representative henry hyde introduced,cong.the bill provided,inter alia,
whoever,for the purpose of avoiding payment of an arrearage under a legal child support obligation,leaves or remains outside the state in which such obligation is imposed,shall be punished 
id.although the bill never made it out of committee,senator daniel coats introduced a nearly identical bill in the senate in february,cong,explaining that the legislation would provide for the imposition of jail terms for those who ignore their legal child support obligation by fleeing and remaining outside the states in which the obligation is imposed.cong.rec.daily ed.over a year later,representative hyde introduced,cong,a measure identical to his own,and senator richard shelby introduced,cong,a bill substantially similar to the hyde bills.
senator shelby noted the severity of the challenge facing the country 
nationwide,billion in child support obligations remain uncollected.in,women were supposed to receive child support.less than half of these women received full payment,while received nothing at all.when looking at women and their children who live below the poverty line,these figures become even more alarming.clearly our society needs to take a stronger position on the abandonment of children.our country needs to make the enforcement of child support a major priority.
cong.rec.daily ed.may.he then explained that one of the greatest enforcement roadblocks was a uniquely interstate inability of states to garnish paychecks 
each state varies from another in laws and enforcement capabilities.although all states have laws giving local authorities the right to garnish paychecks and seize property of a delinquent parent,these laws are of little help when a runaway spouse crosses a state line.absent parents often avoid their child support responsibility by fleeing the state.
this legislation will crack down on state garnishment laws.the delinquent father will be less likely to flee a state to avoid child support payments when faced with the prospect of serving time in a federal penitentiary.
id.after shelby introduced,the bill remained idle for almost a year.
in the interim,an important study highlighted the problems that mothers faced when trying to collect from fathers who moved out of state.in january,the united states general accounting office gao published interstate child support mothers report receiving less support from fathers,available at.the report concluded that m others in interstate cases were less likely to receive support payments than those in cases.id.at.the gao had counted as interstate those cases in which mothers said a noncustodial father lived in a different state,id.at,but not those cases in which the noncustodial father residence was unknown,id.at.it noted that interstate enforcement is difficult whenever the noncustodial parent lives in a different state because s taff from multiple agencies in two or more jurisdictions must coordinate a variety of activities,communicate detailed information,and understand the varying laws,policies,and procedures.id.at.the gao report did not use domicile to define a father living place or residence.see id.at.
the report of the house committee on the judiciary referenced the gao report in discussing an amended version of.one of the amendments to changed the focus of the statute from a parent who fled the state to avoid paying child support to a parent who resides in a state outside the state of residence of the child.the amendment read 
whoever willfully fails to pay a past due support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state shall be punished 
the house committee on the judiciary reported the bill on august.id.its report stated 
addresses the problem of interstate enforcement of child support by taking the incentive out of moving interstate to avoid payment.the bill is designed to target interstate cases only.these are the cases which state officials report to be clearly the most difficult to enforce,especially the hard core group of parents who flagrantly refuse to pay and whom traditional extradition procedures have utterly failed to bring to justice.
the committee believes that a child should be able to expect the most basic support from those who chose to bring the child into the world.that expectation should not end at the state line.
id.at emphasis added.the report expressly referred to the gao report 
in spite of the improved collection efforts,the annual deficit in child support payments remains unacceptably high.this is especially true in interstate collection cases,where enforcement of support is particularly difficult.
according to the gao report,approximately of child support cases concern children whose father live in a different state and,thus,require interstate collection i nterstate extradition and enforcement remains a tedious,cumbersome and slow method of collection.
none of the various members of the house commenting on expressed any understanding that the bill was limited to parents with domiciles.instead,all indicated their expectation that the bill would penalize parents crossing state lines and expressed frustration at the difficulties of enforcing child support obligations of absent parents.thus,charles schumer complained of the snarls of redtape in interstate enforcement cases,cong.rec.daily ed,
at our hearings,we heard of instance after instance where spouses,usually husbands,did not want to pay,went to another state,waited just until the legal process was able to catch up with him,and then went to another state and started the procedure all over again.
we must help the states to collect the support these children desperately need by taking the incentive out of moving interstate to avoid payment.after all,simply put,a child right to support should not end at the state line.
id.representative hyde echoed these sentiments too often as soon as delinquent fathers move to new states,they seem to vanish as far as state enforcement agencies are concerned.it is not that states have no mechanisms available,it is that these mechanisms lose their effectiveness when a father moves to a new state.id.at.none of the representatives who spoke on behalf of the bill expressed any understanding indicating an expectation that resides would denote said,for instance,that the bill would target parents lacking the resoluteness to establish an domicile,or that the bill would target parents intent on remaining permanently in a particular jurisdiction 
indeed,the last member of congress to speak on returned to the garnishment problem that necessarily tracks one residence,not domicile.representative marilyn lloyd,a of the bill,emphasized that would put teeth in state garnishment laws.id.i n far too many cases,being awarded child support is not nearly the same as actually receiving child support payments.in fact,in,of women awarded child support received no money at all id.after her comments,the house passed the bill 
the legislative history of the csra clearly shows that congress understood that would apply to those interstate cases where a parent lived,and one of the major problems in interstate enforcement was an inability to garnish wages effectively.the csra would reinforce state garnishment laws by creating a strong incentive for parents to work or,of course,not to default willfully on their child support obligations.these concerns suggest that congress expected the csra to cover residents.no one ever mentioned domicile,any unique element of domicile,or any concern particular to domicile.
yet venturella suggests that the legislative history of the csra somehow demonstrates that congress intended resides to denote domicile.she again relies entirely on the district court opinion in h.in that opinion,judge weinstein concluded 
the legislative history demonstrates congressional concern with parents who flee child support orders,cross state lines and whom traditional extradition procedures utterly fail to bring to justice.this characterization of those the bill is intended to impact suggests that the technical meaning of resides in a case such as the instant one was domicile rather than reside.if a lax definition of reside were used,then the act would impact parents who reside in another state on a short and transient basis for business or other purposes,but who are available in the child home state for financial purposes.maintaining domicile requires substantial contact with the state of domicile,plus an intent to return.it seems unlikely that parents who maintain their domicile in the same state as does the child but a residence elsewhere would fit the description of parents the bill is intended to affect interstate cases,difficult to enforce support orders against absent parents,and hard core parents whom traditional extradition procedures have utterly failed to bring to justice.
wl,at.we disagree.
in our view,the court conclusion in is at odds with the legislative history.under that view of,a parent could reside without ever crossing state lines the parent could simply retain an domicile while continuing to live.such an interpretation contradicts previously noted congressional expectations.even the house report on which the court in relied presents the problem as one of parents liv ing in a different state,at.this case illustrates the point new york inability to garnish any of venturella wages after she moved to florida has nothing to do with her claims her domicile remained new everything to do with her new residence in florida where she worked and refused to honor her obligation to support her children.
indeed,if resides required proof of domicile,the csra would have been unable to address the very problem schumer said motivated the act instance after instance where spouses went to another state,waited just until the legal process was able to catch up and then went to another state.cong.rec.daily ed.if resides denoted domicile,it would require an intention to remain.no parent intending to reside in a state only until support collection authorities caught up with him would ever change his domicile to trigger.venturella interpretation would convert the very mischief at the heart of congressional concern into a defense to resides required domicile,a parent who proved that she only intended to maintain a residence in a particular state until the law caught up with her would be immune from liability under the csra.
second,we believe the court attributes a meaning to the phrase hard core that it can not bear.that phrase appeared in the report of the house committee on the judiciary and referred to parents who flagrantly refuse to pay and whom traditional extradition procedures have utterly failed to bring to justice,at.it explained that such procedures remain a tedious,cumbersome and slow method of collection.id.hard core did not refer to a parent intent to remain permanently.it referred to a flagrant refusal to pay child support and a willingness to live elsewhere to effectuate that goal.accordingly,the csra captured both of those elements it required a willful failure to pay child support and that a parent reside.
moreover,we do not view residence as a more lax definition than domicile.the court in noted that if resides required residence then the act would impact parents who reside in another state on a short and transient basis for business or other purposes,wl,at.that misconstrues residence,which,as we explained in rosario,generally requires an established abode,permanent for a time.at.furthermore,a rule that all residents may be prosecuted under is no more lax than a rule that all domiciliaries may be prosecuted.it simply identifies a different set of parents.
our conclusions remain unaltered by the amendments to,which came in the form of the dppa.the dppa substituted subsections a through a for the former section a of.the amended statute distinguishes between those persons willfully failing to pay support obligations with respect to a child who resides in another state for over a year or greater than and those doing so for over two years or greater than,increasing the punishment for the latter group.a,c.it also provides that persons merely traveling in interstate or foreign commerce may be punished under,so long as they intend to evade support obligations for over a year or greater than.a.although venturella makes no arguments premised on the legislative history of the dppa,we have reviewed that history and find it consistent with our interpretation of under the csra.
venturella presents a final argument.she argues that we must apply the rule of lenity to construe the statute in her favor.we need not and do not.t he point of the rule of lenity is for statutes to serve as a fair warning in language that the common world will understand.united states canales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the rule requires the sentencing court to impose the lesser of two penalties where there is an actual ambiguity over which penalty should apply.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court has explained 
the rule of lenity,however,is not applicable unless there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the act,such that even after a court has seized every thing from which aid can be derived,it is still left with an ambiguous statute.the rule of lenity comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what congress has expressed,not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.
chapman united states,d internal quotations marks and citations omitted.t he meaning of language is inherently contextual and the supreme court has always reserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute intended scope even after resort to the language and structure,legislative history,and motivating policies of the statute.dauray,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the doctrine is thus one of last resort.see also united states ramirez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here we are confronted not with a grievous ambiguity in a statute but,rather,with a word susceptible to two meanings,one,which in context is absurd,and the other,which in context is consistent with the term usage in another criminal statute and with congressional expectations.the rule of lenity is inapplicable.see united states kavoukian,cir t he rule of lenity is not applicable where,as here,congress intention can be discovered.
for these reasons,we reject venturella argument that the district court erred in its instruction to the jury on the meaning of resides.
the district court failure to hold unconstitutionally vague was not plain error 
venturella argues,given the failure to define residence sic,the average person and venturella,as well,could not possibly be on notice that their travels would result in a federal criminal prosecution sic.venturella did not challenge the vagueness of the statute before the district court.united states rybicki,cir en banc,cert denied,d.reviewing,therefore,for plain error,see.b,we find none.
this court explained our plain error analysis in united states thomas,cir en banc 
the framework of the analysis for plain error pursuant to rule b is the test set forth in united states olano,d.before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
id.internal quotations marks and citations omitted.for an error to be plain,it must,at a minimum,be clear under current law.united states weintraub,cir internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,it must be so obvious at the time of appellate consideration that a trial judge and prosecutor would be derelict in permitting it in a trial held today.thomas,at quoting united states gore,cir.
the vagueness doctrine is a manifestation of the fair warning requirement.united states lanier,d.thus,it is very much akin to the rule of lenity,which the supreme court has termed a sort of junior version of the vagueness doctrine.id.at.internal quotations marks omitted.generally,the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d.we have held that when the interpretation of a statute does not implicate first amendment rights,it is assessed for vagueness only in light of the specific facts of the case at hand and not with regard to the statute facial validity.see rybicki,at internal quotation marks omitted.one whose conduct is clearly proscribed by the statute can not successfully challenge it for vagueness.id.
viewed in a light most favorable to the government,the evidence at trial established that venturella took an unpaid leave of absence from her teaching job in new york on march,shortly after her employer notified her that her salary would be garnished for child support,left new york and lived in florida between the fall of and may,and failed to pay over in child support to her children in new york during that time.based on these facts,we find that the csra gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know that this conduct constituted a fail ure to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state under a and is therefore prohibited by law.accordingly,we find no plain error.
the district court failure to instruct the jury on a dual residency defense was not plain error 
judge hurley instructed the jury they could find venturella guilty if they found,inter alia,that her children resided in new york and that she resided in another state for some period within the time frame charged in the indictment.venturella argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on what she terms a dual residency instruction.the instruction would explain that venturella could not be guilty of violating if she resided in both florida and new york.venturella concedes that our review is for plain error.applying that standard,we reject her argument.
we know of no case holding subject to a dual residency defense.indeed,our treatment of a a firearms statute,and the only other provision using the term resides to define a federal that we would reject such a defense.in matteo,a defendant contended that by virtue of his dual residency in both the state in which he purchased the guns and the state into which he transported the guns,he is exempt from the proscriptions of the statute.at.as noted above,we rejected the dual residency defense,explaining that t o exempt the defendant before this court from the proscriptions of a would not be consistent with the congressional purpose.id.at.we noted that t he actions of
