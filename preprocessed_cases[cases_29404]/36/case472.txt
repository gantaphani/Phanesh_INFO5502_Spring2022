background 
legislative background 
in,congress passed the utah enabling act,which demanded as a condition of statehood that utah enact an irrevocable ordinance preserving the security of religious beliefs,but forever prohibiting polygamous or plural marriages.see act of july,ch,stat,that perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured,and that no inhabitant of said state shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or her mode of religious worship provided,that polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited.emphasis in original.utah complied with this requirement,and,in,a nearly identical version of this proscription was included in article iii of utah constitution 
the following ordinance shall be irrevocable without the consent of the united states and the people of this state 
first perfect toleration of religious sentiment is guaranteed.no inhabitant of this state shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or her mode of religious worship but polygamous or plural marriages are forever prohibited.
utah const.art.iii.
the constitutional prohibition of polygamous or plural marriages has spawned civil and criminal legislation.see state holm,utah,cert.denied,d.on the criminal side,utah enacted an statute which reads as follows 
a person is guilty of bigamy when,knowing he has a husband or wife or knowing the other person has a husband or wife,the person purports to marry another person or cohabits with another person.
bigamy is a felony of the third degree.
it shall be a defense to bigamy that the accused reasonably believed he and the other person were legally eligible to remarry.
utah code ann.
the supreme court of utah has interpreted the term marry in as relating to both legally recognized marriages and those that are non.holm,at.it also has interpreted the word cohabit in in its colloquial sense,as meaning to dwell together as,or as if,husband or wife or to live together in a sexual relationship,especially when not legally married.state green,utah internal quotation marks omitted quoting the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed,and webster new dictionary,concise edition.
with respect to civil legislation,of the utah code declares void and prohibited any marriage involving a person with a husband or wife living,from whom the person marrying has not been divorced.utah code ann.a county clerk is barred from issuing a marriage license for a prohibited marriage.id.in fact,utah makes it a crime for a clerk or deputy clerk to knowingly issue a license for any prohibited marriage.id.an offender is subject to confinement in the state prison for a term not exceeding two years to a fine in any sum not exceeding.id.no marriage may be solemnized without a license issued by the county clerk.id.
factual background 
plaintiffs subscribe to the religious doctrine of plural marriages,which they define as a man having more than one wife,similar to that practiced by the church of jesus christ of saints in utah prior to.app.at,
plaintiffs,cook and bronson,applied for a marriage license and paid the filing fee to a deputy clerk at the marriage division of the salt lake county clerk office in salt lake city,utah.the application indicated that cook was already married to cook.in addition,cook orally informed two deputy clerks that he desired to legally marry a second wife and that cook consented to this marriage.swensen,the elected clerk of salt lake county,instructed the two deputy clerks to deny the application and to inform plaintiffs that plural marriage in utah is illegal.the clerk office refunded the filing fee.
procedural background 
plaintiffs filed suit under against swensen and the two deputy clerks,alleging that they violated plaintiffs federal constitutional rights,including their rights to the free exercise of religion,to intimate expression and association,and to privacy.plaintiffs sought nominal damages,a declaratory judgment,and injunctive relief.
subsequently,the parties agreed to seek the dismissal of the two deputy clerks.they also stipulated that swensen acted under color of state law in denying the application.plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.and,in response,swensen filed a for summary judgment.
after officially dismissing the deputy clerks from the action,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of swensen.the district court determined that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the constitutionality of of article iii of the utah constitution,of the utah enabling act,and.the district court then applied controlling supreme court precedent,reynolds united states,and controlling tenth circuit precedent,potter murray city,cir,to uphold the constitutionality of the contested provisions.the district court reasoned that supreme court jurisprudence reynolds and potter,including lawrence texas,d,did not suggest a different outcome.
plaintiffs filed a motion asking the district court to reconsider its decision.the district court denied that motion.and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to swensen on their claims,arguing that the district court erred in failing to find the existence of a constitutional violation.we hold that plaintiffs have forfeited their claims contesting the constitutionality of utah civil prohibition of polygamy.we further hold that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their claims against swensen based upon the alleged unconstitutionality of utah criminal prohibition of polygamy.
scope of the appeal 
an appellant opening brief must identify appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.fed.a a.consistent with this requirement,we routinely have declined to consider arguments that are not raised,or are inadequately presented,in an appellant opening brief.see exum united states olympic,cir scattered statements in the appellant brief are not enough to preserve an issue for appeal.gross burggraf constr,cir refusing to consider challenge to grant of summary judgment covering title vii retaliation claim because,although appellant maintained at oral argument that she was asserting a retaliation claim,this issue was not adequately briefed.stated differently,the omission of an issue in an opening brief generally forfeits appellate consideration of that issue.see wyoming livingston,cir,cert.denied,d anderson dep t of labor,cir.
we conclude that plaintiffs opening brief does not adequately raise and pursue an argument as to the unconstitutionality of utah civil prohibition of polygamous marriages.for instance,plaintiffs statement of issues on appeal,while referencing of the utah enabling act and of article iii of the utah constitution,does not expressly seek to invalidate utah civil statutes prohibiting polygamous marriages.see anderson,at issue not raised in statement of issues in initial brief is waived on appeal.instead,it refers to the enabling act and article iii in connection with plaintiffs attack on the constitutionality of utah criminal bigamy statute,
furthermore,plaintiffs opening brief does not attempt to explain why utah refusal to give civil recognition to polygamous marriages should be held to contravene their constitutional rights.instead,plaintiffs opening brief is dedicated entirely to establishing the invalidity of utah criminal prohibition of is,to seek ing an end to the criminalization of the practice of religious polygamy,regardless of whether no legal marital rights are afforded to a second or third spouse.aplt.br.at emphasis added.plaintiffs do state in two places that they also challenge the validity of swensen refusal to grant a marriage license,based upon the unconstitutionality of utah civil prohibition of polygamy.see id.at.but these cursory statements,without supporting analysis and case law,fail to constitute the kind of briefing that is necessary to avoid application of the forfeiture doctrine.see adler stores,cir arguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived gross,at holding that plaintiff who ha d not adequately briefed th e issue of retaliation in employment discrimination action forfeited it plaintiff brief contain ed one paragraph in which she refers to retaliation but did not submit any argument,cite relevant case law,or alert us to any part of the record that demonstrates retaliatory conduct.
in essence,plaintiffs opening brief simply attempts to use swensen denial of a marriage license as a vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of utah criminal prohibition of polygamy.we therefore conclude that plaintiffs have forfeited any argument that utah refusal to give civil recognition to polygamous marriages is unconstitutional 
constitutionality of utah criminal prohibition of polygamy 
plaintiffs substantive challenge to utah criminal prohibition of polygamy faces a litany of seemingly insurmountable precedential obstacles.case law upholding the criminalization of polygamy from constitutional attack dates back at least to,when in reynolds united states,the supreme court rejected a free exercise challenge to the morrill act of.more contemporary decisions from the supreme court and from this court have acknowledged the continued validity of reynolds.see lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah,d citing reynolds as support for the proposition that adverse impact on religion from operation of legislative enactment does not translate into impermissible religious targeting where a social harm may have been a legitimate concern of government for reasons quite apart from discrimination grace united methodist church city of cheyenne,cir citing reynolds with approval.
similarly,constitutional challenges to utah criminal statute outlawing polygamy,utah code,have failed.in potter,this court relied upon reynolds in rejecting attacks that were premised upon the due process and free exercise clauses of the united states constitution.see potter,at.and the utah supreme court recently invoked reynolds and potter in holding that a defendant conviction under did not violate his rights to association,to the free exercise of religion,and to substantive due process,as guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.holm,at see also green,at applying reynolds and potter to reject federal free exercise challenge to.
despite this wealth of controlling and persuasive precedent,we conclude that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to resolve plaintiffs claims against swensen based upon utah criminal prohibition of polygamy.we hold that these only claims at issue in this to present a justiciable case or controversy within the meaning of article iii of the united states constitution.
standard for constitutional standing 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision as to standing.see aid for women foulston,cir.article iii of the united states constitution restricts the jurisdiction of federal courts to the adjudication of cases or controversies.const.art.iii,cl.to establish a case or controversy,a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating 
it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d see lujan defenders of wildlife,d tandy city of wichita,cir.put simply,a plaintiff must establish three elements an,causation,and redressability.see finstuen crutcher,wl,at cir noting that article iii standing requires that a plaintiff establish,causation,and redressability.
each plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief in each claim.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d friends of the earth,at.standing at the summary judgment stage must be supported by specific evidentiary facts and not by mere allegations.phelps hamilton,cir citing lujan,at.see tandy,at.
district court analysis 
without distinguishing between utah criminal prohibition of polygamy and its civil prohibition of polygamy,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had standing.its analysis was predicated upon three points that plaintiffs injury was not the threat of imminent prosecution,but,instead,the denial of the legal right to practice polygamy,app.at that a causal nexus existed between this and swensen denial of a marriage license in reliance upon utah prohibition of polygamy and that a favorable opinion would redress plaintiffs injury,as the contested provisions would be held unconstitutional and the marriage license would issue.for the reasons detailed below,we conclude that the district court erred with respect to the claims.
plaintiffs standing to challenge utah criminal prohibition of polygamy 
we hold that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating constitutional standing to seek prospective or retrospective relief based upon the alleged unconstitutionality of utah criminal prohibition of polygamy.
prospective relief 
on appeal,plaintiffs press for prospective relief in the form of a declaratory judgment that,inter alia,the challenged criminal,the provisions of unconstitutional.plaintiffs complaint also requests an injunction prohibiting the future enforcement of the criminal enactments.under the facts of this case,both forms of prospective relief trigger the same standing analysis.see tandy,at.furthermore,we may perform this analysis collectively under the circumstances present here each plaintiff asserts the same,the threat of prosecution under,based upon a shared intent to enter into a polygamous relationship 
plaintiffs argue on appeal that they possess standing to challenge utah criminal prohibition of polygamy due to their fear of criminal prosecution,including the stigma of being branded as a.aplt.br.at emphasis in original see aplt.reply br.at.a plaintiff challenging the validity of a criminal statute under which he has not been prosecuted must show a real and immediate threat of his future prosecution under that statute to satisfy the injury in fact requirement.utah,cir quoting faustin city county of denver,cir.
this requirement also has been characterized as a credible threat of prosecution,one that arises from an objectively justified fear of real consequences,at see initiative referendum inst.walker,cir en banc,cert denied,d see also finstuen,at,wl,at in a plea for injunctive relief,a plaintiff can not maintain standing by asserting an injury based merely on subjective apprehensions that the defendant might act unlawfully.quoting city of los angeles lyons,d winsness yocom,cir the mere presence on the statute books of an unconstitutional statute,in the absence of enforcement or the credible threat of enforcement,does not entitle anyone to sue,even if they allege an inhibiting effect on constitutionally protected conduct prohibited by the statute.
as suggested by this standard,a plaintiff need not risk actual prosecution before challenging an allegedly unconstitutional criminal statute.see,ward utah,cir noting that a plaintiff may have standing even if they have never been prosecuted.standing may still exist even when a plaintiff ends the proscribed behavior,so long as a credible threat remains that such behavior,if taken in the future,would be prosecuted.see,medimmune,genentech,d.
the credible threat test begs further inquiry into what constitutes the requisite degree of likelihood of enforcement to confer standing to bring a particular claim.see seegars gonzales.to the extent clarity prevails only at the poles,case law illuminates those claims for prospective relief that occupy the ends of the continuum.
at the credible threat pole lies claims brought after the entity responsible for enforcing the challenged statute actually threatens a particular plaintiff with arrest or even prosecution.see steffel thompson,d vietnam war protester has standing to bring claim for declaratory relief attacking constitutionality of georgia criminal trespass law after being warned to stop handbilling and being threatened with arrest and prosecution,and after companion was arrested and arraigned doctor john,city of roy,cir adult bookstore faces credible threat of prosecution under city ordinance requiring licensing of sexually oriented businesses when city sends letter stating that bookstore must complete application for license or appropriate legal action will be commenced.
these claims can be juxtaposed with those situated at the no credible threat end of the spectrum.there,the affirmative assurances of from a governmental actor responsible for enforcing the challenged statute prevents a threat of prosecution from maturing into a credible one,even when the plaintiff previously has been arrested under the statute.see mink suthers,cir no credible threat of prosecution when district attorney authored no file letter disavowing intent to prosecute under challenged statute,even though no file letter conceivably might not bind other district attorneys winsness,at,no standing to bring claim for injunctive and declaratory relief when plaintiffs received sworn assurances from county prosecutors that flag abuse statute would not be enforced against them or anyone else,despite fact that one plaintiff experienced a brief prosecution under the statute peta rasmussen,cir no standing to assert claims for prospective relief when defendants admitted that they threatened plaintiff members with arrest due to misinterpretation of challenged statute and plaintiff failed to indicate intention to stage protests at institutions faustin city county of denver,cir no standing to assert claim for injunctive relief against future prosecution under ordinance in light of city prosecutor determination that plaintiff conduct which led to arrest did not violate challenged ordinance.
in addition,the credibility of a threat is diluted when a factual dissimilarity exists between the plaintiff intended future conduct and the conduct that triggered any prior prosecutions under the challenged statute.see,at plaintiff lacks standing to bring civil rights suit challenging utah statute because plaintiff can not show a real threat of prosecution in the face of assurances of from the government merely by pointing to a single past prosecution of a different person for different conduct emphasis added.
plaintiffs claims for prospective relief based upon utah criminal prohibition of polygamy lie closer to the no credible threat end of the continuum.plaintiffs were never charged,prosecuted,or directly threatened with prosecution under.moreover,the alleged credibility of plaintiffs fear is contradicted by their repeated admission that utah criminal law against polygamy is not being enforced.aplt.br.at see id.at.it is further belied by the policy statement of the utah attorney general office that it has decided to focus law enforcement efforts on crimes within the polygamous communities that involve child abuse,domestic violence and fraud,rather than enforcing against consensual polygamous relationships involving adults.utah and arizona attorney generals offices,the primer helping victims of domestic violence and child abuse in polygamous communities at june,available at.pdf.plaintiffs also failed to allege or demonstrate that swensen even if she had the power to do so is likely to enforce utah criminal laws against plaintiffs in the future.see rasmussen,at finding absence of in part because plaintiff did not allege that these defendants would be likely to enforce challenged statute against them in the future.
plaintiffs rely upon two recent state prosecutions under and justify the objective reasonableness of their fear.however,the defendants in these prosecutions had committed independent crimes in connection with forming their respective polygamous relationships.see holm,at,noting that defendant was charged and convicted of bigamy and unlawful sexual conduct with minor green,at noting that defendant was charged and convicted not only of bigamy but also of criminal nonsupport and rape of a child.these cases therefore involved remarkably different facts than those present in this litigation,where no independent crime would attend the formation of plaintiffs polygamous relationship plaintiffs are all adults and profess a desire to enter into a consensual polygamous relationship.see,at.accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs can not establish the first requirement of article iii.
ii.causation 
even if plaintiffs fear was based upon a credible threat of prosecution,such that they are suffering a injury,they could not satisfy the second requirement of.the principle of causation for constitutional standing requires a plaintiff injury to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.nova health gandy,cir internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added quoting lujan,at.although a defendant alleged misconduct need not be the proximate cause of a plaintiff harm,article iii does at least require proof of a substantial likelihood that the defendant conduct caused plaintiff injury in fact.id.emphasis added.
it is that when a plaintiff brings a challenge to the constitutionality of a particular statutory provision,the causation element of standing requires the named defendants to possess authority to enforce the provision.see,socialist workers party leahy,cir in a suit such as this one,where the plaintiff seeks a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a state statute and an injunction against its enforcement,a state officer,in order to be an appropriate defendant,must,at a minimum,have some connection with enforcement of the provision at issue.see also okpalobi foster,cir en banc abortion providers lack standing to sue louisiana governor and attorney general for declaratory and injunctive relief based upon unconstitutionality of louisiana state tort statute authorizing private cause of action because defendants lack authority to enforce statute shell oil noel,cir noting that an officer of a state is an appropriate defendant if he has some connection with the enforcement of the act charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at supp hereinafter,federal practice commenting on cases that view the identification of the proper governmental defendant as a standing issue and at times focus explicitly on the causal nexus between the official role and the claimed injury.
