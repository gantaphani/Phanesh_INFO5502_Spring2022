in this appeal,we conclude that a stipulation signed by the parties attorneys agreeing to transfer exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order from texas to california is valid and enforceable even though it was not signed by the litigating parties themselves.
legal background 
this case involves the uniform interstate family support act uifsa,an act adopted by both texas and california,et cal,et uifsa was designed to ensure that only one state at a time would have jurisdiction to make and modify a child support order.t he central jurisdictional feature of uifsa is the concept of continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.under uifsa,a court that makes a valid child support order retains exclusive jurisdiction to modify the order as long as the requirements for continuing,exclusive jurisdiction remain fulfilled.the court of another state may enforce a child support order registered in that state,but may not modify it unless the decree state has lost its continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.kirkland et,cal.family law practice and procedure ed,fn.omitted see also stone davis th,d.
under uifsa,after a support order issued by another state has been registered in california,a california court may modify that order when,among other instances,one of the parties resides in the issuing state and all of the parties file a written consent in the issuing state court authorizing california to assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction.the relevant statute as currently adopted in california,section,reads in relevant part 
a after a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state,the responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if section does not apply concerns when all of the parties reside in california and after notice and hearing if it finds that 
the child,or a party who is an individual,is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state and all of the parties who are individuals have filed written consents in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over the order,subd.a.
the parties cite us to no published case,and we are aware of none,that determines whether a written consent under section must be signed by the actual parties or whether it can be signed by the parties attorneys.
in,plaintiff steven knabe and defendant ricque brister lived in texas.that year,the texas district court declared that knabe was the father of a child born to brister.the court awarded physical custody of the child to brister,established knabe visitation rights,and ordered knabe to pay child support.
shortly after the texas court entered its order,brister and the child moved to chico,california.knabe continues to reside in texas.in july,knabe registered the texas court order with the butte county superior court.
on september,brister petitioned the california court to modify the texas order by granting her sole custody and restricting knabe visitation rights.knabe initially opposed the petition by arguing that california lacked jurisdiction to modify the texas order.he submitted copies of motions to modify and enforce the texas order he had filed in the texas court on september.he claimed brister had also filed a motion in the texas court to transfer venue.he declared the texas court had refused to transfer venue.
however,on december,attorneys for both knabe and brister executed and filed with the butte county superior court a stipulation purporting to transfer jurisdiction of this matter from texas to california.the stipulation reads in full 
the petitioner,steven knabe,by and through his attorney,melanie howell,and the respondent,ricque brister,by and through her attorney,randy bakke,hereby stipulate as follows 
that the california courts shall have jurisdiction over this matter for all purposes including,but not limited to,jurisdiction to modify the texas court order,and to make such orders as the court deems appropriate concerning custody,visitation and support of the minor child who is the subject of the texas action and 
the petitioner,steven knabe,hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction of the california courts.
the stipulation is signed by the parties respective attorneys.it is not signed by the parties themselves.
from this point,knabe opposed brister petition to modify visitation on the merits.he did not challenge the california court jurisdiction.indeed,he asked the california court to grant him primary physical custody.ultimately,the california court issued an order affecting visitation.
a few years passed.in march,brister filed a motion with the butte county superior court seeking to modify the texas court order provisions on child support.
in response,knabe filed a motion to set aside the stipulation to the extent it transferred jurisdiction over child support issues from texas to california.knabe declared that he never authorized his attorney in to consent to california jurisdiction over child support.he declared he had authorized his counsel to stipulate to california jurisdiction only for the issues of custody and visitation.he stated he never saw a copy of the stipulation until.he also argued the stipulation was not enforceable because a settlement regarding a substantial right must be signed by the parties themselves.
brister argued the stipulation granted california continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over all matters contained in the texas order,including child support.she introduced evidence showing the california court had forwarded the stipulation to the texas court just days after the stipulation had been executed,and the texas court had filed the stipulation.the texas court had stamped the california judge cover letter as filed,and that letter referenced the enclosed stipulation.
in response,knabe submitted evidence showing the texas court file on this matter contained no order transferring jurisdiction to california.the stipulation was filed in the case file general correspondence section,but it was not noted on the docket sheet.
the butte county court denied knabe motion to set aside the stipulation the court finds that knabe attorney had authority,as part of the general authority of any retained counsel,to submit knabe to the jurisdiction of this court for purposes of child support and that such stipulation did not affect an essential right of knabe.the court determined the stipulation was on file in the texas court,and that it satisfied the requirements of section as a written consent by all of the parties agreeing to california assuming and exercising continuing exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of child support in this matter.
discussion 
knabe appeals from the trial court order.he claims the stipulation consenting to california jurisdiction over the texas child support order is invalid because it involves a substantial legal right and was required to be signed by the actual parties he did not give his attorney authority to consent to transferring jurisdiction over the child support order and it does not comply with the requirements of code of civil procedure section.in the absence of a valid stipulation,he also argues that california lacks sufficient minimum contacts to have personal jurisdiction over him.
our resolution of knabe first argument disposes his remaining arguments.
substantial legal right 
knabe argues the stipulation did not satisfy the requirements of section.he claims the statute requirement that all of the parties file written consents in the issuing tribunal to california jurisdiction must be read to require the consents be signed by the party litigants.this,he says,is because consenting to another state jurisdiction over a child support order involves a substantial right to which his attorney could not stipulate without his consent.we disagree.
the word parties is susceptible to more than one interpretation.depending upon the statutory context in which it is used,the word can mean the litigant and the litigant attorney,or it can mean only the specific person by or against whom legal proceedings are brought.levy superior court cal th,d,levy.to determine which meaning applies,w
