appellant donated her eggs so that her lesbian partner,could bear a child through in vitro fertilization.the couple orally agreed that only would be the only parent unless and until there was a formal adoption.gave birth to twins,and both women took on parental responsibilities adoption proceedings,however,were never initiated.while does not dispute that,the birth mother,qualifies as the children parent,she argues that as the genetic mother,she,too,qualifies as a parent entitled to custody and visitation.because we believe that the intention test set out in johnson calvert cal th,d,johnson governs and because substantial evidence supports the trial court factual finding that only intended to bring about the birth of a child whom she intended to raise as her own,we conclude that does not qualify as a parent under the uniform parentage act,et.
factual and procedural history 
in accordance with established principles of appellate review,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court judgment,resolving all conflicts and drawing all inferences in favor of the judgment.rodney karen th,d.
and entered into an intimate relationship in june and began living together in march.they registered as domestic partners in san francisco in october.well before her relationship with,had explored ways of having a child on her own,including artificial insemination and adoption.told of her efforts to become a single parent,and was encouraging and supportive.the parties discussed and agreed that intention was to have a child of her own.a mutual friend of theirs was then involved in a child custody dispute with her lesbian partner,and wanted to avoid any such battle.
during the period from july to november,was unsuccessfully artificially inseminated at fertility clinics times.accompanied to all the appointments and reviewed the potential sperm donors with.in december,was referred to a fertility practice at medical center.attempts at in vitro fertilization using eggs and sperm from a donor failed,because was unable to produce enough eggs to achieve pregnancy.at this same time,was having problems with fibroids in her uterus and was seen by the same medical group at doctor suggested that might want to attempt in vitro fertilization with eggs.was reluctant to do so because the couple relationship was still new,and she did not want a custody battle in the future with eventually,however,asked to donate her eggs,provided that would be a real donor and would be the only mother.the parties discussed the possibility of a future adoption by said she would consider adoption by but not for at least five years,when she felt the relationship was stable and permanent.agreed to terms.
in february,received in the mail from consent forms for both an ovum donor and an ovum recipient.the introductory paragraph of the consent form for ovum donor known provides i will agree to have eggs taken from my ovaries,in order that they may be donated to another woman.under the heading what will happen to me,a detailed description of the egg retrieval process concludes with the sentence,the recipient will have control over the disposition of all retrieved eggs and resulting embryos.on page,the same page where the donor is required to fill in blanks about the donor medical history,the form states it is understood that i waive any right and relinquish any claim to the donated eggs or any pregnancy or offspring that might result from them.i agree that the recipient may regard the donated eggs and any offspring resulting therefrom as her own children.on page,the signature page,the form states i specifically disclaim and waive any rights in or to any child that may be conceived as a result of the use of any ovum or egg of mine,and i agree not to attempt to discover the identity of the recipient thereof.i waive the right of relationship or inheritance with respect to any child born of this procedure 
and reviewed the forms with each other in the weeks prior to signing.told she was relying on the provision concerning relinquishment of parental rights.the standard procedure for egg donation at called for the egg donor to meet with a psychologist for counseling.and attended the counseling session together on february.after meeting with the counselor,and talked about what they would disclose publicly about the parentage of a child formed from donated eggs.they agreed to tell the child eventually that was the genetic mother,but they agreed that would decide when it was appropriate to do so.they also agreed not to tell other people that was the egg donor and to reveal only that was the mother.
on march,the parties went to to begin the procedure for retrieval of eggs.at the hospital,was given a copy of the ovum donor consent form to review and sign.signed the form and then had blood drawn,the first step in the egg retrieval procedure.
in april,about a month after signing the ovum donor consent form,underwent the egg retrieval procedure at three days after that procedure,gave an easter card with a picture of eggs on the front and with a handwritten note inside to my boss,a most memorable easter that we share together,a gift of unconditional love and of life.eggs were fertilized in vitro with sperm from an anonymous donor,and four of the resulting embryos were implanted in uterus.the procedure was successful,and became pregnant with twin girls.in september,gave a card stating i look so forward to the day that i meet your two daughters.underscoring in original.
gave birth to the twins on december.soon afterward,asked to marry her,and on christmas day the couple exchanged rings.
the hospital records from the time of the delivery refer to the parents in the plural,both moms in to visit.however,listed only herself on the birth certificates as the mother,and the children were given surname.was also listed as the only parent on the children baptismal certificates.was not mentioned during the baptism ceremony.within a month of their birth,added the children as beneficiaries to her health care,dental,vision,and life insurance plans and to her retirement plan.had a life insurance policy and small retirement plan,but she did not change the beneficiaries to name the children 
before the twins were born,some friends held a baby shower honoring both and.after the birth,and,as a couple,received other congratulatory cards and gifts.but never revealed to her friends or family that was the egg donor.nor did disclose that she was genetically related to the children,even though the children came to refer to parents as granny and papa.
for the next five years,and and the twins continued to live together as a family unit.there is no dispute that acted as an affectionate mother to the girls,and that the girls are emotionally attached to her.the couple agreed to refer to as muma and to as boss or her first name,and those are the terms the girls came to use and purchased a house together in marin county and enrolled the children in preschool there.listed as a on the school enrollment forms.however,it was who signed the enrollment forms and paid the preschool tuition.both and took the children to pediatric appointments.however,they never revealed to the children pediatrician that was genetically related to the girls.
in the parties argued about whether or how to tell the girls that they were genetically related to asserted she would never tell them and insisted she was their only mother.referred to the waiver of rights on the ovum donor consent form and told she had no legal rights without adoption.in,as the girls fifth birthday approached,became insistent that she wanted to adopt,but had misgivings.the couple also disagreed about relocating to massachusetts.by march,the couple had separated,and filed a notice of termination of the domestic partnership.filed a petition to establish a parental relationship with the girls,seeking,among other things,to prevent from taking the children to massachusetts.she voluntarily dismissed that petition in july,when she and resumed living together and tried to resolve their differences.and then continued to live together until august,when moved with the girls to massachusetts.listed as a parent on the massachusetts school forms.and each paid half the tuition for the massachusetts school.
in february,filed a new petition to establish a parental relationship.she also sought joint custody.in response,filed a motion to quash and dismiss the petition on the ground that lacked standing to assert parentage.pending trial,the parties stipulated to orders for visitation by in massachusetts.
testimony at trial created a sharp conflict in the evidence.testified that from the beginning of their relationship she and planned to have children together.was to bear the child,because was not able to carry a child.denied any discussion with that would be the sole parent.however,conceded that when they met,was actively trying to get pregnant and adoption application did not involve her.she also conceded that was reluctant at first to have children with because their relationship was too new.testified that reluctance to use eggs was based on a concern that the child would resemble and then would have to reveal to her own mother that she is a lesbian.
acknowledged that before the egg retrieval procedure the parties had many conversations about egg donation and about adoption.testified that both she and intended to be the parents of any child formed from eggs.also testified,on the one hand,that the parties discussed the need for adoption to make a parent,and,on the other hand,that she believed adoption was unnecessary because of her genetic connection to the children.denied any agreement that the children would be alone.
denied going over the ovum donor consent form with in advance of signing.she testified that she first received the form at the hospital and signed it within minutes,believing it was a pro forma matter that was necessary to proceed with the egg retrieval.has a master degree and conceded that she understood the language of the donor consent form.she was aware of the language concerning relinquishment of parental rights and understood that her legal rights were affected by the form.however,she did not intend to relinquish her parental rights she thought the language of the donor form would not apply to her because she knew the recipient.she made no request to or to to change the form.she did understand and agree that would have control of any embryos formed through in vitro fertilization.
denied that the parties had an agreement about disclosing genetic connection to the children.however,she acknowledged that,with one exception,she did not tell anyone,even her own family,that she was the egg donor until her relationship with ended.in,when she and began having disagreements about telling the children,told one friend that could not have become pregnant without her,but did not directly say she was the egg donor.in,told her therapist and the friend that she was the egg donor.and in,as her relationship with was ending and after the couple had attended counseling sessions,told the children,over objection,that she was their genetic mother.
after a trial,the trial court issued a lengthy and thoughtful opinion buttressed with numerous factual findings,resolving the disputed facts and concluding that was not a legal parent.the trial court found that relinquished her claim to parentage when she knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently signed the ovum donor consent form.further,the court found that the parties agreed would be the sole parent and their agreement was not modified by their conduct.accordingly,the court ruled that lacked standing,and the court granted motion to quash and dismiss the petition.appeals.
discussion 
introduction 
the uniform parentage act upa was adopted by the legislature in to eliminate the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.see johnson,supra,cal th at,d.the act provides a means of establishing the parent and child relationship,which is defined as the legal relationship existing between a child and the child natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights,privileges,duties,and obligations.the upa is not confined to a determination of paternity.under the act,the parent and child relationship expressly includes the mother and child relationship,subd.a.although the act was not adopted to resolve issues that arise under modern reproductive technology,our supreme court has said that the act should be used even for the rare case such as the one before us in which,because of new biological possibilities,a child maternity is in dispute.johnson,at,d.
though we affirm the trial court,we disagree with its ruling that lacked standing to bring the action to determine parentage under the upa.the upa provides that a ny interested person may bring an action under the upa to determine the existence of a mother and child relationship.two appellate courts have held that the lesbian partner of a child natural mother,being genetically unrelated to the child,is not an interested party and has no standing to bring the mother into court under the upa.west superior court th,d curiale reagan d.but see nancy michele d,fn.nancy.similarly,two other courts have held that the wife of a sperm provider,with no genetic relationship to the child,is not an interested party under the upa.robert susan th,d doe th,d.in johnson,however,the supreme court impliedly recognized that a woman with genetic consanguinity has a colorable claim to parentage and qualifies as an interested party in a parentage dispute with the birth mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.here,in light of genetic connection to the children,we conclude that qualified as an interested party for purposes of obtaining a judicial declaration of her status as a parent.
on the merits,however,as we explain,the trial court properly concluded after a full evidentiary hearing that was the only legally recognized parent under the upa.once the trial court made the substantive determination that was not a legal parent,the court lost jurisdiction to award custody or visitation to her and properly dismissed petition.west superior court,supra,th at,d curiale reagan,supra,d at.
ii.the natural mother the johnson test 
the upa recognizes a legal parental relationship for two kinds of parents natural and adoptive,johnson,supra,cal th at,d,see also nancy,supra,d at.the parent and child relationship for the natural mother may be established by proof of her having given birth to the child,or under the upa,subd.a.the california supreme court has rejected the notion that only the woman who gives birth to a child qualifies as the natural mother the disjunctive or indicates that blood test evidence reflecting genetic consanguinity,as prescribed in the act,constitutes an alternative to proof of having given birth.johnson,at,d.the court explained as follows in our view,the term natural as used in subdivision a of family code section simply refers to a mother who is not an adoptive mother.section does not purport to answer the question who is to be deemed the natural mother when the biological functions essential to bringing a child into the world have been allocated between two women.johnson,fn,d.
in johnson,the court analyzed the concept of natural mother within the context of a surrogacy agreement.an embryo created by the gametes of a married couple was implanted in the uterus of another woman,who had agreed by written contract to bear the child but to relinquish all parental rights.when the surrogate changed her mind and refused to surrender the child,the married couple sought a declaration of parentage under the upa.the supreme court acknowledged that both women had acceptable proof of had given birth to the child and the other had genetic consanguinity.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.but the court expressly declined to find that a child can have two natural mothers.id.at,fn,d.the court said that for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother,despite advances in reproductive technology rendering a different outcome biologically possible.id.at,d,see also in re marriage of moschetta th,d.
the johnson court resolved the competing maternity claims of the genetic mother and the surrogate birth mother by examining the parties intentions as manifested in the surrogacy agreement.the court emphasized that it was the married couple who affirmatively intended the birth of their child and took steps to effect in vitro fertilization,while the surrogate mother simply intended to facilitate the procreation of the couple child.it was the genetic mother who from the outset intended to be the child mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.quoting from a law review article the johnson court explained that,within the context of artificial reproductive techniques,intentions that are voluntarily chosen,deliberate,express and ought presumptively to determine legal parenthood.id.at,d.the johnson court articulated the test of maternity as follows the woman who intended to procreate the bring about the birth of a child whom she intended to raise as her the natural mother under california law.id.at,d.in subsequent cases,the appellate courts have construed the johnson test to mean that the intent to be the parent is the when two women have equal claims.robert susan,supra,th at,d see also in re marriage of buzzanca th,d.
iii.the parties parentage intentions 
expressions of intention 
the trial court made two significant factual findings that defeat assertion that she intended to be the parent of a child produced from her egg.first,orally agreed before the children were conceived that would be the sole parent unless and until the parties underwent formal adoption proceedings.second,signed a donor consent form in advance of the egg donation procedure in which she expressly waived any parental rights that might attach to her genetic connection to a child formed by her ovum.
the oral agreement 
argues that the oral agreement between and concerning parental status is unenforceable for a number of reasons lack of consideration,unconscionability,indefinite terms,and violation of the statute of frauds.the arguments are beside the point.the present action brought under the upa is not an action to enforce a contract the determination of parentage does not rest upon a binding agreement between the parties.dunkin boskey th,d contractual father sought damages for breach by mother.to the contrary,family code section states regardless of its terms,an agreement between an alleged or presumed father and the mother or child does not bar an action under this chapter on determining a parent and child relationship.although that provision refers to an agreement by the alleged father,we conclude that the statute should apply equally to an agreement by a woman alleged to be the child second mother,see in re karen th,d.the clear purpose of family code section is to preclude parents from foreclosing a judicial determination of parentage.county of shasta caruthers th,d mother settlement with father did not preclude paternity determination and support award see also in re marriage of buzzanca,supra,th at,d wife promise to assume all responsibility for child born of surrogate did not abrogate husband duty to support.
the ultimate determination of parenthood depends not upon the existence of a binding contract but rather,as johnson instructs,upon the woman intention to bring about the birth of the child to raise as her own.johnson,supra,cal th at,d,see also robert susan,supra,th at,d in re marriage of buzzanca,supra,th at,d.this distinction between an expression of intention and an enforceable contract is apparent in the supreme court recent opinion on the doctrine of equitable adoption.estate of ford cal th,d.in holding that the doctrine applies only when the evidence establishes an intention to adopt,the court explained that the claimant need not prove all the elements of an enforceable contract this intent to adopt may be shown,of course,by proof of an unperformed express agreement or promise to adopt.but it may also be demonstrated by proof of other acts or statements directly showing that the decedent intended the child to be a legally adopted child id.at,d.
in johnson,the court looked to the parties written surrogacy agreement to determine the parties intentions on parentage.in the present case,the trial court found in the parties oral expressions an intention that would be the only parent unless and until an adoption by.it makes no difference whether the parties oral expressions would be an enforceable agreement under contract law.what is legally relevant is the finding by the trial court that the parties understanding showed that they intended to be the one to bring about the birth of a child to raise as her own child.
the ovum donor consent form 
makes several challenges to the validity of the ovum donor consent form.first,she contends the donor consent form did not give her adequate notice that she was waiving her parental rights.further,she argues the donor form was a contract of adhesion and unconscionable.insists that by signing the form she was not indicating any intent to waive her parental rights.these arguments are curtailed on appeal.despite testimony to the contrary,the trial court found the evidence to be clear and convincing that signed the donor consent form and waived her parental rights knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently.the court found testimony on her execution of the donor form contradictory and not always credible.further,the court found the relinquishment of parental rights contained in the donor form clear.we are bound to accept the trial court resolution of conflicting evidence as long as the court findings are supported by substantial evidence.
the record contains sufficient evidence to support the factual findings.testified that she and carefully reviewed in advance the ovum donor consent form and its provisions concerning relinquishment of parental rights.the parties stipulated that the customary practice at is to send the forms one month before the initial appointment.never objected to the terms of the donor consent form to or to the medical personnel,even though she participated in counseling two weeks before signing the form and did not undergo the egg retrieval procedure until a month afterward.admitted in her testimony that she understood the language of the donor consent form,and the trial court could reasonably disbelieve testimony that she did not understand the legal implications of that language.the evidence was undisputed that until neither party disclosed to others genetic connection to the children and until did not list the children as beneficiaries of her life insurance policy or retirement plan.that evidence serves to show that understood her relinquishment of parental rights.certainly,as emphasizes,there was evidence that family and friends regarded and as a couple raising the children together.but evidence that was domestic partner and helped raise the children does not preclude a finding that understood and agreed that would be the only parent.
next,challenges the trial court ruling that the donor consent form was a valid contract made between and to which was a third party beneficiary.argues that the donor consent form is unenforceable as a third party beneficiary contract because it did not express an intent to benefit.as we have already determined in connection with the oral agreement between and,the effectiveness of the donor consent form as a binding contract is not the question here.the consent form clearly reflects that donated her eggs as a gift.health,et organ and tissue donations.the consent form is a consent form for ovum donor.the opening paragraph of the donor consent form stated that,as ovum donor,was helping an infertile woman achieve a pregnancy and agreeing to have her eggs taken and donated to another woman.as between and,the donor consent form is legally relevant as a written manifestation of the parties intentions on parentage the donor consent form confirms that was intended to be the natural mother and sole parent,while was the ovum donor.
finally,argues that insofar as the donor consent form constitutes a waiver of her rights to parental status,the document violates her constitutional right to procreate.the argument is not persuasive.nothing in the donor consent form precluded from bringing about the birth of another child she intended to raise as her own child.the form simply reflects intention that she would not be the mother of any child formed from eggs donated to 
in johnson,the supreme court observed as follows the argument that a woman can not knowingly and intelligently agree to gestate and deliver a baby for intending parents carries overtones of the reasoning that for centuries prevented women from attaining equal economic rights and professional status under the law.to resurrect this view is both to foreclose a personal and economic choice on the part of the surrogate mother,and to deny intending parents what may be their only means of procreating a child of their own genes.certainly in the present case it can not seriously be argued that anna the surrogate,a licensed vocational nurse who had done well in school and who had previously borne a child,lacked the intellectual wherewithal or life experience necessary to make an informed decision to enter into the surrogacy contract.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
there is no reason should be found incapable of making the informed choice to donate her eggs to another woman with the intent that the recipient be the sole parent.in fact,the status of under the donor consent form and the parties agreement is consistent with the status of a sperm donor under the upa,treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived,subd.b see discussion,post.no public policy is violated by an agreement treating an egg donor in the same way.dunkin boskey,supra,th at,d contract by mother to grant paternal rights to male partner was not invalid.
b.the parties relationship 
we recognize,as emphasizes,key factual differences between johnson and the present case.in johnson,the genetic mother was married to the genetic father,while the surrogate birth mother was a stranger to that established relationship.in contrast,and had a committed relationship with each other that antedated the conception of the children,and the parties planned to provide together a stable and nurturing home for the children.
as we read johnson,the nature of the relationship between the genetic parents and the birth mother in that case was relevant insofar as it cast light on the parties parentage intentions.that is,the genetic mother was held to be the natural mother because under the surrogacy arrangement it was she who intended to bring about the birth of the child.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.in a footnote,the court commented that in a true egg donation situation,where a woman gestates and gives birth to a child formed from the egg of another woman with the intent to raise the child as her own,the birth mother is the natural mother under california law.id.at,fn,d.does not dispute that,who gestated and delivered the twins,is the natural mother of the children.argues,however,that the circumstances here do not present a true egg donation situation and that because of her existing and ongoing relationship with she can not be characterized as a mere egg donor.
we agree that a legal distinction exists between an intending parent and a mere donor of genetic material.the legislature and the courts have already drawn that distinction with respect to a sperm donor.the upa specifies that the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived,subd.b.the courts have held that the statute does not apply,however,when the sperm provider intended to be a parent,not a mere donor.robert susan,supra,th at,d man whose sperm was intended to impregnate wife was not donor to mistaken recipient adoption of matthew d.man whose sperm impregnated surrogate pursuant to agreement was not a sperm donor see also jhordan mary d.sperm donor statute does not apply to man whose sperm was not provided through physician.in johnson,the supreme court similarly concluded that the married couple were not merely donors of genetic material they intended to procreate a child genetically related to them.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case,the trial court found that was an ovum donor and not an intending parent.the trial court had evidence of the relationship between and as it existed at the time of the egg donation and the conception of the children.that evidence showed that the parties intended to maintain their relationship into the future and,at least implicitly,planned to provide a home together for child as long as their relationship continued.the evidence was conflicting on whether the parties intended joint parenthood of a child formed from donated eggs or whether the parties intended to raise the child as own child.although the trial court did not analyze the case in exactly the way we do under johnson the court factual findings nevertheless indicate it was only who affirmatively intended to be the mother of a child,while intention was to donate ova to to facilitate the procreation of a child for 
again,substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings.testified that her intention all along was to be the only mother.even before her relationship began with,she had tried to conceive a child to raise as her own.was initially reluctant to use eggs because she believed the relationship was too new and she feared a future legal dispute over parentage.testimony that orally agreed to sole parenthood was confirmed by the conduct of both parties after the birth of the children in keeping genetic connection secret for years.moreover,after the children grew older,assertions that she wanted to adopt them constituted an implied concession that until adoption was the only parent.
in johnson,which arose in a very different factual context,the supreme court concluded that only one woman could be the child natural mother to the exclusion of the other even though rising divorce rates have made multiple parent arrangements common in our society,we see no compelling reason to recognize such a situation here.the calverts are the genetic and intending parents of their son and have provided him,by all accounts,with a stable,intact,and nurturing home.to recognize parental rights in a third party with whom the calvert family has had little contact since shortly after the child birth would diminish crispina role as mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
here,the trial court factual findings establish as the only natural mother because only intended to procreate a child of her own.we simply do not have before us the case that would like it to both the birth mother and the genetic mother mutually intend joint parenthood.accordingly,we need not and do not decide here whether the determination of natural motherhood in a dispute between the genetic mother and the birth mother always compels the selection of one woman to the exclusion of the other or whether a child can,in an appropriate case,have two natural mothers.
revision of intentions 
asserts that conduct after the birth of the children in accepting as a should be seen as a rescission of the parties oral agreement to give parental status only to.the trial court found to the contrary that did not intend by her conduct to confer legal parental status on and that the parties did not modify their agreement that was to be the sole parent.we discern no error in that ruling.we emphasize again that contract law is not controlling our focus is on the parties intentions.the parties intention that would be the sole parent until adoption impliedly contemplated that the parties would remain together as a couple and that the children and others might regard as a second parent.acceptance of as a joint parental figure in the children lives was consistent with the parties initial intentions and provides no basis for a finding of repudiation of those intentions.
in any event,we reject the notion that the intent to be a parent should be assessed and reassessed over time.as we understand the johnson test,the focus of inquiry must be on the intentions at the time the child was conceived the natural mother is the woman who from the outset intended to be the child mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.of course,the
