in an initial custody determination the trial court awarded primary physical custody to the mother,who intends to move with the children to new mexico.because the trial court found the move was not motivated by bad faith,it did not abuse its discretion.we affirm.
michael and laurel bryant were married in.they have two children of their marriage,ages six and nine.before the parties had their first child they decided that laurel would stay at home and be the primary caregiver to the children,while michael would work to provide for the family.the parties continued this arrangement even after michael moved from the family home in september of.
after michael moved out,the parties attempted reconciliation.from the time he moved until april of,the family continued to have meals together and michael stayed in the family home with the children two nights a week.laurel refused to allow overnight visitation outside the family home because the children had not been told about the separation.
the children were informed of the separation in april of.at that time,michael was living with his father.laurel refused to allow overnight visitation in michael father home.she said she was concerned about the presence of dogs,firearms and a large swimming pool.laurel allowed overnight visits after michael moved into his own apartment.
the parties stopped seeking reconciliation in february of.michael filed for dissolution of marriage in july.laurel requested custody of the children and stated her intention to move to new mexico with them.the question of custody was tried separately.
laurel testified she wanted to move to new mexico to be with her family.she said she grew up there.her parents,brother and and their three children live there.she said that she and her children need the emotional support that her family can provide.laurel admitted she was not moving for financial reasons.she has a trust that can provide adequate financial support.
laurel testified that she is the children primary parent.although michael is a good parent,she has an emotional relationship with the children that michael does not have.
pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,kathleen duval,performed a custody evaluation.duval reports were admitted into evidence.duval recognized laurel as the primary parent.duval said that laurel had a greater level of involvement in the children lives than michael.in duval opinion,it would be detrimental to the children to make a radical shift to michael as the primary parent.duval said she has no reason to believe that michael would abandon his children if laurel moves to new mexico.
gayle clay,a therapist for one of the children,testified that the relationship between mother and child was and connected.she said the relationship between father and child does not flow as easily.
clay said the need for a person who has been rejected in a marriage to be around supportive family and friends is extremely high.this is relevant to the children because the children need to see that their primary caregiver is strong and healthy.
michael testified that laurel was moving in order to punish him.he believes the best interest of the children would be for laurel to remain in santa barbara and continue to be their primary parent.if laurel moves to new mexico,however,he believes it would be in the best interest of the children to award him primary custody.
michael said he sees the children three or four times a week and talks to them on the telephone daily.if the children moved to new mexico,he would not be able to be involved in their daily activities.he expressed doubts about laurel family willingness to accommodate visitation in new mexico.he said laurel father threatened that if michael broke up the family he would make it rough on him.
gordon hess,was the parties marriage counselor.he said the best situation for the children would be for both parents to live in santa barbara.but if laurel moves to new mexico,it would be in the best interest of the children for michael to be awarded primary custody and for the children to remain in santa barbara.
the trial court found that laurel was not motivated to move by bad faith.nor had laurel unreasonably interfered with michael visitation with the children.the court awarded joint legal custody with primary physical custody to laurel.the court awarded visitation to michael.he has a total of weeks per year in santa barbara.he may also visit the children for as many weekends as he desires,in addition to visiting them for each of their birthdays.the court retained jurisdiction.
discussion 
in in re marriage of burgess cal th,d,our supreme court discussed the orders.as in all cases where an initial custody determination is at issue,the trial court has the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.id.at,d.this requires the court to consider all the circumstances.id.at,d.among the circumstances the trial court must consider are the presumptive right of a custodial parent to change the residence of the minor children and the effect of such relocation on the children rights and welfare.id.at,d.neither party has the burden of persuasion to justify a choice of residence as a condition of custody.id.at,d.
we review a custody and visitation order for abuse of discretion.in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,d.we must uphold the ruling if the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the order in question advanced the best interest of the child.ibid.
michael contends the trial court failed to evaluate all the circumstances of the case.specifically,he claims the trial court failed to evaluate the reasons for the move.
but a custodial parent has a statutory right to change the residence of the child,subject to the power of the court to restrain a move that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child.the parent proposing to move away is not required to establish a need or even a justification for relocating to another geographic area.see in re marriage of condon th,d.the only exception is where the reason for the move is to frustrate the parent relationship with the child.ruisi thieriot th,fn,d.
michael cites cassady signorelli th,d for the proposition that the court will not sanction a move away where the reason is whimsical.but the ruling in cassady was based on a finding that the mother intended to frustrate the father relationship with the child.id.at,d.in any event,laurel desire to have the comfort and support of her parents and other family members in the aftermath of the dissolution of her marriage can not be fairly described as whimsical.
here the trial court found that laurel was not acting in bad faith.no further inquiry was necessary or appropriate.the trial court did not err in failing to evaluate the reasons for the move.
michael contends the trial court failed to consider established relationships in making its custody determination.michael cites section for the proposition that it is the policy of the law to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing and to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents 
michael points out that it was the parties arrangement for him to support the family and for laurel to be the children primary caregiver.he argues it is against public policy to use this arrangement against him to restrict the frequency and continuity of contact with his children.
but the policy of assuring frequent and continuing contact must be viewed in light of other policies.it is also the policy to allow the custodial parent the freedom to move.that the move of a custodial parent may have an adverse effect on the frequency of contact by the parent is not by itself determinative.what is determinative is the best interest of the children,given that one parent is moving and the other is not.see in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
from michael point of view,it may be unfair that because he provided primary financial support for his family he had less contact with his children.but the question presented to the trial court is the best interest of the children,not fairness to michael.unfortunat
