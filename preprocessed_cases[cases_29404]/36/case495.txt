this appeal presents the issue of whether the substitute property provision of the federal criminal forfeiture statute,p,preempts the homestead exemption contained in the florida constitution and that state tenancy by the entireties law.
in october a jury found david fleet guilty on counts in a superceding indictment stemming from his role in a fraudulent arrangement that bilked two unwitting investors out of more than million dollars.the counts for which fleet was convicted included charges of wire fraud,aiding and abetting wire fraud,money laundering,aiding and abetting money laundering,conspiracy to engage in money laundering,and making a materially false statement to an fbi agent during the investigation.
the superceding indictment notified fleet that if he were convicted on any of the money laundering counts listed in the indictment,which charged a violation of,the government would seek forfeiture of any real or personal property involved in or traceable to that money laundering.the forfeiture was authorized under a,which provides that anyone found guilty of violating shall forfeit any property involved in or traceable to the crime.section b incorporates the provisions of,the criminal forfeiture statute.the indictment also notified fleet that if the forfeitable property was unavailable because of an act or omission on his part,the government would seek forfeiture of any other property he owned up to the value of the property that was subject to forfeiture under a.
after fleet conviction,the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture that required him to forfeit in cash to the government.although fleet stipulated to that forfeiture amount,he did not have enough cash to cover it.the government then filed a motion pursuant to p asking the district court to amend its preliminary order of forfeiture to substitute other property that fleet owned which was not involved in or traceable to money laundering.
specifically,the government asked the district court to order the forfeiture of fleet interest in his house and three automobiles.fleet owned one of those vehicles outright,but he and his wife owned the other two cars and the house jointly.fleet opposed the government motion by arguing,among other things,that the florida constitution homestead exemption,as well as that state tenancy by the entireties law,shielded his home from forfeiture.fleet never disputed that congress could override those state law provisions if it intended to do so,but instead took the position that congress had not intended to override them with the substitute property provision of p.
the district court rejected fleet argument.it found that he had transferred,deposited into the name of third parties,or otherwise disposed of the in forfeited proceeds with the result that the forfeited proceeds could not be located through due diligence.concluding that p preempted the florida homestead exemption and tenancy by the entireties law,the court ordered that the defendant indivisible interest in the marital property is subject to forfeiture as a substitute asset under p.as to the matter of the vehicles,all of defendant interest in those vehicles is subject to forfeiture under p.the order did not purport to forfeit the interest of fleet wife in any of that property,only his own interest.
pressing the same argument here as he did in the district court,fleet contends that his interest in the home he owns jointly with his wife may not be forfeited as a substitute asset under p.the state law provisions that fleet relies on appear to protect the property in question to the extent that state law can do so.the florida supreme court has interpreted the homestead exemption,which is found in article x,of the florida constitution to forbid the civil or criminal forfeiture of homestead property.butterworth caggiano,so d.likewise,a florida appellate court has held that under that state law governing entireties property,see generally passalino protective group,so d,dca neither spouse may sever or forfeit any part of the estate without the assent of the other sitomer orlan,so d,dca.at the same time,the federal substitute property forfeiture provision,p,does not exempt homestead or entireties property.so,there may be a conflict.
if there is a conflict,federal law prevails under the supremacy clause,united states const.art.vi,cl,which is another way of saying that if congress intended for federal law to preempt state law,it does.if,however,congress did not intend for federal law to preempt state law,then there is no conflict and state law is to be honored in applying the federal law.see freightliner myrick,d cliff payco am.credits,cir pharm.research mfrs.of am.meadows,cir.that is what fleet contends we have here,a situation where congress did not intend for the provisions of the federal statute to override state law.
fleet contention relies on the fact that there is an express preemption provision in the subsection that provides for forfeiture of facilitating and derived property,a,but none in the subsection that provides for forfeiture of substitute property,p,which is what we are dealing with in this case.this is how the relevant language of reads 
a property subject to criminal forfeiture 
any person convicted of a violation of this subchapter or subchapter ii of this chapter shall forfeit to the united states,irrespective of any provision of state law 
any property constituting,or derived from,any proceeds the person obtained,directly or indirectly,as the result of such violation 
any of the person property used,or intended to be used,in any manner or part,to commit,or to facilitate the commission of,such violation and 
p forfeiture of substitute property 
in general 
paragraph of this subsection shall apply,if any property described in subsection a,as a result of any act or omission of the defendant 
a can not be located upon the exercise of due diligence 
b has been transferred or sold to,or deposited with,a third party 
c has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court 
d has been substantially diminished in value or 
e has been commingled with other property which can not be divided without difficulty.
substitute property 
in any case described in any of subparagraphs a through e of paragraph,the court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant,up to the value of any property described in subparagraphs a through e of paragraph,as applicable.
a,p emphasis added.
fleet argues that by including an express preemption clause irrespective of any provision of state law in a but omitting one from p,congress must have intended to preempt state laws where the forfeiture is under the former but not where it is under the latter it must have meant that state laws are preempted where facilitating or derived property is concerned,but not where substitute property is concerned.the latin version of his logic is inclusio unius est exclusio alterius the inclusion of one is the exclusion of the other.see russello united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting united states wong kim bo,cir alteration in original.
this is a seductive argument,and we have been seduced by it before.in myrick freuhauf,cir,we were faced with the question of whether the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act preempted state tort law in a case involving a traffic accident caused by allegedly defective brakes.id.at.the federal statute had a preemption provision which did not reach that specific situation,id.at,and from the inclusion of that express preemption clause we reasoned there could be no implied preemption,id.at w hen there is an express provision we should not consider implied.in other words,the express inclusion of one thing excludes the implied inclusion of another.we thought that was pretty good logic,but the supreme court disagreed.
in disagreeing with our myrick reasoning,the supreme court stated the fact that an express definition of the reach of a statute imp
