in this family law case,the husband sought to reduce spousal and child support in connection with a request for custody of one of the children of the marriage.the trial court granted the custody request but increased the husband support payments based on two factors.
first,the trial court assigned the husband a tax filing status of married filing jointly.in fact,the husband had remarried,and his tax filing status was married filing separately because his new wife refused to file a joint return.second,the trial court allocated a tax deduction to the husband based on his new wife mortgage payments notwithstanding that the property was purchased with her separate funds,the mortgage was in her name only,and she took the entire deduction.
we conclude that the trial court erred in those respects because,in calculating support,the husband net disposable income should reflect his actual,available tax status and deductions.

because donna would not agree to file a joint tax return,david had no choice but to file his return as married filing separately.under the plain meaning of the statute,the trial court should have used the tax status of married filing separately because it reflected the actual amount of david taxes as well as the taxes actually payable.a joint return was not an available alternative for him.
with respect to joint tax returns,federal law provides some guidance on the subject.in general,a husband and wife may elect to make a joint return a.but a joint return of a husband and wife if not made by an agent of one or both spouses shall be signed by both spouses,a,italics added.

as the united states court of claims stated decades ago t he filing of a joint return creates a joint taxable unit at least to the extent that it is to the advantage of one of the spouses to create such a unit.
such a joint return can not be effectively made against the will of either spouse.the statute requires either a return by each,or a joint return,and,of course,if a wife made a separate return,as she would have a right to do,her husband attempt to make a joint return,in order to take advantage of deductions she might be entitled to,would not be permitted.moore united states.
