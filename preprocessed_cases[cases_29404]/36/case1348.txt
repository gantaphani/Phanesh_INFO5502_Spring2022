appeal from a custody order in a marital dissolution.we affirm.
background 
the parties herein,the former wife and husband,refer to themselves in their briefs as cheri and keith,respectively.they also refer to their two sons by their first names,devin and patrick.we too will use these designations,intending no lack of respect to any one.
the parties were married in and separated in.at the time of separation,the family residence was in san mateo,although for most of the marriage they lived in san diego.following the separation,keith moved to san diego and subsequently remarried.cheri,who continued living in san mateo,had primary physical custody of both children after.patrick generally stayed with keith during the summer.
in late,keith requested that he be given full custody of patrick,who has down syndrome and a heart condition.pursuant to court order,a custody evaluation of patrick was performed by psychologist matthew sullivan.in may of,the parties accepted sullivan recommendations,which were embodied in a detailed order specifying physical custody and visitation.keith and cheri would share legal custody of patrick.the order also provided the parent who patrick resides with during the designated period below shall have the authority about patrick educational needs and routine health care while he is in their physical custody.that parent shall share and discuss in a timely fashion with the other parent prior to making any such decisions for patrick.
in december of,cheri was laid off from her job at america online aol.the next day she told keith that she planned to relocate and take patrick to klamath falls,oregon,where she had bought a house in,and began work as a mortgage broker.keith obtained an order barring any change of patrick residence pending a court hearing for a modification of patrick custody due to this change of circumstance.cheri violated that order by taking patrick to oregon.the court made a second order giving keith immediate,temporary custody of patrick pending further evaluation by sullivan and the hearing.this court summarily denied cheri petition to have these orders set aside.following our denial,the trial court made another order that patrick will reside primarily with father subject to mother visitation.
at the time of the full hearing,cheri had sold the home in san mateo and to all intents and purposes lived in klamath falls.the hearing required two days the court heard testimony from keith,sullivan,another psychologist,a physician,and cheri.the court issued a comprehensive statement of decision that formed the basis for an order filed on december.although a number of issues were addressed by the trial court,the only one at issue here is the matter of patrick custody.the court determined that cheri and keith would share legal custody,and that keith would continue to have the majority of physical custody cheri would have custody during the summer,with regular visitation during the rest of the year.cheri filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.
we do not summarize the testimony and evidence received by the trial court because cheri does not attack the court findings except upon grounds of bias and misapplication of law.we therefore take those findings as supported by substantial evidence,in re marriage of fink cal d.before proceeding to examine the alleged legal deficiencies as identified by cheri,we believe it useful to examine the trial court detailed findings,using the trial court headings.
which parent is patrick primarily bonded with patrick has substantial parental bonds with both his parents.however,as stated by sullivan first report of may,patrick primary bond has been with cheri.of further significance,sullivan noted that patrick is also very attached to his older brother,devin,now,and from testimony at trial,patrick is also attached to his two younger who reside in keith home.
which parent is best prepared to protect patrick health,safety and welfare,in light of the child down syndrome condition and his needs the court found that cheri previously had a superior knowledge of patrick educational,medical and services needs,but since keith had primary custody he had competently provided for his son special needs.the court concluded that both parents are prepared to meet those needs.
what weight should the court assign to patrick stated preference for the custodial arrangement although patrick had repeatedly stated a preference for living with cheri,the court decided to give this little weight because patrick,as a thirteen year old with a disability may be capable of stating his preference but is found not to have the capability to make an informed decision like this,weighing all of the factors and considerations involved.
did cheri reasonably facilitate keith visitation with patrick during the nine years from separation to the january,ex parte order cheri claims that there were only two incidents identified by keith alleging inappropriate denial of visitation,october and september.the court disagrees with cheri position.the court apparently accepted allegations made by keith pointing to how difficult it has been at times throughout the years to keep the visitation going.after examining difficulties advanced by cheri and finding them unpersuasive,the court concluded that cheri own testimony gave the court the sense that cheri is only willing to allow court ordered visitation that she absolutely must and was not and is not willing to facilitate anymore than that.this type of conduct is not reasonable and not in patrick best interest.
did either parent interfere with the other parent visitation rights during the months since the january,ex parte order although chiding both parents for their suspicion and conflict,only cheri was found to have failed to facilitate appropriate contact between keith and patrick during the time patrick was returned to her custody.
was cheri move to oregon made in good faith cheri wants the court to find that her move to oregon was made in good faith for bona fide legitimate reasons.the court can not make such findings based on the reasons she gave.there is no doubt that her reasons included the fact that she already had a home in klamath falls,and that she has an affection for that community and that there is a lower cost of living.however,the reasons behind the move,a job offer and cheri desire to have less work so she could spend more time with patrick,are suspect.the court found not credible cheri claim that she only began thinking of moving after she was terminated from her position as at aol.s ometime during the prior school year she apparently contacted the school in klamath fall s and left the school officials with the impression that she had every intention of moving up to oregon soon cheri further testified that she did not receive notice of her termination until december.this was five days after a letter between klamath falls school employees mentioning cheri talking about moving in cheri knew that she was leaving the company before december.
to show that a move is made in good faith,in a case such as this where the hardships on the child must be balanced with the benefits,cheri would have to show that she attempted to find other employment and she had little option but to move some time well before her lay off,she began taking classes to become a mortgage broker.sheri sic never testified that she ever intended to use her brokers license here in san mateo county.again,her actions,taking classes in a completely different field before she supposedly knew of any lay off,and no evidence presented in court of the specific attempts she made to find a job in her field here in san mateo county,or her attempts to find work as a mortgage broker here,lead the court to find her testimony and declarations regarding her attempts to find employment here not credible.
the court will also point out,that cheri argued that her aol job allowed her the freedom to be with patrick unlike a typical job,or as she stated,a lower level job.therefore,she felt being a mortgage broker would give her the same amount of flexibility,to be there for patrick,for example,after school.however,these statements are again a misrepresentation of how much time she was actually there for patrick.sullivan made a finding in his may evaluation that she has a demanding job that reduces her availability to directly care for patrick.this requires child care support for patrick,both after school and intermittently overnights,both during the week and occasionally on weekends.her statements that she had to move to be able to provide patrick the same quality of life she provided while working at aol are disingenuous.
cheri actions in connection with the move are more indicative of secretive plotting and scheming than the actions of someone suddenly laid off without any notice.the move was not made in good faith and not in patrick best interest,but made in cheri best interest.
will klamath falls san diego meet patrick needs for a permanent custodial setting the households,communities and services of klamath falls and san diego may each have their individual advantages and disadvantages,size of the communities and availability of services,for example.keith has previously raised a concern regarding whether patrick health needs can be met in klamath falls.when patrick was a toddler he had a significant heart condition that was treated while the parties lived in san diego.keith has regularly scheduled annual checkups with a san diego heart specialist and,apparently,patrick has not had any further heart problems.cheri testified that she believed patrick medical needs would be met in klamath falls or in medford,miles from klamath falls.the court does have concerns regarding the reality of patrick needs being met in klamath falls.if his needs can not be met there,medford may be too far in an emergency situation.
keith household features greater contact with keith,his wife judy,who has been involved with patrick and has been helping address patrick care,patrick older brother devin,and patrick.in klamath falls,patrick would be with his mother.cheri claims patrick is comfortable in klamath falls,but he has only really visited there,and has no history of any extended stays.
both communities apparently have schools which have programs suited to patrick.patrick at this time is very familiar with the school in san diego all the evidence suggests that patrick has transitioned quite well to the school in san diego.there was no evidence presented that brings doubt to the ability of the san diego schools to provide for a child with down syndrome.
on the other hand,apparently patrick had a lot of difficulty transitioning to the school in klamath falls.it is clear that he did not attend for more than just a few days,and that would not be enough time for someone like patrick,who has difficulty adjusting to change,to feel comfortable.but the school and its personnel may not have the experience or ability to deal with patrick the court does have a serious concern that,although the school in klamath falls does claim to be able to provide education to special needs children,being a town of only,they do not have requisite experience of providing for a child with down syndrome.
based on the evidence presented,the court finds that the households,community and services,including the school system in san diego will meet patrick needs,and that there was not enough evidence presented to make an adequate showing that the household,community or services in klamath falls will meet his needs as efficiently and completely as san diego.
which parent should have primary physical custody of patrick the court began its extended discussion by considering sullivan conclusion in the may evaluation.it is this court opinion that sullivan ultimately favored cheri home for patrick school year because of primarily three strengths cheri had provided primary parenting to patrick and thus been much more involved in the educational and health services cheri had lived in the community for nearly all of patrick life,creating continuity and familiarity that is essential to support patrick functioning.further,sullivan wrote,patrick has received special education services since his infancy in san mateo.the continuity of patrick experience in this system is a critical positive factor in patrick life.emphasis added by court patrick relationship with his babysitter and brother she tara hazelwood was clearly more than just a babysitter and devin,who is nearly years old is also a mature,responsible and caring brother for patrick and an important support for patrick in cheri home.the bulk of sullivan findings really stressed the importance of what the community,san mateo,had provided to patrick and would continue to provide.over the next seven months,after arguing to keep patrick in her custody for those same reasons sullivan cites in his report,cheri removed patrick from the community that sullivan believed was so important to patrick and removed devin from patrick life,in a way that could have been any more devastating for both boys.
the court then discussed the specifics of the devastating removal of devin on or about october,cheri and devin talked and it was decided that he would move to keith house.he called keith that night and it was decided that he would go to san diego two weeks later,after giving notice to his employer for some unknown reason,that night,after devin was asleep,cheri packed up his belongings,woke devin at am and immediately drove him to keith home in san diego with no advance notice to keith.devin never had an opportunity to give notice to his employer but even more importantly,devin and patrick never had an opportunity to say.the court called what cheri did to devin a form of abandonment.
before addressing cheri decision to move and cheri decisions regarding patrick since january the court made this observation cheri has stated that the court is applying a to the parties right to move.keith was able to move to san diego,why should she be allowed to move wherever she would like.she stated in her objections to the tentative decision,cheri had no duty to remain there san mateo.cheri misses the point.sullivan recommended after the first evaluation that patrick should live primarily with cheri because of the support system and continuity of that system in san mateo.since it was that factor that tipped the scale in her favor as far as sullivan was concerned,she did have a duty to stay here,or at least,discuss the potential move fully with patrick father and,perhaps,sullivan before moving,which she did not.lastly,keith move occurred many years ago under different circumstances and should not be compared to the present case.
the court found it very disturbing that cheri did not broach the subject of moving to oregon until after she contacted the schools,listed her home for sale,and had been studying for a new career cheri seems to fail to see that she had made major decisions regarding significant changes in patrick life unilaterally without any acknowledgment of the impact on patrick being moved away from his school,his teachers,his friends,and farther from his father and brother and when she should have known the likely impact on patrick based on the findings of sullivan.one particular impact of a move to oregon would be that it would complicate,and possibly curtail,patrick visitation with keith.
with respect to cheri decisions regarding patrick since january,the trial court found after keith filed his ex parte motion in january,primary custody of patrick was awarded to him.keith promptly enrolled patrick in school.cheri filed a writ with the court of appeal.pending the ruling from the court of appeal,primary custody of patrick was returned to her on or about march.however,she was still under an order not to remove patrick from the state of california.she knew she could not return to klamath falls,oregon,until after the trial on keith motion to change custody.instead of finding temporary housing in san diego so that patrick could continue to attend the school he had attended for over two months,cheri chose to find temporary housing in tule lake,california,a place as close to the oregon border one could get.during the time patrick was in cheri custody in tule lake,patrick did not attend school
