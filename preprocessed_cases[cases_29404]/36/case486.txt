this case concerns whether sierra shealy,daughter of gregory shealy and regina shealy,should be returned to germany from the united states pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,opened for signature,instrument of ratification deposited april,doc,reprinted in hereinafter hague convention or convention.the german court,where the parties are engaged in a custody dispute over sierra,found that her removal to the united states by shealy did not violate the terms of that court interim custody order.the district court in the instant action,in ruling on shealy hague convention claim,determined shealy removal of sierra was not wrongful.for the reasons set out below,we affirm.
shealy and shealy are united states citizens who were married in the united states.their only child,sierra hope shealy,was born in the united states on may.the following year shealy,a dental technician in the army,was assigned to a tour in germany.shealy family accompanied her to germany pursuant to a command sponsorship,whereby the army allows the family of personnel to accompany soldiers abroad and use army facilities contingent upon the service member continued presence in the country.sierra and her parents lived on the army base in germany for approximately three and a half years prior to the events around which this appeal revolves.
while living in germany,the couple marriage fell apart.shealy began divorce proceedings in german family court and sought sole custody of sierra.shealy,also submitting to the jurisdiction of the german courts,filed for domicile determination rights and custody of sierra.the german family court issued a decision on july,temporarily granting domicile determination rights to shealy.at the decision included a or ne exeat clause barring shealy from taking the child out of germany without her father consent,unless this should become necessary for military reasons.id.at.
on february,the family court ordered that an opinion be obtained from a social worker in an effort to determine which parent should have custody.shealy and sierra were scheduled to meet with a social worker for an interview the following month.one week after the family court order,shealy requested curtailment of her german assignment,admittedly in order to avoid the jurisdiction and decision of the german family court.on march,the army authorized shealy to report to her new post at collins,colorado.five days after receiving her orders,and one day prior to their appointment with the social worker,shealy removed sierra from germany and brought her to the united states.she notified neither shealy nor the family court prior to carrying out her actions.she also dismissed her german divorce proceeding and subsequently filed for divorce in alabama.
shortly after shealy removal of sierra,the german family court issued a ruling declaring that the removal constituted a violation of shealy custody rights.id.at.the court holding was based on its view that unilateral removal of the child was not necessary for military reasons as required by its prior order.the necessity would not occur,it held,until the return date set by the military,which the court understood to be sometime in april id.
shealy appealed the family court ruling to the regional court.that court annulled the family court ruling on june,holding that the transfer was necessary for military reasons.
it is true that she moved the child to the united states somewhat earlier than absolutely necessary.at the present time it can no longer be assumed that she arranged the child residence in the illegally,since she will have to be in the united states anyway for military reasons as of the end of july.
id.at emphasis added.although sierra is no longer in germany,the custody proceeding remains open pending the return of sierra to germany.
while shealy complaint regarding shealy removal of sierra was pending in the german courts,he filed an emergency petition in federal court in colorado,asserting the removal violated the german family court order and shealy custody rights under the german civil code.the petition sought an order returning sierra to her habitual residence in germany under the hague convention,to which the united states is a signatory,and the international child abduction remedies act icara,to,this country legislation implementing the convention.
relying on decisions from other circuits,the district court found that sierra was a habitual resident of germany.at citing miller miller,cir shalit coppe,cir feder,cir friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich i.citing german law,the court found that because the family court order of july,was a temporary ruling giving shealy no more than domicile determination rights,shealy retained joint custody rights that he was exercising with respect to his daughter.at.however,the district court found that shealy removal of sierra was not wrongful because it did not breach shealy custody rights under german law.the clause contained in the german family court july,order allowed for removal of the child if a military necessity existed.the district court,although troubled by the timing of shealy departure from germany,found a military necessity existed at the time shealy removed sierra to the united states.in this respect,the court relied upon testimony from the chief of personnel reassignments at carson regarding the nature of military reassignment orders,and shealy testimony regarding her understanding of the german family court order.most importantly,the court based its decision on the findings of the german appellate court that shealy departure with sierra was necessary for military reasons.id.at.
on appeal,shealy challenges the district court order on two grounds.first,he contends the court erred in concluding that sierra removal was not wrongful because it was justified by military necessity.second,he asserts the right to determine the child residence vested the german family court with a right of custody over the child and therefore the german court rights were violated by shealy removal of sierra from germany.
our decision in this case is governed by the hague convention and the international child abduction remedies act.in an action pursuant to icara and the hague convention,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions regarding principles of domestic,foreign,and international law de novo.see miller,at citing friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich ii.
the convention and icara serve,in part,to prevent parents from abducting children in order to avoid the jurisdiction of courts with whose rulings they do not or believe they will not agree.the treaty and legislation seek to preserve the status quo and to deter parents from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court.friedrich i,at see also karin wolfe,a tale of two states successes and failures of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction in the united states and germany,of int l pol,the convention is intended as a rapid remedy for the parent to return to the status quo before the wrongful removal or retention.our scope of inquiry under the hague convention is limited to the merits of the abduction claim.miller,at citing icara,b.as such,the merits of the underlying dispute related to custody of sierra are not before us.id.
in a case arising under icara and the hague convention,the district court must determine whether the removal of a child was wrongful under the definition set forth in the convention.the removal or retention of a child is wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention,where such rights were actually exercised by the parent seeking return of the child.hague convention.the petitioner bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal or retention was wrongful.e a see feder,at.more specifically,the petitioner must show that the child was habitually resident in a given state
