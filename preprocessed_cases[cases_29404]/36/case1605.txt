petitioner michael,a party to a juvenile dependency action,served subpoenas duces tecum on real parties in interest orange county sheriff department and the westminster police department prior to the jurisdictional hearing.petitioner sought to discover forensic evidence and various investigative reports compiled by real parties during their ongoing criminal investigation into the death of monika g.the trial court granted real parties motion to quash the subpoenas,finding the official information privilege applied and precluded disclosure of materials relating to an ongoing criminal investigation.we conclude the court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an in camera review of the requested items before ruling on real parties motion.accordingly,we grant the petition and remand the matter for the court to conduct an in camera review.
petitioner is the biological father and custodial parent of alexandria his girlfriend kirsten would frequently bring her daughter monika on weekend visits to his home.on one of these visits kirsten left monika in petitioner care less than an hour later,monika was transported to a hospital emergency room where she was treated for subdural hemorrhaging,cerebral edema,optic nerve hemorrhaging,and retinal hemorrhaging.she died the following day.
alexandria,who was also in petitioner care and present when monika sustained her injuries,was taken into protective custody by officers of the westminster police department.petitioner told investigating officers monika fell off a couch and landed on a table.alexandria told a social worker the baby died and i did it.alexandria later explained that she and monika were playing a game on the couch.at one point during the game,monika grabbed her and caused both of them to fall.alexandria said she accidentally landed on top of monika.
orange county social services agency ssa filed a welfare and institutions code section petition,alleging petitioner caused monika death and put alexandria at risk of serious physical harm.the petition stated petitioner was under investigation by the westminster police department in connection with the homicide of monika due to her suffering trauma consistent with multiple blunt force trauma.the treating physicians suspected syndrome.the assistant coroner preliminary finding,however,was that monika suffered seven blunt force blows to the head.
on the day scheduled for the jurisdictional hearing,the court granted petitioner motion for a continuance.petitioner lawyer complained the coroner office had yet to complete its report,no medical reports had been provided,and,although he received a copy of one police report,he had not received a copy of a taped interview with alexandria.the deputy county counsel stated she had provided petitioner lawyer with all discovery in her possession.this included reports containing the social worker synopsis of various ssa,medical,and police reports,but no original documents or forensic evidence.
the following day,petitioner lawyer served subpoenas duces tecum on the custodians of records for the orange county sheriff forensic services department,the orange county coroner office,and the westminster police department.of the forensic services department,petitioner requested a ll reports,writings,recordings,notes,photographs,video tape,blood and tissue laboratory examination.all crime scene investigation records,photographs,diagrams,reports,evidence collection logs,and video he requested a ll reports,writings,recordings,notes,photographs,and video tape from the coroner office,and a ll reports,writings,recordings,notes,video tape,crime scene investigation records,photographs,diagrams,reports,evidence collection logs,and video taped and audio taped interviews from the westminster police department.
the orange county moved to quash the subpoenas the westminster police department joined in the motion.mindful of our recent decision in county of orange superior court th,d,the court declined to conduct an in camera review of the requested items,granted the motion to quash with the sole exception of a taped child abuse service team interview with alexandria,and continued the trial.
petitioner then filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,requesting review of the ruling and a stay of the juvenile court proceedings.we granted father request for a stay and invited the parties to respond informally.subsequently,we issued an alternative writ.
at oral argument,real parties lawyers reported the criminal investigation was ongoing and no criminal charges had been filed.petitioner remained a suspect in the case.police officials had largely ruled out kirsten as the perpetrator.alexandria,who was initially detained in orangewood children home,was later placed with her mother on a conditional release to intensive supervision agreement.several doctors involved in monika treatment discounted accidental death.according to one doctor interviewed by a social worker,there is a murderer out there,and it not the seven year old.
