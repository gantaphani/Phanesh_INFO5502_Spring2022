perri further noted that since their separation in december,alan had been depositing between to per month into their household account and had continued to pay their credit card bills,which were between and per month.because alan had stopped paying the credit card bills for her and the children the month before,perri declared she had been unable to meet the household expenses or invest money for savings as she did during the marriage solely on alan per month contribution and her gross monthly salary of.perri further noted she was now carrying a substantial balance owing on her credit card for the first time in years.
perri income and expense declaration submitted with the osc showed household expenses for her and the children were per month and her current net monthly disposable income was.the child support information filed with the osc alleged the children spent percent of the time with perri and percent of the time with alan.perri also lodged copies of the parties federal and state income tax returns for and.
in his lengthy responsive declaration,alan stated he had no issue in providing support to perri to maintain their children at the standard of living which they had provided them since birth,but did contest the spousal support she sought because he felt she had purposely reduced her income to set the stage for a support award upon separation and was understating what her true income from her medical practice could be.although he conceded his gross income in was and in,alan requested the court impute to perri for the income she could easily earn if she applied her skills and time to her practice,and objected to her statement of expenses to run the household,claiming they were also twice the amount used to run the household during their marriage.alan also requested the court consider the actual needs of the children when it determined the amount of temporary child support because of his extraordinarily high income.
regarding a parenting plan,alan refuted that perri was the sole caregiver of the children,claiming he was the parent who interacted the most with the children during the marriage.since the separation,he had experienced difficulty in communicating with the children because he had to go through perri regarding any visitation.it was alan hope that he could equally with perri on a basis.he had purchased a square foot home five miles from the marital residence and within the children school district.he had help to care for the children when he was away at the office and could easily be home by or each day.alan did not want to be reduced to only an alternate weekend father.
in her reply declaration,perri denied alan numerous personal attacks,countering with many of her own disparaging remarks.essentially,perri represented that while the family court services fcs mediator had recommended alan have only parenting time,she looked forward to him having increased time in the future.perri also justified her reduction in work hours and explained more fully her household expenses.
on march,alan filed an income and expense declaration showing net monthly disposable income and a month in expenses.he also filed a memo showing as his estimated net income for from his former medical partnership and his current medical corporation.in addition,alan filed a income analysis he had done for perri,showing that she could make per month in with a gross income of.
before the march,hearing on the osc,perri filed another income and expense declaration that date,showing total monthly expenses remained at while her current monthly disposable income had dropped to because her income from her practice varies from month to month.
at the hearing,after the parties noted for the record they were stipulating to the appointment of appraisers for the marital residence and the parties medical practices,perri counsel requested the court confirm the fcs report regarding time and strike certain statements disparaging of perri made in alan declaration.counsel also objected to the income analysis submitted by alan as having no foundation and being inaccurate.counsel then argued that because alan salary had been nearly times that of perri,alan earning approximately million per year while perri earned only about to per year,and that given the parties lifestyle during the marriage,per month total for household expenses plus money for savings,which was not included in those expenses,would be reasonable.counsel stressed that perri was also now having to pay many of the credit card debts that alan had paid for in the past.perri was requesting guideline child support and sufficient spousal support to meet the household expenses consistent with the marital lifestyle,which included the ability to save to per month.
alan counsel then clarified that alan income for was approximately million,asked the court to strike certain paragraphs of perri declaration that were disparaging to alan,and argued strenuously for more time for alan and more mediation time for the parties regarding child custody issues as for support,alan counsel challenged the appropriateness of certain items claimed by perri as expenses,her credit card payments,home improvements,and certain expenses that perri was deducting from her business,like the lease of one of her automobiles and accounting services.counsel asserted that because perri budget was thus at most about per month without such improper expenses,the deduction of her net monthly disposable income figure from her first income and expense statement would render expenses of only monthly which she could afford to pay.
with regard to child support,alan counsel argued the guideline amount was rebuttable due to alan extraordinarily high income which would lead to an amount that far exceeds the needs of the children.counsel
