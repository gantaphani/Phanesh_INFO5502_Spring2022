the petitioner,hofit jenkins,appeals from the district court denial of her petition filed pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,seeking the return of her son,orin,to her custody in israel.under the abduction convention,as implemented by congress through the international child abduction remedies act icara,return is the remedy for a child wrongful removal to or retention in another country in violation of the rights of custody of the petitioning parent under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.see hague abduction convention,article.in this case,orin and his parents,hofit and avraham jenkins,were living in dayton,ohio,after relocating to the united states from their native israel because of avraham jenkins job.the district court noted that orin was allegedly wrongfully retained in this country by his father on the date that his mother,the petitioner here,voluntarily returned to israel,leaving the child behind with his father and his paternal grandparents.the district court concluded,however,that both parents had been exercising their mutual rights of custody at that time,under the law of the state ohio in which the child was habitually resident,that orin father was therefore not in breach of hofit rights of custody,and that her petition for the child return should be denied.id.
we conclude that the petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence,as required by e a,that there was an actual removal or retention by orin father or that the alleged retention was wrongful.it therefore follows that the abduction convention can not be successfully invoked in this case and that the petition filed by orin mother should have been dismissed rather than denied.because the result is,practically speaking,the same,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
orin jenkins parents,hofit and avraham,were born in israel during the.hofit had lived her entire life there before moving to dayton with her husband and son.avraham,on the other hand,had moved from israel to the united states with his mother and stepfather,klaris and dennis jenkins,had spent his childhood here,and was educated in this country,although he had not obtained united states citizenship.as a result,when avraham was later in israel on vacation,he was detained by israeli officials and drafted as an israeli citizen into the israeli defense force.while in the military,he met hofit and they married in late.orin was born to the couple in haifa on april.
in the immediate aftermath of orin birth,the family lived in tirat carmel in the haifa district of israel.the jenkinses home was a short distance from that of hofit parents,and hofit father brought breakfast food for orin every morning before driving hofit to work and orin to his preschool.in the evenings,when avraham worked late,hofit father would also pick orin up from preschool and hofit from work and drive them to his home until it was time for orin to go to bed.orin grandfather described the young boy as happy and testified that orin regularly played with the other children in the neighborhood,even though orin could not have been more than two years old at the time.
eventually,at the end of or in early,avraham was offered a position with his company in the united states for a,renewable term at a salary approximately three and a half times as much as what he was making in israel.after hofit had another in a series of altercations with her mother,the couple agreed to accept the generous employment offer and move to the united states.consequently,hofit quit her secretarial job in israel,the couple terminated the lease on their residence,and hofit and avraham sold and gave or threw away all the belongings that they did not intend to take with them to america.on april,hofit,avraham,and orin moved temporarily into klaris and dennis jenkins home in a suburb of dayton,ohio,until they could obtain a home of their own.
almost immediately,hofit and avraham went about the business of normalizing their lives in their new surroundings.on april,the couple enrolled orin in hillel academy,where klaris taught hebrew,so that the young boy could make new friends and learn english.according to testimony offered by klaris,orin adjusted well to school,made new friends,and attended synagogue with her each week.the boy eventually changed schools but continued to do well and meet with friends at synagogue and at the numerous children birthday parties held in the jewish community in dayton.orin also accompanied family members on frequent example,to a nearby park and to the air force museum.
by the end of may,hofit and avraham were ready to move into a home of their own.initially,hofit accompanied klaris on the home search and,after locating a suitable dwelling for rent,hofit inquired of the realtor whether she and avraham could eventually purchase the home.the petitioner also asked questions regarding painting and redecorating their new house,and she purchased several thousand dollars worth of furniture to fill it.
in july,the couple was forced to return to israel for more than three weeks to obtain certain documents related to their visa applications.while they were gone,klaris continued to care for orin indeed,when klaris first expressed some reluctance to stay with orin because of plans,hofit confronted her with the promise that klaris had made to provide babysitting services whenever needed.during hofit and avraham absence,klaris made sure that orin was able to participate in all his usual activities and even used that opportunity to the boy because hofit had not done so previously.klaris testified that by that time,orin english skills had advanced to the point that the boy grasp of english was the same as his facility with hebrew and that his english skills were already appropriate for an american child of that age.
by the time hofit and avraham returned to the united states in august,the couple relationship was deteriorating,in part because of hofit confession to both klaris and to klaris husband,dennis,that she had cheated on avraham with a young man from israel.hofit claimed that avraham then hid orin passport from her and became both emotionally and sexually abusive.finally,on september,in response to hofit requests to return to israel to live,avraham drove hofit to the airport and purchased a ticket for her to leave dayton.even though avraham refused to allow orin to go with her,hofit nevertheless flew to new york and from there on to israel.
once in israel,hofit instituted divorce proceedings against avraham and filed a petition with the israeli central authority for the return of orin under the provisions of the hague abduction convention.because hofit was pregnant with her second child at the time scheduled for the evidentiary hearing in april,arrangements were made to have hofit and her witnesses testify by telephone from the united states consulate in israel,with the aid of an interpreter.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court ruled 
the date of the alleged wrongful detention of orin by avraham was september.at that time,both hofit and avraham had and were exercising their custody rights.orin habitual residence on september,was in the therefore,hofit petition for the return of orin jenkins to israel is denied.
hofit now appeals that decision,challenging the habitual residence finding and various underpinnings of that conclusion.avraham and klaris,contending that certain expert testimony offered by the petitioner should not have been allowed into evidence.
discussion 
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction was adopted by signatory nations to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as to secure protection for rights of access.march levine,cir quoting the hague abduction convention preamble.to those ends,the convention is generally intended to restore the status quo and to deter parents from crossing borders in search of a more sympathetic court.friedrich friedrich friedrich ii,cir.
pursuant to article of the convention 
the removal or retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where 
it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention 
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
in this dispute,the petitioner and the respondents concede that both hofit and avraham jenkins were exercising custodial rights over orin on september,the date that hofit flew back to israel.she nevertheless contends that because she was not permitted to take the child with her,orin was wrongfully retained by his father in ohio and should be returned to her custody in israel.in support of this proposition,hofit offered the testimony of an israeli lawyer,oded,that under the laws of israel,the mother is favored as the custodian of the child.hofit argued,therefore,that avraham breached her custodial rights when he refused to let orin to return to israel with her.
there are several legal problems with this claim.we note,first,that the record is devoid of any support for this statement.in fact,the child custody laws of israel and ohio appear to be functionally equivalent second,the claim is directly contradicted by the petitioner assertion in her verified petition for return of child.attached as exhibit d to that petition is a convention form entitled request for return of abducted child.in the written request,the petitioner recites in section v factual and legal background justifying this request,subsection setting out t he requesting party custodial rights,as follows 
pursuant to israel capacity and guardianship law,parents are the joint guardians of their minor children,which include sic the right to custody and to determine the child place of residence.therefore,the parents have joint custody and joint guardianship,including the joint right to determine the children place of residence.
finally,and of paramount importance,we note that although the opinion offered by the petitioner expert may be relevant to the question of who,eventually,is to be awarded legal custody of orin,it was irrelevant to the question before the district court,the jurisdiction in which the custody award should be determined.see b the convention and this chapter empower courts in the united states to determine only rights under the convention and not the merits of any underlying child custody claims.see also linda silberman,interpreting the hague abduction convention in search of a global jurisprudence,davis,the return remedy can be thought of as a provisional remedy because it does not dispose of the merits of the custody proceedings on the merits of the custody dispute are contemplated in the state of the child habitual residence once the child is returned there.the district court undoubtedly gave the testimony of the israeli lawyer only passing comment for just this reason,focusing instead on the dispositive issue whether orin had been wrongfully removed from his habitual residence as of september,or,if lawfully removed,whether he had then been wrongfully retained in the united states.
from our reading of article of the convention,we conclude that there was no wrongful removal or retention,simply because a there was no removal wrongful or than that resulting from the parents mutual decision to relocate orin from israel to the united states,and b there was no wrongful retention of the child by avraham,who had an equal right with hofit to orin custody in the absence of a court order or judicial determination to the contrary.in refusing to let hofit take orin to israel,avraham may arguably have committed a breach of hofit rights of access to orin but he did not commit a breach of rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the alleged removal or retention.hague abduction convention,article 
we conclude that the petitioner failure to establish that orin was either wrongfully removed or retained by avraham effectively ends our review in this appeal.nevertheless,we take the occasion to address the issue of orin habitual residence in view of the dissent conclusion that resolution of this question requires a remand to the district court to examine the strength of orin relationship with his prior habitual residence.
the parties have argued at length about the correctness of the district court finding that ohio was orin habitual residence at the time hofit left the marital home to return to israel.unfortunately,neither the hague abduction convention nor icara offers a comprehensive definition of the phrase habitual residence.moreover,the term has yet to be interpreted by the supreme court.we have stated clearly,however,that habitual residence must not be confused with domicile.to determine the habitual residence,the court must focus on the child,not the parents,and examine past experience,not future intentions.friedrich friedrich friedrich i,cir.see also silberman,supra,at.in doing so,our precedent requires that we consider a child habitual residence to be the nation where,at the time of a wrongful removal or retention,the child has been present long enough to allow acclimatization,and where this presence has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.robert tesson,cir quoting feder,cir.
in karkkainen kovalchuk,cir,the third circuit listed several factors that a court could consider in determining a child habitual residence.in our opinion in robert,we found many of those karkkainen factors applicable to the dispute before us and noted 
t he third circuit held that academic activities are among the most central in a child life and therefore highly suggestive of acclimatization.the court also noted that social engagements,participation in sports programs and excursions,and meaningful connections with the people and places in the child new country all point to the child being acclimatized.additionally,the court held that the fact that the child brought more personal belongings with her than usual,in anticipation that she would remain in the united states was evidence of a settled purpose to reside in the united states.
robert,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district judge did not clearly err in his factual finding in this matter that orin,as of september,had become acclimated to life in ohio.his evaluation of the relevant factors of acclimatization discussed in robert and karkkainen indicated that the child was attending preschool in the united states and was,by all accounts,doing well in that environment,having attained both hebrew and english language skills commensurate with his age and learning opportunities.orin also enjoyed a weekly routine that involved visits to the air force museum in dayton,frequent summertime visits to fountains in a nearby water park,weekly trips to the synagogue with his grandmother,and attendance at numerous birthday parties for young friends from both preschool and synagogue finally,the court accurately noted that all of orin personal belongings,clothes,and toys were in his home in ohio,evidencing a settled purpose to reside in the united states from the child perspective.indeed,as noted in trial testimony,any belongings that the family could not bring with them from israel to the united states had been sold,given away,or thrown away.
despite overwhelming evidence that ohio was orin habitual residence,the petitioner the dissent appears to the district judge did not give sufficient deference to the unique jewish heritage advantages offered by an upbringing in israel when determining orin habitual residence in response to a similar argument proffered at trial,the district court concluded that,although it may be true that orin has a unique heritage as an israeli jew that can only be properly developed in israel,such a consideration was not properly before the court in this litigation.rather,the court is only to determine orin habitual residence at the time of the wrongful removal and considerations of where orin heritage can properly be developed are not a part of this determination.in contrast,the ultimate decision concerning legal custody will,of course,take into consideration such factors as orin heritage,his future education,and which family associations are in his best interest.the only question properly before the district court in this dispute,however,was where that custody determination should be made.
the record reveals that the district court appropriately recognized the limits placed on the scope of its inquiry by the convention and icara.moreover,despite the dissent contention to the contrary,there was no error in the district court failure to engage in a more detailed comparison of the virtues of orin situation in ohio with the possible advantages of life in israel.as we noted in friedrich i,wrongful removal is a legal term strictly defined in the convention that does not require an ad hoc determination or a balancing of the equities.friedrich i,at.indeed,such a balancing would be contrary to a primary purpose of the convention to preserve the status quo and to deter parents from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court.id.that observation is particularly relevant in the circumstances of the case before us,which suggest that hofit was likely engaging in when she petitioned the court to declare israel to be orin habitual residence because,as her expert witness testified,u nder the law of israel,the mother is favored as the custodian of the child.
it was this expert testimony that is the subject of the filed by avraham and klaris jenkins.the respondents lodged an objection to it,arguing that the petitioner had failed to provide timely expert witness statements as required by federal rule of civil procedure a b before oded took the stand.they now contend that the district court erred in permitting to testify.however,appellate courts review judgments,not statements in an opinion.asarco,sec y of labor,cir.thus,a party may not appeal from a judgment or decision in his favor,for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to support the decree.fittings thomas betts.because the district judge ruling on the admissibility of testimony was not determinative of the merits of the issue before the district court,we are without jurisdiction over that one adverse aspect of an otherwise favorable decision.the respondents must,therefore,be dismissed.
for the reasons set out above,we conclude that hofit jenkins petition should have been dismissed for failure to establish a claim under the hague abduction convention,and we therefore affirm the district court judgment to the extent that it denies relief to the petitioner.moreover,we dismiss the respondents for lack of jurisdiction to review the question presented.
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention exists to ensure the prompt return of children wrongfully retained to the state of the child habitual residence.hague convention,preamble.according to the convention,a retention is wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
article.although the word retention itself is not defined,the hague convention does define rights of custody,and contrasts it with the mere rights of access for which the hague convention does not provide the remedy of the child return 
a rights of custody shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence 
b rights of access shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.
the district court looked to the third circuit decision in karkkainen kovalchuk,cir,for the following process in hague convention cases 
when did the removal or retention at issue take place 
immediately prior to the removal or retention,in which state was the child habitually resident did the removal or retention breach the rights of custody attributed to the petitioner under the law of the habitual residence was the petitioner exercising those rights at the time of the removal or retention 
id.at.using this formula,the district court concluded that the united states was the child habitual residence,and so it denied hofit petition for return of the child to israel.
the majority denies hofit petition on appeal,but it relies primarily on a different reason.according to the court,the retention was not wrongful in this case because avraham did not commit a breach of rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the alleged removal or retention.op.at quoting hague convention,article.the majority also concludes in dicta that the district court did not commit procedural error by failing to give any consideration to israel as orin habitual residence.for the following reasons,i dissent.
neither in the district court,nor on appeal did avraham argue that he did not breach hofit right of custody.even in denying hofit petition,the district court concluded that hofit,as orin mother,had a right of custody under both israeli and ohio law.yet the majority concludes that avraham did not breach a right of custody of hofit.i believe that is incorrect.
the hague convention defines a right of custody in particular to include the right to determine the child place of residence.hague convention,article.the majority readily admits that under both israeli and ohio law,as orin mother,hofit had a right to determine the child place of residence.op.at.at the time of the alleged retention,hofit shared the joint right of custody with avraham as orin married parents.id.the report also makes clear that the hague convention contemplates joint custody.t he whole tenor of article,which defines wrongful retention,leaves no room for doubt that the convention seeks to protect joint custody report.in other words,a right of custody that is joint and shared with another is a right of custody under the hague convention.both parents have a right of custody under the hague convention.
that right is breached if another person,even if that person is the other joint holder of a right of custody,unilaterally determines the child place of residence.t he removal or retention of a child by one of the joint holders of custody without the consent of the other has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law and so is wrongful.report.when hofit wanted orin to come with her to israel and avraham subsequently prevented orin departure from ohio,avraham unilaterally decided orin place of residence.by taking such unilateral action,avraham breached hofit right of custody see id.
although the majority disposes of the case on right of custody grounds,the district court focused on the habitual residence analysis and denied hofit claim on this issue.in my opinion,the district court was right to focus on orin habitual residence,but it committed reversible error by failing to compare his relationship to the united states with his relationship to israel.
the hague convention is intended to prevent a child from being taken out of the family and social environment in which its life has developed.report.that results when a court refuses to restore a child to its own environment after a stay abroad.id.the court in robert tesson,cir,understood these dictates to mean that habitual residence must be determined by comparing the levels of attachment the child has to each of the states in which he or she has resided.at.just as orin here,the children in robert had lived in two countries,and the cour
