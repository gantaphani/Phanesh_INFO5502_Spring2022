in,the legislature substantially amended the grandparent access statute,codified at family code sections.the statute now includes a presumption that a parent acts in his child best interest,and it permits biological or adoptive grandparents to obtain access to a grandchild only if they show that denial of access will significantly impair the child physical health or emotional.id.we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding access here because the is neither a biological nor an adoptive grandparent,and the grandmother did not overcome the statutory presumption favoring the children father.we conditionally grant mandamus relief.
ricky and jennifer derzapf were married in the.they had two sons,age,and,age,as well as one daughter,age.jennifer died of leukemia on june.during the summer months immediately following jennifer death,connie and randy johnson helped ricky care for the children.connie is jennifer mother and the children grandmother randy is connie husband and the children.during the first few months,connie and randy were the children primary caregivers.this arrangement was necessitated by ricky work schedule,especially shortly after jennifer death.initially,ricky and the johnsons worked cooperatively on the children behalf.on most nights,ricky joined the johnsons and his children for dinner at the johnsons home.
once the school year began,however,ricky attempted to reassert himself as the children primary for the two older boys.and began spending most nights at home with ricky.tension between ricky and the johnsons increased during this time.the johnsons perceived ricky as emotionally aloof and a negative influence on in particular ricky believed that connie was assuming the role of mother instead of grandmother,directly undermining his influence and authority over the children later,ricky wanted to keep overnight and on weekends,but the johnsons preferred a more gradual transition.
on may,connie and randy filed an original suit affecting the relationship sapcr seeking custody of the children and requesting that they be appointed sole managing conservators.the johnsons alleged that ricky endangered the children and significantly impaired their physical health and emotional development,and they obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order preventing ricky from obtaining possession of the children.after a hearing,the trial court dissolved the temporary restraining order and returned the children to their father conservatorship.the trial court noted in its may,letter ruling 
the evidence at the temporary orders hearing was not satisfactory proof that the father home raises a serious question concerning the children physical health and welfare.
the main concern of the johnsons focused on ricky derzapf neglect of the children,based on his allowing the children to spend so much time with their grandparents,and the services provided by connie johnson in taking the children to doctor and dentist visits,picking them up from school when sick.i do not see this arrangement as neglectful in any way.it appears that this was a mutually agreed upon arrangement following the death of the children mother which has been a benefit to everyone children,the father and the grandparents.there was no testimony that the johnsons ever objected to providing these services,or that they asked derzapf to take on more of the responsibilities.if they had done so,i believe he would have stepped up to the plate.
the trial court held that the johnsons,as grandparents,lack ed standing to be appointed as sole managing conservators or joint managing conservators of the children under section a of the texas family code because there was no evidence that ricky care of the children created serious question s concerning their physical health or welfare as family code section a required the trial court dismissed the case without prejudice on june.
after the johnsons filed the sapcr,ricky discontinued their access to the children.according to ricky,over the next twelve to eighteen months the children began to heal from their depression spurred by their mother death and the ongoing tension between the johnsons and him.ricky took the children to counseling,and they have since been released from the counselor care because of their progress in coping with their depression,as evidenced by their social and academic success in school and by the fact that and are no longer on antidepressant medications.
connie and randy filed a petition for grandparent access on march.the trial court appointed mark otis,a psychologist,to evaluate connie,randy,the johnsons sons ricky,and the children and to advise the court whether the johnsons should have access.on october,the trial court held an evidentiary hearing.otis testified,and his report was admitted into evidence.the page report,prepared after interviewing all parties,concluded 
it is my opinion that the children will benefit from renewed contact with their mother family.while the children have certainly benefitted from being pulled away from connie untoward communications,the children loss of relatedness to the entire johnson family has added to the children feeling of loss following their mother death.i have specific concern,however,that connie is at risk to dominate contact with the children and to project her experiences inappropriately on the children,thereby undermining both ricky position and the ability of other johnson family members to relate fully to the children.additionally,ricky and the johnsons have highly polarized views of the situation and one another.their conflict is now highly intractable and will not yield easily to change.
otis recommended family therapy for connie,randy,and their sons,in which the primary focus would involve family members learning how to monitor,coach,restrain and help connie.block inappropriate communications or questions to the children about their father or faith matters.respect interpersonal and family boundaries,and.be mindful to others relational needs rather than being so focused on her own.he recommended that the children have visitation with only randy and the uncles,until such time as connie therapist determined that she was ready to join family outings.alternatively,he recommended that the johnsons and the uncles have access to the children for one full day every two months.
at the hearing,otis testified that the children had formed attachments to the johnsons,and it would not be healthy to cut them off.he testified that and had a lingering sadness about their lack of contact with the grandparents,but that it was not manifested as depression or behavioral problems or acting out and that it did not rise to a level of significant emotional impairment.
on february,the trial court signed temporary orders granting the johnsons and the uncles visitation on thanksgiving day and the first saturday of each month on july,the trial court issued amended temporary orders stating that connie and randy had standing denying access would significantly impair the children physical health or emotional connie and randy,but not the uncles,were granted visitation with the children during part of thanksgiving day and on the first saturday of each month and could attend the children extracurricular activities and the uncles could pick up and return the children during these visits.
ricky sought mandamus relief.after granting his motion for temporary relief and staying the trial court order,the court of appeals denied the mandamus petition in a per curiam memorandum opinion.wl.for the reasons expressed below,we conditionally grant mandamus relief and direct the trial court to vacate its amended temporary orders of july.
initially,we must determine whether randy johnson,the children,has standing to pursue grandparent access possession of or access to a child by a grandparent is governed by the standards established by chapter.c.ricky argues that chapter applies only to biological or adoptive grandparents,and because randy is neither,he lacks standing to seek access.a.the johnsons disagree,citing three reasons randy should have standing to bring a suit for grandparent access.first,they argu
