willis appeals from juvenile court orders removing three children from his custody and denying reunification services.he maintains the district attorney participation in the juvenile dependency proceedings was inappropriate and prejudicial,his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance,and the court erred in denying reunification.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the juvenile court orders.
background 
alameda county social services agency the agency filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that dennis,jacob and samantha came within the juvenile court jurisdiction under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b failure to protect,d sexual abuse and j abuse of sibling.the petition alleged the father,willis,had committed various acts of physical abuse against his sons and,in the children presence,their grandmother.it further alleged willis had sexually molested his daughter,based on samantha statements that her father had touched her privates in the bath and touched the inside of her bottom,making it hurt,and that she had rolled around naked with her father and had seen his penis.the previous fall,samantha was sexually molested by an neighbor and her brother jacob.moreover,a recent medical exam of samantha revealed a history of hymenal trauma and sexual assault.finally,the petition noted that willis was registered as a serious sex offender due to his prior molestation of another child,an older of these children.
the agency received a report on march,alleging that samantha had a broken leg,had not been attending school,and was sleeping in the same bed with her father.shortly after this report,willis was arrested for physical abuse of his elderly,mother.police officers later interviewed the children and took them into protective custody,and the juvenile court ordered them detained.at the detention hearing,the juvenile court appointed separate counsel to represent the father and the children.the court also appointed the district attorney,at the request of the agency,to represent the interest of the state.
at the jurisdictional hearing,the court viewed videotaped interviews of the children and heard testimony from willis,the children maternal grandmother and two young women who lived in the same apartment with willis and the children and slept in a dressing area adjacent to his bedroom.in a videotaped interview,samantha said her father had touched her on the chest,vagina and bottom.she reported one incident in which her father touched her on the vagina,or the outside of her bottom,while the two were in bed.jacob told the interviewer he slept on the floor and sometimes willis hit him in the back of the head.once his father hit his head into a light switch.dennis reported that willis spanked him on the bottom with a belt or his hand.
willis denied all allegations of sexual abuse,claiming he had not bathed with samantha since she was a baby and had only touched her vaginal area once,to clean a cut she suffered from a fall.he touched her bottom only once,he said,to push her away after she had scooted too close to him in the bed.he denied ever touching samantha chest except to poke or tickle her.willis also denied most of the allegations of physical abuse,although he admitted he once punched dennis lightly,and once inadvertently hit jacob head against the wall and cracked a light switch cover.he denied choking jacob or hitting any of the children with a belt.
the juvenile court found the allegations of the petition to be true.based on findings that the father inflicted severe sexual abuse on his daughter and severe physical abuse on his sons,the court denied reunification services.
discussion 
trial counsel did not render ineffective.participation of the district attorney.
willis contends the juvenile court committed reversible error by allowing the district attorney to participate in the dependency proceedings however,as willis acknowledges,he never raised this objection below.an appellate court will ordinarily not consider procedural defects or erroneous rulings in connection with relief sought or defenses asserted,where an objection could have been,but was not,presented to the lower court by some appropriate method.witkin,cal.procedure ed appeal.the most obvious types of implied waiver arise from failure to object to the ruling or proceeding.id.at.although willis waived his claim of error based on the district attorney participation see in re courtney d.objection to district attorney representation of minor waived,we address the merits of his argument that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the objection 
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in dependency proceedings,a parent must demonstrate both that his appointed counsel failed to act in a manner expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates and that this failure made a determinative difference in the outcome,rendering the proceedings fundamentally unfair in that it is reasonably probable that but for such failure,a determination more favorable for the parent interests would have resulted.in re diana th,d see people pope,supra,cal d,in re kristin th,d.in short,appellant has the burden of proving both that his attorney representation was deficient and that this deficiency resulted in prejudice.people pope,supra,at.
to prove deficient representation,willis must affirmatively show that the omissions of defense counsel involved a crucial issue,and that the omissions can not be explained on the basis of any knowledgeable choice of tactics.citation.people jackson cal d.willis contends any reasonably competent attorney would have objected to the participation of an adverse,the district attorney.citing the general principle that the district attorney may not prosecute civil actions absent express authority from the legislature safer superior court cal d,he argues that no statute permits the district attorney to participate in dependency proceedings,as he did here,to represent the interests of the state.
we agree with the father that no statute explicitly provides for the appearance of the district attorney in dependency proceedings as a representative of undefined interests of the state.welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c permits the juvenile court to appoint the district attorney as counsel for the child in such a proceeding,and section provides that,where the parent has counsel,the court may appoint the district attorney to represent the petitioner here,the children and the petitioner the agency were already represented by counsel and continued to be so throughout the proceedings.the court allowed the district attorney to appear,at the request of the petitioner,to represent the undefined interests of the state.
respondent contends statutory authorization for the district attorney participation may be found in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,which states where the petition in a juvenile court proceeding alleges that a minor is a person described in subdivision a,b,or d of section,and either of the parents is charged in a pending criminal prosecution based upon unlawful acts committed against the minor,the prosecuting attorney shall,with the consent or at the request of the juvenile court judge,represent the minor in the interest of the state at the juvenile court proceeding.the terms and conditions of such representation shall be with the consent or approval of the judge of the juvenile court.although we have found no case law construing this provision,it appears clear from the statute language that it applies only when criminal charges have been brought and thus are pending against the parent,and it authorizes only the district attorney representation of the minor.the statute is not directly applicable in the present case because it is undisputed that,at the time of the dependency hearings,no criminal charges had been filed against willis relating to his treatment of the children.the agency asks us to read section,subdivision b broadly to encompass ongoing criminal investigations as well as pending criminal charges,because otherwise prosecutors might rush to file charges
