introduction 
this is an appeal from an order quashing a judgment creditor writ of execution seeking to recover interest.a judgment of marital dissolution ordered the husband to pay attorney fees to the wife former attorneys,who were named in the judgment.when judgment was entered,the husband informed the wife of his intention to pay the attorney fees to the wife former attorneys.claiming that the former attorneys right to attorney fees was derivative of the client right to those fees,the wife prohibited any payment to her former attorneys,and the husband did not satisfy the judgment for more than seven months.we conclude that entry of a judgment ordering payment of attorney fees to the former attorneys gave them an independent statutory right to enforce the judgment pursuant to family code section.section also gives the wife certain rights regarding a judgment awarding attorney fees to her former attorneys,but those rights do not include the power to prohibit the judgment debtor from satisfying the judgment.here the husband did not pay or tender satisfaction to the judgment creditor,and did not deposit the disputed amount into court for the judgment creditor,which would have terminated accrual of interest pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d.therefore interest on the judgment,which began to accrue on the date the judgment was entered,continued to accrue until husband paid the judgment.we conclude that the trial court erroneously entered an order quashing wife former attorneys writ of execution seeking to recover interest,and reverse that order.
factual and procedural history 
leonard green and jude green married on july,and separated on may.on june,leonard filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage.on november,the trial court bifurcated the proceeding and entered a judgment of dissolution of marriage,status only.
leonard died on october.on december,bernard greenberg,trustee of the leonard green living trust trustee,was substituted as petitioner in the dissolution action in place of leonard.
on october,trustee and jude signed a settlement agreement which,inter alia,divided marital property.the settlement agreement required leonard to pay,as his contributive share of jude attorney fees,to the law firm of freid and goldsman,which represented jude in the dissolution action.
after december,freid and goldsman ceased to represent jude.jude was subsequently represented by martin friedlander.
on december,jude sought to set aside the settlement agreement as unenforceable.trustee moved to enforce the settlement and enter a judgment under code of civil procedure section.the trial court granted trustee motion.a judgment filed on june,incorporated and ordered the parties to comply with the october,settlement agreement.thus the judgment required trustee to pay to freid and goldsman.
trustee states his willingness to pay freid and goldsman,but requests jude objections,if any,to this payment.
on june,trustee counsel sent a letter to jude counsel the letter enclosed a copy of the signed judgment,and stated that pursuant to the judgment,trustee was prepared to pay the sum of to freid and goldsman.the letter continued,if your client does not intend for us to make this payment per the judgment,please have her state her intentions now.otherwise,we will forward the checks to that firm and your client will be accepting the benefits of the judgment and will have to comply with her obligations under the judgment.trustee sent copies of the letter to freid and goldsman and to friedlander.
jude instructs trustee not to pay freid and goldsman.
friedlander responded as jude attorney of record,asserted that the judgment was void,and stated to trustee attorney you are not to disperse sic any funds to any third person or take any action to enforce this void judgment.friedlander sent a copy of his letter to the trial judge with a request to vacate the judgment.
trustee reiterates willingness to comply with the judgment,wants to avoid involvement in the parties fee dispute,and asserts his right to interplead funds necessary to satisfy the judgment but does not want to be liable for interest.
on june,trustee counsel wrote a letter to jude counsel and to freid.trustee counsel stated that freid and goldsman had demanded immediate payment by trustee,but jude had not stated her reasons for objecting to the payment.because of conflicting demands,trustee counsel reserved the right to interplead funds due under the judgment but preferred to avoid doing so.the letter concluded that freid and goldsman should enforce the judgment by giving the notice required by family code section,subdivision c,and jude could dispute freid and goldsman enforcement of the attorney fee award by filing a motion under that statute or by filing an appeal.trustee counsel stated that if jude took either step,he believed the parties would agree that trustee would be relieved of any obligation to pay interest until jude objections were resolved.trustee counsel also stated that if jude did not make a statutory motion or file an appeal,he would conclude that the parties understood that jude consented to payment of the freid and goldsman attorney fees for jude benefit.trustee counsel concluded the letter by reiterating that trustee was prepared to comply with the judgment,wanted to avoid taking sides in a dispute between jude and freid and goldsman,and sought a solution to relieve trustee of conflicting claims and of liability for interest if payment was delayed.
jude counsel cautions trustee against paying freid and goldsman and asserts that an interpleader action by the trustee would be in bad faith.
on june,jude counsel wrote to trustee counsel.the letter noted,inter alia,that the trial court had refused to vacate the judgment.it also cautioned trustee counsel against issuing checks to freid and goldsman,and asserted that trustee interpleading of those funds would be an act of bad faith.
trustee again asserts his right to interplead funds and asks freid and goldsman to withdraw demand for payment until jude objections ceased.
on june,trustee counsel wrote to jude counsel.he disagreed that interpleading these funds would be bad faith conduct,and reiterated trustee right to avoid conflicting claims by interpleading the funds.trustee counsel stated that he would ask freid whether freid would withdraw his demands for payment until jude counsel withdrew jude objections.
the freid and goldsman firm begins statutory enforcement of judgment debt,and tells trustee that interpleading judgment debt would be inappropriate and that interest continues to accrue.
on june,freid and goldsman served a notice of application to enforce the judgment pursuant to family code section,subdivision c.the notice stated that in days,freid and goldsman would apply for a writ of execution to enforce the attorney fee provision in the judgment.
on june,freid and goldsman wrote to trustee counsel,advising of the notice of application to enforce the judgment and stating that it would be inappropriate to interplead the due freid and goldsman.freid and goldsman reminded trustee counsel that at a percent rate,interest accumulated at per day,and stated that freid and goldsman expected interest calculated from june,to be added to the principal.
trustee asks jude to withdraw her objections and to indemnify him if she refuses to do so.
on june,trustee counsel sent a letter to jude counsel asking whether jude would withdraw her objections to payment of freid and goldsman.trustee counsel also asked whether,if jude refused to withdraw her objections,she would indemnify trustee against liability,including but not limited to interest,that trustee might incur by complying with jude demand to withhold payment until judgment was final.the record contains no response from jude counsel.
in a declaration attached to the motion to quash freid and goldsman writ of execution,trustee counsel declared that on july,he talked with jude counsel and with counsel for freid and goldsman.he reiterated trustee prior offers to deposit with the court the attorney fees owed to freid and goldsman,on the condition that trustee be relieved of any obl
