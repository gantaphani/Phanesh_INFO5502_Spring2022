the lake county district attorney family support division county appeals in these three consolidated cases after the lake county child support commissioner trial court entered orders denying the county requests to enter default child support judgments against christopher palla,douglas hill and harry abram defendants,pursuant to family code section these orders were based on the trial court refusal to enter default judgments in cases in which the county has alleged paternity as a material fact of the child support case,but does not ask the court to make a judicial determination of paternity and does not explain why a judicial determination of paternity is not required as we shall explain,the trial court erred in refusing to enter the proposed default judgments simply because the county did not provide additional information regarding paternity.accordingly,we shall reverse and remand the cases to the trial court for entry of default judgments.
factual and procedural background 
none of the defendants appeared in the proceedings before the trial court,and none has filed a brief on appeal.accordingly,we accept the factual recitation contained in the county opening brief,but apply the rule that the county must affirmatively demonstrate prejudicial error.county of yuba savedra th,d,citing cases see also cal.rules of court,rule b 
the county filed complaints alleging that each defendant and a named mother are the parents of a child named in the complaint and,in the palla and abram cases,that the county had provided public assistance for that child.although the county alleged in the complaints that the defendants were the fathers of the children in question,it did not request that parentage be established the county did request that child support be established,seeking current monthly support based on the state support guidelines and presumed income,as set forth in computations attached to each complaint.in the palla and abram cases,it also requested reimbursement of public assistance for a period beginning one year before the date the complaint was filed.
attached to each complaint was a proposed judgment regarding parental obligations,which included an order stating that the mother and father listed in the complaint are the parents of the child in question and ordering the defendant to pay a specified amount of child support monthly as well as,in the palla and abram cases,to reimburse the county for past public assistance provided to the child.the complaint,the proposed judgment,and an accompanying information document each contained a notice informing the defendant that the proposed judgment would be entered against him and become legally binding unless he filed an answer within days of the date of service of the complaint and other documents.
a copy of the complaint,proposed judgment,and other required materials was personally served on each defendant.none of the defendants filed an answer,and the county entered defaults in each case.the county then filed with the trial court a request to enter default judgment as to each defendant.
however,after a hearing on february,the trial court refused the county requests to enter default judgments in the three cases.instead,on february,the trial court entered orders denying the requests for entry of default judgments.these consolidated appeals are from those february,orders after hearing.
