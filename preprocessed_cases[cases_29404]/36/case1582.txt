on september,defendant dragisa lazarevich was charged by information with two counts of retaining and concealing a minor child,the information alleged that the violations took place between october,and june.on february,the trial court concluded that our state did not maintain jurisdiction over any of the charged events and therefore granted defendant motion to dismiss the information for once in jeopardy.pursuant to section,subdivision a,the people appeal from the order setting aside the information based upon lack of jurisdiction and once in jeopardy concerns.they contend the trial court erred by dismissing the information because the trial court properly had jurisdiction over the case and because defendant failed to prove that he was placed once in jeopardy for the same charges for the entire time period in question.for the reasons stated below,we shall reverse the order setting aside the information.
defendant and shayna lazarevich married in.they were divorced in may in los angeles county.in the judgment of dissolution,shayna was given physical custody of their two children and defendant was given visitation rights.in september,shayna moved from los angeles to santa cruz.
on september,defendant telephoned shayna and told her that he was driving from los angeles to visit with the children from september through october.he picked up both children the morning of september and was expected to return them to shayna home on the evening of october.defendant never returned with the children.
when shayna called defendant neighbor in southern california,she was told defendant home had been sold when she called defendant employer,she was told defendant had not worked there for several months.
shayna called the police on the morning of october.their investigation revealed that defendant,using fraudulently obtained passports,had left the united states with the children and had returned to his home country of yugoslavia.the santa cruz county district attorney filed a criminal complaint against defendant and obtained a warrant for his arrest,and the united states attorney for the northern district of california instituted proceedings against defendant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
in,serbian officials began a criminal proceeding against defendant for taking and detaining the children from the lawful custody of their mother in violation of article,paragraph,of the criminal code of the republic of serbia.on october,defendant was found guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine or spend seven days in custody if the fine was not paid.
the children were concealed in serbia until june,when serbian authorities,acting under the direction of president milosevic,recovered the children in yugoslavia.the children were turned over to diplomatic representatives of the united states when american citizens were evacuated before the kosovo war,and they were reunited with their mother on june.
defendant eventually was extradited to the united states,and in,he was convicted in federal court of passport fraud.upon his release from federal custody,he left the united states pursuant to a voluntary deportation.in december,he returned to santa cruz and soon thereafter was arrested near shayna home.he was prosecuted and convicted of illegal into the united states while serving his federal sentence on that charge,he made a demand in the instant case pursuant to section.he was arraigned in santa cruz county on september.
thereafter,the superior court granted defendant motion to dismiss the information for once in jeopardy on the ground that california does not maintain jurisdiction over those events.
discussion 
in his motion to dismiss,defendant claimed his conviction in serbia for kidnapping his children serves as a bar to the santa cruz county prosecution under the principle of double jeopardy because his conviction in serbia was based upon the same act as the santa cruz county prosecution.
in their opening brief on appeal,the people contended the trial court erred because defendant failed to sustain his burden of proving a violation of double jeopardy principles.
our state double jeopardy clause,like that of the federal constitution,provides that a person may not be subjected to a second prosecution for the same offense for which he or she has once been prosecuted and convicted or acquitted,cal,art.i.
prosecution for the same act by different sovereigns is not barred by the fifth amendment guarantees against double jeopardy,although a state is not precluded from providing greater double jeopardy protection than that afforded by the federal constitution people walker d.
section of our state penal code states that w hen an act charged as a public offense is within the jurisdiction of another state or country,as well as of this state,a conviction or acquittal thereof in the former is a bar to the prosecution or indictment therefor in this state.similarly,section provides that w henever on the trial of an accused person it appears that upon a criminal prosecution under the laws of another state,government,or country,founded upon the act or omission in respect to which he is on trial,he has been acquitted or convicted,it is a sufficient defense.the difference between sections and is of no legal significance neither statute provides greater protection than the other.people walker,supra,d at,fn.
to determine whether a defendant has been placed once in jeopardy in another jurisdiction,the trial court must look at the physical elements of each crime.a defendant may not be convicted after a prior acquittal or conviction in another jurisdiction if all the acts constituting the offense in this state were necessary to prove the offense in the prior prosecution citation however,a conviction in this state is not barred where the offense committed is not the same act but involves an element not present in the prior prosecution.citation.people belcher cal d.the burden is on the defendant to prove that he or she has been placed in double jeopardy by reason of a prior conviction or acquittal.people burkhart cal d,people ferguson d.people mason d.people vigghiany d.
in this case,we have taken judicial notice of article,paragraph,of the criminal code of the republic of serbia and its english translation.we also have reviewed the english language translation of the judgment of conviction of defendant from the first municipal court of belgrade,dated january.
the judgment indicated that defendant had been convicted of a violation of article,paragraph of the criminal law of the republic of serbia,kidnapping of a minor person.the conviction was based upon the fact that on september,defendant took his children to yugoslavia during a visitation period and did not return them to their mother.
in english,article,paragraph,of the criminal code of serbia states that o ne who illegally detains an underaged minor person,or takes it away from parents,adopter,guardian,institution,or person the child was given in custody of,or prevents the execution of the decision on custody of the minor child,shall be punished by an sentence.
by supplemental letter brief,the people now concede that,in light of the language found in article,paragraph of the criminal code of the republic of serbia and of section of our state penal code,defendant can not be prosecuted in california for the kidnapping and detention of his children between october,and january,the date of the judgment of defendant conviction in serbia b ecause serbia kidnapping statute punishes both the taking and retention of defendant children,
however,the people argue that california has jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for the concealment and detainment of his children between january,and june,and that such prosecution is not subject to any double jeopardy prohibitions because defendant continued to conceal his children until when serbian officials returned the children to their mother.
a similar argument was made in superior court when the prosecutor stated that,assuming the superior court agreed there was a double jeopardy problem,then the people would then argue that any acts which occurred after his conviction in yugoslavia,the people should
