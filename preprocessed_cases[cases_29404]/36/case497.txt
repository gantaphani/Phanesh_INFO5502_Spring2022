discussion 
the narrow issue in this case is whether roy removal of the children from ireland was wrongful under the convention,such that the children should be returned to ireland for a determination of the hanleys guardianship rights by an irish court.
i.the purpose of the hague convention 
the convention was adopted in to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as to secure protection for rights of access.convention,pmbl.the convention generally intends to restore the status quo and deter parents from crossing borders in search of a more sympathetic court for custody hearings.march levine,cir friedrich friedrich,cir.
to establish wrongful removal under the convention,the hanleys must show that they had rights of custody and that they were exercising those rights when roy removed the children in.specifically,in furnes reeves,cir,this court held that,under the convention,the removal of a child from his or her state of habitual residence is wrongful where the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the child has been removed or retained in violation of the petitioner rights of custody,rights relating to the care of the person of the child either jointly or alone and at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.furnes,at quoting in relevant part articles and of the convention citations omitted.the existence of rights of custody are determined by the law of the country in which the child habitually resides at the time of removal convention,elisa,explanatory report hague conference on private international law,in acts and documents of the fourteenth session child abduction.

ii.testimonial guardianship under irish law 
the hanleys were appointed testamentary guardians of the children by margaret and,pursuant to section of the guardianship of infants act of guardianship act were authorized under the laws of ireland to act as guardians of the children jointly with roy,unless roy objected.upon roy objection,the hanleys could seek a court determination enforcing their joint guardianship rights.guardianship of infants act of.
as noted by the district court,in ireland,guardianship encompasses the duty to maintain and properly care for a child and the right to make decisions about a child religion and secular education,health requirements and general welfare.in re roy,d at quoting and,ir,high court,ir.quoting shatter family law,ed.guardianship under irish law is further described as follows 
guardianship is a concept often confused with custody.in fact,it is not necessary that the guardian of a child be also its custodian and caregiver.guardianship is altogether a more global responsibility.the concept of guardianship relates not to the specific matters of a child daily life,but to its overall welfare and upbringing.guardianship,in other words,concerns matters of overriding seminal importance to a child upbringing,where he or she is educated,according to which religious belief he or she is to be reared,and whether the child should undergo serious medical treatment.
guardianship should not be seen solely as a right.it entails both rights and duties,in particular the duty to ensure that a child is properly cared for and that decisions relating to the child are made with his or her best interests at heart.
