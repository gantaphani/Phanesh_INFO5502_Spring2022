the petitioner,robert crook,appeals from the decision of the appellate court holding that the trial court erred in its division of retirement funds,and the marital estate was not entitled to reimbursement of for payment made on a joint loan for improvements to nonmarital property.d.this court allowed robert petition for leave to appeal.we reverse in part and affirm in part.
background 
the petitioner,robert crook,and the respondent,patricia crook,were married for years.robert was a farmer until,when he became a truck driver.patricia worked in the home for years and then as a school secretary for years.
patricia retired from her job as a secretary at parkland college in july,after accepting an early retirement incentive plan.patricia is not eligible to receive social security benefits.the parties stipulated that robert current social security benefits entitlement is per month and will increase as robert continues to work.patricia may receive a nominal social security benefit as robert former spouse if she does not remarry.
during the marriage,robert farmed land owned by patricia family.patricia was raised on the farm and had spent most of her life there.the farmhouse where robert and patricia lived during most of the marriage originally belonged to patricia parents,who deeded the farmhouse and five acres of the farm to her in.the property also contained a machine shed,a barn,a crib,a shop,and a steel grain bin.the buildings on the property were used as part of the farming operation.in approximately,the parties jointly borrowed money from central illinois bank to build a new shed on the property to store farm equipment.the new shed replaced a barn that had burned.
when robert quit farming,the parties agreed to sell the farm equipment.following the sale of some of the farm equipment,of the proceeds was placed into the parties joint bank account.after robert filed for a dissolution of marriage,patricia withdrew from the account and applied to the parties shed construction loan when she became concerned that robert might file for bankruptcy.robert withdrew the remaining.
on june,the trial court entered a memorandum opinion and supplemental order.the trial court awarded robert a sep retirement account and a roth ira.the trial court then equally divided the remaining payments on patricia retirement funds from the parkland college early retirement incentive plan,her state university retirement system benefits,and her illinois municipal retirement fund benefits.the trial court order resulted in an equal division of patricia retirement benefits with each party receiving approximately per month until july,based on patricia current early retirement incentive income.after july,when patricia early retirement incentive payments from parkland college cease,each party will receive only per month from patricia remaining retirement funds.in reaching its conclusion as to the division of patricia pension benefits,the trial court did not consider the in anticipated social security benefits robert would receive upon his retirement.
the trial court also determined that the marital estate was entitled to a reimbursement for the funds patricia withdrew from the joint account and applied to the debt incurred by the parties to build the shed on patricia nonmarital property.the trial court ordered patricia to reimburse the marital estate by paying of the tax liability of,plus of the remaining tax liability.
patricia appealed the trial court division of retirement funds and its order that she reimburse the marital estate for payment made on a joint loan for improvements to nonmarital property.the appellate court reversed the trial court order regarding pension benefits,holding that the trial court should have considered robert anticipated social security benefits in making a division of patricia pension benefits.the appellate court remanded the cause for reconsideration of the division of patricia benefits with instructions to consider robert anticipated social security benefits in striv ing to arrive at a division of property that is equitable to both parties and places each party in similar economic circumstances.d at.
the appellate court also reversed the trial court order requiring patricia to reimburse to the marital estate,determining that the debt was marital and that the marital estate was not entitled to reimbursement because it had been more than compensated for this contribution through the use of the property during the marriage.this court allowed robert petition for leave to appeal.
ii.analysis 
robert presents two issues for review whether a court may offset a perceived disparity in social security benefits by awarding one party to a divorce a greater share of marital pension benefits and whether the marital estate is entitled to reimbursement of for payment made on a joint loan for improvements to nonmarital property.
division of retirement benefits 
the issue of whether a court may offset a perceived disparity in social security benefits by awarding one party to a divorce a greater share of marital pension benefits is an issue of first impression in this court.section d of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act ilcs d west requires the trial court to divide marital property in just proportions,taking into account enumerated statutory factors and any additional factors the court deems relevant.pension benefits attributable to contributions made during the marriage are marital property.ilcs b west.thus,in this case we must examine the interplay between the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act and the social security act.this presents a question of law that we review de novo.people chapman,de novo standard of review is applicable when there are no factual or credibility issues and the issue presented is purely a question of law.
in enacting the social security act act,congress created an extensive and highly regulated public benefit plan.see helvering davis.as part of this plan,congress reserved to itself the exclusive power to alter,amend,or repeal any provision of the act.because congress reserved the authority to amend or repeal provisions of the act,the united states supreme court has held that social security beneficiaries have a noncontractual interest in social security benefits,and that these benefits are not to be considered as an accrued property right.flemming nestor,d.the court has contrasted an individual noncontractual interest in social security benefits with a person contractual interest in a private pension plan in the latter,the right to benefits is assured and is based upon that person payments into the plan.flemming,at.at,d at.indeed,the court has observed that t o engraft upon the social security system a concept of accrued property rights would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to conditions which it demands.flemming,at.at,d at.
germane to this case,congress has also specifically provided for division of social security benefits where a husband and wife seek divorce.section of the act enumerates the benefits to be received by divorced spouses,providing to them,under circumstances specified by congress,a portion of their former spouse benefits.b.thus,congress has crafted a statutory scheme that strictly regulates and limits the payment of derivative social security benefits to a divorced spouse.
emphasizing congress desire to regulate payments of benefits under the act,section a a prohibits a beneficiary from transferring or assigning his or her benefits to another.specifically,this provision provides that 
t he right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable,at law or in equity,and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution,levy,attachment,garnishment or other legal process,or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.a.
thus,section a imposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits.philpott essex county welfare board,d.although congress has carved a narrow exception to this rule to allow the collection of past due child support or alimony maintenance in illinois from social security benefits a congress has also explicitly excluded any similar payment obligation arising from a community property settlement,equitable distribution of property,or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.i b ii.
it is with this statutory framework in mind that the question presented in this appeal must be analyzed.the united states supreme court has never addressed the precise issue in the cause before us whether a state court may consider federal social security benefits in determining the division of assets in a marital dissolution proceeding.guidance may be gleaned,however,from the supreme court decision in hisquierdo hisquierdo,d,where the court addressed the similar question of whether retirement benefits awarded to an under the federal railroad retirement act of et could be subject to attachment or an offsetting award during state divorce proceedings.the court determined that,under the principle of federal preemption arising from the federal constitution supremacy clause,either a division of those benefits or an offsetting award in the state divorce action impermissibly conflicted with the railroad retirement act.
although the supreme court decision in hisquierdo specifically addressed the treatment in state marital dissolution proceedings of benefits flowing from the railroad retirement act,the analysis employed in the hisquierdo case has been recognized as applying equally to social security benefits.see,in re marriage of boyer,iowa in re marriage of olson,in re marriage of swan,or,in re marriage of zahm,wash d.in fact,hisquierdo frequently drew parallels between the railroad retirement act and the social security act,and analogized their provisions throughout the opinion,holding that they are fundamentally similar.hisquierido,at.at,d at.indeed,the parties extensively argue the applicability of the hisquierdo decision to the facts in the cause before us.accordingly,a detailed analysis of this decision is appropriate.
in hisquierdo,the court reversed a decision designating the husband federal railroad retirement act benefits community property and awarding his an interest in his expectation of ultimately receiving these retirement benefits.the court rejected the wife community property claim to a portion of the husband retirement benefits following their divorce,even though his entitlement to these benefits had accrued largely during their married years.
in arriving at this holding,hisquierdo first set forth fundamental principles of federalism.the court recognized that t he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife,parent and child,belongs to the laws of the states,and not to the laws of the united states.hisquierdo,at.at,d at,quoting in re burrus.however,o n the rare occasion when state family law has come into conflict with a federal statute,this court has limited review under the supremacy clause to a determination whether congress has positively required by direct enactment that state law be.hisquierdo,at.at,d at,quoting wetmore markoe.before a state law governing domestic relations will be overridden,it must do major damage to clear and substantial federal interests.hisquierdo,at.at,d at,quoting united states yazell,d.
hisquierdo found that the case before it presented such a rare situation because it concerned conflict between federal and state rules for the allocation of a federal entitlement.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.initially,the court addressed the question of whether a state court could order the husband to pay his a portion of his retirement benefit as he received it.the court observed that the railroad retirement act contained a flat prohibition against the attachment of benefits and analogized this provision of the railroad retirement act to the provisions of section of the social security act.section provided that federal retirement benefits may not be reached to satisfy a community property settlement,equitable distribution of property,or other division of property between spouses or former spouses i b ii.hisquierdo held that ordering a direct beneficiary to pay a portion of the benefit to an would run contrary to the language and purpose of the statutes enacted by congress and would mechanically deprive the direct beneficiary of a portion of the benefit that congress indicated was solely for that beneficiary.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.applying the preemption doctrine to the facts in hisquierdo prevents the vagaries of state law from disrupting the national scheme,and guarantees a national uniformity that enhances the effectiveness of congressional policy.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.
the court explained that allowing state courts to alter the comprehensive federal scheme could do great damage 
it is for congress to decide how these finite funds are to be allocated.the statutory balance is delicate.congress has fixed an amount thought appropriate to support an employee old age and to encourage the employee to retire.any automatic diminution of that amount frustrates the congressional objective.by reducing benefits received,it discourages the divorced employee from retiring.and it provides the employee with an incentive to keep working,because the former spouse has no community property claim to salary earned after the marital community is dissolved.the federal statute shields the distribution of benefits from state decisions that would actually reverse the flow of incentives congress originally intended.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.
although the wife in hisquerido argued that the court interpretation of the act was manifestly unjust,the court rejected this contention.the court held that statutes have substantive meaning hisquierdo,at.at,d at,that congress chose not to make an exception from the prohibition for an,and that the wife argument was one of equity,not of law.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.the court thus held that california must defer to the federal statutory scheme for allocating railroad retirement act benefits insofar as the terms of federal law require.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.
after holding that a direct division of social security benefits violated the provisions of the federal statutory scheme,the hisquierdo court next considered the argument advanced by the wife that a state court could vindicate her interest and still leave the federal benefit system intact by giving her an offset award of available community property to compensate her for her interest in her expected retirement benefits.in rejecting this argument,the court provided the following explanation 
an offsetting award,however,would upset the statutory balance and impair the economic security just as surely as would a regular deduction from his benefit check.the harm might well be greater.the railroad retirement act provides that payments are not to be anticipated.a prohibition against anticipation is commonly understood to mean that the interest of a sole beneficiary shall not be paid to him before a certain date.if that definition is applied here,then the offsetting award respondent seeks would improperly anticipate payment by allowing her to receive her interest before the date congress has set for any interest to accrue.
any such anticipation threatens harm to the employee,and corresponding frustration to federal policy,over and above the mere loss of wealth caused by the offset.by barring lump sum community property settlements based on mere expectations,the prohibition against anticipation prevents such an obvious frustration of congressional purpose.it also preserves congressional freedom to amend the act,and so serves much the same function as the frequently stated understanding that programs of this nature convey no future rights and so may be changed without taking property in violation of the fifth amendment.hisquierdo,at.at,d at.
the court concluded that,although it was mindful that retirement benefits are increasingly important in american life and that divorce is becoming more frequent,the state community property interest sought by the conflicted with the federal statutory scheme,diminished that portion of the benefit congress had stated sh
