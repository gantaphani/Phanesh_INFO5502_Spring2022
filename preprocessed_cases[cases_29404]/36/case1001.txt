factual and procedural background 
esperanza was born in june.her father was not identified.esperanza mother,laura,had an extensive history of substance abuse and involvement with child protective services.the juvenile court had terminated laura parental rights to three older children,who were adopted by relatives.
in january the san diego county health and human services agency agency detained esperanza in protective custody and initiated dependency proceedings,subd.b.esperanza maternal,steve,and his wife,shannon,together,the came forward and asked the agency to place esperanza in their home.steve was a licensed preacher and assistant pastor at a local church.the had four teenage children who were in school,either working or participating in sports,and doing well.however,the had a history of substance abuse and involvement with child protective services,and steve had a criminal record.
on february,the court sustained the section petition and removed esperanza from parental custody.the court bypassed reunification services and set a section hearing,subd.b.
on march,the agency denied the request to place esperanza in their home.steve had been convicted in for contributing to the delinquency of a minor under penal code section section,and in for petty theft,possession of a dangerous weapon and receiving stolen property.the agency stated that steve section conviction might have encompassed lewd and lascivious conduct with a child age years of age or under,and classified the conviction as a nonexemptible disqualifying offense.
the agency was also concerned about child abuse referrals it had substantiated against shannon in and the in.the children were removed from parental custody in because of substance abuse and domestic violence.the family reunified in.the agency did not recommend esperanza placement with the because of their child protective history and steve criminal convictions.
steve asserted that his section conviction did not include lewd or lascivious conduct with a child and filed a grievance with the agency.steve explained he was charged with violating section when he was years old after he supplied beer to his brother and four underage friends.the social worker stated t here is no evidence to indicate that steve version of the crime takes it to an exemptible status.she reported the agency did not receive any evidence to show steve section conviction was exemptible,and the grievance officer was unable to overturn the denial of the relative home assessment.
on july,the agency placed esperanza in a prospective adoptive home.on july esperanza and laura filed section petitions asking the court to review the agency placement decision for abuse of discretion and to place esperanza with the.the section petitions alleged the agency abused its discretion when it denied the home evaluation and esperanza best interests would be promoted by placement with a relative.
without making prima facie findings,the court granted a hearing on the petitions,and asked the parties to brief whether section was a nonexemptible offense and whether the juvenile court had the authority to issue a criminal records exemption.
on august,the court stated it had read and considered the case file and memoranda of points and authorities.the court clarified with county counsel that the agency sought a criminal records exemption but the administrative body indicated they were not going to grant an exemption.minor counsel told the court that steve tried to submit information to show the section conviction was exemptible but he could not locate a case number or court report from.
the court found that steve section conviction was exemptible.despite the court many concerns about what went on here,the court determined it did not have jurisdiction to review the agency denial of steve criminal records exemption and could not grant an evidentiary hearing on the section petitions.the court denied the section petitions as a matter of law.
appellate proceedings 
on february,laura filed a request with this court to take judicial notice of the notice of appeal,filed october,and this court order of november,dismissing the appeal for lack of standing.on february this court ordered the request for judicial notice to be considered concurrently with the appeal.we grant laura request for judicial notice of the notice of appeal and this court order dismissing the appeal,subd.d.
on april,on this court own motion,we took judicial notice of the juvenile court order of november,terminating parental rights and referring esperanza to the agency for adoptive placement.this court directed the parties to submit simultaneous letter briefs addressing the following 
assuming arguendo error below,in view of the subsequent events that occurred in these dependency proceedings after this appeal was filed,is it possible for this court to grant effective relief or has the referral of the child to the agency for adoptive placement rendered this appeal moot 
on april,laura filed a motion with this court to take additional evidence under section of the code of civil procedure.the agency opposes the request.on may this court ordered the request for additional evidence to be considered concurrently with the appeal.we deny the motion.
discussion 
appellants contend the agency incorrectly interpreted section as a nonexemptible offense.they argue the agency denial of steve request for an exemption was an abuse of discretion subject to juvenile court review.appellants maintain the juvenile court erred when it determined it did not have jurisdiction to review the agency action for abuse of discretion and summarily denied their section petitions.they assert the juvenile court should have directed the agency to evaluate the home based upon accurate information.
the agency does not address appellants contention the agency erred when it classified section as a nonexemptible offense.it maintains the juvenile court lacks jurisdiction to review or override the agency executive decision to deny a criminal records exemption and relative home evaluation.the agency asserts the court properly denied the section petitions as a matter of law.
before we discuss the merits of the parties contentions,we address the agency arguments appellants lack standing and the appeal has been rendered moot by subsequent proceedings.
the agency contends appellants lack standing to appeal the court denial of their section petitions.it argues appellants were not aggrieved by the denial of their section petitions because the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction to review and override the agency executive decisions.the agency asserts the were the only persons aggrieved by the denials,and had the right to file an administrative grievance process,which they did,tit,subd.g.the agency acknowledges esperanza has an interest in placement with the but argues esperanza was not aggrieved by agency action because she had not been placed in the home.
generally,an aggrieved party may appeal a judgment in a juvenile dependency matter.in re th,d.to be aggrieved,a party must have a legally cognizable interest that is injuriously affected by the court decision.in re carissa th,d.we liberally construe the issue of standing and resolve doubts in favor of the right to appeal.ajida technologies,roos instruments,th,d.
as the agency acknowledges,a child has a legally cognizable interest in his or her placement with a relative.see in re marilyn cal th,d,natural children have a fundamental independent interest in belonging to a family unit,subd.a directing the court to consider the child wishes for relative placement,if appropriate in re miguel th,d recognizing child right to challenge a placement order.here,the juvenile court determination that it could not review the agency erroneous classification of a criminal conviction as a nonexemptible offense foreclosed any possibility that esperanza would be placed with the.while the administrative grievance process may protect steve rights and interests in an exemption of his criminal conviction,it does not necessarily safeguard esperanza interest in relative placement within the context of juvenile dependency proceedings.see,subd.a,subd.a,subd.c,code.civ,discussion,post,at see also,subd.a.we conclude that esperanza has standing to challenge the denial of her section petition.
until parental rights are terminated,a parent retains a fundamental interest in his or her child companionship,custody,management and care.in re th,d in re dakota th,d see also,subd.a directing the court to consider the parent wishes for relative placement,if appropriate,allowing return to parental custody after termination of reunification services,subd.h authorizing parental visitation after termination of reunification services.at the time of the proceedings at issue here,laura parental rights had not been terminated.this court has also recognized that placement of a child with a relative has the potential to alter the juvenile court determination of the child best interests and the appropriate permanency plan for that child,and may affect a parent interest in his or her legal status with respect to the child.in re,supra,th at,d see,subd.c a former subd.c d see also in re,supra,th at,d.while an alternative permanency plan to adoption may be unlikely on this record,it remains a statutory option for the juvenile court.we resolve doubts in favor of laura right to appeal.ajida technologies,roos instruments,supra,th at,d.
the agency contends the issues raised in this appeal have been rendered moot by the subsequent termination of parental rights and esperanza placement with a prospective adoptive family.it argues when parental rights are terminated,the exclusive care and control of the child is placed with the agency for adoptive placement,subd.j.the agency argues this court can not grant effective relief because esperanza prospective adoptive family now has statutory preference for adoption,and the juvenile court role is limited to reviewing the agency adoptive placement decision for abuse of discretion,subd.k see in re sarah th,d.
appellants contend if this court determines the juvenile court erred when it did not grant the section petitions,this court must reverse the judgment terminating parental rights.they argue this court can grant effective relief by remanding the matter to the juvenile court with directions to independently review the question of relative placement,including whether the agency considered the request for an exemption under the correct legal standard.appellants also contend the issue whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction to review the agency denial of an exemption for abuse of discretion is a question of continuing public importance,and is capable of repetition,yet evading review.in re christina th,d.
an appellate court will not review questions which are moot and only of academic importance,nor will it determine abstract questions of law at the request of a party who shows no substantial rights can be affected by the decision either way.tg oceanside,city of oceanside th,d.an appeal becomes moot when,through no fault of the respondent,the occurrence of an event renders it impossible for the appellate court to grant the appellant effective relief.in re jessica th,d consolidated.air.united.workers cal d.on a basis,the reviewing court decides whether subsequent events in a dependency case have rendered the appeal moot and whether its decision would affect the outcome of the case in a subsequent proceeding.in re dylan th,d.
as we explained above,appellants have substantial interests at stake that may be affected by the outcome of this appeal.keefer keefer,supra,d at.a decision by this court that the juvenile court has authority to review a denial of a criminal records exemption for abuse of discretion,and to direct the agency to consider the request for an exemption under the appropriate legal standard,may affect the outcome in a subsequent proceeding.in re dylan,supra,th at,d.if the agency grants an exemption,the juvenile court may consider the child placement under section independent review or section,subdivision k abuse of discretion review.a judicial determination under either statute may result in a change of placement.see,in re lauren th,d in re,supra,th,d in re shirley th,d in re jeremy th,d.we conclude the appeal has not been rendered moot by subsequent events.
when a child is removed from parental custody,the child relatives are given preferential consideration for placement,whenever possible,subd.a,subd.a,subd.c see also mandating detention with a responsible relative,subd.a placement shall,if possible,be made in the home of a relative,unless the placement would not be in the best interest of the child.the legislature states its preference that a child who has been removed from parental custody should live in the least restrictive,most familylike setting,as close to the child family as possible,subd.a.the setting must be safe for the child,subd.a,subd.c.
before a child may be placed in a relative home,the social worker must visit the home to assess the appropriateness of the placement,subd.a.the same safety standards used in licensing foster homes apply to a relative home assessment,subd.d.the court or social worker must initiate a criminal records check on all persons over the age of living in the home,and on any other person over the age of who may have significant contact with the child,subd.b.if the criminal records check indicates the person has no criminal record other than minor traffic violations,the social worker and the court may consider the home for placement of the child under section,subd.d.
if the criminal records check indicates the person has been convicted of a crime that would preclude licensure as a foster home,the child may not be placed in the home,unless an exemption has been granted,subd.d.the juvenile court may review the agency decision not to request a waiver of the disqualifying offense for abuse of discretion.valerie,supra,th at,d see,tit,subd.d d see,generally,gresher anderson th,d discussing right of applicant to request a waiver under health,subds.d,g.
if the agency receives a request to waive the disqualifying conviction,it evaluates the criminal conviction.convictions generally fall into two categories crimes for which the county may grant an exemption exemptible offenses and crimes for which the county can not grant an exemption nonexemptible offenses.health,subd.g,tit.
