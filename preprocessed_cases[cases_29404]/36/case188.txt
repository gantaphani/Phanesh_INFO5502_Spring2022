el sayed hassan rashwan was convicted of marriage fraud,conspiracy to commit marriage fraud,identification fraud,and making false statements to the immigration and naturalization service ins.rashwan,along with several other individuals,engaged in a scheme to procure citizenship and other benefits through the production of false documents and the undertaking of a sham marriage.rashwan was properly prosecuted and convicted on all counts.the judgment of the district court is thus affirmed.
rashwan,an egyptian national,entered the united states in july on a six month visitor visa.at the end of the six months,rashwan failed to leave the country.he continued to reside in the united states illegally,and in the ensuing years undertook a number of schemes in an attempt to gain permanent residence status.
in september,rashwan traveled from his residence in new jersey to virginia to obtain a driver license.rashwan had been unable to obtain a driver license in new jersey because he had neither a social security card nor a green card.when rashwan learned he would be unable to procure a new jersey license,he contacted a man who brought individuals to virginia to get licenses.the two men drove to a richmond area office of the department of motor vehicles dmv.there,rashwan applied for a virginia identification card and learner permit.
in order to receive a license in virginia,rashwan was required to complete a residency certification form,which requires the applicant to provide a sworn statement of his name and the place and length of his virginia residence.rashwan provided a false richmond address.the dmv then issued a virginia identification card with rashwan picture on it and,the following day,a virginia learner permit.on october,rashwan returned to the same virginia dmv office and applied for a virginia driver license.he again falsely stated and swore to a richmond residence address.
after receiving his license,rashwan informed his acquaintance nadir hajez that he would like to get married so that he could obtain his green card.rashwan asked hajez to seek out women who might be interested in marrying him in exchange for free rent.in october,hajez introduced rashwan to melanie walker.walker was about to be evicted and was having trouble keeping a job.rashwan offered walker an apartment for her sole use and to assist her in getting a car.in exchange,rashwan asked walker to marry him so he could secure permanent residency status.under grant of immunity,walker testified that she knew that she and rashwan were entering into the marriage with no intent to consummate it and with the sole purpose of facilitating rashwan obtaining a green card.
on december,walker and rashwan were married in a double wedding ceremony with another couple,omar obeidat and peggy campbell.obeidat was also a foreign national seeking to obtain permanent residency in the united states.there were no family members in attendance at the wedding.rashwan arranged for photographs to be taken during the wedding,and later admitted that the sole purpose of these pictures was to impress the ins.the bride and groom did not consummate the marriage and did not live together after they were married.
in late december,walker moved out of the free apartment rashwan had been providing and asked for a divorce so that she could marry omar obeidat.in response,rashwan threatened walker that if she did not finish the ins application process with him,he would report walker and obeidat to the authorities and they would go to jail.walker agreed to continue with the sham marriage.
on april,rashwan hired an immigration attorney to help him prepare an application for permanent residency.based on information provided by rashwan and walker,the attorney prepared for the ins an form,application to register permanent resident or adjust status,and a biographical information form.at no point in time did rashwan inform the ins or his attorney that he and walker were not.
rashwan met with walker several times to exchange personal information in preparation for their ins interview.in order to make their marriage appear authentic,he obtained credit cards and an electric bill for his residence in walker name.he gave these credit cards to walker only on the day of the interview so that she could produce them if necessary,and he took them back from her immediately after the interview.rashwan also hung pictures of himself and walker in the apartment he shared with barbara hancock to make it appear that walker lived with him.
in february,rashwan and walker were interviewed by an ins district adjudications officer to validate that a bona fide marriage existed between the two.the examiner specifically asked whether rashwan and walker were residing together,to which both falsely responded yes.after the interview,rashwan provided walker with more money and a plane ticket to visit her mother.he also asked her to maintain the marriage until rashwan went back to the ins for a second interview.on february,the ins approved rashwan application and granted him a conditional residency permit.
later that month,the virginia dmv discovered that the false address used by rashwan in his license application had also been used by at least other applicants.during the ensuing investigation,dmv agents interviewed rashwan in his home.at this time,rashwan admitted that he never lived at the address listed on his application.the agent then confiscated rashwan driver license.rashwan girlfriend barbara hancock called the dmv several times over the next few weeks pretending to be his wife and demanding to know when rashwan license would be returned to him.
in early march,the dmv contacted the fbi concerning rashwan identification fraud,which in turn led to an fbi investigation of rashwan.on june,a grand jury returned an superceding indictment charging rashwan and hancock with conspiracy to defraud the united states in violation of and obstruction of justice the indictment also alleged that rashwan committed identification document fraud in violation of a,marriage fraud in violation of c,and immigration fraud in violation of a.
on september,a jury found rashwan guilty of the above counts.at sentencing,the district court applied a two level enhancement for organizing and leading the criminal activity,giving rashwan a total offense level of ten.rashwan was sentenced to twelve months incarceration on each count,to run concurrently,and three years supervised release.rashwan now appeals his conviction and sentence on several grounds.
rashwan first contends that it was improper for the government to prosecute him for both conspiracy to commit marriage fraud under and the substantive offense of marriage fraud under c because such prosecution violates the judicially devised doctrine called wharton rule under wharton rule,a n agreement by two persons to commit a particular crime can not be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the crime is of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons for its commission.iannelli united states,d quoting anderson,wharton criminal law and procedure.rashwan argues that his conviction for both of these offenses violated wharton rule because marriage fraud necessarily requires the participation of two persons for its commission.
wharton rule,however,does not apply where,as here,a crime is capable of being committed by one person.see united states spitler,cir.the language of c makes plain that it is intended to punish a ny individual who knowingly enters into a marriage for the purpose of evading any provision of the immigration laws.c west ann emphasis added.thus,it is the fraud committed by rashwan as an individual that violates the statute and it is irrelevant whether walker entered into the marriage with a similar intent to defraud the ins or whether she entered the marriage with entirely innocent motives.although in this case walker was part of the scheme to defraud the ins,rashwan could just as easily have wed an individual who had no knowledge of his plan to evade the immigration laws.therefore,it is clear that wharton rule does not apply in this situation and that rashwan may be charged separately for the
