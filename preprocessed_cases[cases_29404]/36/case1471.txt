an alleged father waited three and a half years,until the filing of a third dependency petition concerning his alleged child,before requesting paternity testing.he had never developed any relationship with the child,and had declined to participate in all previous dependency hearings.the juvenile court denied the request,finding the question of biological paternity irrelevant where the man would not qualify as a presumed father.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this is the third round of dependency proceedings for joshua the minor.he was first taken into protective custody on february,immediately after his birth to an incarcerated and mother.mary was in juvenile hall for theft and drug offenses.she did not know the identity of the minor father,but named three possible candidates,including appellant,whom she identified only as josh.the court made a due diligence finding as to efforts to locate the alleged fathers,and entered their defaults.the minor remained in foster care until march,when the court terminated the dependency proceedings upon finding mary had complied with her case plan.
that success was short lived.three months later,mary abandoned the minor to her mother care.on june,a second original dependency petition was filed concerning the minor.welf,subds.b failure to protect g no provision for support.the petition alleged mother whereabouts were unknown,as were father identity and whereabouts.on july,the court ordered the orange county social services agency ssa to search for alleged fathers josh unknown and patrick ssa found appellant,joshua,at wasco state prison.he received notice of the dependency proceedings and an order for transportation to the next hearing.
on august,joshua signed a form denying paternity.the form stated,i,joshua l,having been alleged to be the father of the child of mary born on,state that i am not the father of said child.the form further acknowledged joshua was giv ing up any claim to family reunification services and to notice of juvenile court dependency hearings regarding said child.on september,joshua signed another form waiving his right to appear at the upcoming hearing.
on september,the minor was adjudicated a dependent of the juvenile court.a review hearing was set for march.joshua received a transportation order for the hearing but on or about february he waived his right to appear at the hearing.on february,almost six months after joshua formally denied paternity,ssa received a letter from him acknowledging that the minor could very well be my son.joshua apologized for not coming to the child custody hearing.he explained he expected to go on work furlough in garden grove in a couple of months and if i go back and forth to court right now,it will ruin my chances of going to furlough and could prolong my incarceration another six months.he added,i promise that when i do get out,i will go to every court appearance for my son and do everything humanly possible to gain custody of my boy.
in the status report filed for the march hearing,ssa reported that mary identified joshua as the father of the minor.she informed ssa she had known joshua for only three months,they never really developed a relationship,and she had not heard from him during the past year.
on march,joshua sent another letter to ssa.he stated he had been denied work furlough so i will remain here until i parole i have every intention to make my son priority sic in my life when i get out.joshua scheduled release date of october was then seven months away.he acknowledged having made some bad decisions of the last two years and those bad choices and my addiction with drugs has landed me right here in prison.he concluded,i am very much interested in my son and i am more than willing to accept the full responsibility of a father.just send whatever paper work that i have to sign to attend the next meeting.
the next meeting was a big one the court set a permanency planning hearing under section for august,having terminated services to mary for noncompliance with her case plan.on june,the court issued a transportation order for joshua to attend the august hearing.on june,he signed a form waiving his right to be present at the hearing.on july,he signed a second form waiving his right to appear.
the section permanency hearing was continued several times.in the interim,mary filed a section petition seeking to vacate the previous court order terminating services and setting the permanency hearing.in a supplemental report filed by ssa on october,the case worker stated mary reported joshua had called her on october or to ask about the minor.now out of prison,he was aware of the permanency hearing then set for october and asked about getting a paternity test.
the section permanency hearing and hearing on mary section petition was continued to october.the hearing lasted two days.at its conclusion,the court granted mary section petition and vacated the order setting the permanency hearing,based on a finding of changed circumstances.joshua did not attend the hearing.
at the review hearing on february,the court ordered the minor placed with mary.on october,the court terminated the dependency proceedings due to mary compliance with her case plan.again,her success was fleeting.on february,mary gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for methamphetamines.a new dependency petition was filed on behalf of the minor,now five years old.the petition listed joshua as his alleged father,address unknown.joshua had not been in touch with mary since sometime in.
the case worker found joshua in the orange county jail.he had been convicted of a felony on october,and was awaiting transfer to wasco state prison where he was to serve a sentence.
at the hearing,joshua requested paternity testing under family code section.ssa,mary,and the minor counsel all opposed the request.the court concurred.the court reasoned a paternity test was irrelevant to the proceedings because joshua would not qualify as a presumed father.joshua appeals from the denial of his request for paternity testing.
discussion 
joshua contends the juvenile court abused its discretion by denying his request for paternity testing.he argues the statutory criteria for such testing were met and denial of testing was not in the minor best interests.he is wrong on both counts.
family code section governs paternity testing.it provides,in pertinent part,as follows in a civil action or proceeding in which paternity is a relevant fact,the court shall upon motion of any party to the action or proceeding made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings unduly,order the mother,child,and alleged father to submit to genetic tests.italics added.the court rejected testing on the ground paternity is not a relevant fact in this proceeding.underlying that conclusion is the finding joshua does not qualify as a presumed father of the minor 
joshua does not contest that finding.he does,however,question its significance.joshua challenges the court determination that his lack of presumed father status renders paternity irrelevant in this proceeding.we conclude the juvenile court got it right.
in in re zacharia cal th,d,the california supreme court held that only a presumed,not a mere biological,father is a parent entitled to receive reunification services under section.citation.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.the court further held only a presumed father is entitled to custody of his child.ibid.consequently,in this dependency proceeding,joshua inability to qualify as a presumed father precludes him from obtaining either family reunification services or custody of the minor.more to the point,that result would not change even if genetic testing determined he was the minor biological step up from alleged father.
we should acknowledge a theoretical advantage joshua could gain from a finding of paternity.the juvenile court has discretion to offer a mere biological father reunification services based on a finding it would benefit the child,subd.a.however,we conclude the court implicitly rejected that option when it found paternity irrelevant and denied joshua request for genetic tests.underlying that decision is the
