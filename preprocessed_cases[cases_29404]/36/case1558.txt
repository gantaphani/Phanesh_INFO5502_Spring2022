introduction 
mere weeks before oral argument in this case,the adoptive placement that had appeared to have been working out at the time of the hearing utterly failed.the prospective adoptive parents returned the two boys who are the subject of this appeal,jayson,now going on,and joseph,going on,to orangewood children home only a few weeks ago.
the case forces us to examine the recurring problem in juvenile dependency law of postjudgment developments during the pendency of an appeal,in re elise cal d,finding it appropriate to accept stipulation reversing order terminating parental custody and control based on postjudgment circumstances.in this case,the postjudgment developments call into question one of the foundations on which a termination of parental rights must necessarily be children who have had their ties to their parents legally severed will likely be adopted.see,subd.c see in re elise,supra,cal d at,conc.opn.of bird,because termination proceedings required findings of adoptability,evidence should be taken of postjudgment developments.it is a problem not specifically addressed in the statutes.
there are two basic but irreconcilable models available.the first model is the traditional model of appellate procedure.if there was no error at the hearing,then it makes no difference if the children who are the subject of the proceedings are not really adoptable.the duty of the appellate court ends with examination for error at the trial level.no error,no reversal the appellate court must be blind to the implications of postjudgment developments for the child.
the second model is based on the underlying reason for the dependency statutes in the first protect children.if the government is going to terminate a child ties to his or her natural parents,then there must be reasonable certainty that the child is not going to be left a legal orphan.if postjudgment developments cast doubt where the law requires certainty,there is no harm in allowing the trial court to take a second look at a child adoptability.
until our supreme court or legislature tells us otherwise,we conclude the second model more closely represents the present intent of the legislature and is better public policy.a child should not be condemned to legal orphanage merely because possible problems with his or her adoptability were,as in this case,not discovered or glossed over by the trial court.as long as the order terminating parental rights is not yet final,a court should be able to examine whether the child is still likely to be adopted.we shall therefore reverse and remand for an updated review hearing as to whether the two boys really are adoptable.as we explain below,if they are not adoptable,it would be a travesty of the juvenile dependency law to terminate parental rights.
at the updated review hearing the court should ascertain whether the children still are adoptable in light of the new information brought to this court attention during the pendency of the appeal pursuant to a motion to take additional evidence if they are adoptable,then parental rights should be summarily terminated.if,however,the court finds that the children are not now adoptable and minor counsel has brought to our attention some very serious reasons to believe that they are not,then the court should consider an appropriate order under section,consonant with not terminating parental rights.
ii.the case that might have been 
ordinarily,this appeal would result in an affirmance because of a deferential standard of review.the incident that precipitated the dependency was an incident in august in which the mother,melissa,threw a knife at her sister and threatened her with a barbecue fork,and in which melissa held a knife to joseph neck.the evidence at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing showed that melissa was suffering from bipolar disorder.indeed,melissa admittance to a residential psychiatric treatment center coincided with the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing in february.there was expert testimony that melissa would need to consistently take her medication,lest she experience recurrent attacks of mental illness.
things hit a low for melissa during the first six months of reunification services,ending october.she had completed parenting classes,nor was she compliant with the requirements of medication or psychological counseling in her reunification plan social workers reported that melissa would exhibit some bizarre behavior during her weekly monitored visitation,most notably vacillating between kindness and detachment toward the children.
the evidence on her behalf at the review hearing held in march was a little better.she had completed a parenting class,and she had not missed any visits without good excuse,the foster parents being on vacation,and she had taken her medication since march except for periods when she had run out and could get a doctor appointment for a refill.even so,the trial court terminated reunification services and set the case for a hearing.
the actual hearing did not take place until late september,giving melissa time,in august,to file a section petition.she averred,in her supporting declaration,that since reunification services had been terminated she had commenced a week child abuse prevention and parenting program and completed weeks of it.she had stayed on her medication since january.she had been gainfully employed since april.she was seeing a psychiatrist and a clinical social worker.and she had maintained constant visitation with the two boys.
however,under in re kimberly th,d,a case conspicuously avoided by melissa appellate counsel,melissa showing would not have been enough,tested on an abuse of discretion standard,to require reversal of the order denying the modification request.a psychiatrist ironically called by melissa herself testified melissa suffered from schizoaffective disorder,which results in alternating depression and agitation.the psychiatrist was also not convinced of melissa ability to stay compliant with medication in the future.the children had told a social worker that they wanted to be adopted,even if it meant they could not see their mother and grandmother again.while jayson testified that he wanted to continue to see his natural mother no matter what,joseph said he did want to live with his mother and grandmother.
in sum,the hearing resulted in evidence that a the reason for the dependency was very serious,b the relative bonds between the caretakers and the parents were neutral as far as melissa case was concerned,and c there was reason to doubt that melissa now taking her be trusted for the indefinite future.under an abuse of discretion standard,reversal would certainly not be compelled.see in re kimberly,supra,th at,d.
melissa appellate argument thus tries to sidestep the kimberly factors by basically asking this court to create an automatic judicial exception to the basic time frames in the dependency statutes for mentally ill natural parents.she argues that section does not provide an adequate escape mechanism for the reform by the mentally ill.see in re marilyn cal th,d,importance of availability of modification proceeding as escape mechanism to the general constitutionality of state dependency statutes.
melissa case does quite fit the model of in re elizabeth th,d,which does indeed stand for the idea that periods of hospitalization for mental illness can furnish a valid reason for exceeding the maximum for reunification services.true,both cases involved periods of hospitalization for mental illness though here the total period was less than three months,while in elizabeth the hospitalization took up all but five months of an month reunification period,see id.at,d.but the two cases present somewhat contrasting ways with which a parent deals with mental illness.in elizabeth,the parent recognized the signs of impending psychotic episodes,and in each instance voluntarily sought hospitalization.see id.at,d.here,by contrast,the hospitalizations were involuntary,because early on melissa refused to take her meds.thus melissa would not have,as was the case in elizabeth,a record showing exemplary compliance with the reunification plan.see id.at,d.given that there was some evidence here that melissa could not be trusted to always take her medication,elizabeth does help her.
to the degree that melissa contends this court should extend the rule of elizabeth to all cases of mental illness,we must decline the invitation.the legislature has made no special provision for mental illness.mental illness is treated like drug addiction.see b both mental illness and substance abuse are treated the same.the same clock begins running on the maximum time for reunification services.see.
true,as melissa suggests,a mentally ill parent may not be,at the commencement of a dependency,fully appreciative of the need to demonstrate consistent compliance with the need to take medication,and a proper reunification plan should be designed with that in mind.in re elizabeth,supra,th at,d need for reunification plans to accommodate mental illness.any deficiency in the reunification plan was,however,a matter for her trial counsel at the dispositional hearing,when any deficiencies in the plan could have been remedied.it is enough to say that melissa appellate counsel has not brought any proceeding to assert melissa was the victim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in that regard 
iii.the case that is 
but things happened after the hearing that force us to rethink what the result should be.the children appellate counsel has brought to light some disturbing facts casting serious doubt on their adoptability.counsel first filed a minor brief,sans declaration,to the effect that she favored reversal because the current adoptive parents were considering sending the boys back to orange county social services because of problems with the boys that the adoptive parents are afraid might adversely affect their two natural children.apparently,they believe that joseph has reactive attachment disorder,in a rather severe way.counsel was worried that it was a clear signal the prospective adoptive parents were about to give up.
a couple of weeks then passed.the social services agency made a motion to strike minor appellate brief based on its lack of evidentiary foundation.appellate counsel who,as she explained at oral argument,had had a death in the family and had not been able to prepare a formal motion to take evidence to accompany her minor brief when it was filed,then made a motion to take additional evidence the additional evidence went beyond the mere possibility that the placement might fail.by the time it was made,it had failed.counsel declaration averred that she had just learned that the two boys had already been returned to orangewood children home.the return took place sometime between january,and february.
counsel also averred that the prospective adoptive mother had now concluded that even jayson was possibly affected with reactive attachment disorder.the declaration also stated that social workers were apparently considering the two boys and a younger sister who is not the subject of this appeal to be a sibling set,so that the prospective adoptive parents were not allowed to keep just the sister,or the sister and joseph.moreover,jayson told his counsel repeatedly that he had been moved around too much and the two boys did not want to move anymore.and to add to their sense of dislocation,the boys had been told they could not stay at orangewood,a location they liked.
reactive attachment disorder is a psychological condition that means an inability to form loving attachments.it entails difficulty bonding,poor impulse control,and insensitivity to the needs of others.see department of social services superior court th,d comment,transnational adoption the creation and ill effects of an international black market baby trade juv.
it is a relatively serious allegation the child is at least at some risk of turning out to be a psychopath.ironically enough,one factor that can lead to reactive attachment disorder is multiple placements.see shink,law day promoting justice for children may.law,citing the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed,in re krystle th,d this disorder,while related to having inadequate care and multiple caregivers prior to placement in foster care,is further exacerbated by the lack of permanent placement in a stable,nurturing and supportive home.
as of this writing,as minor counsel mentioned at oral argument,these two boys are on their fifth placement,and that is only a day emergency foster home.no matter what we do,then,a sixth placement is inevitable.given the evident lack of stability that these boys have experienced since being removed from their mother by the county,their appellate counsel urges we not affirm,but return the case for further actions so that the boys can find a stable situation.
for its part,the social services agency stresses that the minors trial counsel filed no appeal,and that nothing as yet regarding actual unadoptability has been found,as a matter of fact,by a trial court.
we should add here that the issue of adoptability was not actually litigated at the trial was a nonissue.given the circumstances at the time,minors trial counsel had no reason to raise was going well with a adoptive placement.the two boys and their sister expected to be there forever.thus melissa would have found that raising the issue would be futile one can readily imagine what she would anticipate the trial judge saying,what do you mean your two boys are not adoptable they have already been placed with a couple who want to adopt them.
iv.the problem of postjudgment events 
it is at this point that one of the major conundrums of our dependency system comes into sharp focus.what happens when events happen during the pendency of an appeal from an order terminating parental rights which cast doubt on the adoptability finding on which the order terminating parental rights was necessarily premised the question of what an appellate court should do when it receives information from a child appellate counsel indicating that an order terminating parental rights should be reversed,even though there was,strictly speaking,no error by the juvenile court,is now before the california supreme court,in the context of the role of minor counsel.it will be the supreme court first encounter with the problem since elise 
actually,the facts in in re elise k,supra,cal d,are directly on point with this case there,at the time of the termination of rights under old civil code section,the outlook for adoption was exceedingly favorable.see id.at,conc.opn.of bird.then the adoptive placement failed,and the child age rendered her unlikely to be adopted.ibid.she was in the position of having neither a parent nor a prospect of gaining one through adoption.ibid.the court of appeal,however,declined to give weight to the new postjudgment evidence.id.at.our supreme court took the case and,by contrast,found it appropriate to accept a stipulation allowing the reversal of the termination order.ibid.the chief justice,joined by justice reynoso,wrote separately to demonstrate the wisdom of having appellate courts take cognizance of the changed circumstances.id.at,conc.opn.of bird.
while the entirety of our high court certainly impliedly rejected the see no error approach of the court of appeal in elise,the stipulation obviated the need to explore the issue in depth.that gauntlet was taken up by chief justice bird,but anything she said in her separate concurring opinion could only be,at most,persuasive authority for future cases.for what it is worth we are persuaded by it.
a.the two models look for error or look 
for the child best interests 
there are two possible models that might be adopted by the courts or by the legislature if it were to directly confront the issue concerning developments during the pendency of an appeal that cast doubt on a child adoptability.the first model says that regardless of what happens to the child,the only thing the appellate court should look at is whether there was any prejudicial error at the hearing.
it should be remembered,at this point,that adoptability under section is relatively easy for social service agencies to establish.the exact language from the statute is whether it is likely the child will be adopted.true,the determination must be made on clear and convincing evidence,subd.c.however,it is only common sense that when there is a prospective adoptive home in which the child is already living,and the only indications are that,if matters continue,the child will be adopted into that home,adoptability is established.in such a case,the literal language of the statute is satisfied,because it is likely that that particular child will be adopted.
case law has also established that adoptability may be satisfied by a general adoptability,independent of whether there is a prospective adoptive family as the term of art goes waiting in the wings.in re sarah th,d see in re jeremy th,d evidence that there is a prospective adoptive parent willing to adopt a child gives rise to the inference that other individuals might be willing to adopt the same child.that is,the child need either be already placed with prospective adoptive parents,nor is it necessary even to have identified prospective parents,as long as there is clear and convincing evidence the child will be adopted in a reasonable time.see in re jennilee th,d.
the upshot,in terms of this model,is that if a child has been found to be adoptable at the hearing,social workers should,in theory,be able to find another prospective adoptive home.one might describe this model as,social workers will provide.
there is a certain rough justice to this model.for example,one can point as courts often do when affirming terminations in juvenile dependency cases to the deficiencies on the part of the parent that led to the denial of reunification services.a court can usually say in such cases,in substance,that if a parent really,really cared,he or she usually she would have gotten her act together from the very inception of the dependency.suzanne superior court th,d the dependency scheme is designed to aid those parents who seriously want to maintain a healthy parental relationship with their children.as it is there is usually a flavor to these cases.
the second model stresses the law abhorrence of legal orphanage,and the high importance that any adoptability finding be correct.see in re amelia d.using language such as high probability,no substantial doubt,and sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind to describe nature of the evidence required to sustain an adoptability finding see also in re elise,supra,cal d at,conc.opn.of bird,stressing essential role of adoptability.the trial court can not terminate parental rights unless the child is adoptable,because if the child is adoptable,the proceeding will have done nothing to benefit the child other than to permanently separate the child from the child natural parents,and condemn the child to permanent.the second model does quite have as much faith in social workers to come up with another adoptive home after one has already failed,and is more willing to trust the trial court to decide the issue of adoptability in light of subsequent facts,rather than trust social workers to necessarily find a new adoptive home regardless of intervening circumstances.
looking for the child best interests 
is the better model 
the present case forces a decision upon us.so,until the supreme court or the legislature tells us otherwise,we conclude that,as between the two models,the second is by far the superior.
first,as underscored by recent scandals regarding abuse in foster care placements in southern california fortunately,as far as we are aware,none regarding the particular county social service agency before the court here,the legislature has wisely authorized minors counsel to monitor possible problems in placement.after all,social workers were the ones who made the actual placement in the first place,and they may have reasons to continue it that may not be completely in sync with the minors best interests including psychological vesting,and internal bureaucratic pressures for high adoption statistics.it is the minor counsel who has the most incentive to bring any problems with a placement to a court attention.
thus,section,subdivision e,imposes on the child counsel the statutory duty to look out for his or her interests,including when those interests are opposed to what social workers want.the statute says that counsel must investigate the interests of the minor beyond the scope of the juvenile proceeding and report to the court other interests of the minor that may need to be protected by the institution of other administrative or judicial proceedings,emphasis added.to that end,minors counsel shall make further investigations necessary to ascertain the facts,including the interviewing of witnesses,subd.e,emphasis added.moreover,in the present child that is,the client is four years old or older,counsel must interview the child to determine the child wishes and to assess the minor,and shall advise the court of the minor wishes.see also cal.rules of court,rule c the attorney for the child must have sufficient contact with the child to establish and maintain an adequate and professional relationship.
the text of section makes no differentiation between minors trial and appellate counsel.again,the wisdom is.in many cases,like this one,new evidence will come to light during the pendency of an appeal that casts doubt on an adoptability finding which everyone took for granted at the trial level.it is also telling that this court would have been kept completely ignorant about the possibility of these children becoming legal orphans if an independent counsel had not brought it to our attention.
unless the legislature was just wasting its time by specifying that minor counsel was to report to the court the minor other interests that may need to be protected by judicial proceedings,the logical inference is that appellate courts necessarily will have the power to act to protect the child interests on appeal.see also code civ,if a court has jurisdiction over a matter,it has implied power to use all the means necessary to carry that jurisdiction into effect.
the converse quickly devolves into absurdity.try writing this sentence without flinching regardless of whether a child will wind up being a legal orphan,the appellate court is powerless to take any action unless there was some error apparent in the trial record.no one on the supreme court wanted to write that in elise,and we wo endorse it now.in the present case,for example,we are presented with a virtual mockery of the permanence that is usually cited to justify termination.if we summarily affirm,these two boys may never have any permanence or a natural parent.
second,and even more importantly,the second model is rather than.it is concerned with the child best interests,not punishing the parent.the first model takes an isolated view of the various stages of dependency proceedings in a vacuum,as if they had no overall purpose of protecting the child welfare.but there are cases,quite independent of what the natural parents deserve,where the best interests of the child are enhanced by the preservation of parental rights.the whole purpose of section,with its convoluted structure and requirements of multiple factfinding,is to assure that children do not fall through cracks in the system.if parental rights are terminated,children should go to a better situation,a permanent adoptive home,not a worse one permanent foster care and no parent.if the children are not adoptable,a series of placements is the least preferable option,not the de facto second option because social workers want a natural parent completely out of the picture.see,subd.b.
finally,adoptability findings are fraught with a unique danger at the trial level.as the present case and elise illustrate,adoptability can easily go from being an uncontested nonissue at trial because a child is doing well in an adoptive placement to dominating appellate proceedings in the wake of the unanticipated failure of that placement.
consider this trap that a trial court may easily fall into if a child is doing well in an adoptive placement at the time of the hearing,it is too easy to avoid confronting the child general ad
