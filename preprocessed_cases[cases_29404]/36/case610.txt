the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs starts an investigation 
on may,dcfs received an immediate response referral involving possible severe child neglect,apparently from hospital authorities.the reporting party informed dcfs that destiny had been crushed to death by an iron gate after mother had allowed her to be outside without adult supervision,and requested a risk assessment as to mia.dcfs sent an emergency response social worker to mother address the same day,but no one was home.
on may,los angeles county sheriff department detective toni martinez called in a report to dcfs stating that destiny accident occurred in an alley in front of a commercial parking lot that was very far from mother residence.further,detective martinez reported that video surveillance showed destiny and two boys in the parking lot for several minutes before the accident.the boys began pushing and pulling on a black metal gate,and,while destiny was out of the camera view,the gate fell over into the alley where she was apparently standing.beyond the details of the accident with the gate,the detective reported that the alley where destiny had been playing was a high traffic area through which cars traveled at a high rate of speed.detective martinez stated that she was aware of a child neglect report involving the family in for leaving children unsupervised.detective martinez stated that it was her belief that mother had a history of leaving her children unsupervised.
after speaking with detective martinez,the social worker visited the area where destiny had been struck with the gate.the social worker noted that the location of the accident was at least feet from mother residence in an upstairs apartment.a tenant in mother apartment complex,denise,told the social worker that the alley where destiny was killed was very busy during the day and cars often passed through the alley at a high rate of speed.denise said that on the day the gate fell on destiny,she saw destiny and two boys playing alone.when she heard destiny screams,denise ran to the scene and tried to lift the gate from destiny body.denise yelled for mother help,but it took mother some time to arrive.
the social worker then went to father address where a tenant in his building who wished to remain anonymous reported that mother,destiny and mia had moved out about a month earlier.the tenant had known the family for many years.he said there had always been concerns about the parents lack of supervision of their children.the tenant explained that on a daily basis the children were observed by various tenants to be on the apartment balcony,in the hallways,on the sidewalk,or in the lobby alone and unsupervised.this typically occurred during daytime hours when father was at work and mother was home with destiny and mia.the tenant said he had talked to the parents about the lack of supervision on more than one occasion.mother would say things to the effect that she did not know how the children got out of her eyesight.the social worker learned that the building had several video cameras,and was shown a video taken in september,when mia and destiny left the family apartment,went down the stairs,and exited through the lobby out onto the street.the tenant said he had several videos depicting the children wandering around the building unsupervised.when asked why he kept the videos,the tenant answered that he had almost hit destiny with his car once when she darted into the street.according to the tenant her parents did know where she was or what had happened.but that was always the case.there were several times where the girls were in a situation where something tragic could have happened because their parents did not care.
on may,the social worker interviewed mother and mia at dcfs metro north office.mother stated that on the day destiny was killed,she had allowed the child to play in the hallway with a boy who lived in the building,and,when she went to check on destiny,she heard people outside yelling and calling her name.mother said she ran downstairs into the alley and saw the gate on top of destiny.mother stated that only about one minute had elapsed between the time destiny went out to the hallway and the time when mother began hearing screams.mother denied allowing her children to be outside without supervision.when the social worker told mother there was a video showing the children walking out of the building unattended,mother said she must have been right behind them.
the dependency proceedings 
on may,dcfs filed a petition on mia behalf pursuant to welfare and institutions code section subdivision b failure to protect,subdivision f causing death to a child sibling,and subdivision j abuse of sibling.under all of the subdivisions,the petition alleged mother lack of parental supervision.at the time of the filing of the petition,dcfs submitted reports establishing the facts summarized above.the dependency court detained mia in foster care,ordered monitored visits for mother and unmonitored visits for father 
in july,dcfs submitted a report detailing further interviews with those involved in mia case.detective martinez said neither parent was taking responsibility for destiny death,and that mother blamed the property owner for having a broken gate that fell on destiny.detective martinez also reported that she had viewed a video from showing destiny and mia walking alone across a public street in what appeared to be a toward a man working on a car who may have been father.an anonymous reporter told dcfs that destiny and mia regularly would leave the apartment and go to the balcony,hallways,and the outside of the apartment building,and were often observed running around the building without supervision,diapers,or clothes.according to the reporter,a number of tenants had acted to protect the children when they were outdoors alone,and had confronted mother about her lack of supervision.
martin,the parents landlord,told dcfs that he often saw destiny and mia wandering around without supervision.he said mother usually left her door open when the children were playing outside,but the supervision was not there.he also said there were many times when he told mother that both girls had gone into the apartment of a single male.martin said that many tenants had brought to his attention the fact that the children were not being supervised.when asked how many times he saw that the children were not being supervised,martin replied,at least times.he added that he once found the children on the fire escape stairs,which was extremely dangerous because the family lived on the third floor.
tony,who managed the family apartment building until,told dcfs he noticed the parents were not adequately supervising the children,which he brought to mother attention two or three times.he often saw destiny at the top of the third floor staircase while mother was inside cooking with the door open.tony described one incident where destiny and mia made it all the way to the emergency exit of the building,which had a large hole to the first floor.he took the children back to mother apartment and explained the risk that the girls could fall into the hole.
during the parents further interviews,mother denied ever placing the children at any risk,and claimed she was providing adequate care.she said that many of the children in the apartment complex played outside and other parents would supervise her children.father said he and mother had come to believe that destiny death was her destiny,and added that accidents can happen in a breeze and there are accidents that ca be prevented.father stated that,regardless of what had happened,he knew that mother was a great mother,and that he was grateful to having sic his children have such a great mother.
mother and father had enrolled in parenting classes.they had been arriving together to the foster family agency for visits with mia,although their visits were separate.
in november,dcfs reported that mother and father had nearly completed a session parenting class.they were also attending individual grief and loss counseling.mia was participating in therapy on a weekly basis,and the parents attended consistently as collaterals and were receptive to the services offered to them.
in december,the dependency court conducted a jurisdiction hearing over several days.alfonso testified that he was the reporting party who had wanted to remain anonymous when he spoke with the social worker on may,the day after destiny death.alfonso had been manager at father apartment building for the last two years.in may,he had to run and grab mia after she tripped and started rolling down the stairs of the building.on another occasion,he witnessed the children going up the roof staircase while no one was watching them.there had been a few times when he saw the children walking in the hallways with no supervision,including once when they were walking near the second floor stairs.alfonso had watched a video where mia and destiny were crossing a street unaccompanied toward father,who was fixing his car on the other side of the street.
martin,the owner of father apartment building,testified that he once saw mia and destiny unattended at the building third floor fire escape,and had seen them wandering unsupervised around the complex more than five times.more than a few times,he expressed his concern to the parents that the girls were not being supervised.
on december,the lawyers for the parties presented arguments to the dependency court.as to section,subdivision f,mia appointed counsel argued that dcfs had failed to prove that mother failure to supervise destiny was a cause of her death,and that the petition should be sustained under section,subdivision b,but not subdivision f.mother appointed counsel and father appointed counsel argued that the proceedings should be dismissed because mia was not then,seven months after destiny death,at risk of harm.the dependency court sustained the section petition under subdivisions b,f,and j,and ordered dcfs to provide the parents with family reunification services.at the parents request,the court continued proceedings for a contested disposition hearing.
in february,dcfs filed a report indicating that mother had completed the session parenting class in november,and father had completed of sessions.the parents had been attending mia therapy appointments.
the second petition 
in february,mother gave birth to a new child,angel,and dcfs filed an immediate section petition on the child behalf alleging that he was at risk of harm from mother inadequate parental supervision.the dependency court detained angel.the court ordered dcfs to verify that mother was not living with father.
at a hearing in,mother counsel informed the dependency court that mother was not living with father.in march,dcfs filed a report indicating that,in late february,father had represented that mother did not live at father apartment,but they were still in a relationship.
the disposition hearing as to mia,and jurisdiction and disposition as to angel 
in march,dcfs reported that mother and father arrived and left their visits with the children together.at a hearing on march,the dependency court ordered continued monitored visits for father,and reminded him that he was not to act as monitor for mother visits.the court continued the proceedings to april.
in april,dcfs reported that the social worker voicemail had recorded a message from father cellular telephone on march.during the message,mother could be heard telling father that they needed to meet someplace where they were not known in order to prevent dcfs from asking anyone if they had been seen together.the social worker opined that mother still lacked parenting skills,including an understanding of child development,and still did not recognize her accountability for her role in destiny death.father seemed to minimize mother role in destiny death,was dependent on mother,and focused on mother wishes instead of reunification with their children.the social worker believed father would likely allow mother to have unlimited access to their children.
on april,the dependency court adjudged angel to be a dependent of the court under section,subdivisions f and j.as to the issue of disposition of both children,father counsel argued that father should be dismissed from the proceedings,and that the children should be released to father custody and care.mother counsel argued that the proceedings should be dismissed,and that the children should be returned to mother.the children counsel argued that father should be dismissed from the proceedings,and that the children should be released to father custody and care.
the dependency court removed mia and angel from mother custody and care,and ordered them placed with father.the court granted mother monitored visits,on the condition that father was not to monitor mother visits.the court ordered mother to participate in counseling to address case issues.
mother filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
section,subdivision f the causation issue 
section,subdivision f,authorizes the dependency court to take jurisdiction over a child when the evidence establishes that the child parent caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.a finding of a current risk to a surviving child is not required.see in re ethan cal th,ethan.subdivision f reflects the legislature apparent determination that a parent neglectful or abusive responsibility for a child fatality may inherently give rise to a serious concern for the current safety and welfare of living children under the parent care,and may thereby justify the juvenile court intervention on their behalf without the need for separate evidence of findings about the current risk of such harm.ethan,supra,cal th at.
mother contends the evidence is not sufficient to support the dependency court jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision f because,while it undisputedly showed a lack of parental supervision at the time of destiny death,it did not show that this lack of parental supervision caused destiny death within the meaning of section,subdivision f in that it did not show that the lack of parental supervision was a substantial factor in causing the child death.here,mother submits that destiny would have been killed by the gate falling on her even if mother was with her in the parking lot.pressing this proposition further,mother asserts that dcfs case for dependency jurisdiction under subdivision f rested on a theory that mother should never have allowed destiny to play in a busy commercial alley containing numerous potential dangers,but that this theory is flawed because it presuppose d that it was obvious the metal gate would fall off its track,and there was no evidence presented to support that.we find mother argument unpersuasive.
a dependency court jurisdictional findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test.in re matthew th.under this test,we resolve all conflicts in the evidence,and indulge all reasonable inferences that may be derived from the evidence,in favor of the court findings.in re savannah th.
mother causation argument fails because it is based on a false predicate,namely,that jurisdiction under section,subdivision f must be viewed as based on mother neglectful parental supervision in that she allowed destiny to play in an
