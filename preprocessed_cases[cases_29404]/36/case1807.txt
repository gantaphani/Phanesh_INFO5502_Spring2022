at issue is whether a man who signs a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity can later seek to undo the acknowledgment on the basis of dna test results.we hold that he can not.
background 
on october,valerie dawson gave birth to kendra smith.dawson and respondent,romel smith,executed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity two days later.by executing this form,respondent became kendra legal father.see ilcs a,b west.the acknowledgment form informed respondent that,by signing it,he would become the legal father of the child for all purposes.moreover,the form advised respondent of his right to genetic testing,the legal consequences of his decision to sign the form,and what rights he was waiving by signing the form.under the large bold heading notice of rights and responsibilities,respondent was advised of the following 
when the mother and alleged biological father properly sign the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form and,if required,the and mother sign the voluntary denial of paternity form,the alleged biological father becomes the legal father of the child for all purposes.the biological father mother may be ordered to pay child support until the child is at least eighteen years old,including retroactive child support from the date of the child birth,reimbursement of public assistance paid to the custodial parent for the child medical costs and medical insurance for the child until the child is at least eighteen years old.
you have the right to an attorney,a hearing and a right to have genetic testing.when the alleged biological father and the mother sign the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity they are waiving those rights.custody of the child is presumed to be with the mother.the alleged biological father may petition the courts for custody and visitation rights.
you should have a genetic test if you are not sure who is the biological father of the child.if the results of the genetic testing show that the man is the biological father of the child you can sign the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity form and the mother and may sign the voluntary denial of paternity form.
if you want legal advice you should talk to an attorney.if you would like to establish paternity without going to court or need other child support services,you may call the illinois department of public aid at.persons using a teletypewriter tty may call.
respondent signature appears on the form directly under an affirmation that he had read and understood his rights and responsibilities listed on the form was waiving those rights did not want a genetic test and was accepting the obligation to provide child support.
on december,the state,on behalf of the illinois department of public aid,filed a petition to set child support.the petition alleged that respondent had failed to meet his obligations under the illinois public aid code and asked the circuit court to order respondent to pay child support commensurate with statutory guidelines.on may,the court ordered respondent to pay per week in child support and further ordered him to obtain medical insurance coverage for kendra.
on june,respondent filed a pro se petition to terminate child support.respondent alleged in the petition that he was not kendra biological father.the state moved to dismiss the petition pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.
respondent obtained an attorney and refiled his action as a complaint to declare the nonexistence of the parent and child relationship pursuant to section of the illinois parentage act of parentage act ilcs west.respondent asserted in the complaint that he had signed the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity in based on dawson representation that he was kendra biological father.respondent entered the military on or about july,and was discharged on or about december.during this time,respondent saw kendra on only a few occasions.in march,respondent began to doubt that kendra was his child because she did not share any of his physical characteristics.respondent had himself and kendra tested at dna diagnostics center on april,and the test results showed a chance that he was kendra biological father.the test results were certified on may,but respondent alleged that he did not receive them until june,because of administrative problems.respondent attached the dna test results to his complaint.
the state moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,arguing that respondent could not pursue this action because he had signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.the state relied on section b of the parentage act ilcs b west,which provides that the presumption of paternity arising out of a voluntary acknowledgment becomes conclusive if the acknowledgment is not rescinded upon the earlier of days after the acknowledgment is signed or the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child including a proceeding to establish a support order in which the signatory is a party.the state further relied on section d of the parentage act ilcs d west,which provides that a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged only on grounds of fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact.
respondent argued in a brief in support of his complaint that he had filed a proper action pursuant to section of the parentage act,which provides as follows 
an action to declare the of the parent and child relationship may be brought subsequent to an adjudication of paternity in any judgment by the man adjudicated to be the father pursuant to the presumptions in section of this act if,as a result of deoxyribonucleic acid dna tests,it is discovered that the man adjudicated to be the father is not the natural father of the child.actions brought by the adjudicated father shall be brought by verified complaint.if,as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid dna tests,the plaintiff is determined not to be the father of the child,the adjudication of paternity and any orders regarding custody,visitation,and future payments of support may be vacated.ilcs west.
section references the presumptions in section.these presumptions are as follows 
presumption of paternity 
a a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if 
he and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other,even though the marriage is or could be declared invalid,and the child is born or conceived during such marriage 
after the child birth,he and the child natural mother have married each other,even though the marriage is or could be declared invalid,and he is named,with his written consent,as the child father on the child birth certificate 
he and the child natural mother have signed an acknowledgment of paternity in accordance with rules adopted by the illinois department of public aid under section of the illinois public aid code or 
he and the child natural mother have signed an acknowledgment of parentage or,if the natural father is someone other than one presumed to be the father under this section,an acknowledgment of parentage and denial of paternity in accordance with section of the vital records act.ilcs a west.
respondent argued that,because he had satisfied all the requirements of section,his cause of action must be allowed to proceed.he signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity,and therefore was presumed to be kendra father under subsection a.he later obtained dna tests that showed he was not kendra father.thus,respondent contended that he was entitled to file an action under section.
following a hearing,the circuit court granted the state motion to dismiss.the circuit court relied on the provision of the parentage act that the presumption of paternity arising from a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity becomes conclusive unless it is timely rescinded.ilcs b west.the court further relied on section d of the parentage act,which provides that a voluntary acknowledgment may be challenged only on the basis of fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact.ilcs d west.as respondent had neither rescinded the acknowledgment within days nor challenged the acknowledgment on one of the grounds listed in section d,the court ruled that his action had to be dismissed the court specifically found that respondent interpretation would render the acknowledgment provision of the statute meaningless.
the appellate court reversed.d.the court relied on the plain language of section,which it noted allowed a cause of action to be brought by a man adjudicated to be the father pursuant to the presumptions in section of this act.d at,quoting ilcs west.the court stated that,pursuant to section b of the parentage act,a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity has the full force and effect of a judgment.d at,quoting ilcs b west.thus,according to the court,respondent had been adjudicated to be kendra father pursuant to one of the presumptions in section.d at.the court acknowledged the conflict with section d provision that a signed acknowledgment of paternity entered under this act may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact d at,quoting ilcs d west.however,the court held that,because section was part of the original act,which became effective july,and section became effective august,it was evident that section was intended to create a limited exception to that rule.d at.the court acknowledged that its interpretation rendered section confusing,and suggested that the legislature amend section to eliminate the confusion.d at.the court specifically rejected the state argument that the terms adjudicated and adjudication in section referred to judicial proceedings and were thus inapplicable to voluntary acknowledgments of paternity because there is no judgment entered in these cases.according to the court,this argument would render section entirely meaningless because the presumptions in sections a man presumed to be the father if child is born or conceived during marriage and a man presumed to be father if after child birth he marries child mother and is named as the father on the birth certificate do not necessarily involve judgments either.d at.we allowed the state petition for leave to appeal.
resolving this issue is solely a matter of statutory construction.we review issues of statutory construction de novo.in re.the primary objective in construing a statute is to determine and give effect to the legislature intent.yang city of chicago.this effort properly begins with an examination of the statutory language.service pipeline mcgaw.each undefined word in the statute must be ascribed its ordinary and popularly understood meaning,at.if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need to resort to other aids of construction.in re.a statute is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.in re.
here,the apparent conflict arises when a man who has signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity wishes to bring a section action.section provides that the cause of action it describes may be brought by a man adjudicated to be the father pursuant to the presumptions in section of this act.ilcs west.section contains four types of presumptions of paternity,two arising out of marriage ilcs a,a west,and two arising out of voluntary acknowledgments ilcs a,a west.however,allowing this cause of action to be brought by a man who becomes a father pursuant to a voluntary acknowledgment would directly contradict section d of the act,which clearly provides that a signed acknowledgment of paternity entered under this act may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact ilcs d west.
one way to avoid the apparent conflict would be simply to give the terms adjudication,adjudicated,and judgment in section their plain and ordinary meanings.adjudicate means t o rule upon judicially black law dictionary ed,while an adjudication is t he legal process of resolving a dispute the process of judicially deciding a case black law dictionary ed.we have previously held that judgment has a definition as a legal term it is a court official decision with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties to a lawsuit.in re marriage of logston.section provides that the cause of action may be brought subsequent to an adjudication of paternity in any judgment by the man adjudicated to be the father pursuant to the presumptions in section.the state contends that this ends the inquiry because a man who becomes a father pursuant to a voluntary acknowledgment is never adjudicated to be the father and there is no judgment entered.thus,according to the state,a man who has become a father by signing a voluntary acknowledgment lacks standing to bring a section action.the state correctly points out that section c of the parentage act provides that a judicial or administrative proceeding to ratify paternity established in accordance with subsection a providing for establishment of paternity by voluntary acknowledgment is neither required nor permitted.ilcs c west.the state interpretation would give effect to the plain language of both section and section d.
respondent points out,however,that the parentage act treats a voluntary acknowledgment as having the same effect as a judgment.section b provides that p aternity established in accordance with subsection a has the full force and effect of a judgment entered under this act and serves as a basis for seeking a child support order without any further proceedings to establish paternity.ilcs b west.moreover,it is apparent that the legislature intended for actions under section d of the parentage act challenging voluntary acknowledgments of paternity on the basis of fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact to be brought by means of a section petition ilcs west.as part of the same public act that added subsection d to section of the parentage act,the legislature amended section a of the code of civil procedure to provide that e xcept as provided in section of the illinois parentage act of,there shall be no distinction between actions and other proceedings,statutory or otherwise,as to availability of relief,grounds for relief or the relief obtainable.emphasis added.pub.act,eff.july,ilcs a west.section is entitled relief from judgments,and by its express terms applies when a party is seeking r elief from final orders and judgments.ilcs a west.thus,the legislature has provided that voluntary acknowledgments should be attacked by the method of relief used to attack final orders and judgments.both the state and respondent have presented reasonable arguments as to what the legislature meant by the terms adjudication,adjudicated,and judgment in section,and thus we must look to other aids of construction.
before doing so,however,we may easily reject the appellate court resolution of the meaning of the word adjudicate.relying on the rule of statutory construction that no term should be rendered superfluous or meaningless,the court held that the state interpretation would render section entirely meaningless.d at.the court reasoned that,just as the voluntary acknowledgment presumptions never involve judgments,the two marital presumptions contained in sections a and a do not necessarily involve judgments either.d at.the appellate court held that because a judgment is not necessarily entered when a man is presumed to be the father in one of these instances,the state interpretation would render section entirely without meaning.of course,this is not the case at all.the section would apply to a man adjudicated to be a father in a dissolution of marriage judgment.a man adjudicated to be a father in a dissolution of marriage judgment,who learns through dna tests that he is not the child father,would have standing to bring a section action.thus,it is unclear how the appellate court reached the conclusion that the state interpretation would render section entirely without meaning.moreover,the legislative history shows that the situation described above is exactly what the legislature had in mind when it enacted section.
when a statute meaning is unclear,the court may examine the legislative history.country mutual insurance teachers insurance.section was added by public act,which became effective on august.the legislative history shows that the bill that became public act was inspired by the
