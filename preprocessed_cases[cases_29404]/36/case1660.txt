introduction 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d states that a dependent child shall not be placed in the home where the child would have contact with an adult who has been convicted of a crime,other than a minor traffic violation.the los angeles county department of children and family services the department has filed a petition for writ of mandate asking this court to vacate the order of the juvenile court placing serena and richard with their maternal and his wife because of the extensive disqualifying history of criminal convictions.we hold that the prohibition in section,subdivision d is mandatory.we further hold that the statute does not otherwise provide the juvenile court with discretion to avoid a disqualifying criminal conviction.thus,the juvenile court acted in excess of its authority in ordering the challenged placement.accordingly,we grant the department writ and direct the juvenile court to vacate its order.
factual and procedural background 
the department filed a petition alleging the children are described by subdivisions b,g,and j of section of the welfare and institutions code because their mother,valerie,has a long history of drug abuse,arrests,and convictions,and used rock cocaine during her pregnancy with serena,all of which endangers the children health,safety,and.
the children were detained and the court ordered the department to conduct a investigation of the maternal,robert,and his wife,delores,for possible placement of the children with them.the investigation revealed,among other things,that delores and robert have been married for one year and are active in their church.because delores works outside the home,she made arrangements for the children.delores has no criminal record.
robert,however,disclosed that he has a criminal record it is believed he has adult convictions for offenses,over the past years,resulting in incarceration in both county jail and state prison.he stated he had a history of drug abuse until.he had had a relapse in,when he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol,although he has since recovered his driver license.he also admitted to activities,years ago.robert is not in good health.he undergoes kidney dialysis three times a week for four hours a day and consequently does not work.he is also on numerous medications for high blood pressure,liver disorder,and renal failure.because of concerns about robert criminal record,history of drug use,and health,the department recommended against the children release to robert and delores.
over the department objections,the court ordered the children released to delores and directed that robert could only have monitored contact with the children and could not babysit them.in making its order,the court found that robert and delores were taking good care of the children and had been forthcoming about their situation.
the department filed an application for rehearing on the ground that the placement of the children in robert home violated the prohibition in section,subdivision d against placing children in a home in which is present an adult with a criminal record other than a minor traffic violation.
instead,the court sustained the petition and ordered that the children remain released to delores.the department filed the instant petition for writ of mandate.
this court issued a notice directing the juvenile court to change its placement order.palma industrial fasteners,cal d.noting the children were receiving appropriate care with delores,the juvenile court ordered robert to move out of delores home and directed the department to verify that robert had moved out.
after the department confirmed that robert had moved,a social worker discovered robert in delores house during a surprise visit.robert admitted spending all his waking hours at delores house,only going to his mother late in the evening to sleep.robert had moved his clothes back into delores house,took showers,ate all his meals there,and maintained unmonitored contact with the children,even driving them to day care.robert and delores stated that their marriage is intact and they planned for robert to move back into the house when the juvenile proceedings terminate.delores also stated,with respect to divorce,that she would do what was needed to protect the children placement.recently,counsel for the children reported that robert had voluntarily stopped transporting the children to and from daycare 
we issued an alternative writ of mandate directing the trial court to remove the children from delores home to bar contact between the children and robert.after the selection and implementation hearing,the department informed this court that the juvenile court had granted delores legal guardianship over the children,again over the department objection,but refrained from terminating its jurisdiction because of the pendency of the instant writ petition.
discussion 
the juvenile court acted in excess of its authority.
the applicable principles of statutory construction are well settled.in construing statutes,we must determine and effectuate legislative intent.citation.to ascertain intent,we look first to the words of the statutes citation,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning citation.if there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute,then the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.where the statute is clear,courts will not interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.citation.citation.lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d.
turning to the statute,section directs,before placing dependent children in a house that is not a licensed or certified foster home,that the department conduct a criminal records check on all adults living in the potential home,and on any other known adult who may have significant contact with the children,or who has a familial or intimate relationship with anyone living in the potential home,subd.b.the department must follow this records check with a fingerprint clearance check to ensure accuracy,subd.d.if the fingerprint clearance check indicates that a person described in section has been convicted of a crime that would preclude licensure under health and safety code section any crime other than a minor traffic statute states the child shall not be placed in the home,subd.d,italics added.
the italicized language of section subdivision d is plain the statute is mandatory.it is a principle that the word shall in statutes is usually construed as a mandatory term.common cause board of supervisors cal d.
section,subdivision d does not confer on the juvenile court any discretion to avoid its prohibition.the section applies broadly to anyone involved in placement because the clause is stated in the passive form.that is,the phrase the child shall not be placed in the home,lacks a subject with the result that it clearly forbids the juvenile court,as well as social workers and the department,to place a child with someone who has a disqualifying criminal conviction.w here the language is clear,there can be no room for interpretation.walker superior court cal d,internal quotation marks omitted.the plain language of section,subdivision d simply precludes the juvenile court from ignoring a disabling criminal conviction.
although there is a provision in the statute allowing for a waiver of the disqualification,the power to grant a waiver was not conferred on the juvenile court,subd.d according to the statute,the county may request a waiver from the director of the department of social services dss.the director has days to grant or deny a waiver application based on the standards set out in health and safety code section,subdivision g it has already been established that t he plain language of both section,subdivision d,and health and safety code section,subdivision g,places responsibility for granting or denying the exemption squarely on the director of dss.the legislature has made no provision for delegation of this duty outside the dss.in re jullian th,d,italics added,fn.omitted.t he statement of limited exceptions excludes others,and therefore the judiciary ha
