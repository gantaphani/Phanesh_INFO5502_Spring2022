in these consolidated appeals,levetus,mother of the minor,angel,appeals from orders of the juvenile court denying her petition for modification and terminating her parental rights.welf,further undesignated statutory references are to this code.in the published part of this opinion,we find the court erred in denying appellant request to represent herself,but that such error was harmless.in the unpublished portions of this opinion,we reject appellant remaining claims of error.we affirm the orders of the juvenile court.
the sacramento county department of health and human services dhhs removed the minor from appellant custody in september based upon allegations of neglect,domestic violence and substance abuse.the court adjudged the minor a dependent child and ordered reunification services,including a psychological evaluation.the evaluation concluded appellant tended to project blame for her problems on others,was unlikely to profit from parenting classes,and would probably have difficulty with independent parenting.appellant participated in services,completed various programs and consistently visited the minor.during visits,appellant was appropriate and the minor seemed to be happy but did not initiate interaction with appellant and was somewhat reserved.the social worker was concerned about appellant parenting skills and referred her to the intensive lekotek parenting program.although visitation interaction was appropriate,the social worker observed that the minor did not seem to be strongly attached to appellant.after several sessions with appellant and the minor,the lekotek provider also expressed her belief that there was a lack of a bond between appellant and the minor despite appellant positive interaction with the minor.according to the lekotek provider,the minor response to appellant ranged from eager interaction to anxiety.
appellant made enough progress in her reunification plan to begin unsupervised and overnight visitation in november but,by february,she had relapsed into substance abuse.at the permanency review hearing,the court terminated services,decreased visitation and set a section hearing.prior to the hearing,appellant requested that the court appoint substitute counsel and,after a hearing,the court granted the request.
the assessment for the section hearing stated appellant had visited the minor consistently twice a week until visitation was suspended and then reduced after appellant relapse.the reports from the visitation supervisor indicated that in the june visit,the minor did not want to have anything to do with appellant and would not show affection,respond to appellant directions or interact with her.the july visit was calmer but the minor still did not readily move toward,interact with,or show affection to appellant.at the august visit,the minor was not affectionate at all and did not respond to appellant babying her.
the section hearing was continued for several months while dhhs sought a prospective adoptive home for the minor.during this time,appellant filed a petition for modification requesting additional reunification services,citing as changed circumstances that she was participating in drug testing,attending alcoholics anonymous,had stable housing and continued to visit the minor regularly.appellant alleged no facts to show the proposed change was in the minor best interests.at the hearing on the petition,the court found the petition did state a change of circumstances based upon appellant participation in some services on her own,but it was not in the minor best interests to reinstate reunification.
in february,dhhs filed an addendum to the assessment for the section hearing which stated that a prospective adoptive placement had been found and that the minor began visits in the new home in january.the social worker reiterated his previous conclusion the minor was likely to be adopted and recommended termination of parental rights.the social worker believed,based upon observation of visits between appellant and the minor,that the minor was not attached or bonded to appellant since the minor seemed disinterested in visiting with the mother.
at the section hearing,appellant again requested substitute counsel,asserting her current counsel failed to return telephone calls,had misrepresented the facts of the case to her and had failed to make arguments appellant considered important.at the court request,counsel responded to the allegations explaining her tactical choices in representing appellant and addressing the alleged misrepresentations and lack of communication.the court found appellant had not demonstrated either a breakdown in the relationship and communications to the extent that new counsel was required or that counsel handling of the case showed bad faith or incompetence.
appellant then sought unsuccessfully to represent herself.proceeding with counsel,appellant testified about her visitation and contact with the minor.focusing upon the most recent visit of february,appellant testified the minor recognized her and appeared happy to see her.in describing the visit,appellant testified the visit went well.she the minor was very happy to see me.she cried momma,momma,i love you.the visit went very well.she did told me that she did want to leave me.the minor counsel interposed a hearsay objection at this point,which the court sustained.appellant did not challenge the ruling.the court terminated parental rights and ordered the minor placed for adoption.
discussion 
after appellant was unsuccessful in moving for substitute counsel,she asked to represent herself the court attempted to explain that it had to find her competent to do so and began to explain the pending hearing but appellant continually interrupted the court and became increasingly upset.concluding it could not take a waiver of the right to counsel given appellant current emotional state,the court called a brief recess in the proceedings.when proceedings resumed,the court did not make any further attempt to inquire of appellant and stated and the court is determining that based on appellant previous inability in these proceedings to focus on the questions necessary to an inquiry on the issue of self representation in order to give appropriate responses and also because demonstrated earlier on the record through her prior conduct that it would be a disruption of the court proceedings for her to proceed in pro per,and we would not be able to conduct a meaningful trial,so i going to leave parent advocates as counsel for the mother.
appellant contends the court erred in denying her request to represent herself.she relies upon the united states supreme court decision in faretta california,d,for the proposition that,because she was competent,she had the right to represent herself.appellant observes that no california case has held faretta does not apply in dependency proceedings and notes the court in in re brian th,at page,d assumed the faretta rule did apply to these proceedings.
in faretta,the supreme court held a criminal defendant not only has the right to the assistance of counsel,but also has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.faretta california,supra,d.the decision in faretta was based on three arguments the history of the right of since the founding of the united states,the structure of the sixth amendment,and respect for the individual.martinez court of app.of cal,d.in martinez,the supreme court applied this reasoning to determine whether there was a right to on appeal of a criminal case and concluded there was not.id.at.at,d at.
the sixth amendment does not apply in dependency proceedings so its structure can not provide a basis for finding a correlative constitutional right of.unlike the bright line rule where the loss of liberty is involved,the constitutional right to counsel in civil cases is evolving.in re andrew th,d.in lassiter department of social services,d,the supreme court held due process may require the appointment of counsel in a proceeding to terminate parental rights the determination is to be made on a basis,applying the factors from mathews eldridge,d.
the dispositive question,which must now be addressed,is whether the three eldridge factors,when weighed against the presumption that there is no right to appointed counsel in the absence of at least a potential deprivation of physical liberty,suffice to rebut that presumption and thus to lead to the conclusion that the due process clause requires the appointment of counsel when a state seeks to terminate an indigent parental status.to summarize the above discussion of the eldridge factors the parent interest is an extremely important one and may be supplemented by the dangers of criminal liability inherent in some termination proceedings the state shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision,has a relatively weak pecuniary interest,and in some but not all cases,has a possibly stronger interest in informal procedures and the complexity of the proceeding,and the incapacity of the uncounseled parent could be,but would not always be,great enough to make the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent rights insupportably high.
if,in a given case,the parent interests were at their strongest,the state interests were at their weakest,and the risks of error were at their peak,it could not be said that the eldridge factors did not overcome the presumption against the right to appointed counsel,and that due process did not therefore require the appointment of counsel.but since the eldridge factors will not always be so distributed,and since due process is not so rigid as to require that the significant interests in informality,flexibility and economy must always be sacrificed,citation,neither can we say that the constitution requires the appointment of counsel in every parental termination proceeding.we therefore adopt the standard found appropriate in gagnon scarpelli,d,and leave the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel for indigent parents in termination proceedings to be answered in the first instance by the trial court,subject,of course,to appellate review.citation.lassiter,supra,at.
in dependency cases in california,it appears settled that whether a due process right to counsel existed at the lower court hearing depends on whether the presence of counsel would have made a determinative difference in the outcome of the proceeding.citation.in re ronald th,d.more specifically,the constitutional right to counsel has been held not to attach at a section hearing.in re andrew th,d.by the time the hearing is held it already has been determined that the parent will not have custody of the child,and the issue to be decided is whether to allow the child to be adopted.certainly the mother has a stake in that decision,and it is proper that she have counsel at the hearing at which the issue will be decided.but in light of the standards announced by the united states supreme court and applied by our supreme court,we can not say the appellant had a constitutional right to appointed counsel at the proceeding.citation.ibid.
since there is no federal constitutional right to counsel from which a right to can be derived,we look to the other two bases of the faretta decision.in martinez,the supreme court found the historical evidence insufficient to support a constitutional right to on appeal in a criminal case.the historical evidence relied upon by faretta as identifying a right of is not always useful because it pertained to times when lawyers were scarce,often mistrusted,and not readily available to the average person accused of crime.for one who could not obtain a lawyer,was the only feasible alternative to asserting no defense at all.thus,a government recognition of an indigent defendant right to represent himself was comparable to bestowing upon the homeless beggar a right to take shelter in the sewers of paris.martinez,supra,at.at,d at.the indigent parent facing a loss of parental rights faces no such stark alternatives,as he or she has an indisputable statutory right to counsel.
finally,the martinez court found the respect for individual autonomy as a basis for a right of must be grounded in the due process clause where the sixth amendment did not apply.martinez,supra,at.at,d at.under the practices that prevail in the nation today,however,we are entirely unpersuaded that the risk of either disloyalty or suspicion of disloyalty is a sufficient concern to conclude that a constitutional right of is a necessary component of a fair appellate proceeding.ibid.this same reasoning applies to defeat a constitutional right to in a dependency proceeding.
nor can a constitutional right to be grounded on the california constitution.in people sharp cal d,at pages,our supreme court held there was no right to under the state constitution.
that there is no constitutional right of in a dependency proceeding does not necessarily mean there is no such right.in in re justin d,this court concluded there is a statutory right to in a proceeding to terminate parental rights,and error in denying this right should be analyzed under ordinary principles of harmless error as set forth in people watson cal d.as we explain,we adhere to that holding.
in justin,an attorney had been appointed to represent the mother in a proceeding to terminate her parental rights under former civil code section.in re justin,supra,d at.at the start of trial,the mother filed a document entitled discharge of attorney and substitution of party in propria persona.the court denied the request to discharge counsel,telling the mother she was stuck with him.id.at,and fn.we found no constitutional right to waive counsel,but that such right had been granted by statute.at that time civil code section,subdivision b provided for the appointment of counsel unless such representation is knowingly and intelligently waived.in re justin,supra,at,fn.original italics.we found the error in depriving the mother of her statutory right to waive counsel was subject to the ordinary principles of harmless error and was harmless.id.at.
the current provisions for the appointment of counsel in dependency cases codified in the welf.are are similar to those considered in justin,supra,d.section provides,in part a when it appears to the court that a parent of the child desires counsel but is presently financially unable to afford and can not for that reason employ counsel,the court may appoint counsel as provided in this section.b when it appears to the court that a parent of the child is presently financially unable to afford and can not for that reason employ counsel,and the child has been placed in care,or the petitioning agency is recommending that the child be placed in care,the court shall appoint counsel,unless the court finds that the parent has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel as provided in this section.d the counsel appointed by the court shall represent the parent,guardian,or child at the detention hearing and at all subsequent proceedings before the juvenile court.counsel shall continue to represent the parent or child unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause.the representation shall include representing the parent or the child in termination proceedings and in those proceedings relating to the institution or setting aside of a legal guardianship.see also cal.rules of court,rule h.
section,subdivision b gives the parent the right to waive counsel in the circumstance where appointment of counsel is mandatory.indeed,the court is not obliged to appoint counsel absent some manifestation by the indigent parent that he or she wants representation.in re ebony th,d.this limitation on the court duty to appoint counsel is implicit recognition that the primary right of the parent is 
we do not read subdivision d,which assures vertical representation throughout the dependency proceedings,to defeat the parent right to waive counsel.a parent may waive counsel at any point.see,in re jamie th,d mother waived right to counsel at in camera hearing where she remained silent after counsel stipulation to permit court to interview children without counsel present.section has been construed to permit relieving counsel from appointment once the parents n
