introduction 
the marriage of appellant darshana nadkarni hereafter darshana and respondent dattaprasanna nadkarni hereafter datta ended in may.since then,the parties have been involved in a child custody dispute regarding their two teenaged children.in april,datta,who is darshana former husband,accessed an email account used by darshana and obtained copies of emails between his former wife and third persons,including her attorney.according to datta,the parties used the email account to communicate about their children,and he accessed the account after discovering that darshana had left the children alone while she traveled to india.datta attached copies of darshana emails to documents he filed in the trial court in their child custody matter.
darshana,on the other hand,asserts that the email account belonged to her and was used for her personal and professional business.she applied for and received a temporary restraining order and order to show cause under the domestic violence prevention act dvpa,et that ordered datta to,among other things,to not engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined such as blackmail,slander,stalking,threatening,harassing,and disturbing the peace of darshana or third parties through the use of personal information accessed through darshana email.darshana sought to extend the restraining order,but after a proceeding on the order to show cause held in march,the trial court dismissed her application on april.
on appeal,darshana contends that the trial court erred in dismissing her application for a restraining order on the ground that datta alleged conduct was insufficient to constitute abuse within the meaning of the dvpa.for the reasons stated below,we find that darshana application for a restraining order under the dvpa was facially sufficient.therefore,we will reverse the april,order dismissing the application for a restraining order and remand the matter for a hearing on the merits.
ii.factual and procedural background 
during their long term marriage,darshana and datta had a son and a daughter.darshana filed a petition for marital dissolution on june.the record indicates that their divorce was final in may and a child custody order awarding joint legal and physical custody of the children was entered on may.
on july,datta filed a declaration in support of his motion to reaffirm joint legal custody,modification of child support and other relief.datta stated that on may,the trial court had granted darshana request for temporary sole custody pending family mediation.underscoring omitted.datta also filed a supplemental declaration on august,in which he accused darshana of gross negligence in leaving their children,aged and,alone while she was in india during march and april of without informing him of her absence or providing him with contact information.underscoring omitted.
datta attached to his august,supplemental declaration copies of several emails between darshana and third persons,including her family law attorney and the children,that were sent in march and april of.datta stated in his supplemental declaration that he had no choice but to access darshana emails because his kids safety was at stake.underscoring omitted.he further stated that in sheer panic and desperation i tried to access the email accounts which i had myself set up for darshana and my son several years ago,to see if i had missed any emails from her regarding her international travel plans.
according to datta,the emails showed that when darshana was contacted by child protective services which had begun an investigation of the children welfare at datta request,she falsely stated that she had arranged for her brother look after the children in her absence.datta also asserted in his supplemental declaration that the emails showed that darshana had instructed the children to lie to him regarding her whereabouts.additionally,datta claimed that he had procured more evidence from the above mentioned email accounts,which could be considered inflammatory and sensitive to certain others.i have no intention to share these emails other than as evidence in future legal proceedings.
on october,darshana filed a judicial council form request for a temporary restraining order under the dvpa,section et in her supporting declaration,filed october,darshana stated that she became aware in august that datta had accessed her email account when he attached copies of her email messages to documents that he filed in the trial court in their child custody matter she asserted that she had created the email account after the parties separated and she had never authorized datta or any third party to use the account or given them the password.according to darshana,she used the email account for several confidential matters,including communicating with her family law attorney,communicating with her clients in her executive search and employment counseling business,storing her financial records,storing her mother financial and medical records,communicating with third parties regarding her mother finances,and communicating with third parties regarding potential job candidates.
darshana further asserted in her october,declaration that i am also quite disturbed by datta statement in his august,supplemental declaration that i have procured more evidence from the email accounts,which could be considered inflammatory and sensitive to certain others.i have no intention to share these emails other than as evidence in future legal proceedings.given that the information was in my email account,i believe this statement is a direct threat that unless i succumb to his demands in the family law case,he will interfere and directly impact my business relationships.i also believe he will file my personal emails in the family court action in order to embarrass me,and to injure my relationships with my family members and,including professional clients.boldface omitted.
additionally,darshana claimed that datta had used the information obtained from her email account to subpoena the records of third parties,including her business contacts,and to find out what social events she would be attending.she stated that datta has told others that he knew which social events i would be attending within the past three months.i was unable to determine how he became aware of my schedule until learning of his access to my email account.his knowledge of my attendance at these activities has caused me fear for my safety based on his prior treatment of me during our marriage.datta repeatedly abused me physically during our marriage.the most recent incident was in november,when he beat me viciously and repeatedly in front of our children.he was convicted and sentenced to days in jail.
based on these allegations,darshana requested an ex parte temporary restraining order that,with respect to the emails,barred datta from engag ing in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined such as blackmail,slander,stalking,threatening,harassing,and disturbing the peace of darshana or third parties through the use of personal information accessed through darshana email using,delivering,distributing,printing,copying,or disclosing the message or content of darshana email account to others and attempting to access or otherwise interfere with her internet service provider accounts darshana also requested that datta be ordered to deliver to her attorney within three business days of service of the order all electronically downloaded media accessed from her email account,all hardcopies of any and all information accessed through her email account,and the identities of all third parties to whom datta has provided copies of or access to information obtained from her email account.
on october,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order on judicial council form that restricted datta conduct with regard to darshana emails as she had requested in her application the temporary restraining order also included an order to show cause why the restraining order should not be extended for up to five years and set a hearing date of november,later continued to december.
datta filed an answer to the order to show cause on judicial council form on december.he opposed the extension of the restraining order for the reasons stated in his supporting declaration.first,in contrast to darshana statements about the creation of her email account,datta asserted that he had created the account and selected the password sometime in or for the purpose of allowing the parties to communicate about their marital dissolution matter and their children while darshana was traveling.second,datta maintained that u p until august,i always had access to this email account with the knowledge and agreement of darshana,through our joint knowledge of the password which i began when i created this email account.
datta also emphasized that he accessed the account in april when he was unable to contact darshana and had received evasive replies from his children and darshana attorney regarding her whereabouts.he explained that a t this point,i accessed the email account to see if it disclosed darshana whereabouts.i discovered through several emails she was in india with her mother.i was alarmed because i believed my children were abandoned by darshana with no proper adult supervision,especially during the evenings.i believed the foregoing email admissions by darshana were relevant to pending family mediation hearings that were to commence on may.the hearings included darshana demand for legal and physical custody,to which i objected.i believed the several emails supported my opposition to darshana receiving legal and physical custody.
datta answer also included his evidentiary objections and his argument that the application for a restraining order should be denied because darshana declaration failed to set forth any facts that came within either the dvpa,section,or the civil harassment statute,code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.
the parties appeared at the hearing on the order to show cause that was set for december,and advised the trial court that they had agreed to continue the hearing as a long cause matter.the trial court then set a hearing date of march,and continued the temporary restraining order until that time.
darshana filed a trial brief on march.she argued that a restraining order was warranted under the dvpa,the civil harassment statute code civ,subd.b and the civil stalking statute,because,in addition to physical violence,any type of knowing and willful behavior that harasses or disturbs the peace of darshana also meet s the requirements for a restraining order.additionally,based on her allegations that datta had a history of abusing her physically and emotionally,darshana asserted that she feared that he would continue to use the private and privileged information that he had obtained from her emails to to control,harass,and abuse her if he were not enjoined from such conduct.
darshana therefore sought a permanent restraining order as requested on her application with a duration of no less than years.she also sought an order permanently sealing the emails attached to the documents that datta had filed in the trial court and that she had filed conditionally under seal,and requested an award of attorney fees and monetary sanctions.
the record reflects that datta subsequently brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings.however,the motion for judgment on the pleadings was not included in the record on appeal,which contains a clerk certificate attesting that after a diligent search,the superior court clerk was unable to locate the motion for judgment on the pleadings or the supporting points and authorities and declaration.the clerk certificate also states that the filing date of the motion for judgment on the pleadings is unknown.however,the record contains darshana opposition to the motion for judgment on the pleadings,filed on march.she argued that the motion should be denied because it was untimely and because datta conduct with respect to her emails fell within the scope of the abuse that may be enjoined under the dvpa and the civil harassment statute code civ,subd.b.specifically,darshana contended that a reasonable person who has been subject to datta history of abusive and harassing behavior,as she has,would be in reasonable fear that he will use this information to harm her business and livelihood,her reputation in the cultural community,and her personal relationships.
the parties appeared on darshana application for a permanent restraining order on the hearing date of march.the trial court initially inquired as to whether the domestic violence matter was entitled to calendar preference on the court morning calendar.the parties disagreed,with darshana attorney noting that she had several witnesses ready to testify.however,the court decided to hear the other matters on calendar first.when the application for a restraining order was called in the afternoon,the trial court stated,over the noon hour,i had a chance to review this file and also the motion for judgment on the pleadings.i know i the judge who originally signed the temporary restraining order,but i have to tell you that it was kind of an iffy thing for me.i think the complaint of conduct may very well be illegal,but i do think that it rises to the level of conduct that is amenable to the domestic violence prevention act.so i inclined to dismiss the case without prejudice to you filing a civil action in the superior court.darshana attorney objected that the motion for judgment on the pleadings had not been filed.the trial court responded,actually,because i got your opposition,i wanted to see what the basis of the motion was.so i secured it.datta attorney then advised the court that he had made an ineffectual attempt to file the motion for judgment on the pleadings on the morning of the hearing and intended to file the motion that afternoon.
in a written order filed on april,the trial court stated that datta had submitted his motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered that a fter due consideration of datta motion and the argument of counsel,darshana application for a restraining order was dismissed.darshana filed a timely notice of appeal on april.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,darshana argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her application for a restraining order under the dvpa et because the rules governing challenges to the sufficiency of the pleadings in a family law matter do not permit a motion for judgment on the pleadings the court failed to provide an evidentiary hearing on the merits,which is required where an application for a restraining order is facially sufficient under the dvpa and her application for a restraining order included a showing of abuse sufficient for the issuance of a dvpa restraining order and the court failed to provide the requisite statutory procedural safeguards,including calendar preference,consideration of datta criminal history,and consideration of whether denial of the application for a restraining order will jeopardize the applicant safety.
we will begin our evaluation of darshana claims of trial court error with an overview of the dvpa et and the standard of review that applies to an order denying an application for a restraining order under the dvpa.
a.the domestic violence prevention act 
the dvpa et authorizes the trial court to issue a restraining order for the purpose of preventing a recurrence of domestic violence and ensuring a period of separation of the persons involved,if an affidavit shows,to the satisfaction of the court,reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.gonzalez munoz th,d.a restraining order may issue under the dvpa either enjoining specific acts of abuse,excluding a person from a dwelling,or enjoining other specified behavior and may issue ex parte,after notice and a hearing,or in a judgment.
for purposes of the dvpa,abuse means any of the following a intentionally or recklessly to cause or attempt to cause bodily injury.b sexual assault.c to place a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.d to engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to section,italics added nakamura parker th,d nakamura.
section provides in part that t he court may issue an ex parte order enjoining a party from molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,battering,harassing,telephoning,including,but not limited to,annoying telephone calls as described in section of the penal code,destroying personal property,contacting,either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise,coming within a specified distance of,disturbing the peace of the other party,and,in the discretion of the court,on a showing of good cause,of other named family or household members.nakamura,supra,th at,d.
a dvpa restraining order may be issued in an independent action brought by a former spouse who has been the subject of abuse within the meaning of the dvpa,subd.b nakamura,supra,th at,d.the procedure for obtaining an ex parte temporary restraining order is set forth in section et.under section,when an application for a temporary restraining order is granted,the order must include an order to show cause why a permanent restraining order should not be granted and set a hearing date within or days before the hearing on the order to show cause,the trial court is required to ensure that a search is or has been conducted to determine if the subject of the proposed order has any prior criminal conviction for certain felony and misdemeanor offenses,including a misdemeanor conviction involving domestic violence,subd.a.if the criminal investigation reveals that the subject of the proposed order has been convicted of one of the offenses enumerated in section,subdivision a,the trial court must consider the conviction before deciding whether to issue a dvpa restraining order,subd.b.
the dvpa also specifies the duration of the personal conduct,and residence exclusion orders that may issue after notice and a hearing,subd.a.in the discretion of the court,such restraining orders may have a duration of no more than five years and may be renewed,upon the request of a party,either for five years or permanently,without a showing of any further abuse,subd.a.
the standard of review for an order denying injunctive relief is abuse of discretion,because granting,denial,dissolving or refusing to dissolve a permanent or preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court upon consideration of all the particular circumstances of each individual case citations.salazar eastin cal th,d.this standard applies to a grant or denial of a protective order under the dvpa.citations.gonzalez munoz,supra,th at,d.
having reviewed the statutory framework governing restraining orders under the dvpa and the applicable standard of review,we turn to our analysis of the issues on appeal.
sufficiency of the application for a dvpa restraining order 
darshana argues that the trial court erred in finding that her application and supporting declaration failed to allege abuse that is sufficient for the issuance of a restraining order under the dvpa.she asserts that the requisite abuse need not involve physical injury or assault,and the dvpa must be broadly construed to authorize a restraining order where,as here,the application shows fear for the applicant safety,due to the applicant former spouse using information gained from accessing the applicant private email account,and in light of the former spouse previous physical violence.additionally,darshana claims that h ad she been able to be heard on the merits,the court would have heard testimony about how datta conduct harassed her,disturbed her peace,invaded her privacy,frightened her and intimidated her.
according to datta,darshana showing was insufficient to warrant a finding of abuse within the meaning of the dvpa because she did not allege any contact by him and the dvpa was not intended to include such vague allegations of embarrassment or access to alleged private email accounts.our resolution of the issue is governed by the pertinent provisions of the dvpa and its legislative history.
to be facially sufficient under the dvpa,an application for a restraining order must allege abuse within the meaning of the dvpa.as noted above in part a,ante,the definition of abuse under the dvpa includes engaging in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to section,subd.d.section provides in part that t he court may issue an ex parte order enjoining a party from molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,battering,harassing,telephoning,including,but not limited to,annoying telephone calls as described in section of the penal code,destroying personal property,contacting,either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise,coming within a specified distance of,disturbing the peace of the other party,and,in the discretion of the court,on a showing of good cause,of other named family or household members.
thus,section provides that the requisite abuse need not be actual infliction of physical injury or assault.conness satram th,d.to the contrary,section lists several types of nonviolent conduct that may constitute abuse within the meaning of the dvpa,including two types of conduct relevant to the present case.
first,section provides that contacting the other party either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise may constitute abuse.in the present case,darshana stated in her declaration that datta had told other persons that he knew which social events i would be attending,which caused her to fear for her safety because he had physically abused her in the past.assuming,without deciding,that darshana statements are true,datta alleged conduct of viewing darshana private email,learning her social schedule,and communicating this information to third persons who then told darshana that datta was aware of her schedule,could constitute indirect and threatening contact with darshana,and thus abuse within the meaning of section.
second,section broadly provides that disturbing the peace of the other party constitutes abuse for purposes of the dvpa.the dvpa does not provide any definition for the phrase disturbing the peace of the other party,and we therefore turn to the rules of statutory construction to determine the meaning of the phrase and whether datta conduct,as alleged by darshana in her declaration,may constitute abuse within the meaning of the dvpa.
in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.estate of griswold cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.id.at,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.ibid.if there is ambiguity,however,we may then look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.ibid.in such cases,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.ibid.
to determine the plain meaning of statutory language,we may resort to the dictionary.when attempting to ascertain the ordinary,usual meaning of a word in a statute,courts appropriately refer to the dictionary definition of that word.wasatch property management degrate cal th,d.the ordinary meaning of disturb is t o agitate and destroy quiet,peace,rest to break up the quiet,tranquility,or rest of a person,a country,to stir up,trouble,disquiet.oxford english dictionary online ed as of.peace,as a condition of the individual,is ordinarily defined as freedom from anxiety,disturbance emotional,mental or spiritual,or inner conflict calm,tranquillity sic.ibid.thus,the plain meaning of the phrase disturbing the peace of the other party in section may be properly understood as conduct that destroys the mental or emotional calm of the other party.
our interpretation of the phrase disturbing the peace of the other party in section also comports with the legislative history of the dvpa.as enacted in stats,ch,the dvpa collected earlier provisions for the issuance o
