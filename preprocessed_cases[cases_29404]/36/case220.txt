factual and procedural history 
cherie shipp shipp was involved in an abusive marriage with her husband,dalton shipp dalton in shreveport,louisiana.to escape her husband abuse,shipp moved into her sister home near minden,louisiana.when dalton learned of shipp whereabouts,he made several threatening phone calls to her,which she reported to deputies of the webster parish sheriff office wpso.on several occasions,dalton also drove by the home of shipp sister.shipp reported these to steve cropper cropper,a webster parish deputy.cropper informed shipp that he would do nothing about dalton.
shipp then moved to her cousin residence in dubberly,which is also in webster parish.dalton went to the house in dubberly,attacked shipp by beating her with a telephone that he ripped from the wall,and hit her with his fist.he forewarned shipp that if she reported the incident to law enforcement,she would find herself in the hospital.after physically abusing her,dalton took some items belonging to shipp and her cousin,placed them in his automobile,and drove off.despite dalton admonition,shipp called the wpso.deputy cropper came to the scene and took a report,but made no immediate effort to arrest dalton.
several days later,deputy cropper approached dalton about returning the items that he took from the residence of shipp cousin,but did not arrest him.afterward,dalton was allowed to turn himself in,and he was charged with simple criminal damage to property and simple battery,both misdemeanor offenses.as a condition of bail,the court ordered that dalton stay away from shipp.dalton pleaded guilty to both offenses,and the court ordered him to seek immediate counseling.the court set sentencing for a later date.
shipp obtained a temporary restraining order tro that prohibited dalton from having any contact with her.after deputy cropper served dalton with the tro,dalton made several abusive and threatening phone calls to shipp,which shipp reported to the wpso.she was told that nothing could be done about the phone calls,and despite his violations of the tro and the bail order,the wpso did not arrest dalton.
dalton failed to appear in court for sentencing on the criminal charges,and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued.although dalton eventually appeared in court to answer other unrelated criminal charges at the webster parish courthouse,deputies nonetheless failed to arrest him for violating the tro and conditions of bail.
approximately four months after dalton failed to appear at the scheduled sentencing hearing for the offenses committed against shipp,dalton tracked down shipp at her other sister house and convinced shipp to come out of the house and get into his car.once in the car,dalton sped away with shipp feet dragging the ground.she attempted to jump out of the car,but dalton grabbed her by the head and drove shipp to a house that he had leased in webster parish.
shipp sister telephoned her mother,carolyn gates,who reported the incident to the wpso.betty shipp,dalton mother,was the dispatcher who received the phone call.apparently,she hung up the telephone without conducting an inquiry into the particulars of the incident before advising deputy cropper of the call.he chose to take no action,despite his knowledge of dalton propensity for violent behavior.neither cropper nor betty shipp dispatched information to alert the other deputies.
after betty shipp terminated the phone call,shipp mother called the minden police department,which dispatched an emergency alert and radioed the wpso.shipp mother then picked up jerry gates,shipp father,and drove to the webster parish courthouse.they observed deputy cropper standing idly outside the courthouse.cropper advised gates that he intended to do nothing to apprehend dalton.after they discussed where dalton may be located with shipp,gates denounced cropper unwillingness to act,and told him that he was heading to dalton leased house.deputy cropper and another deputy pursued gates.
subsequently,gates and four deputies arrived at the house.when the deputies made no effort to enter the house,gates attempted to approach the house,but was restrained by the deputies.cropper then knocked on the door,explaining that he had to ascertain whether shipp was voluntarily in the house with dalton.no one inside answered cropper knock.
at dalton house,gates observed what he believed to be a silhouette on a curtain showing a person with a gun.gates again attempted to approach the house,but the deputies ordered him back.a shot rang out from the house and the deputies immediately retreated to their vehicles to put on armored vests.another shot rang out as the deputies remained crouched behind their cars.
inside the house,dalton had raped shipp.after shooting her in the chest with a shotgun,he shot himself.shipp staggered to the door and unsuccessfully attempted to open it.she screamed for help,but none of the deputies responded.shipp eventually staggered out a side door holding her entrails in her hands.
as she exited the house,shipp mother and a deputy raced to her aid.gates also dashed toward shipp,but cropper abruptly intercepted him.at cropper order,another deputy handcuffed gates and removed him from the scene.
shipp was transported to a hospital,where she underwent emergency surgery.she was hospitalized for several weeks,followed by rehabilitation,therapy,and more surgery.dalton recovered from his wounds and was subsequently charged with aggravated rape,aggravated kidnapping,and attempted second degree murder.following the incident,the wpso took no disciplinary action against any deputy.
in february,shipp and gates filed an action under in federal district court against sheriffs royce mcmahon and theodore riser and wpso deputies shipp and cropper defendants.shipp and gates claimed that the defendants violated their federal constitutional due process and equal protection rights.shipp and gates also alleged claims based on louisiana state tort law.the defendants moved to dismiss under fed.b.in january,the magistrate judge filed a report recommending that all of shipp federal constitutional claims,with the exception of the equal protection claim and the related failure to train claim,be dismissed with prejudice all federal claims by plaintiff jerry gates be dismissed with prejudice,and all claims against sheriff theodore riser be dismissed with prejudice,and the motion be denied in all other aspects.the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendation.the district court also exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state tort law claims and ordered shipp to file a reply to the assertion of qualified immunity by deputies cropper and shipp.after reviewing shipp reply to the qualified immunity issue,the district court found that shipp had met the pleading requirements articulated in schultea wood,cir en banc,and denied the defendants motion to dismiss.the defendants now appeal the district court ruling denying their motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity.
standard of review 
denials of motions to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds are appealable collateral orders when based on issues of law.mitchell forsyth,d champagne jefferson parish sheriff office,cir per curiam.we review the district court ruling under rule b de novo.lowrey texas university system,cir.a motion to dismiss under rule b is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.kaiser aluminum chem.sales avondale shipyards,cir.the complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff,and all facts pleaded in the complaint must be taken as true.campbell wells fargo bank,cir.the district court may not dismiss a complaint under rule b unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.this strict standard of review under rule b has been summarized as follows the question therefore is whether in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and with every doubt resolved in his behalf,the complaint states any valid claim for relief.charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
discussion 
the defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because shipp failed to plead that the defendants violated clearly established law.in other words,the defendants maintain that when the alleged improper conduct occurred,there existed no clearly established law recognizing an equal protection claim based on law enforcement policies,practices,and customs toward domestic abuse cases.
qualified immunity 
the qualified immunity analysis involves a process.first,we examine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.see siegert gilley,d wooley city of baton rouge,cir.if the court determines that the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,the next step is to determine whether the official conduct was objectively reasonable at the time of the incident.sanchez swyden,cir mangieri clifton,cir.thus,if the pleadings on their face show an unreasonable violation of a clearly establish constitutional right,the defense of qualified immunity will not sustain a motion to dismiss under rule b.
clearly established right 
when evaluating a claim of qualified immunity under the clearly established right prong,a court first must determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all,and if so,proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.wilson layne,d quoting conn gabbert,d.thus,we begin our inquiry by addressing domestic assault and equal protection.
the first cases testing the viability of an equal protection claim relating to law enforcement policies,customs,and practices toward domestic abuse cases were filed in the.however,those cases were ultimately settled before trial the first reported case holding that a law enforcement policy that treated victims of domestic abuse differently than victims of assault constituted an equal protection violation was decided in.see thurman city of torrington,denying the police officers motion to dismiss and declaring that the plaintiff allegation that the officers intentionally afforded victims of domestic assault less protection than victims of other assault was sufficient to state an equal protection claim.
in,the supreme court decided deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.although the main issue in deshaney involved the plaintiff substantive due process claim regarding the defendant failure to remove timely the plaintiff,a,from his abusive father custody the court in footnote three provided pivotal language that has formed the foundation for contemporary equal protection challenges to law enforcement policies,practices,and customs toward domestic abuse.the court stated that,t he state may not of course,selectively deny its protective services to certain disfavored minorities without violating the equal protection clause.id.at.citation omitted.
the same year deshaney was decided,we addressed for the first time whether a plaintiff claim based on police inaction,and law enforcement policies and customs that allegedly treated victims of domestic assault differently from victims of other crimes violate the equal protection clause as contemplated by the supreme court in deshaney footnote three.in mckee city of rockwall,texas,cir,we affirmed a district court grant of summary judgment asserting that the plaintiff failed to produce sufficient summary judgment evidence to show that the defendants adopted law enforcement policies,customs,and practices that treated victims of domestic assault differently from victims of other crimes.mckee,at.as such,the court left open the questions of whether law enforcement policies,practices,and customs that treat victims of domestic assault differently from victims of other crimes constitute intentional discrimination against women under washington davis,d,and whether such policies discriminate against protected minorities within the meaning of deshaney footnote three.mckee,at.
approximately eleven years after mckee,we are again called upon to address whether a domestic abuse victim complaint against a law enforcement agency and its officials for failure to effectuate an arrest,and for their adoption of policies,practices,and customs that discriminate against victims of domestic assault constitute intentional discrimination against women,and thus is cognizable under the equal protection clause.specifically,shipp claims that the defendants through their policies,practices,and customs afforded less protection to victims of domestic assault than other assault victims.furthermore,shipp claims that these policies,customs,and practices disproportionately impact women because an overwhelming majority of the victims of domestic assaults are women.the issues raised in shipp complaint invoke the unresolved questions of mckee.
before addressing mckee unresolved questions,we recognize that governmental policies,which create neutral classifications that have a disproportionate adverse impact upon a protected class,are unconstitutional under the equal protection clause only if the disproportionate impact can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.personnel administrator of feeney,d.thus,the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits a state from engaging in intentionally discriminatory conduct that has an adverse disparate impact on women unless the state can show an exceedingly persuasive justification for that action.see united states virginia,d.state policies that perpetuate antiquated and outdated gender stereotypes that are derogatory and condescending toward women do not form the basis for proper discriminatory purpose.see mississippi university for women hogan,d.
in addressing the questions mckee left open,we observe that courts from other circuits have addressed similar equal protection challenges based on law enforcement policies,practices,and customs that treat victims of domestic assault differently from other crime victims.in watson city of kansas city,cir,a victim of domestic assault brought a action against a city,the city police department,and several police officers acting in their official capacities for adopting policies,practices,and customs that provided less protection to domestic assault victims than other assault victims.in addressing the victim claim,the watson court articulated a legal standard that domestic assault victims must meet to sustain an equal protection challenge.the watson court declared that to maintain an equal protection claim,the plaintiff must show that a policy or custom was adopted by the defendants to provide less protection to victims of domestic assault than to other assault victims that discrimination against women was the motivating factor for the defendants and that the injury was caused by the operation of the policy or custom.see watson at.
several other circuits have adopted the standard articulated in watson to review equal protection claims brought by victims of domestic assault.see soto flores,cir stating that,u nder the standard we adopt today,soto must show that there is a policy or custom of providing less protection to victims of domestic assault than to other victims,that gender discrimination is a motivating factor,and that soto was injured by the practice ricketts city of columbia,cir applying the watson standard to an equal protection claim against a municipality eagleston guido,cir applying the watson standard hynson city of chester,cir announcing that,w e agree with the watson court that if the categories used by the police in administering the law are domestic assault and nondomestic assault,this is not sufficient to raise a claim for discrimination absent a showing of an intent,purpose or effect of discriminating against women
