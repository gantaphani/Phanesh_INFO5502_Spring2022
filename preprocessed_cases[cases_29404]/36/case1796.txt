this appeal involves amendments to the illinois parentage act of ilcs et west concerning removal of children from illinois.
background 
vincent fisher and jill waldrop never married,but were involved in a relationship for several years.they had a child,callie,who was born in february.in august fisher and waldrop ended their relationship,and in may fisher filed a petition to establish the relationship.waldrop admitted that fisher was callie father,and in december the circuit court of sangamon county entered an order to that effect.the court awarded custody of callie to waldrop,but also set forth an extensive and detailed visitation schedule for fisher.in its order,the court decline d to impose geographic restrictions on jill choice of residence.in its order disposing of both parties motions for reconsideration,the court specified that i n the event waldrop decides to move from her present residence,whether that move be intrastate or interstate,the issue of visitation between fisher and callie will be based upon the circumstances that exist at that time.
in december,approximately a year after the order establishing paternity,fisher filed a petition for temporary and permanent injunction pursuant to section of the parentage act ilcs west.in that petition fisher alleged that waldrop had notified him that she planned to move to indiana with callie and her new husband in.fisher asserted that waldrop had not sought permission from the court to remove callie from the state,as he contended she was required to do,and argued that to permit waldrop to remove callie from illinois would cause irreparable harm to his relationship with callie and would not be in callie best interests.fisher asked the court to enjoin waldrop from removing callie from illinois.
shortly thereafter,waldrop filed a petition pursuant to section of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act the marriage act ilcs west for leave to remove callie from illinois.in the petition waldrop noted that she had remarried and her new spouse had found employment in indiana despite having been unable to do so in illinois.accordingly,she argued,it would be in callie best interests to permit waldrop to remove her from illinois.however,approximately a week after filing her petition for leave to remove,waldrop moved to dismiss the petition.in the motion to dismiss,waldrop noted that she and fisher were never married,and asserted that ilcs governs petitions for removal in paternity cases,and it is the petitioner burden of proof to show that injunction is appropriate.
the court held a hearing on fisher petition in june.at the outset of the hearing the court ruled that as a legal matter,the burden was on the person objecting to this case,establish that removal would not be in the child best interests.the hearing lasted several days.not only did waldrop and fisher both testify,they also introduced numerous exhibits and expert testimony regarding the effect on callie of the proposed move.
shortly after the conclusion of the hearing,the court rendered its decision in a lengthy written order.the court found that both waldrop and fisher were responsible for their acrimonious relationship with each other,but also found that b ut for their relationship with one another,both fisher and waldrop are good,loving,effective parents.relevant to our disposition of this case is the following portion of the court order 
if the court were only to consider what is in the best interests of callie fisher,the court would conclude that it is not in the best interests of callie that she be removed from the state of illinois.the move from springfield,illinois to richmond,indiana will separate callie from a parent with whom she has a close,loving relationship she will be removed from the home in which she has been raised since shortly after her birth her contact with her extended family,with whom she has a close relationship,will be substantially curtailed she will move to a location where she has no extended family or friends she will be subjected to a difficult commute in order to visit her father and other extended family members she is moving to a community that does not have the resources that springfield has and strained communications between two parents which the court attributes to each parent will become almost impossible.the court also has substantial concern about how callie will be cared for in richmond when waldrop is away from home for her craft shows which are her livelihood.the court has substantial concerns about the nature of the relationship between callie and waldrop new husband.by virtue of this order callie will have to go through a period of adjustment with a new in her home as well as a period of adjustment to a new community,in a new school,meeting new friends,all of which will have to be accomplished without her father or her extended family with whom she is very close and on whom she relies for emotional support.these problems were foreseeable when waldrop elected to marry a man who had not lived in illinois prior to the marriage and who planned to move the family to georgia after marriage.it is a finding of this court that one of waldrop motives to marry and move away from springfield was to separate herself from fisher.the court also finds that fisher is partly responsible for this result based upon his conduct towards waldrop.
the court concludes from the evidence that indirect benefits to callie require the court to deny the complaint for injunctive relief and thereby permit waldrop to remove callie to the state of indiana.waldrop new husband was not able to find employment in illinois.the job he has found in indiana is a well paying job.waldrop is pregnant,so that if the court allows the injunction the unborn baby will be separated from his father,balanced against a granting of the injunction which will result in callie being separated from fisher.no matter what the court orders one child will lose contact with a parent.in this circumstance the benefit to waldrop that indirectly benefits callie is sufficient to warrant the denial of the complaint for injunctive relief.
fisher appealed.in proceedings before the appellate court,waldrop appellee brief was due on december.that date passed without waldrop having filed a brief.approximately two weeks later,on december,waldrop new counsel filed a motion requesting additional time to file waldrop appellate brief.although fisher made no objection,the appellate court denied waldrop leave to file a late brief.in its opinion disposing of the case,the appellate court noted that waldrop had failed to file a brief,but stated that the claimed error is such that we can decide this appeal on the merits without the aid of waldrop appellee brief.d,citing first capitol mortgage talandis construction.
the appellate court reversed and remanded,directing the circuit court to grant fisher a permanent injunction.d.the court noted that the legislature had amended the parentage act in to deal with removal,and found that the amendments were intended to achieve two ends to give noncustodial parents a way to forestall removal while custody issues were pending and to incorporate section of the marriage act into the parentage act,thereby requiring custodial parents to seek leave to remove a child from the state under the standards set forth in section.d at.the court held that the custodial parent had the burden of proving that removal was in the child best interests in parentage act proceedings,just as they would in marriage act proceedings pursuant to section,and the circuit court erred by placing the burden of proof on fisher,the noncustodial parent.the court further ruled that the circuit court order denying the injunction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the court had found that removal was not in callie best interests.d at.finally,the appellate court held that the circuit court had erred in granting waldrop permission to remove callie from illinois,because there was no petition for removal pending before the court.
justice mccullough dissented.d at,mccullough,dissenting.he agreed with the majority that section of the marriage act controlled,but did not believe that the circuit court had evaluated callie best interests for purposes of making a section determination.he would have remanded for the circuit court to perform such an evaluation rather than ordering the circuit court to grant a permanent injunction.
we granted waldrop petition for leave to appeal.see a.
waldrop raises two arguments before this court.she argues first that the appellate court violated her due process rights when the court refused to allow her to file a late appellate brief.in the alternative,she argues that the appellate court construction of the parentage act was faulty,specifically that the court erred in holding that a custodial parent must file a petition for removal before removing a child from the state and that the custodial parent has the burden of proving that removal would be in the best interests of the child.
we decline to address waldrop due process argument because it is moot.whatever injury waldrop may have suffered in being prevented from filing her brief with the appellate court was cured when this court granted her leave to appeal.before this court waldrop may raise any and all arguments that she could have presented to the appellate court,and we give the appellate court decision no deference in resolving the issues before us.there is no other relief we could grant her even if we were to rule in her favor,which renders the issue moot.see in re,an issue is rendered moot when an intervening event makes it impossible for the court to grant effective relief to the complaining party.thus even if we were to agree that the appellate court erred in refusing to accept a late brief from a custodial parent in a case of first impression involving a minor child,the fact that waldrop may now make any and all arguments she could have made in the appellate court would render any such error inconsequential.see,at.
accordingly,we turn to the merits of the case.the question we must answer is what procedures must be followed in a case brought under the parentage act when a custodial parent seeks to remove a child from illinois.waldrop argues that in proceedings under the parentage act the custodial parent may remove a child from illinois unless the noncustodial parent files for and obtains an injunction pursuant to section.she argues that the burden is on the noncustodial parent to show that removal would not be in the child best interests,and that the appellate court erred in holding otherwise.fisher advocates for a different interpretation of the statutory scheme.he contends that custodial parents now must seek leave of court before removing a child from illinois in actions brought under the parentage act just as they must in proceedings under the marriage act.he argues that section is only intended to permit the noncustodial parent to enjoin removal until a custodial parent petition for removal can be dealt with on the merits.
this dispute turns on statutory construction.the principles which guide our analysis are familiar.our standard of review is de novo,and our primary objective is to give effect to the legislature intent.the best indication of legislative intent is the statutory language,given its plain and ordinary meaning.thus,when the statutory language is clear,it must be given effect without resort to other tools of interpretation,although we always presume that the legislature did not intend to create absurd,inconvenient or unjust results.in re.
courts should consider a statute in its entirety,keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the legislature apparent objective in enacting it and avoiding constructions which would render any term meaningless or superfluous.andrews kowa printing,stroger regional transportation authority.moreover,this court has a duty to construe a statute in a manner that upholds its validity and constitutionality if it reasonably can be done.in re,at.
before,the parentage act did not contain any provisions relating specifically to the issue of removal of children from illinois.although section of the marriage act speaks directly to the situation our appellate court does not import provisions of the marriage act into parentage act cases absent express statutory authority.see,in re stella,d,only those marriage act relevant factors and standards expressly embraced by the parentage act may be applied by trial judges in parentage cases.before no provision of the parentage act referenced or incorporated section of the marriage act,and accordingly,the appellate court never applied the requirements of section to the issue of removal in parentage act proceedings.see in re adams,d,circuit court has no inherent power to enjoin custodial parent from removing child from state in parentage actions in re parentage of melton,d,same in re parentage of,d,because the parentage act contains no provisions requiring that actions for removal be resolved pursuant to section of the marriage act,we find that section of the marriage act is not implicitly incorporated into the parentage act 
however,in the legislature amended the parentage act to address removal.pub.act,eff.july.see ilcs,west.section deals with initial judgments.after the amendments,it provides in relevant part as follows additions emphasized 
the judgment shall contain or explicitly reserve provisions concerning any duty and amount of child support and may contain provisions concerning the custody and guardianship of the child,visitation privileges with the child,the furnishing of bond or other security for the payment of the judgment,which the court shall determine in accordance with the relevant factors set forth in the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act and any other applicable law of illinois,to guide the court in a finding in the best interests of the child.in determining custody,joint custody,removal,or visitation,the court shall apply the relevant standards of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act,including section.emphases added.ilcs a west.
section deals with modification of judgments,and underwent similar modifications 
the court has continuing jurisdiction to modify an order for support,custody,visitation,or removal included in a judgment entered under this act.any custody,visitation,or removal judgment modification shall be in accordance with the relevant factors specified in the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act,including section.emphases added.ilcs west.
finally,section of the parentage act,added in,provides in pertinent part 
a in any action brought under this act for the initial determination of custody or visitation of a child or for modification of a prior custody or visitation order,the court,upon application of any party,may enjoin a party having physical possession or custody of a child from temporarily or permanently removing the child from illinois pending the adjudication of the issues of custody and visitation.when deciding whether to enjoin removal of a child,the court shall consider the following factors including,but not limited to 
the extent of previous involvement with the child by the party seeking to enjoin removal 
the likelihood that parentage will be established and 
the impact on the financial,physical,and emotional health of the party being enjoined from removing the child.
b injunctive relief under this act shall be governed by the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure.ilcs west.
as previously noted,waldrop contends that section is the operative section,and contends that unless a noncustodial parent files for an injunction pursuant to section,the parentage act does not restrict a custodial parent ability to remove a child from the state.we disagree.
sections and of the parentage act clearly refer to removal as an issue to be addressed in the initial judgment and in judgment modifications.see ilcs,west.moreover,both sections specify that the court determination on removal is to be made in accordance with section of the marriage act.section specifies that the court may grant leave to a custodial parent to remove a child from the parent must first request the burden is on the custodial parent to prove that removal would be in the child best interests.ilcs a west.see in re marriage of roppo,d,under marriage act,court approval is required where minor children subject to the jurisdiction of the court are to be removed permanently from the state.
the language of section does not support waldrop position.section permits the court to enjoin the custodial parent from temporarily or permanently removing the child from illinois pending the adjudication of the issues of custody and visitation.emphasis added.ilcs a west.it is clear that the injunctions permitted by section are intended to be temporary in nature,keeping the child in illinois only until the court can conduct a hearing on the merits of a removal petition.
moreover,waldrop position would render the changes to sections and mere surplusage,which would violate one of our cardinal rules of statutory construction.see andrews,at,stroger,at.if,as waldrop argues,a custodial parent can remove a child from illinois unless the noncustodial parent files for an injunction pursuant to section,the changes the legislature made to sections and would be meaningless and utterly without effect.no custodial parent would ever seek an order allowing removal if he or she automatically had the power to remove the child simply by virtue of being the custodial parent,as waldrop argues.
additionally,fisher suggested construction of the amendments to the parentage act has the virtue of greater similarity to the marriage act.under the marriage act,as previously noted,a custodial parent must petition for leave of court before removing a child from illinois,and the burden is on the custodial parent to show removal is in the child best interests.ilcs west.however,the marriage act also provides that in all proceedings thereunder,any party may request a preliminary injunction to,inter alia,enjoin a party from removing a child from the jurisdiction of the court.ilcs a ii west.the legislative history indicates that the legislature intent was to grant a parent in a parentage act action rights similar,if not identical,to those of a parent in a marriage act action.see,house proceedings,may,at statements of representative black at least it gives the noncustodial parent a,i wo say the same right,but a similar standing to go to court and question the removal of the child or children,as the case may be,to another state if there no apparent reason for the move.
for all these reasons,we conclude that fisher reading of the parentage act is correct.that is,when a custodial parent intends to remove a child from illinois he or she must request leave of court,and the burden is on the custodial parent to show that removal would be in the child best interests.it is not incumbent on a noncustodial parent to request an injunction pursuant to section in order to force the custodial parent to request leave of court before removing children from the state regardless of whether an injunction has been sought,and a custodial parent who removes children from the state without having first at least requested leave could potentially be subjected to contempt proceedings.if the noncustodial parent does seek an injunction,the burden is on the noncustodial parent to establish that he has no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief see sadat american motors,paying specific but not exclusive attention to the factors listed in section of the parentage act ilcs a west.
waldrop objects that this reading of the parentage act leads to the preposterous result of requiring two separate hearings with two different burdens of proof on essentially the same issue.waldrop notes that injunctions under section are governed by the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure ilcs b west,and that traditionally the burden is on the party seeking an injunction.see sadat,at.thus at the hearing on the injunction,waldrop contends,the burden is on the noncustodial parent to prove that removal is not in the child best interests.it does not make sense,waldrop argues,that the legislature would require that the parties and court then perform an abrupt and engage in another hearing at which the same issue is litigated,this time with the burden on the custodial parent.
first,as we noted above,preliminary injunctions against removal and hearings on removal can both occur in marriage act proceedings.see ilcs a ii,west.accordingly,we see no reason why the two could not coexist peacefully in the parentage act.more fundamentally,however,we disagree with waldrop that the two hearings deal with precisely the same issue.it is clear that at the hearing on the removal the sole issue is the best interests of the child.see ilcs a west.however,at the hearing on the injunction,the focus is more on the parents interests.although other factors may be considered,the three factors which section specifically requires the circuit court to take into account all involve the parents the extent to which the party opposing removal has previously been involved with the child the likelihood that parentage will be established and the impact that an injunction would have on the custodial parent.see ilcs a through a west.this makes sense,because at the injunction stage the noncustodial parent is not seeking to permanently prevent removal.rather,the noncustodial parent is asserting that his or her interest in and relationship with the child outweighs any burden that an injunction may impose on the custodial parent and,consequently,the status quo should be maintained until the custodial parent shows that the move is truly in the child best interests.
of course the circuit court should not turn a wholly blind eye to the child at the hearing on the injunction.the best interests of the child are always paramount in removal actions.in re marriage of collingbourne,citing in re marriage of eckert.however,at the hearing on the injunction section of the parentage act clearly places the focus on whether the noncustodial parent has an interest of sufficient magnitude to warrant delaying removal until the custodial parent can prove that removal is in the child best interests.rather than dragging out the proceedings by turning the hearing on the injunction into a hearing,we believe that the legislature determined that at this stage the child interests will be better served by focusing on the parents interests,so that the injunction issue may be resolved quickly.this is important to clarify the injunction hearing is not the equivalent of the hearing,and a circuit court order denying an injunction is not tantamount to an order granting leave to remove.it is not impossible that a circuit court could conclude that a noncustodial parent was not entitled to an injunction but also ultimately determine that the custodial parent proposed removal of the child would not be in the child best interests.
in this case,fisher filed a motion for injunction pursuant to section of the parentage act and waldrop never sought leave to remove.but in ruling on fisher injunction the court focused almost exclusively on the child best interests.the court essentially proceeded as if waldrop had filed for leave to remove,but with the critical difference of placing the burden on fisher of proving that removal would not be in callie best interests.moreover,the circuit court conclusion was court clearly stated that removal would not be in callie best interests,but then ruled that removal would be allowed because of the indirect benefit callie would receive if waldrop were permitted to move.although benefit to the custodial parent and the child household are entirely proper matters to consider,they are factors in the circuit court determination of what is in a child best interests,not separate factors that overrule what would otherwise be in a child best interest.see in re marriage of collingbourne.
not only is the circuit court ultimate determination regarding whether the move would be in callie best interests somewhat ambiguous,the circuit court findings do not provide a answer as to whether the court would have granted fisher an injunction if the court had focused on that issue.one of the listed factors is clearly satisfied,as paternity has already been admitted and established.see ilcs a west.the circuit court found fisher to have had significant previous involvement and a strong relationship with callie,indicating that another factor also would weigh in favor of the injunction.see ilcs a west.on the other hand,the court was clearly concerned about the effect on waldrop financial and emotional health were she to be enjoined from removing callie.whether an injunction would be proper is not sufficiently evident as to permit this court to enter an order based on the cold record before us.
we note as well that,even if it were clear that fisher was entitled to an injunction,the appellate court would have erred in ordering that the circuit court make the injunction permanent.although the appellate court did not explain its reasoning,it may be that the court focused on that portion of section which states that the court may enjoin a party having physical possession or custody of a child from temporarily or permanently removing the child from illinois.see ilcs west.however,it is clear that the phrase temporarily or permanently modifies the verb removing,rather than the verb may enjoin.in other words,the court has the power to enjoin removal,whether the removal is intended to be permanent or only temporary.but this is not the same thing as saying that the court has the power to temporarily or permanently enjoin the custodial parent from removing the child.it is clear that section does not contemplate a permanent injunction,given that it only permits the circuit court to enjoin removal pending the adjudication of the issues of custody and visitation.even if it were clear that fisher was entitled to an injunction,neither he nor any parent may be granted an injunction of a permanent nature.
we believe that the only appropriate course of action is to remand for the circuit court to rule on fisher injunction,focusing as we have stated on whether the factors listed in section,as well as any other similar matters the circuit finds relevant,warrant enjoining waldrop from removing callie until a best interests hearing on callie removal has been held.regardless of the outcome of this hearing,waldrop must file a petition for leave to remove callie from illinois if she still intends to do so 
conclusion 
the appellate court was correct to reverse the circuit court judgment granting waldrop leave to remove callie from illinois,and was also correct that the parentage act requires the custodial parent to seek leave of court for removal and to prove that removal would be in the child best interests.however,we do not agree with the appellate court that the circuit court denial of injunction was against the manifest weight of the evidence,and thus ought to be reversed outright.rather,because it appears that the circuit court conflated the issues of injunction and removal,the proper course is to remand for the circuit court to rule on the injunction request.moreover,even if the circuit court denial of injunction had been against the manifest weight of the evidence,the appellate court would have erred in ordering the circuit court to issue a permanent injunction on remand,a remedy which the statute does not contemplate.
accordingly,the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed in part and reversed in part,the judgment of the circuit court is reversed,and the cause is remanded to the circuit court to rule on fisher motion for injunction in accordance with the guidelines set out above.
appellate court judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part circuit court judgment reversed cause remanded.
i do not agree with the majority construction of the applicable statutes or with its conclusion that this case must be remanded for another hearing on fisher motion for an injunction.in my view,section has no application to this case,and therefore the cause should not be remanded for a hearing to determine whether fisher has the right to an injunction under that section.
this case has worked its way through the circuit court,the appellate court,and the supreme court,without anyone questioning fisher right to file for an injunction under section.this is curious,as the first sentence of that section provides that 
in any action brought under this act for the initial determination of custody or visitation of a child or for modification of a prior custody or visitation order,the court,upon application of any party,may enjoin a party having physical possession or custody of a child from temporarily or permanently removing the child from illinois pending the adjudication of the issues of custody and visitation.emphases added.ilcs a west.
thus,before a party may move for an injunction under section,there must be an action brought under the parentage act,and that action must be one for the initial determination of custody or visitation,or for modification of a prior custody or visitation order.here,there was no pending action for modification of custody or visitation when fisher moved for an injunction.rather,fisher initiated this proceeding by moving for an injunction.there was briefly a removal action filed by waldrop,and this removal petition included a request that fisher visitation schedule be adjusted accordingly,but waldrop voluntarily dismissed this action after one week.thus,at the time fisher moved for the injunction there was not,nor is there now,a pending action for custody or visitation.why would we remand this cause for a hearing to determine whether fisher is entitled to an injunction preventing callie removal from illinois pending the determination of custody or visitation issues,when there are no pending custody or visitation issues 
although the error is not ultimately relevant on the facts of this case,the majority gets itself on the wrong track by improperly reading the word removal into section.the majority quotes from section and even emphasizes the language pending the adjudication of the issues of custody and visitation.see at.at,at.in the very next sentence,however,the majority asserts that i t is clear that the injunctions permitted by section are intended to be temporary in nature,keeping the child in illinois only until the court can conduct a hearing on the merits of a removal petition.at.at,at.the majority never explains how it made the leap from issues of custody and visitation to removal petition.perhaps the majority is assuming that a petition for removal is necessarily a petition to modify visitation.this is not necessarily the case,however,and whether a removal results in a modification of visitation depends on the circumstances of the particular case.moreover,as the majority is well aware,the parentage act treats removal as a separate issue from custody and visitation.see,ilcs a west in determining custody,joint custody,removal,or visitation,the court shall apply the relevant standards of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act,including section ilcs west the court has continuing jurisdiction to modify an order for support,custody,visitation,or removal included in a judgment entered under this act.thus,contrary to the majority interpretation,section is not automatically triggered when the action the court is considering is a removal petition filed by the custodial parent.here,however,the removal petition included a request that the court modify visitation accordingly.thus,if the majority is going to conclude that section is relevant to this case,it should do so solely on the basis that waldrop moved to modify the visitation schedule,not because she filed a removal petition.it should then conclude both that waldrop withdrawal of that request renders section inapplicable and that a remand for a hearing on fisher request for an injunction is unnecessary.
moreover,even if the majority were correct that the word removal should be judicially legislated into section,a remand would still be unnecessary.according to the majority,the injunctions permitted by section are intended to be temporary in nature,keeping the child in illinois only until the court can conduct a hearing on the merits of a removal petition.at.at,at.yet the majority readily concedes that
