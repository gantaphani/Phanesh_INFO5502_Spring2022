this case involves three appeals and an array of appellate motions filed by eddie andrews arising from two federal lawsuits he brought seeking to compel federal judges to enjoin state court proceedings and obtain damages from them.a prior suit filed by andrews regarding the same subject matter resulted in an additional two appeals before this court.as with that first lawsuit,we now conclude that andrews second and third lawsuits are without merit and were properly dismissed by the district court.andrews complaints currently before us suffer from several fatal defects among other things,they seek to assert claims against defendants entitled to absolute judicial immunity,fail to meet the heightened pleading requirements of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and seek to enforce criminal statutes through a civil action.because of the vexatious nature of andrews filings,the district court imposed restrictions on andrews ability to pursue additional pro se filings in the western district of oklahoma.we modify these restrictions,limiting them in scope to filings related to the subject matter of andrews three related federal lawsuits,but we also extend them to preclude andrews from filing additional appeals in these or future related cases.
although it is difficult to discern from the record,these appeals appear to have their origin in a decision by the oklahoma department of human services dhs to investigate complaints regarding various children in andrews care,at least one of whom appears to have been his daughter.dhs ultimately decided that the children should be placed in protective custody and then foster care,and that andrews should be denied custody and visitation rights to his daughter and potentially the other children as well.it appears that andrews sought to regain custody through some sort of state court proceeding but grew frustrated and eventually sought recourse in federal court 
andrews first federal case in the western district of oklahoma,named various family members and three dhs agents as defendants alleged a criminal conspiracy and violation of his procedural due process rights and sought to enjoin undefined state court proceedings which,as best the district court could discern,appear to have involved a to the lawsuit.federal district court judge joe heaton dismissed andrews claims,holding that most of the allegations fell outside the relevant statute of limitations and that a federal court had neither the authority to enjoin the proceedings of an independent sovereign judicial system under the circumstances nor the authority to enjoin parties andrews had not named as defendants.andrews case resulted in two appeals to this court filed on the same date,which were resolved together and affirmed the district court dismissal of his case.
andrews then filed his second federal lawsuit in the western district of oklahoma,naming some defendants,including all of the federal district and appellate judges who had issued orders adverse to him,members of their staffs,and john and jane does through.this lawsuit alleged,among other things,that the named defendants had entered into a criminal conspiracy to deprive andrews of his rights and defraud the united states in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.
the claims against the federal judges and court employee defendants were dismissed sua by judge david russell on may,because,the court held,these defendants were entitled to absolute judicial immunity for the alleged conduct in the complaint.regarding the claims against the other defendants,judge russell held that the claims for violations of criminal statutes were not enforceable in a private civil action,the generously read civil rico claims failed to comply with the heightened pleading requirements of rule b,and there were no allegations regarding any acts by the john and jane doe defendants.judge russell instructed andrews that if he wished to proceed with his lawsuit he should file an amended complaint within days.andrews did not do so.
instead,on may,andrews filed a motion to vacate judge russell order,which was denied on june.undeterred,four days later andrews appealed judge russell ruling and filed a third federal lawsuit in the western district of oklahoma.this third suit listed more than defendants,including all of the judges of the tenth circuit court of appeals,all of the judges and magistrates in the western district of oklahoma,a great many members of judicial staff,together with several private attorneys 
similar to his first two complaints,andrews third complaint alleged a vague yet vast criminal conspiracy.given that every local judge was named as a defendant,the case was assigned to judge william downes,a federal judge from the district of wyoming.judge downes dismissed all of andrews remaining claims because,the court held,andrews was again impermissibly attempting to enforce criminal statutes through a private civil action in addition,judge downes established procedures for andrews to obtain permission from the court before initiating any additional pro se lawsuits in the western district of oklahoma.finally,judge downes cautioned andrews about bringing another round of frivolous appeals to this court andrews,however,promptly appealed.
all told,andrews has brought a total of five appeals in three federal lawsuits,three of which relate to his second and third lawsuits at issue here.although it is often difficult to discern from his pleadings,andrews appears,at the very least,to contest before us judge russell dismissal of his second complaint judge downes order dismissing the third complaint and our orders of august,and august,abating andrews appeals of judge russell and judge downes dismissal orders while his motion to reconsider judge downes dismissal order was pending in the district court.in addition to his appeals on the merits of these rulings,andrews has also lodged two motions seeking to institute a tribunal of special masters who are not now,nor have they ever been federal circuit judges or members of any bar to hear his cases.beyond even this,andrews has submitted to us two sets of objections to our orders abating his appeals while the district court resolved his motion to reconsider three motions for default judgment a motion to strike a defense motion and two motions to strike the various appellees opening briefs because defense counsel of record,who include an assistant united states attorney,three oklahoma assistant attorney generals,and an assistant general counsel of dhs the latter four attorneys are also named defendants in this matter,are allegedly improper interlopers in this matter without authority to represent the defendants.
we read pro se complaints more liberally than those composed by lawyers and dismiss them only when it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.haines kerner,d internal quotation omitted.as extensively elaborated by the district court judges who have addressed andrews lawsuits,his federal claims are without merit and were properly dismissed in accord with this steep standard.
first,dismissal of the claims against the judicial defendants was proper because it is well established that a bsolute immunity bars suits for money damages for acts made in the exercise of prosecutorial or judicial discretion.guttman khalsa,cir citing mireles waco,d.given that andrews alleges the judicial defendants engaged in unconstitutional conduct only while presiding over his civil lawsuits,these defendants were performing judicial acts and were therefore clothed with absolute judicial immunity.hunt bennett,cir see also lundahl zimmer,cir extending judicial immunity to any judicial officer who acts to either resolve disputes between parties or authoritatively adjudicate private rights.internal quote and alterations omitted.
second,even reading andrews second federal complaint as generously as possible,dismissal of andrews second complaint was proper because his vague and conclusory allegations of fraud failed to come anywhere near satisfying the specificity requirement
