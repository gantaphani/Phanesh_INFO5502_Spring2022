petitioner ushian kayon james james petitions for review of an october,decision of the bia affirming a july,order of removal by immigration judge ij alan vomacka.that order was based on a finding that james state misdemeanor conviction for endangering the welfare of a child was an aggravated felony within the meaning of a a sexual abuse of a minor.
background 
james,a native and citizen of jamaica,was admitted to the united states in as a lawful permanent resident.sometime in,when he was,he entered into a relationship with the daughter of a family acquaintance.the details of the relationship are not entirely clear,but eventually james was charged with rape in the third degree,pursuant to new york penal law section.the felony reduced to a misdemeanor information alleged that in february of,james,then years old,engaged in sexual intercourse with a female.james pleaded guilty in the first district court of new york,county of suffolk,to endangering the welfare of a child,pursuant to new york penal law section a conviction was entered on october,and james was sentenced to three years probation.
on september,the department of homeland security dhs issued james a notice to appear nta.the nta charged him with removability under a e i for being convicted of a crime of domestic violence,a crime of stalking,or a crime of child abuse,child neglect,or child abandonment.the ij held a removal hearing on november,at which james admitted the factual allegations in the nta but denied the charge of removability.in a motion to terminate the proceedings,james argued that dhs had not shown that he had been convicted of child abuse as defined in the immigration and nationality act ina.dhs then lodged an additional charge of removability,pursuant to a different provision of the ina under a a iii,the dhs claimed,james was removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a a,namely sexual abuse of a minor.james objected to this charge as well.
on july,the ij issued an order denying james motion to terminate and sustaining both charges of removability.the ij decision was based on the facts alleged in the felony complaint.because that complaint had been converted into a misdemeanor information,pursuant to new york criminal procedure section the ij concluded that the physical conduct described between james and the complaining witness sexual intercourse is in fact the conduct james pleaded guilty to when he entered a plea of guilty to endangering the welfare of a child.the ij then found that james conviction does constitute a crime of child abuse or at the very least may be considered some type of child neglect,under a e i,and that it also constituted the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor under a a.
james appealed the aggravated felony finding to the bia,arguing that the ij had misapplied the law and that his marriage to a citizen made him eligible for adjustment of status,a form of relief not made available to him at his immigration court hearing.in an order dated october,the bia affirmed the ij decision.first,the bia decided that the statute of conviction,new york penal law section,was,under the law of this circuit,divisible.the bia observed that,while that statute does not explicitly refer to any type of sexual content,it encompasses some offenses which would qualify as sexual abuse.in such circumstances,the bia noted,the second circuit allows the agency to consult the judgment and charging papers in an effort to narrow down the statutory options and identify the precise offense of which the respondent was convicted.then,citing the felony complaint and the plea transcript,the bia determined that james was,in fact,convicted of a crime within the meaning of a a.as for james adjustment of status claim,the bia observed that james had not sought this form of relief below,that he had not submitted appropriate documentation,and that he had failed to comply with the procedures for filing a motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status,see c.accordingly,the bia found a remand unwarranted.
james filed with our court a timely petition for review,in which he argues that his case should be remanded because a conviction for endangering the welfare of a child under new york law does not constitute an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina,because the bia exceeded its jurisdiction when it considered the facts underlying his conviction,and because he is eligible for relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status.

as of the codification of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,div,stat,we lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is deportable because he or she was convicted of an aggravated felony,save for constitutional claims and questions of law.a c.this jurisdictional bar arises if the petitioner is an alien and he is deportable under one of the offenses enumerated in a.mugalli ashcroft,cir.we retain jurisdiction,however,to determine whether this jurisdictional bar is,whether a petitioner satisfies the jurisdictional facts.id.at.the determination of our jurisdiction is exclusively for the court to decide.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the bia adopted the ij reasoning and offered additional commentary.consequently,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.wala mukasey,cir.we must defer to the bia determination,in accordance with the supreme court decision in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,when our jurisdiction depends on the definition of a phrase used in the ina,a statute that the bia administers,and when the intent of congress is unclear and the agency interpretation is reasonable.mugalli,at internal quotation marks omitted.but when,in the course of interpreting the ina,the bia has interpreted state or federal criminal laws,we review its decision de novo.id.in this case,then,we defer to the bia interpretation of a a in determining the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,but w e give no deference to the bia decision that the petitioner conviction under new york law meets the bia interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor.id.at.

categorical and modified categorical approaches 
we have adopted a categorical approach to decide whether a crime of conviction fits within the definition of aggravated felony in a a.santos gonzales,cir per curiam.under this approach the singular circumstances of an individual petitioner crimes should not be considered,and only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.dalton ashcroft,cir alteration quoting calabresi,dissenting in part,in michel ins,cir.we have,however,modified this approach in one important respect when a criminal statute encompasses diverse classes of criminal of which would categorically be grounds for removal and others of which would have held that the statute can be considered divisible the agency may then refer to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction wa
