judy schmir,a woman who had been unemployed for years,appeals from an order terminating her spousal support from her,maurice schmir judy contends the order is not supported by substantial evidence and the trial court erred in imputing earned income to her without first giving her fair advance notice and opportunity to secure employment.we find there was substantial evidence to justify terminating judy spousal support but the trial court abused its discretion in doing it so abruptly as to deny judy reasonable notice and an opportunity to find a job.
facts and proceedings below 
judy and maurice married in and separated in.in their marriage was dissolved by a judgment based on a marital settlement agreement.the judgment provided that after the sale of the family residence maurice would pay judy spousal support in the sum of per month until the death of either party,judy remarriage,or further order of the court.the judgment recited judy had no present employment or professional income and had unreimbursed medical expenses of approximately per month.neither the settlement agreement nor the judgment contained a richmond order terminating spousal support jurisdiction as of a specific date nor a gavron warning advising judy she needed to become or face onerous legal and financial consequences 
maurice made the payments to judy without objection until january,when he sought an order modifying or terminating judy support.
maurice alleged three changes in judy circumstances which justified reducing judy spousal support judy had returned to work judy had reached the age when she could draw on her ira without penalty and there had been a reduction in judy unreimbursed medical expenses.
in june the court ordered judy support reduced to per month on an interim basis pending a further hearing on the matter.
discovery was conducted,judy underwent two vocational examinations and a hearing with live testimony was held,following which the trial court granted maurice request to modify the spousal support order.the court found there had been three changes in circumstances since the original support order.although judy had not returned to work she was capable of obtaining employment as a licensed clinical social worker at a gross salary of per month she was eligible to draw without penalty on her ira which had a value in excess of half a million dollars and her medical expenses had decreased from per month to per month.based on these changes in circumstances the trial court ordered judy support reduced to zero the following month,ordered maurice to contribute to judy attorney fees in the proceeding,and retained jurisdiction over spousal support.
judy filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
i.the trial court finding of changes in judy circumstances is supported by substantial evidence.standard of review.
the modification of a spousal support order is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.in exercising its discretion the trial court must follow established legal principles and base its findings on substantial evidence if the trial court conforms to these requirements its order will be upheld whether or not the appellate court agrees with it or would make the same order if it were a trial court.
for a change in circumstances to exist there must have been a material change since the entry of the previous order.in other words if the circumstances in question existed at the time of the previous order those circumstances presumably were considered when the previous order was made and bringing them to the court attention years later does not constitute a change in the circumstances nor has there been a change in circumstances merely because a different trial judge disagrees with the previous order 
in the present case the trial court found three changes in circumstances judy is presently employable as a licensed clinical social worker judy medical expenses have decreased to a month and judy is now eligible to withdraw funds from her retirement account without penalty.judy challenges each of these findings as not supported by substantial evidence.
b.the record supports a change in circumstances based on judy present ability to earn income as a licensed clinical social worker.
the trial court found judy is presently able to earn a minimum of per month as a licensed clinical social worker lcsw and that this constitutes a change in circumstances since the original spousal support order in.the evidence is undisputed judy was not earning income as an lcsw or in any other field of employment at the time of the original order and has not engaged in gainful employment at any time since that order.
judy maintains she can not earn income as an lcsw but even if she could this would not constitute a change in circumstances because she was an lcsw at the time of the original judgment awarding her spousal support 
the change in circumstances,however,is not based on judy credentials as an lcsw but on her postjudgment regaining of the ability to practice this profession.in her responsive declaration to the order to show cause judy explained that commencing in the,i had to deal with new and indeed life altering stressors all of which were related to the final unraveling of the marriage,including the five years of the divorce and community property distribution proceedings finally,overwhelmed and exhausted,i stopped practicing as an lcsw altogether in may.i have not practiced as a psychotherapist since then and i have not been gainfully employed since may.
there is substantial evidence in the record from which the trial court could find these life altering stressors no longer interfered with judy ability to practice her profession.to start with,the court reasonably could infer from the mere passage of judy was no longer overwhelmed and exhausted from her divorce experience.this inference is supported by the fact judy did not mention psychological or emotional problems in discussing her health with the vocational expert who interviewed her in june.moreover,in this interview judy stated she was the secretary and treasurer of her condominium association from to and in the course of this service she was engaged in a full time job negotiating with contractors,experts and attorneys relating to a lawsuit regarding construction problems as well as coordinating repairs at the condominium complex.judy also stated she had recently rejoined the association board of directors to help complete the final project.if judy was psychologically and emotionally able to engage in a job negotiating with contractors,experts and attorneys over repairs to a condominium complex,the trial court could reasonably conclude she was psychologically and emotionally capable of returning to her past employment as an lcsw.finally,the undisputed evidence showed judy has a master degree in social work from the university of southern california,has kept her license current for the past years,completes hours of continuing education every two years and has remained an active member of the academy of certified social workers.
judy argues,citing code of civil procedure section,the evidence described above can not be used to support the trial court finding of changed circumstances because the court statement of decision did not rely on a change in her psychological condition.we disagree.
under section of the code of civil procedure the losing party must state any objection to the trial court statement of decision on an issue in order to avoid an implied finding on appeal in favor of the prevailing party on the issue.if omissions or ambiguities in the trial court statement are timely brought to the court attention an appellate court will not imply findings of fact in favor of the prevailing party on that issue but judy did not object to the statement of decision on the ground the trial court omitted a decision on the issue of changed circumstances or on the ground the trial court decision was ambiguous.
neither code of civil procedure section nor the cases judy relies on support her argument that in determining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding we are limited to the evidence cited in the trial court statement of decision.this argument flies in the face of established rules of appellate review which require us to accept as true all evidence tending to establish the correctness of the findings of the trial court,resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the prevailing party,and indulge all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the judgment our review is not limited to only those facts the trial court mentions in its statement of decision but,like any appellate review,extends to the entire record this is apparent from the fact a statement of decision need do no more than state the grounds upon which the judgment rests,without necessarily specifying the particular evidence considered by the trial court in reaching its decision.
c.the record supports a change in circumstances based on a reduction in judy monthly medical needs.
the judgment of dissolution recited judy currently has medical expenses of approximately per month.
in her income and expense declaration executed june,judy stated she presently had unreimbursed medical expenses of per month.in her declaration in opposition to modification of the support order she stated my uninsured medical expenses will run more than per month just for regular check ups,medications,lab tests,and the like,all of which i quite simply can not afford.
on appeal judy argues the figure does not reflect a reduction in her current medical needs but only a reduction in the amount she can afford to expend on those needs.
we are not persuaded.the declaration showing in medical expenses was executed on june,the trial court made an interim reduction in her monthly support payment from to.logically,if judy could not meet her present medical needs out of her a month support payment it would be she who sought to modify the support order.in addition,there is little likelihood a person whose necessary medical expenses are in the neighborhood of per month would describe them as more than per month.that would be like a baseball player with a batting average describing it as more than.
d.the record supports a change in circumstances based on judy ability to make withdrawals from her retirement account without penalty.
the trial court found judy ability to draw from her individual retirement account without penalty constituted the final change in circumstances.
judy contends her ability to make withdrawals from her retirement account is not a change in circumstances because the parties must have contemplated when they entered into their support agreement in judy would reach the age when she could begin making withdrawals from the account without penalty therefore her reaching the requisite age is not a change in circumstance but merely an aspect of the same circumstance existing at the time of the original support order in.
adopting judy line of reasoning would mean that as a matter of law the supporting spouse attainment of retirement age could never constitute a change of circumstance for purposes of a motion to modify a support order.numerous appellate court decisions have rejected such a result even though the parties in those cases clearly contemplated the supporting spouse would one day reach the age when he or she could legitimately retire 
we also note judy ability to withdraw funds from her retirement account without penalty constitutes a change in circumstance when the circumstance being considered is judy assets available to provide for her own support in addition,when judy retirement account was created in as part of the parties property settlement neither party could have reliably predicted its future value.thus the growth of the account to more than double its original size can also be viewed as a change in circumstance.
for the reasons discussed above we hold the trial court finding there had been changes in judy circumstances since the original spousal support order based on substantial evidence in the record.
ii.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring judy to make up any shortfall in her monthly living expenses from her ira.
even if judy obtains employment at the rate of a month it is undisputed she will have to draw on her retirement account to make ends meet.
in in re marriage of olson the court observed t he legislature,in prescribing the factors to be considered by trial courts in fixing permanent spousal support has provided no specific guidance as to what consideration the court should give to contributions to or accruals in retirement plans.the legislature has,however,instructed trial courts that in setting spousal support they should consider among other things the assets,including the separate property,of each party,the age and health of the parties,the balance of hardships to each party,and a ny other factors the court determines are just and reasonable.the appellate courts have held in assessing a party ability to pay spousal support a trial court may consider investment income by parity of reasoning trial courts assessing the supported party needs should also consider that party investment income.finally,in considering the parties retirement plans in setting spousal support courts have recognized it is necessary to weigh the public policy favoring provision for one retirement against all other circumstances in the case not surprisingly the court in olson concluded the trial court possesses broad discretion to determine whether to consider as income available for spousal support purposes contributions made by a participant to his or her retirement plan.
as we understand judy argument she contends the order terminating her spousal support should be reversed because the record contains no evidence of what sums she could and should reasonably withdraw from her ira in lieu of the terminated support.for example there is no evidence of judy life expectancy,the tax consequences to her of withdrawing any particular sums of money from her account,how much money judy would be required to withdraw or the resulting financial impact on her retirement nest egg.judy maintains without this evidence it is impossible for us to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in terminating her spousal support.
with the exception of judy life expectancy there is evidence in the record on all of these factual issues.evidence of judy life expectancy is not necessary for reasons we shall explain.we find no abuse of discretion.
we discussed the tax consequences of judy withdrawals in part i of this opinion.the undisputed evidence shows judy has reached the age where she can make withdrawals from her ira without penalty.therefore her withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income just as her support payments were.
terminating judy a month spousal support would not require her to make a significant incursion into the principal of her retirement account in order to compensate for the lost income.by paying off her mortgage out of her retirement account which judy could do without a substantial effect on her interest earnings and by ceasing to make further contributions to the retirement account,judy would save approximately a month.the trial court found judy could reasonably earn a month as an lcsw leaving a gap of.a percent rate of return on her ira would allow judy to make withdrawals of per month without reducing the principal.
thus we see no basis for disturbing the trial court order for abuse of discretion based on judy use of her retirement assets.
iii.the imputation of per month in employment income is supported by substantial evidence.
the trial court determined judy had the present ability to earn a minimum of a month as an lcsw.this finding is supported by substantial evidence.
a vocational examiner who interviewed judy and reviewed her education and employment history stated she contacted five employers who were recruiting persons in judy field of experience.two of the five stated judy would qualify and the other three indicated she might qualify.
the salary range quoted by these hiring employers was between and per year.three of the employers gave a range between and per year.the trial court explained that imputing the sum of per month per year it was choosing a figure at the
