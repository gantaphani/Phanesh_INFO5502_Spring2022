factual and procedural history 
petitioner carlos is a native and citizen of mexico.he became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.twice in,he pleaded guilty to violating section of the california penal code.the records of conviction establish that 
on or about or the crime of disobeying court order,in violation of section of the penal code,a misdemeanor,was committed by carlos alanis alvarado,who at the time and place last aforesaid,did willfully,unlawfully and knowingly violate a court order obtained pursuant to section and of the family code of the state of california.
after those convictions,the government issued a notice to appear.the notice to appear asserted that,because of the two convictions petitioner was removable under three different provisions of the ina under a a ii,for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude under a e i,for having been convicted of a crime of domestic violence and under a e ii,for having been convicted of violating a domestic violence protection order.
after a hearing,the immigration judge ordered petitioner removed.petitioner appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia held that petitioner convictions qualified under a e ii,but expressly declined to reach the other two sections of the ina charged in the notice to appear.petitioner then filed a timely petition for review with this court.
standard of review 
we review de novo whether a particular conviction under state law is a removable offense.ins,cir.
discussion 
to determine whether a petitioner prior conviction fits within the statutory definition of a removable offense,we use the categorical approach and modified categorical approach that were first announced in taylor united states,d.ferreira ashcroft,cir,recognized as overruled on other grounds by kawashima mukasey,cir.under the categorical approach,if the full range of conduct covered by the state statute falls within the scope of the ina provision,then the petitioner conviction is categorically a removable offense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.if not,we then proceed to a modified categorical approach.id.under the modified categorical approach,we conduct a limited examination of the documents in the record of conviction to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the alien was convicted of the elements of the generically defined crime even though his or her statute of conviction was facially overinclusive.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.if the information in the record of conviction does not establish that the petitioner conviction meets the requirements of the ina provision,then the conviction is not a removable offense under that provision.id.
the bia held that petitioner state convictions meet the requirements of a e ii,which is titled v iolators of protection orders and reads in full 
any alien who at any time after admission is enjoined under a protection order issued by a court and whom the court determines has engaged in conduct that violates the portion of a protection order that involves protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury to the person or persons for whom the protection order was issued is deportable.for purposes of this clause,the term protection order means any injunction issued for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening acts of domestic violence,including temporary or final orders issued by civil or criminal courts other than support or child custody orders or provisions whether obtained by filing an independent action or as a pendente lite order in another proceeding.
petitioner was convicted of violating california penal code section,which reads in relevant part 
a any intentional and knowing violation of a protective order,as defined in section of the family code,or of an order issued pursuant to section or of the code of civil procedure,or section of the welfare and institutions code,is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars,or by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year,or by both that fine and imprisonment.
examining the full range of conduct proscribed by section,petitioner conviction does not suffice under the categorical approach.the range of orders that may be issued under the state statute is broad,and the statute plainly encompasses orders outside the scope of the ina provision.for instance,some orders issued under the civil procedure code or welfare code have nothing to do with domestic violence.see,c authorizing a court to issue a temporary restraining order against any person,without regard to the existence or nature of a relationship between the assailant and the victim.indeed,the government concedes that a conviction under california penal code section does not satisfy the categorical test.
we therefore proceed to a modified categorical approach.ferreira,at.the records of conviction establish that petitioner was convicted,more specifically,of violating an order obtained pursuant to section and of the california family code.we therefore must determine whether a conviction for violating an order obtained pursuant to sections and of the california family code necessarily meets the requirements of the ina provision although this inquiry rides under the banner of the modified categorical approach,the records of conviction here tell us only which combination of statutes authorized the protection order that petitioner violated.our modified categorical inquiry is therefore identical to a categorical inquiry whether the ina provision embraces the full range of conduct under those state statutes.it is a kind of modified categorical inquiry nonetheless,because it is a inquiry.
section of the california family code states in full 
the court may issue an ex parte order enjoining a party from molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,battering,harassing,telephoning,including,but not limited to,annoying telephone calls as described in section of the penal code,destroying personal property,contacting,either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise,coming within a specified distance of,or disturbing the peace of the other party,and,in the discretion of the court,on a showing of good cause,of other named family or household members.
cal.section of the california family code provides,in part,that a person subject to a protective order,as defined in section,shall not own,possess,purchase,or receive a firearm while that protective order is in effect.cal.a.
the parties agree that section does not,by itself,authorize a court to issue a protective order.instead,whenever a court issues a protective order,the provisions of section are triggered automatically.our conclusion is confirmed by the definition of protective order in the california family code,which includes only orders issued under sections,and.cal.in sum,although petitioner records of conviction establish that he violated an order issued pursuant to section and of the californ
