this is an appeal from a decision by the family court in a child support action.the,andrew sentner the father,sought modification on august,of a support order.that order required him to pay per month in child support for his daughter,dawn sentner dawn.a family court commissioner granted the father request for modification since his current employment provided less than half the income he had earned at the time the support order was entered against him.
in reviewing the commissioner decision de novo,a family court judge denied the petition for modification,even though the father earned substantially less income from the loss of his employment and had conducted a vigorous job search.the family court judge held that the father request for modification should be rejected since a sufficient period of time had not elapsed under the delaware child support formula melson formula thus,the family court judge reinstated the support order and made a finding of arrears.
in this appeal,the father argues that the family court abused its discretion by failing to acknowledge the adequacy of the father job search in applying the sufficient period of time requirement of the melson formula we conclude that the father contention is meritorious.accordingly,the judgment of the family court is reversed.
the parties daughter,dawn,was born on august.following her birth,the parties separated and were divorced.dawn lives with vicki sentner the mother by stipulation of the parties.on september,the family court entered a support order directing the father to pay per month in child support.
when the support order was entered,the father worked for keene compressed gas keene.he sold industrial gases and welding equipment.keene terminated his employment on may,for falsifying reports and a customer complaint that he smelled of alcohol.he had worked at keene for over eighteen years and earned approximately a year.consequently,the father sole income for the remainder of the year consisted of unemployment compensation.
in august,the father filed a petition to modify child support.he sought to modify the support order because he was earning significantly less income.since less than two and a half years had elapsed,the melson formula required that the father show that there was a substantial change in circumstances that was not due to his own fault following a hearing,a commissioner ruled that the father had failed to carry that burden.accordingly,the commissioner dismissed the father petition.
in january,the father began working for rosser.he sold gases,industrial gases and welding supplies.he earned approximately per year.
commissioner order 
on august,the father filed another petition to modify the support order.the mother opposed the petition.the case was scheduled before a commissioner.
on february,the commissioner held a hearing on the issues of modification and arrears the commissioner stated that in applying the melson formula that the father no longer had to prove that he lost his employment through no fault of his own since a period of more than two and a half years had passed since the order was the current amount of child support was set according to the commissioner,under the melson formula standards for modification,the father rather merely ha d to prove that he ha d made substantial efforts to find comparable employment.
at the hearing before the commissioner,the father testified that after he began employment with rosser,he had been looking for a job that paid more money,but that he had not been successful in finding one.he offered to submit copies of want ads from his job search.he also testified that he had submitted several resumes and had interviews.
dianne buckley buckley,a senior vocational rehabilitation consultant,testified that the father sought her assistance in obtaining a better job.she testified she had compiled a report of over one hundred positions for sales representatives at the time.buckley,however,stated that the father was not qualified for or would not have been suitable for such positions.she testified that it would take the father time to work up to the same earning potential that he had acquired due to his tenure at keene.buckley encouraged the father to stay at his current position in a similar sales field.she believed that it would be easier for him to get a job if he already had one.
after finding that the father had made an adequate job search,the commissioner entered an order modifying the father child support and arrears.the commissioner used the father current income in calculating the father support obligation pursuant to the melson formula.the commissioner modified the father child support payments to per month and assessed arrearages of as of january.the mother filed an appeal de novo.
review de novo by family court 
after conducting a de novo review of the record,a family court judge entered an order on may.the trial judge rejected the commissioner order modifying the father child support and arrears.on may,the father filed a motion to vacate this order and reopen the case.the father had not received a copy of the mother appeal prior to the issuance of the family court may,order.the family court granted the father motion and permitted him to respond to the mother initial appeal.on september,the family court entered a new order reinstating the may,order as the final order of the family court.
melson formula 
the family court adopted the melson formula to operate as a uniform procedure for calculating child support obligations that procedure,which has been upheld by this court,operates as a rebuttable presumption in all child support cases in delaware the appropriate child support obligation is determined,in part,upon the respective net income of the parties under the melson formula,the amount of child support to be paid is calculated after determining the monthly net income of each parent,the primary support needs of the children and then making a standard of living adjustment 
a proper application of the melson formula requires more than the mechanical use of an algebraic equation this court standard of review is to examine the record for an abuse of discretion we will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly wrong.the court will affirm the inferences and deductions of the trial judge if they are supported by the record and are the product of an orderly and logical deductive process 
modification constraints 
in the absence of a substantial change in an obligor circumstances,the melson formula includes a general prohibition against filing any petition for modification within two and a half years of the last order setting the current amount of child support 
no petition may be filed within years of the date of the last order regarding current support absent pleading with particularity a substantial change in changes in income brought on by no fault of the petitioner,changes in day care expenses,or changes in other child support obligations of the obligor 
the change in circumstances exception to the general prohibition is subject to an important qualification that any substantial changes in income be brought on by no fault of the petitioner.accordingly,if an obligor can not demonstrate that no fault qualification to the alleged change in circumstances,the last order setting the current amount of child support will remain in effect for two and a half years,notwithstanding a substantial reduction in the petitioning obligor income.
after the passage of two and a half years,the melson formula permits modification as follows 
the passage of years since the last order regarding current support shall constitute sufficient basis to file a petition for modification of the current support order.these petitions shall result in a modification of the support order based strictly on the calculation amount,with no need for a threshold to be met 
the fact that a petition for modification can be filed after the passage of two and a half years does not make the petitioner fault in causing a reduction of income irrelevant.it also does not obviate the consideration of other time constraints.when a petition for reduction is filed more
