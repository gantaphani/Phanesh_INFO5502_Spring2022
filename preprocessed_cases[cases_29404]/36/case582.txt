introduction 
jeffrey and anna are the parents of.they share equal physical custody.in,anna sought an award of child support evidence adduced at trial established that davis,anna friend and godfather,supports anna financially and pays her expenses of over per month.anna does not work and has virtually no other source of funds.jeffrey has an income of over per month.jeffrey argued davis financial support of anna should be considered her income for purposes of calculating child support,thereby eliminating jeffrey support obligation.the trial court rejected this argument and issued an order requiring jeffrey to pay anna per month in child support.on appeal,jeffrey argues the trial court erred when it failed to characterize davis gifts as income to anna in calculating the child support award.we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
was born in.in august,jeffrey admitted paternity and sought joint legal and physical custody of.in july,the court granted the parties joint legal custody.since,the parties have shared equal physical custody of.in october,the trial court issued a bifurcated judgment of parentage,reserving jurisdiction over all other issues,including child support.
trial on custody and support issues was held over days between august and march.as relevant to this appeal,the following facts were established at trial.jeffrey is an investment manager.his october income and expense declaration indicated his monthly income was over and he had over in monthly expenses.based on the testimony of jeffrey,his accountant,and anna forensic accountant,the trial court eventually found jeffrey has a gross monthly income of,which includes wages,salary,and income 
anna income and expense declaration indicated she had not worked since and had no income from any source.she identified monthly expenses of over.at trial,anna provided only minimal testimony about davis financial support and her expenses.her testimony mainly concerned the information included in her income and expense declaration and the source of that information.
davis testified he met anna in.he considers her his closest best friend and has no romantic involvement with her.is his goddaughter.anna lives in a house in beverly hills davis pays the approximately per month rent.davis has a room at the house.he currently stays there with anna and around two weeks of each month davis pays a person to work at and take care of the house.he also pays for the food,all the bills to get paid at the house,and whatever household products the house needs.he pays a nanny to work for anna on an basis.anna has the use of two vehicles,both of which davis owns or leases.
anna uses a credit card issued in davis name.davis prefers that she keep spending on the card under per month,but there are occasional exceptions.davis also gives anna an average of per month,which he deposits into an account for her.he further testified he gives anna money which she uses to pay for clothes and whatever needs.davis has no agreement or expectation that anna will pay him back for her living expenses.because a business manager pays davis bills,he was not sure if he pays the rent and house manager directly,or if anna pays those bills with money he gives her.he thought anna paid the household expenses,but believed he might pay the nanny directly.
davis has loaned anna over million for attorney fees in the family law proceedings.he could not identify a source from which he believed anna could repay these loans.davis testified he provides financial support to anna because he loves her and 
in his closing argument,anna counsel contended it would be absurd to conclude that because a samaritan provides for a child,the parent with a statutory duty to provide support is somehow off the hook he argued davis support was not income to anna and deviation from the child support guidelines was not appropriate.anna counsel asserted that if davis and anna were married,the court could not consider new mate income,and t he fact that they not married should somehow elevate that into a consideration that the court can now make.
jeffrey counsel argued the court should characterize davis support of anna as her income and reduce jeffrey support obligation to zero.counsel contended that given the opulent lifestyle anna provides to with davis gifts,requiring jeffrey to pay child support would only negatively affect by reducing the amount of money he could spend on her in his own home.he argued a child support award would therefore penalize jeffrey while providing no benefit to.as to the new mate argument,jeffrey counsel simply asserted davis was not a new mate.
the trial court found there was no evidence from which it could impute an income to anna it determined jeffrey earns approximately per year.the court found davis pays all of anna expenses,totaling between and per month,although the court noted even anna does not fully understand the amount davis pays.the court declined to impute income under in re marriage of alter th alter to anna,explaining while the court agrees that the money davis pays is little more than a gift,unlike alter,he has not paid these expenses for years and as noted above,he is a legal stranger to anna unlike alter mother.
the court noted enjoys a comfortable lifestyle in both of her parents homes and arguably a more affluent lifestyle with anna.still,the court concluded nevertheless there is a legal preference that parents pay support for their children.even under the unusual circumstances of this case,this court can not deviate from guideline,thus effectively relieving jeffrey from his financial responsibility.the court ordered jeffrey to pay child support of per month.
discussion 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to characterize davis gifts to anna as her income when calculating child support 
on appeal,jeffrey argues the trial court erred when it failed to deem davis financial support of anna to be her income when calculating child support.we find no abuse of discretion.
applicable legal principles 
the principles governing appellate review of child support calculations and awards are.awards of child support and spousal support are reviewed for abuse of discretion.citation.w e do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court,and we will disturb the trial court decision only if no judge could have reasonably made the challenged decision.citation.citation.in reviewing a child support order,we are mindful that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.citation.citation.t he trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the law regarding child support.citations.citation.citation.in re marriage of williamson th,williamson.
statutory guidelines regulate the determination of child support in california.see fam.code.the guidelines set forth several important principles relating to child support determinations,including that the interests of the child are the state top priority,a parent principal obligation is to support his or her children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,children should share in both parents standard of living,and in cases in which both parents have high levels of responsibility for the children,child support orders should reflect the increased costs of raising the children in two homes and should minimize significant disparities in the children living standards in the two homes,subds.a,b,d g.the guideline amount of child support,which is calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the relative incomes of the parents,is presumptively correct.see,subd.a citation.the court may depart from the guideline only in special circumstances set forth in the child support statutes.citation.in re marriage of schlafly th,schlafly.
trial courts must calculate child support in accordance with the mathematical formula contained in family code section.citation.this mandatory formula takes into account both parents net monthly disposable income,subds.a,b,which is determined based upon the parents annual gross income.section,subdivision a,defines annual gross income as income from whatever source derived,and lists more than a dozen possible income sources to be considered as part of annual gross income.citation.williamson,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
financial contributions from others and income in child support calculations 
in defining annual gross income for a child support calculation,section,subdivision a sets forth a nonexclusive list of possible sources of income that does not mention gifts.california courts have accordingly considered gifts and other financial benefits not identified in the statute in the factual contexts in which they arise to determine whether they may be included or excluded as income in a child support guideline calculation.
for example,in in re marriage of scheppers th scheppers,the obligor father sought a reduction in his child support obligation based on the mother receipt of a lump sum payment as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.the trial court treated the interest that could be earned from the lump sum amount as income to the mother,but not the corpus of the life insurance death benefit itself.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court ruling.the court noted that while the statutory definition of income is broad under section,it is not unlimited.it does not extend to every type of payment or economic benefit received by a parent.id.at.the court explained,in part first,it is established that gifts,whether inter vivos citation or testamentary citation,are not within the scope of the statutory definition of income.it is impossible to draw a rational distinction between a gift made by designating the donee as the beneficiary of a will and a gift made by designating the donee as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.ibid.
the court further reasoned life insurance death benefits are not income under the federal internal revenue code,which is persuasive in the interpretation of section.life insurance proceeds also do not fall within the definition of income.the scheppers court explained the traditional understanding of income is the gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,or property citation or from any other investment of capital citation.almost every type of income specified by section,subdivision a,is either a return from labor,business,or property such as wages,dividends,and rents or else a substitute for that return such as disability insurance benefits.scheppers,supra,th at.
several courts have also considered whether financial benefits may be considered income to a parent in a child support calculation.in in re marriage of loh th loh,the court rejected an approach that would characterize as income anything that reduces a parent living expenses,such as or housing.id.at.in loh,the obligee mother sought an increase in child support based on evidence of the father lifestyle with his girlfriend.id.at.the court concluded the trial court erred in finding the father income was greater than the evidence established,and in departing from a calculation based on income reported in the father tax returns.id.at.the loh court further considered how the trial court should proceed when significant nontaxable benefits are involved,such as when the parent has free housing 
t he proper course was to first calculate the guideline amount in light of the parents incomes as revealed by such evidence as tax returns,income and expense declarations and pay stubs,and then,under section,to adjust the amount upward in light of the free housing benefit.such an approach respects the rebuttable correctness of the mechanically calculated guideline amount,and allows child support awards to properly reflect the parents standard of living without doing violence to the word income in a way that would make the sheriff of nottingham proud.loh,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
the court found there was insufficient evidence to upwardly modify the child support award using this approach in the case before it.loh,supra,th at.the mother had not attempted to establish the father tax returns did not fairly reflect his income.id.at.further,section prohibited the trial court consideration of the father lifestyle,which was subsidized by his new girlfriend loh,at.
the appellate court followed a loh approach in schlafly,supra,th.the obligor father lived in a home that had a rental value of per month.id.at.the reviewing court reversed an order in which the trial court included of income to the father in the child support calculation,based on the rental value of the house.the court noted the housing was neither an employee benefit nor resulted from an effort to funnel income into a form that would not be recognized in the dissomaster calculation.id.at.however,the reviewing court concluded the trial court properly considered the father lack of any housing expense when deviating upward from the guideline in temporary child support orders and it could do so again on remand.id.at.
likewise,in th,the reviewing court concluded the trial court erred when it characterized as income an indian tribe direct payment of the obligor father attorney fees in the proceedings.although the payment of the fees could be easily valued,the court explained the tribe paid the attorneys directly,and if the father incurred no fees he received no benefit.thus,the payments are not part of the father regular income or included in his cashflow.this case is akin to stewart,in which the inclusion of a benefit resulted in a presumptively correct guideline amount based in part on money the father simply does not have available for support.id.at.while bonuses the father received from the tribe were properly deemed income to him for purposes of calculating child support,the tribe direct payment of his attorney fees was not.
these cases reflect a concern that a child support award should usually not be based on monies the parent does not actually have available for support.under a loh approach,while nontaxable financial or monetary benefits may justify a deviation from the child support guidelines under section,they are not characterized as income to the parent.in re marriage of riddle th,rejecting argument that husband income consisted only of his cash flow and did not include loan forgiveness that was income under tax laws.
alter and subsequent cases 
in alter,supra,th,the court considered whether cash a grandparent provided to an obligor parent could properly be characterized as income to that parent in a child support calculation.in alter,the obligor father sought a reduction in his child support obligations.his mother paid many of his expenses,allowed him to live in a house she owned,and gave him each month,of which was to pay the rent she charged him.the grandmother monthly payments to the father occurred during the marriage and continued after the dissolution indeed,the monthly payments had occurred for more than a decade.the trial court characterized the monthly as the father income,as well as in other cash and benefits.id.at.
on appeal,the father argued the trial court erred as to the payments,contending gifts can not be considered income in the guideline support calculation.the alter court rejected any such absolute rule.alter,supra,th at.the court noted section,subdivision a list of income sources is nonexclusive and nothing in the statute precludes a court from considering gifts as income for child support purposes.id.at.the court reviewed common definitions of income and determined they also do not unequivocally preclude considering recurring gifts of money as income.id.at.alter distinguished california cases that considered only gifts scheppers county of kern,and cases in which the court refused to characterize noncash benefits unrelated to employment as income for child support purposes loh schlafly.alter,supra,at.the court reasoned that concerns related to the complicated nature of determining the value of noncash benefits and the potential for inconsistent results are not present when the gifts are cash and are recurrent.id.at.
the alter court explained that although the definition of income under federal tax law is helpful in many cases,it is not controlling.this is in part because the child support and federal income tax statutes have differing purposes and a parent may have income that is nonetheless available to support the child.alter,supra,th at.the court further rejected the argument that a gift should not be deemed income because of the lack of a guarantee that the obligor parent will continue receiving such gifts in the future.id.at.adopting the reasoning of an illinois appellate court decision,the court explained few sources of income are certain to continue unchanged year after year,thus the relevant focus is the parent economic situation at the time the child support calculations are made by the court.citation.ibid.
however,the alter court did not hold gifts to a parent must always be considered income.instead,the court concluded n othing in the law prohibits considering gifts to be income for purposes of child support so long as the gifts bear a reasonable relationship to the traditional meaning of income as a recurrent monetary benefit.but while regular gifts of cash may fairly represent income,that might not always be so.therefore,the question of whether gifts should be considered income for purposes of the child support calculation is one that must be left to the discretion of the trial court.alter,supra,th at.
in kevin lauren th kevin and in re marriage of smith th smith,the reviewing courts found no abuse of discretion in the trial court consideration of regular,recurrent gifts from a parent to an adult child when assessing the adult child ability to pay attorney fees in a family law proceeding.although both kevin and smith relied in part on alter,neither concerned income in the context of the child support calculation,which involves policy objectives different from those involved in a fee award.see kevin,supra,th at parents had equal ability to pay fees in light of regular,recurrent infusions from parent to adult child made over a long period of time smith,supra,th at parent payment of wife attorney fees allowed her to engage in abusive litigation and intended to prevent a party from litigating the other side out of the case.
in contrast,in williamson,the reviewing court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court ruling declining to base a child support calculation on gifts the obligor father had historically received from his wealthy parents.during the marriage,the grandparents regularly gave the husband,wife,and children annual gifts of each.on one occasion the grandparents gave the father a gift of.on other occasions the grandparents advanced money to the father and mother for various expenses,such as home purchases and renovations.williamson,supra,th at.on appeal,the obligee mother contended the trial court should have characterized the grandparents historical cash advances as income to the father for the purposes of calculating child and spousal support.id.at.
the williamson court disagreed.the court discussed alter,but noted two features that distinguished the case before it.the first was that the cash advances from the grandparents were made upon request,depending upon the family needs in some years the parents needed large sums of cash,primarily to purchase and renovate homes.in other years,they requested little or no assistance.in that sense,the advances were irregular and outside the traditional concept of income as a recurrent,monetary benefit.citation.williamson,supra,th at.
the second distinguishing feature was evidence establishing the grandparents had ceased giving the obligor father gifts.thus,even though the trial court properly characterized the annual gift as income,substantial evidence supported the trial court conclusion that it would be speculative to assume such gifts would be made in the future.the appellate court reasoned generous relatives do not have a duty to support a family member minor children.that duty belongs to the children parents,subd.b.once gifts to a supporting parent have ceased,without any reasonable indication they will resume,they may not be used to impute income to that parent.citation.treating such gifts as income would lead to support payments based on money the parent does not have.citations.williamson,supra,th at.the trial court decision to exclude the cash advances as income was therefore within the proper exercise of discretion.ibid.
d.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case 
the legal authorities discussed above indicate regular,recurrent gifts to a parent may be characterized as income to that parent for purposes of calculating guideline child support,but they do not indicate gifts must be so characterized in every case.instead,the trial court has discretion to consider gifts as income when they are a regular,recurrent monetary benefit to the parent.further,courts are mindful not to base a child support calculation on monies a parent does not actually have.
i.we do not resolve this case under section 
on appeal,anna contends section determines the outcome of this case.we decline to resolve the case under section for two reasons.first,while the parties agree there is no statutory definition of nonmarital partner,the evidence did not clearly establish the relationship between davis and anna is equivalent to a spousal relationship.instead,the uncontradicted evidence was that davis is godfather and he considers anna his best friend with whom he has no romantic involvement.further,anna trial brief identified davis only as anna friend and godfather.
second,and related,is the fact that anna did not contend in the trial court that section applied.as a result,the record on this issue was not developed.although anna trial brief acknowledged jeffrey intended to argue davis financial support of anna should be characterized as her income,and argued in response that alter did not apply to the case,the brief did not invoke section.in closing arguments,anna counsel raised section,but only as an analogy the trial court made no findings of fact on the nature of the relationship between anna and davis to do so would have required credibility determinations and a drawing of inferences from the evidence,all of which are within the province of the trial court.we therefore decline to resolve this case under section.moorpark homeowner vrt th,fn.mcdonald board of supervisors th.
ii.the trial court ruling was within its discretion 
we turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in failing to characterize davis financial support of anna as her income.jeffrey contends alter governs.however,this case differs from alter in several respects a large portion of the financial support anna receives from davis is in the form of indirect,benefits,such as housing,payments to others for services provided to her,and use of davis possessions,such as his cars.the evidence did not establish the money davis uses to cover those expenditures is otherwise available to anna for other purposes.consistent with loh,schlafly,and,the trial court reasonably excluded this financial support from the calculation of anna income.
even as to the cash or financial support davis gives anna,the court could reasonably determine these benefits were not properly characterized as income to her for purposes of the child support calculation.under several analyses courts have used to determine income,davis financial support would not qualify.there was no evidence the financial support is derived from anna capital,labor,or any combination of the two.alter,supra,th at.there was no evidence davis financial support is income to anna for federal income tax purposes jeffrey did not argue anna true income under the tax laws was different from what she represented to taxing authorities.loh,supra,th at.
moreover,while alter provided legal authority for the court to characterize at least some of davis financial support as anna income,the facts of this case are significantly different.unlike the situation presented in alter,very little about anna arrangement wit
