introduction 
the orange county department of child support services the department appealed from an order for genetic testing issued pursuant to family code section.all further statutory references are to the family code,unless otherwise noted.
as explained post,we treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate,and grant the petition.the order was issued preliminarily to the court ruling on a motion to set aside a paternity judgment based on a voluntary declaration of paternity.the motion to set aside was filed more than two years after the child birth,and was therefore untimely under sections,subdivision a and,subdivision b.there was no extrinsic fraud in this case which would permit the trial court,using its equity powers,to set aside the paternity declaration despite its untimeliness.the trial court could not set aside the paternity judgment and therefore abused its discretion by ordering genetic testing for the purpose of deciding whether to set aside the judgment.
statement of facts and procedural history 
kameron was born in november.jason rothert and elicia signed a paternity declaration two days after kameron birth,acknowledging rothert was kameron biological father.
on july,the department filed a summons and complaint to establish a child support order for kameron.the issue of paternity was not placed at issue in the complaint.rothert failed to file an answer to the complaint,and a default judgment was entered on april,establishing monthly support for kameron.
on august,rothert filed a motion to set aside the default judgment and submitted a proposed answer to the complaint,in which he challenged the monthly support and the amount in arrears,but admitted paternity.the trial court granted the motion on september,and set aside the default judgment with respect to the financial issues,but determined that the portion of the judgment establishing paternity would not be disturbed.
on july,rothert filed a motion to set aside the judgment of paternity.in support of the motion,rothert declared at the time the child was conceived,neither rothert nor elicia were sic in a mutually exclusive relationship.i have not seen the child since he was months old,and briefly through monitored visitation.the custodial parent has never made the attempt to establish a relationship.those who have seen the child state that he does not look like me.for these reasons,i want a dna test to establish paternity.rothert alleged it had been less than one year since he had discovered or should have discovered the alleged fraud that had led him to sign the paternity declaration,although he did not explain the nature of any fraud.
on august,the trial court granted rothert request for genetic testing,and ordered rothert,elicia,and kameron to submit to genetic testing within days.the court announced it would make its decision on setting aside the judgment of paternity after receiving the results of the genetic testing.at the hearing,the trial court explained its decision pursuant to section,subdivision b,the family code,that is the section which talks about the rescission of a voluntary declaration of paternity.that section indicates notwithstanding section,if the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts,based on the results of genetic tests,are that the man who signed the voluntary declaration is not the father of the child,the court may set aside the voluntary declaration.clearly,if the legislature chose to include that section in the decision portion of the family code,the legislature contemplates the genetic testing would be ordered regarding the issue of whether or not a voluntary declaration of paternity should be set aside.therefore,for the department to say that simply because someone has signed the voluntary declaration of paternity,paternity is no longer an issue is in direct contravention of the clear legislative intent of the statute itself.
the department timely appealed.the trial court denied the department request for a stay of proceedings pending appeal 
on december,the department filed a petition for a writ of mandate,prohibition,or other appropriate relief and requested an immediate stay of the trial court proceedings from this court.we treated the department petition as a petition for a writ of supersedeas,and,on our own motion,granted the department request for an immediate stay of the proceedings.in our order,we also consolidated the department petition with this appeal.
discussion 
as petition for writ of mandate 
rothert filed a motion to dismiss the department appeal on the ground that the genetic testing order is not a judgment or an appealable order.we do not reach this issue because we exercise our discretion to treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate,in the interests of justice and judicial economy.morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d,connell superior court th,d.the merits of the issue have been fully briefed by the parties,and this is a case in which the failure to consider the issue at this juncture would be a dereliction of our duties as a reviewing court.we deny the motion to dismiss the appeal as moot.
standards of review 
a trial court order granting or denying a request for genetic testing is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.cruz superior court th,d in re joshua th,d city and county of san francisco stanley th,d.
on the question of whether the trial court correctly interpreted the scope of its authority to order genetic testing under the relevant statutes,however,we review the matter de novo.holmes jones th,d.
did the trial court err by granting the order 
the department argues the trial court erred by granting the order requiring genetic testing because rothert request was untimely.before analyzing the relevant statutes,we will explain the history of those statutes.
before the enactment of section,a paternity judgment,even if it was a default judgment,was conclusive for all purposes.see county of fresno sanchez th,d.county of los angeles navarro th,d navarro highlighted the issues relating to genetic testing after entry of a default judgment.in navarro,a default judgment establishing manuel navarro as the father of two boys born in december was entered in july.id.at,d.five years later,in july,navarro filed a motion to set aside the judgment,offering the results of a genetic blood test proving he was not the boys father.ibid.the trial court denied the motion because it had been filed long after the period provided by code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.navarro,supra,th at,d.the trial court refused to grant equity relief because the mother assertion that navarro was the father was not extrinsic fraud.ibid.
the appellate court concluded that fairness nevertheless required that the judgment be set aside,given the circumstances of the case.sometimes even more important policies than the finality of judgments are at stake,however.mistakes do happen,and a profound mistake occurred here when navarro was charged with being the boys father,an error the county concedes.instead of remedying its mistake,the county retreats behind the procedural redoubt offered by the passage of time since it took navarro default.navarro,supra,th at,d.
article to chapter of the uniform parentage act et,enacted in september,sets forth the procedures for challenging a judgment of paternity based on the results of genetic testing.in light of this comprehensive statutory scheme for setting aside a judgment of paternity when otherwise established procedural rules would not permit relief,it must be concluded that section et,vitiates county of los angeles navarro.the amorphous equitable considerations and general policies relied on in navarro must give way to the later enacted detailed procedure.county of fresno sanchez,supra,th at,d.
section,subdivision a sets out the time periods within which a paternity judgment may be challenged on the basis of genetic testing notwithstanding any other provision of law,a judgment establishing paternity may be set aside or vacated upon a motion by the previously established father of a child if genetic testing indicates that the previously established father of a child is not the
