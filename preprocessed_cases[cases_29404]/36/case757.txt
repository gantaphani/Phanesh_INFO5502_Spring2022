facts and procedural history 
appellant and daisy medina medina are the parents of two children,rebecca and cristabelle.on january,the trial court entered a default judgment requiring appellant to pay child support of per month,per child.in,appellant and medina stipulated to reduce the child support to per month,per child.the written form used for the stipulation and order specified that it may be executed by a commissioner of the superior court and,in fact,commissioner mcknight signed the stipulation and order on april.on june,appellant and medina stipulated to waive unassigned child support arrears that had accrued through may.apparently,medina had agreed with appellant to have the department close its case for collection of child support arrears,since appellant was prepared to pay medina directly the amounts then owed.
on august,at the request of medina,the department filed a motion to modify child support.the notice of motion included,in bold print at the top of page two thereof,a notice advising the parties that the case may be referred to a court commissioner who would act as a temporary judge in the absence of an objection by either party prior to the hearing.the minute order regarding the hearing of the motion reflects that appellant appeared and consented to having commissioner mcknight act as temporary judge in that hearing.appellant support obligation was modified by commissioner mcknight to per month for cristabelle and per month for rebecca,for a total of each month.
on december,at appellant request,the department filed another motion to modify child support,apparently due to a decrease in appellant income.the notice of motion included the same notice provision,informing the parties that the case may be referred to a court commissioner who would hear and decide the matter as a temporary judge in the absence of objection by either party.the department motion also included a request to set payment on any arrears balance at the rate of per month,or such other sum based on the obligor ability to pay.unnecessary capitalization omitted.the hearing of the department motion was set for january,at,in department f,of kern county superior court.
on january,appellant filed a motion to modify arrears of child support.pursuant to an application by appellant for an order shortening time,this motion was set at the same time and date as the department pending motion on his behalf,for january,at,in department appellant attached a declaration to his motion to modify arrears which asserted the factual grounds for his motion.he asserted that in july,medina had requested that the department reopen her case for enforcement of child support,and in doing so she reported to the department only a partial payment history dating back to october of.as a result,the department billing statements reflected that appellant owed child support arrears of plus in interest.appellant also attached the department most recent report stating that as of december,he owed a balance due of in child support arrears.appellant claimed in his motion that these amounts were incorrect because they failed to account for a number of additional payments made by appellant for his children support between october and may.appellant provided banking records showing the additional sums paid by him,totaling over.thus,from appellant perspective,he did not owe any arrears since he had paid more than the total amounts due for child support.
as noted,the hearing date for both motions was january.the minute order for that date reflected that appellant and medina appeared in room and met with the department representative,but they did not make a formal appearance before the trial court.both motions were continued to february,at,in department f,for hearing before commissioner mcknight or other assigned judicial officer.
on february,the parties appeared for the hearing of the two motions.commissioner james compton was presiding in place of commissioner mcknight on that date.commissioner compton heard evidence,including testimony from both appellant and medina,and decided the department motion to modify appellant child support obligation.specifically,appellant support obligation for rebecca was modified to per month.commissioner compton continued the hearing of appellant motion regarding arrears to march,at,in department f,before the ralph mcknight jr or other assigned judicial officer.unnecessary capitalization omitted.the purpose of the continuance was to allow appellant to gather additional bank records to substantiate payments he made to medina.
on march,neither parent appeared at the hearing and commissioner mcknight continued the matter to march.
on march,both parents and the department appeared for appellant motion to modify the amount of arrears.after presenting evidence of the payments made by him to medina,appellant claimed that he overpaid child support in the amount of and,thus,he had zero arrears.medina asked the trial court to deny credit for the extra amounts paid,since there was no agreement that such amounts were to be an offset toward his future child support obligation each month.
in explaining his ruling from the bench,commissioner mcknight also referred to herein as the trial court credited appellant with certain payments that had not been included in the department calculations.with respect to other amounts that were paid the court ordered child support,the trial court found that there was no evidence that such payments were intended to be credited against future child support due.rather,the supplemental amounts were intended as occasional gifts.nevertheless,in light of the good faith demonstrated by paying in excess of the amount,the trial court ordered that the accounting of arrears would show a zero balance at the end of january,coinciding with the time frame that appellant stopped making regular payments.beginning february,the amount of arrears due would be based on whatever amount of monies were not paid up to the monthly amount due from that point forward.a formal order after hearing was filed on march,and the department was ordered therein to adjust its account concerning arrears accordingly.
on april,appellant filed a motion to set aside the trial court order determining arrears.the ground for appellant motion was that that he had not been properly advised of his right to object to having a commissioner decide the matter.the hearing on the motion was held on may,before commissioner mcknight.appellant and his attorney appeared at the hearing,along with medina and the department.appellant attorney stated that appellant did not attend the prehearing video presentation that was used by the family law court to advise all parties,prior to convening the child support calendar,that they have a right to object to a commissioner hearing their case.appellant attorney argued that absent an advisal and written waiver,the rulings of the commissioner would not be binding on him the trial court summarized appellant position as an o ffer of proof that appellant did not appear,as directed,at and listen to the video instruction.appellant attorney replied that app
