a father appeals from an order finding him delinquent in his child support payments and assessing him a statutory interest penalty.he argues interest should not have accrued until the effective date of this court remittitur reinstating his child support obligations for the period his child participated in an american field service program in japan.he also argues child support was not owed until he was provided satisfactory proof none of the contingencies had occurred which would have terminated his child support obligations as a matter of law.absent this proof,he argues,his withholding of child support payments can not be deemed egregious as is required before penalties may be imposed.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
william and ursula hubner were married in june and separated in october after a marriage of about four years.their son,ryan,with whom william has never had any contact,was born on march.a judgment of dissolution of marriage was entered in november.
from ryan birth until early,william paid per month in child support.in,in response to ursula petition for increased child support,william was ordered to pay child support of per month,retroactive to march.that order was based in part on findings ursula had sole legal and physical custody of ryan and william stipulation he had a net disposable income of at least million per year and the ability to pay any reasonable child support order.under the then statutory guidelines,the order for child support could have been at least per month.
in october,ursula filed an order to show cause to modify the child support order to the guideline level.instead of submitting to ursula requests for discovery,william filed an admission stating his annual pretax income exceeded,he enjoyed a lifestyle commensurate with a person earning per year,and he had the ability to pay any reasonable and lawful child support order william claimed his admission established his status as an extraordinary high income earner which in turn relieved him from any obligation to comply with ursula discovery requests.
the court ordered william to pay per month from november through march,when ryan would turn years old.however,the court decided ryan would not be a high school student,and thus not entitled to support during the time he participated in an american field service program in japan as a foreign exchange student.the court order thus suspended william obligation to pay child support during this period,to be reinstated when ryan returned to high school after his return from japan and until ryan birthday.
both ursula and william appealed from the court order.in december,we issued our opinion in in re marriage of hubner we found the trial court erred in suspending william child support obligation during the period ryan participated in the american field service program we also remanded the matter to determine an appropriate amount of child support consistent with the statutory guidelines 
in the meantime william made no child support payments all during the period following ryan birthday,from april through march,pursuant to either the original order for per month or the modified order for per month.
ryan participated in the american field service program and attended school full time while in japan.he returned to mater dei high school in orange county to complete his senior year in high school.ryan turned years old on march.he graduated from mater dei high school in may.
in june,ursula brought a motion to determine arrearages.ursula motion sought to collect at least the per month due under the child support order,pending release of william financial information to determine a proper guideline amount of support as directed by this court.the trial court granted ursula motion without prejudice to her seeking a new modified support order based on the statutory guidelines.the court stated,i think that she is entitled to enforce the order which is currently in effect.and the order currently in effect per the court of appeal is a month until such time as ryan finished his afs and graduated f rom mater dei.and turned.i think that is clearly what the court of appeal was saying.and it up to her if she wants to run around and try to collect it right now.
william counsel inquired how interest on the unpaid amount should be handled because the time period involved two different child support orders one for a month and the other for per month.the court noted the only valid support order was for per month and interest on that amount accru ed when they were paid on time.the court noted the fact the subsequent child support order for per month was reduced to is not going to be a basis for eliminating the right to collect interest on the.
the court issued its order for arrearages on september.ursula served william notice of the court order the next day.the notice,based on the court rulings,stated he owed child support commencing april,in the total principal sum of,plus statutory interest.in october,william paid toward his past due child support obligation.he paid nothing more.
in june,ursula served william with a notice of delinquency.ursula notice stated she would seek penalty interest on the delinquent balance in accordance with section william responded by filing his own petition to determine arrearages.he claimed he was not delinquent because he paid per month until may,when ryan would have otherwise graduated from high school but for his participation in the american field service program ryan did not submit proof he satisfied the necessary conditions for child support until age the appropriate amount of child support had yet to be conclusively determined during the time ryan was in japan he spent considerably less than per month if the court ultimately ordered less than per month in the still pending request for modification it would not serve the interests of justice to require him to seek reimbursement from ursula who admittedly had no means to repay any amount and if the court ultimately ordered more than per month as appropriate child support then the amount now claimed to be delinquent would be subsumed in any final order in any event william argued because of these circumstances his nonpayment could not be considered egregious.he thus requested no penalties be imposed for his failure to pay.finally,william argued,even if the court determines he is in arrears in his child support payments then interest should only begin to accrue on the arrearages from december,the date of this court decision finding the trial court erred in suspending his liability for child support during the time ryan spent as a foreign exchange student in japan.
at the conclusion of the hearing the trial court ordered,in accordance with its earlier ruling in september,the order directing william to pay child support in the amount of per month remained in effect,and that statutory interest accrued from the date each such payment was due,commencing april,through march accordingly,the court entered an order for child support in the principal sum of plus accrued interest of for a total of.
at the hearing,william admitted he had not tendered payment until days after receiving service of ursula notice of delinquency.the trial court found his failure to pay the arrearages,despite notice of its order in september,and despite his ability to do so,was sufficiently egregious to justify imposition of the interest penalty for the two months he failed to pay after receiving ursula notice of delinquency.on the other hand,the court found william argument interest should only accrue from the date of this court opinion reversing the suspension order was not so patently frivolous,or otherwise so clearly resolved in its order to warrant an award of sanctions.

william argues statutory interest on the arrearages should have only begun to accrue from the date the remittitur issued in this court decision in in re marriage of hubner,that is when the
