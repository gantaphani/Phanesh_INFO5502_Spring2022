the legislature further found that a simple system for voluntary paternity declarations would result in a significant increase in the ease of establishing paternity and a significant decrease in the time and money needed to establish paternity,and was in the public interest,subd.b.the legislature adopted such a system.under section,upon the event of a live birth,prior to an unmarried mother leaving any hospital,the person responsible for registering live births shall provide to the natural mother and shall attempt to provide,at the place of birth,to the man identified by the natural mother as the natural father,a voluntary declaration of paternity together with the written materials described in section.staff in the hospital shall witness the signatures of parents signing a voluntary declaration of paternity and shall forward the signed declaration to the department of child support services within days of the date the declaration was signed,subd.a.the written materials must inform the parents that once filed,a voluntary declaration of paternity establishes paternity,and must also inform the father that by signing the voluntary declaration he is waiving the constitutional right to have paternity established by a court,subd.b.
once a voluntary declaration has been filed with the department of child support services,it shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.the voluntary declaration of paternity shall be recognized as a basis for the establishment of an order for child custody,visitation,or child support.
there are,however,circumstances under which a voluntary declaration may be rescinded or set aside.under section,subdivision a,either parent may rescind the declaration within days merely by filing a form.under,subdivision b,a court may set a declaration aside when blood tests et establish that the declarant is not the child father,subd.b.section,subdivision c provides that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prejudice or bar the rights of either parent to file an action or motion to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity on any of the grounds described in,and within the time limits specified in,section of the code of civil procedure,subd.c.notably,section,subdivision c ends with the rule that nothing in this section is intended to restrict a court from acting as a court of equity,subd.c.
