a spousal support order was scheduled to step down to zero in.the trial court modified the order to keep the spousal support at the level it had been prior to,based on the change of circumstances that a child support order had terminated seventeen months earlier.the trial court authority for doing so was family code,section,a relatively new statute in the family code the supporting spouse has brought this appeal from the order of modification.
there are times when the definition of is really makes a difference.this case is one of them.the key word in section is is.
section provides that 
when the court has jurisdiction to order spousal support and 
if a companion child support order is in effect italics added 
the termination of child support because the child reaches the age of majority constitutes a change of circumstance that may be the basis for a request for modification of spousal support.
this is a case of first impression.the question of first impression is what the legislature meant by the words if a companion child support order is in effect,and particularly what it meant by the phrase,is in effect.or,put another way how much time can elapse before is becomes was 
as we explain in detail below,the phrase is in effect should not be narrowly construed to deprive the family court of jurisdiction to make an order under section just because the child has already reached the age of the majority,even though,under section,a child support order is,technically,no longer in effect the day after a child reaches the age of majority.thus a family law court is not deprived of jurisdiction to make an order under section simply because a child,for example,turned a few days before the supported spouse made a request for modification under section.
rather,the statute should be broadly construed to implement its purpose,which was to allow for the possibility of modified spousal support generally upon the event of the discontinuation of child support.in that regard,we divine that the legislature intended that reasonable contemporaneousness with the discontinuation of child support is enough to give the family law court jurisdiction to make a spousal support order under section.
even particular facts in this appeal force us to ask just how long a supported spouse may wait after a child support order is no longer in effect to bring a proceeding to modify spousal support under section.a few months under the rule of general contemporaneousness,we think we are safe to say that a few months would be within the purview of the statute.
but more than a year as we show below,by comparison to other important deadlines in the family code,it would do violence to the legislature use of the phrase is in effect present say that a modification proceeding more than seventeen months after the companion child support order ceased to be in effect was within the purview of section.the definition of is can not be stretched to include something that became past tense seventeen months ago.consequently we conclude that the trial court order modifying support in this the child support order ended in august and no modification request was brought until february be sustained on the basis of section.and section was the sole basis for the modification,so the order can not be sustained at all.
background 
laurie and richard kacik were married in june,and separated in may,for a marriage.they had one child,alexander,then age,born august.they were divorced pursuant to a stipulated judgment filed june.each was represented by counsel.the stipulated judgment provided for a month in child support from richard to laurie,which was to last until alexander reached the age of.richard was also to pay laurie in spousal support for seven years,after which spousal support was to be reduced to zero on february,but the court was to retain jurisdiction over support until death,remarriage or further order of the court.at the time of the separation laurie was years old,not working and earning zero,but the stipulated judgment recited that she had the ability to earn not less than per month in gross income.richard was making gross income a month.
the child support order terminated in august,apparently as a result of the couple son alexander having reached the age of.about seventeen months later,on february,precise date that the spousal support award was scheduled to step down to,represented by counsel,filed an order to show cause proceeding commonly called an osc,the main objective of which was a modification of spousal support to laurie declaration in support of the order to show cause made these statements and assertions in support of her modification request 
in august,child support for our son terminated.
i have attempted to become and presently work full time.i,however,can not find a position that pays more than my present per hour.
if spousal support were to be reduced to zero,pursuant to the existing judgment,i would be forced to sell my residence in the middle of a very weak market and move out of orange county.it would be impossible to live on my current income.
i require continued spousal support from richard in order to afford the basic necessities of life.
by the time of laurie osc in,she had obtained employment in a shop in san juan capistrano earning an hour,was working a week,and was years old.her declaration in support of her osc provided no information beyond the statement that she could not find a position that pays more than an hour regarding any efforts by laurie to gain additional education or skills.her income and expense declaration listed the completion of high school as her highest level of education.
the initial date for the hearing on laurie osc was scheduled for april.richard filed a responsive declaration asserting that he was paying for all the costs of andrew education at cal poly san luis obispo,and had relied on the judgment in undertaking to shoulder the cost of the couple son by himself.his form showed a monthly income of divided by.
the case was continued to june.in the meantime april richard attorneys propounded a request for production of documents,basically asking for any documentation concerning laurie efforts to become since the judgment.the response was that no such documents existed.that point formed the basis of a supplemental declaration from richard counsel filed about four days prior to the june hearing,the gravamen of which was that laurie had not really done anything to become.
the matter was continued again to july,when the hearing went forward,with counsel having agreed to submit on the paperwork.
the substantive hearing began with the trial judge announcing a modified order of before hearing argument.this is what she announced she took the gross per month that richard was making at the time of the judgment and halved it,arriving at the figure of.the trial judge then declared the figure to be the marital standard of living.then she found that the spousal support figure in the judgment of did not meet the marital standard of living,leaving laurie short.that is,the figure only made up the shortfall by half,and that was the court order 
at that point richard counsel interrupted to argue that there had been no preliminary finding of change of circumstances.the trial judge replied that the child no longer lives with her was the change in circumstances justifying modification of the spousal support order.when richard counsel asserted that the change was over two years ago,the trial judge acknowledged the passage of time,then changed the subject 
as to any efforts on laurie part to become,the trial judge said that the a month laurie was then making constituted a substantial increase over what had been imputed to laurie by way of income capacity in the judgment.as far as the trial judge was concerned,the itself represented a sufficient effort to become.earlier in the argument,however,the trial judge said,in answer to richard counsel argument that there was no evidence laurie had done anything to improve or become,that laurie does have any education.
the modified spousal support order,made retroactive to february,was embodied in a formal order filed october,from which richard took a timely appeal on november,
ii.section 
a.the history 
in in re marriage of lautsbaugh th,d,the court of appeal held that the circumstance of a child graduation from high school and concomitant termination of husband child support obligations was not a sufficient material change of circumstances to justify a spousal support modification request.the court based its thinking on the rule that circumstances accounted for in the previous order can not constitute a change of circumstances.id.at,d,citing hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.since the termination of child support was within the expectations of the original order,the termination was simply not a change of circumstances.lautsbaugh,supra,th at,d.
in,the legislature added section stats,ch.to the family code,with the express purpose of overturning the lautsbaugh decision.the bill was senate bill,carried by an orange county state senator tom harman and was presented as a bill,sponsored by the family law section of the state bar,that seeks to eliminate this change of circumstances courthouse hurdle in these cases when a child support order terminates by operation of law.cal.bill analysis,assem.jud,regular session,senate bill,july,at.the reports from the assembly judiciary committee,the senate judiciary committee and the senate rules committee are all easily accessible,and in any event are summarized in a comment in the rutter group practice guide.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group a.the committee reports and the rutter comment all tell this consistent story about the intent of the bill 
assume a hypothetical appropriate amount of spousal support in a case that also involves a child support order.further assume,however,that because of the high levels of child support required under california child support guidelines,there simply is enough money left over for the spousal support order to reach that hypothetically appropriate amount.under lautsbaugh,when the child support order terminates,the supported spouse would be left with a spousal support order,but no chance to go back to court and as the senate rules committee report put it make the case for a modified spousal support order based upon a change of circumstances.the bill was intended to remedy that situation 
the senate rules committee report noted that courts do not always consider the termination of a child support obligation in setting the terms of a spousal support order and parties in pro per may not have the foresight or legal knowledge to request that a court consider the termination of a child support obligation when setting the terms of spousal support.the report gives the example of a supported spouse whose children may have already graduated from high school,but continue to reside in the free.cal.bill analysis,jud,regular session,senate bill,march,at.under such a circumstance,modification of spousal support may be appropriate,but,under the rule of lautsbaugh,there would be no recourse in such a situation.ibid.
an interesting aspect of the legislation is that,in july,the author agreed to accept an amendment adding a sunset to the measure to permit the legislature to review the effect of this law change to ensure no unintended results come about through this reform.cal.bill analysis,assem.jud,regular session,senate bill,july,at.hence,unless extended,section will expire on january.
b.the language 
the operative words of section can be readily quoted in their entirety in a proceeding in which a spousal support order exists or in which the court has retained jurisdiction over a spousal support order,if a companion child support order is in effect,the termination of child support pursuant to subdivision a of section constitutes a change of circumstances that may be the basis for a request for modification of spousal support.
as we have alluded to already,the linguistic structure of section is conditional,as shown by that big word if.there are two conditions a proceeding in which a spousal support order exists or the court has retained jurisdiction,and a companion child support order is in effect.if the conditions are met,then the termination of child support pursuant to subdivision a of section constitutes a change of circumstances that may be the basis for a request for modification of spousal support.we note that section,by its terms,speaking of child support continuing until certain events,most notably a child reaching,depending on the circumstances,the age of or 
we confront the second condition of section what did the legislature intend when it wrote the words,a companion child support order is in effect 
the committee reports fail to directly address the issue.nor do the facts in lautsbaugh provide a great deal of help.in lautsbaugh,the youngest child graduated from high school in june,and the supported spouse filed her order to show cause to increase spousal support on june.lautsbaugh,supra,th at,d.assuming that the child support payments were due at the very end of one month or,more likely,the very beginning of the next,a child support order was certainly in effect on june when the osc was filed.also do any high schools who hold graduation ceremonies in june hold them as early as june probably not.that is,if some time had elapsed from the termination of the child support order at graduation until the supported spouse brought her osc,we would have a pretty good clue that the legislature meant something broader by in effect than,er,in effect.
that is,the legislature intent to overturn lautsbaugh as it relates to child support termination does not tell us that it meant to allow modifications filed after the termination of the child support order.all we know for sure is that a modification filed before the termination of the child support order,as in lautsbaugh,is within the meaning of the phrase is in effect.
c.one extreme 
there is another statute,however,which directly addresses when a child support order is in effect,section.the operative language is in the first sentence a an order for child support entered pursuant to this chapter continues in effect until the order is terminated by the court or terminates by operation of law pursuant to sections,and.italics added.
when statutes are in pari materia,similar phrases appearing in each should be given like meanings.people lamas cal th,d.statutes are in pari materia when they are on the same subject people honig th,d,or dealing with the same subject matter bonner county of san diego th,d.section is certainly in pari materia with section,because not only do section and section each deal with the topic of child support orders,but each involves the question of when a child support order is in effect.section,in fact,directly answers the question a child support order is in effect until the order is terminated by the court,or terminates by operation of law pursuant to sections,and,that is,until the child reaches the age of majority and support is terminated under section see also medical board of california superior court th,d rule of pari materia applies even when,as here,one statute deals generally with the subject and another deals with the subject with more specificity.
but there a problem with a construction of section that simply imports the literal language of into section.the problem is the word termination,as in the phrase,the termination of child support pursuant to subdivision a of section constitutes a change of circumstances construing the conditional words,is in effect to exclude any time at all after the formal termination of the child support order reads the words the termination to mean,in practicality,the upcoming termination or the prospective termination.
to be sure,the two readings can be literally harmonized by treating the words the termination as a fixed point in time and space,regardless of whether one is looking forward toward an upcoming termination,or backward toward one that has already happened.thus harmonized,one would read section to apply only to modification requests made prior to the termination of support,that is,while the companion child support order was still in effect.
even so,such a reading seems at odds with the basic purpose of the statute.the basic purpose of the statute is to allow supported spouses no longer receiving child support to make the case for a modification of spousal support because of the termination of child support.basically,a reading that precluded all modifications filed after formal termination would deprive trial judges of the data they would need to make an informed decision concerning the modification request.
this court recently recounted the basic rules of spousal support modification in in re marriage of dietz th,d,alluding to the numerous factors involved modification of spousal support,even if the prior amount is established by agreement,requires a material change of circumstances since the last order change of circumstances means a reduction or increase in the supporting spouse ability to pay an increase or decrease in the supported spouse needs it includes all factors affecting need and the ability to pay.a trial court considering whether to modify a spousal support order considers the same criteria set forth in family code section as it considered in making the initial order.
in other words,in considering a spousal support modification be sure,given the predicate of a change of trial court looks at the various factors bearing on spousal support under section.however,under a reading of section which requires a spousal support modification request to be made prior to the termination of the child support order,the supported spouse would have to make a request for modification prior to any actual experience of trying to live on the existing spousal support order absent child support.data concerning several important factors bearing on the modification under section would be literally unavailable.
there would,for example,be no data concerning the supported spouse maybe the supported spouse income as well,depending to use the example from the committee report on whether a child still living at home paid rent or not,or could get a job with which to pay rent.there would be no data about the needs of the supported spouse after as in this case the youngest child had moved out,subd.d,or,by contrast,the ability of the supported spouse,now possibly free from childcare responsibilities,to earn income,subds.a a or obtain retraining to earn extra income because of the prospect of more free time because of a newly empty nest,subd.l.and there would be no data with which to otherwise gauge the balance of hardships to each of the parties,subd.k in a context where a parent,formerly a primary caregiver for a child,no longer maybe,maybe not had that role.that is,under a reading that required the modification request be brought prior to the actual termination of the child support order,a great deal of information that a trial judge would necessarily want to make an appropriate modified spousal support order would simply not yet exist.
moreover,there is the example given by the senate rules committee children who have already graduated from high school,but continue to reside in the free.a reading of is in effect that precluded spousal support modifications after termination of the child support order would mean that some such situations where the child had graduated from high school but was continuing to reside in the home rent free would,literally,not qualify for modification even though the legislature explicitly intended them to qualify,the parent initially thought,before graduation,that the child would pay rent because he or she had a job lined up,so did bring an osc for spousal support modification,and then,a week after graduation the child lost the job.
we therefore decline to construe the words is in effect in pari materia with section such that section would automatically not apply the day after a child reached his or her majority.given the purpose of the statute,it seems that legislature wanted to treat the termination as the change of circumstances warranting modification.it would defeat the purpose of section to require the modification be filed before the actual change even though the literal language of section would point in that direction,and we decline to do that.see rehman dmv th,d construing two provisions of vehicle code so as to provide for immediate suspension of a commercial truck driver license for driving with or greater blood alcohol even though one statute seemed to require reinstatement of license if level was not or greater.
and the other 
but if a supported spouse is not required to file a modification request prior to the day the child support order expires,the question remains how long after may such a request be filed indefinitely 
we have already rejected a reading of is in effect that automatically precludes a modification request made after the expiration of the child support order.the opposite extreme would be a reading that would allow a modification any time there had been a child support order,no matter how much time had passed since it was in effect.
courts should give effect and significance to every word and phrase of a statute.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.the words is in effect have to have some meaning in section.indeed even when broadly construing a statute,we may not ignore the plain statutory language or reach conclusions inconsistent with this language.beach properties berti cal th,d.
a reading of section that would allow an unlimited amount of time to bring a spousal support modification request after a child support order literally went out of effect under section would read the words is in effect totally out of the statute.if the legislature had wanted a rule whereby any case in which there had ever been a child support order in effect at any time to be a change of circumstance that could possibly justify a modified spousal support order,it could easily have said,all the legislature needed to do was change one word is to was,as in was in effect.it did not.the legislature said is in effect,not was in effect or has been in effect at any time.
back to the purpose of the statute the idea was that a spousal support order typically in a marriage might be because a child support order essentially left insufficient money for a par spousal support order.hence the termination of the child support order would leave the supported spouse with the order,and no ground to correct it.that suggests that the modification should be brought within a reasonable amount of time after the termination of the child support order,what we have said above about the section factors that would go into the modification for enough time for some data to be collected.
a rule requiring a reasonable relationship between the event that the legislature said could be a change of circumstance justifying a possible termination of the child support the request both a satisfies the purpose of the statute while respecting the legislature choice of words,is in effect.for shorthand,we might call such a rule a requirement of reasonable contemporaneousness.
e.when is becomes was 
that leaves the question of the actual facts in this case the child support order terminated in august.the modification request was made more than seventeen months later in february.
we are guided by what the legislature has said about deadlines in other contexts,particularly contexts where the burdened party is necessarily aware of some need to act at the time of the event.a litigant has one year to move to set aside a family law judgment procured by fraud or perjury,subds.a,b,one year if a stipulated or uncontested judgment is the product of a mistake or if there was a failure to comply with disclosure requirements,subds.e,f,but two years if the judgment was procured because of duress or mental incapacity,subd.c,d.the classic deadline to move to set something aside because of mistake or related mishaps under section is a reasonable time,in no case exceeding six months.code civ,subd.b.
in light of the legislature concern that a given spousal support award might be the product of the law own,squeeze out effect because of a high level of child support,it seems hard to justify a modification made after more time
