fouad said appeals from the summary judgment denying his petition to determine that he is not the father of fouad samir said,subd.b on the ground that he lacked standing as a presumed father to maintain such an action.because he presented sufficient evidence to show he might qualify as the presumed father,subd.d,we hold that the trial court erred and reverse the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
fouad said appellant and henrietta jegan obtained a california divorce judgment in december.at the time,they had a daughter named suna.in april,jegan gave birth to a samir named appellant as the father on fouad birth certificate in april before fouad filed a petition to remove his name from fouad birth certificate,alleging that he was erroneously listed as the father.the petition was prepared on a form denominated as one to establish parentage under family code section,which is part of the uniform parentage act,et respondents filed a response that denied appellant allegations,and raised several affirmative defenses,including estoppel,and that appellant and jegan are married under the laws of islam and other jurisdictions.
in may appellant filed a motion to compel fouad to submit to dna testing.the motion was supported by appellant declaration,which stated that appellant moved from los angeles to saudi arabia in,shortly after his marriage to jegan.he and jegan separated in,and their divorce became final in december.in,appellant married his current wife.he lived in saudi arabia until,and since then has lived in switzerland.he and jegan did not live together or have sexual relations after their divorce.according to appellant,he learned at some unspecified time that he was listed as fouad father on fouad birth certificate.he never authorized jegan to do so.he was in saudi arabia when fouad was conceived and born.because he was not fouad father,appellant asked that his name be removed from fouad birth certificate and that the court find he was not the father.
respondents then moved for summary judgment,contending that appellant lacked standing to bring his petition under section.according to respondents,only a presumed father as defined by section,subdivision d had standing to bring the petition because appellant declaration denied the existence of any facts that would qualify him as a presumed father under subdivision d,and because appellant could not contradict his sworn statements,respondents conceded the truth of those statements only for purposes of their summary judgment motion,and asked the trial court to enter judgment for them.appellant opposed the motion,contending the trial court should consider declarations and other evidence from respondents showing they alleged facts which,if true,would qualify appellant as fouad presumed father under section,subdivision d 
the trial court granted the summary judgment motion and entered judgment for respondents,finding that appellant sworn statements concerning his lack of any relationship with fouad precluded appellant from establishing he was fouad presumed father.as a result,the trial court ruled,appellant lacked standing to bring his petition
