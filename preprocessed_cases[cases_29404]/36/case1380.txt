ray appeals a judgment terminating his parental rights to his daughter,under welfare and institutions code section ray asserts the judgment should be reversed because proper notice was not provided under the indian child welfare act icwa et the court abused its discretion by denying his section modification petition and the court did not ensure was able to visit her half brother,lucille,paternal grandmother and de facto parent,appeals from the denial of her section modification petition.she raises no arguments relating to the denial of that petition,but contends that the judgment should be reversed because notice was not provided in compliance with the icwa.because the agency did not comply with the notice provisions of the icwa,we reverse the judgment terminating parental rights and direct the court to ensure proper notice under the icwa is given.
factual and procedural background 
the san diego county health and human services agency the agency removed from the custody of her mother,shortly after her april birth and filed a section petition on her behalf.the petition alleged was at risk because was incarcerated and ray whereabouts were unknown.shortly after was removed from custody,lucille told the social worker that looked just like my mother you can see the indian in her,and there was cherokee blood,on my mother side.
at the may jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,the court made a true finding on the petition.however,because five other children had previously been declared dependents and did not reunify with her,the court did not order reunification services and scheduled a section hearing.although not clear from this record,it appears that because ray was an alleged father,he was not offered services.in august the court found ray was biological father and entered a judgment of paternity.
in november ray filed a section modification petition seeking to vacate the order referring the matter to a section hearing and to obtain services because he had been declared biological father.later that month,the court denied his petition.at the contemporaneous section hearing,the court terminated parental rights after finding was adoptable and none of the section,subdivision c exceptions applied.ray timely appealed.
in june we reversed the judgment terminating parental rights because ray had not received adequate notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings.in re june,wl nonpub.opn.we did not address ray contention that notice had not been provided under the icwa,but because there was sufficient evidence might be an indian child,we directed the court to assure proper notice was given under the icwa.id.at,at.
following remand by this court,ray told the social worker his grandmother,lillian,may have been registered with one of the cherokee tribes and before her death resided in beaumont,texas.in august the social worker sent notices to the cherokee indian tribes and the bureau of indian affairs bia.the eastern band of cherokee indians and the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians responded that,based on the information provided by the agency,was not eligible for enrollment in their tribes.the cherokee nation of oklahoma requested more information about family members to verify cherokee heritage.
in late august the agency filed an amended petition,alleging was at risk of harm because of her parents drug use.at the detention hearing,the court found notice had been provided pursuant to the icwa and the icwa did not apply.in october the court made a true finding on one allegation in the petition,granted lucille de facto parent application,declared to be a dependent,and removed her from custody.the court denied reunification services for both parents and scheduled a section hearing.ray and lucille filed petitions for extraordinary writ relief under california rules of court,rule b which this court denied in april.ray superior court,wl nonpub.opn.
in july lucille,ray,and each filed a section modification petition.lucille sought a hearing to review the agency decision not to place with a paternal uncle and aunt.ray and sought to vacate the section hearing and obtain six months of services to reunify with also sought return to her custody.the next month the agency received a letter from the cherokee nation of oklahoma stating it had received no response to its previous request for information and reiterating it was unable to verify indian heritage without further information.
in september the court denied the section modification petitions.contemporaneously,the court found was adoptable and none of the section,subdivision c exceptions applied,and terminated parental rights.
discussion 
lucille and ray assert the judgment must be reversed because notice of these proceedings was not given in compliance with the icwa.
congress enacted the icwa in to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.it allows a tribe to intervene in state court dependency proceedings c because the icwa presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations,a most important resource.in re desiree th,d.
w here the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and their right of intervention.a.notice to the tribe provides it the opportunity to assert its rights.in re karla th,d.notice shall be sent whenever there is reason to believe the child may be an indian child,and for every hearing thereafter unless and until it is determined that the child is not an indian child.rule f.no proceeding to terminate parental rights may occur until days after the tribe has received the notice.a.we may void a judgment terminating parental rights if notice to the tribes or bia is not given in accordance with provisions of the icwa.
lucille and ray contend reversal of the judgment is required because the agency did not include information about lillian in the august notices it sent to the cherokee tribes and the bia.
one of the primary purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable it to determine whether the minor is an indian child.in re th,d.notice is meaningless if no information or insufficient information is presented to the tribe,at,d.the notice must include the name,birthdate,and birthplace of the indian child his or her tribal affiliation a copy of the dependency petition the petitioner name a statement of the right of the tribe to intervene in the proceeding and information about the indian child biological mother,biological father,maternal and paternal grandparents and or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases,birthdates,places of birth and death,current and former addresses,tribal enrollment numbers,other identifying information.in re karla,supra,th at,d in re th,d a,d.
the social worker has a duty to inquire about and obtain,if possible,all of the information about a child family history required by code of federal regulations part d.in re,supra,th at,d.however,the initial appellate record shows no information was provided in the icwa notices about lucille or lillian,the person with alleged indian heritage.information about lucille was indisputably available because she was the minor de facto parent.see in re jennifer th,d.it is also likely lucille had information about lillian.however,the initial appellate record contains no evidence the social worker attempted to gather information from lucille.because the notices contained no information about lillian or lucille,the tribes could not conduct a meaningful search with the information provided.see,in re jennifer,supra,th at,d see also in re,supra,th at,d.the court erred in determining the notice provisions of icwa had been satisfied.
the agency concedes the initial appellate record does not show that the icwa notice requirements were satisfied.however,it urges us to affirm because it contends the error was cured with the notices sent to the bia and the recognized cherokee tribes in august,which are part of the augmented appellate record we may conclude the inadequate initial icwa notice is harmless if the august notices sent by the agency comply with the icwa.in re,supra,th at,d.
the augmented record shows the social worker provided the bia,the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians,the eastern band of cherokee indians,and the cherokee nation of oklahoma with lucille name,birthdate,and birthplace,the name of paternal grandfather,and the names,birthdates,and states of birth for paternal.however,the august notices still do not comply with the requirements of code of federal regulations part.they did not include aliases,the birthdate and birthplace of the paternal grandfather,the birthplace of paternal,the places of death if any relatives are deceased,or any current or former addresses.it is also not clear whether each woman married or maiden name was provided.the social worker did not say this information is unavailable.the social worker was required to investigate whether this information was available in re,supra,th at,d,or report no family member knew the information required by code of federal regulations part.
further,paternal date of birth is identified as.we question whether that date is accurate.it is plain that he could not have been born in,and it is not clear that he was born in.this question underscores the importance of filing the notices with the juvenile court.had the notices been properly filed in the first instance,this question could have been addressed and resolved below.because the notices were incomplete,the tribes and the bia could not conduct a meaningful search.see,in re jennifer,supra,th at,d.
in addition,in august the cherokee nation of oklahoma asked for additional information about the maternal grandparents and the paternal grandfather,i n order to verify cherokee heritage.the cherokee nation of oklahoma also requested dates of birth for everyone and maiden names of all females.it is impossible to validate or invalidate this claim without more complete family information.one year later,having received no response to its first letter,the cherokee nation of oklahoma sent another letter to the agency,stating the tribe notified the social worker that it was impossible to validate or invalidate any claim to cherokee heritage without more complete family information.our notice explained exactly what type of information was needed and asked the social worker to diligently research,to the best of her ability,and supply as much as possible.the social worker,however,did not respond to this letter.the agency has not provided an explanation for not responding to these requests for information other than conjecture at oral argument that the letters were incorrectly filed.
we are troubled that the agency did not file these letters with the juvenile court or seek to augment our record with them.the agency is required to file with the trial court all responses it receives from any tribes.in re karla,supra,th at,d in re th,d.not filing the tribes responses aids neither the courts nor the parties and does not serve the purpose of the icwa.we infer from these letters that the cherokee nation of oklahoma may believe has indian heritage.if,after remand,the cherokee nation of oklahoma determines she does and chooses to intervene,the agency failure to provide sufficient information in a timely fashion will have unnecessarily delayed resolution of this proceeding.the purpose of the icwa is to promote the stability and security of indian tribes.that security is not promoted when the agency does not respond to a tribe request for information.the court error of finding the icwa did not apply in this proceeding was not cured by information contained in the agency augmentation of the record.
ray and lucille also argue the matter should be reversed because birth certificate and a copy of the dependency petition were not sent with the notice full name was not provided the notices were not sent by certified mail and there is no evidence the bia or the cherokee nation of oklahoma received notice because the agency did not file proofs of service.we need not address these arguments,because other grounds exist for reversal.however,we urge the agency to comply with the provisions of the icwa when it provides notice following remand.
we reluctantly remand this matter to the juvenile court for the second time,particularly because this reversal was entirely preventable.by the time this opinion is filed,will have been in the juvenile system for over three years.however,given the deficiencies in compliance with the notice provisions of the icwa,we have no alternative but to reverse the matter for proper notice to be provided to the tribes and the bia 
ray asserts the court abused its discretion by denying his section modification petition seeking to vacate the referral to the section hearing and to obtain six months of services.under section,a parent may petition the court to change,modify,or set aside a previous court order.the petitioning party has the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there is a change of circumstances or new evidence,and the proposed modification is in the minor best interests.in re jasmon cal th,d.
the petition is addressed to the sound discretion of the juvenile court and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.citations.in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.citations.in re stephanie cal th,d.
because the agency conceded and the court accepted,that ray circumstances had changed,we address only whether the court abused its discretion in determining that because ray had no relationship with her,it was not in best interests to grant the petition.in examining that finding,we consider the bond between ray and and the bond between and her current caretakers.in re kimberly th,d.
the social worker believed considered ray a stranger.she did not want to visit with him and was anxious about being alone with him.during visits,she rejected his attempts to show affection.when he attempted to talk to,hold,or kiss her,she turned her head away,said stop it,ran away,or cried.when he asked her for something or tried to engage her,she said no stop,i do want to,or no,no,or tried to hit him,pushed him away,or turned her head away.she tried to close the door to the visitation room to prevent his entry.she did not ask about him between visits or talk about his visits after they were completed.
in contrast,saw her foster parents as parents.she relied on them to meet her needs and was clearly bonded to them.she felt secure and comfortable with them.
further,ray did not act in a parental manner.he did not come prepared for visits with food or diapers,did not call on her birthday or give her a gift,or call the foster parents between visits.he did not regularly visit.between april and september,he visited only three times.he did not contact the social worker for visits or to check on between november and may.he requested visits in may,but either did not attend or was often late to the visits she arranged.he apparently did not visit between july and september,he also acted inappropriately.while waiting in the court hallway to testify at the section hearing,the foster mother saw ray hit in the face with his fist.
relying on in re kimberly,supra,th,d,ray asserts we should find the court abused its discretion because it did not focus on the benefit would gain from continuing her relationship with lucille and other parental relatives,which would occur if ray received services.however,in re kimberly stated that the simple best interest test ignored the bonds between a father,a mother,a sister,and a brother,and devalued the minor interests in preserving an existing family unit
