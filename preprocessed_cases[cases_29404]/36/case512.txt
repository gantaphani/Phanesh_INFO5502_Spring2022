in this case,appellants,eric foretich and his parents,challenge the constitutionality of the elizabeth morgan act the act,claiming that the act is a bill of attainder.on the record before us,we find that congress violated the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder by singling out foretich for legislative punishment.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
foretich and his former wife,jean elizabeth morgan,have contested visitation and custody rights with respect to their daughter,hilary,since hilary birth in.in,the superior court awarded custody to morgan and broad visitation rights to foretich.notwithstanding repeated orders of the superior court,morgan continually objected to and obstructed foretich rights,claiming that foretich and his parents had sexually abused hilary.morgan accusations of sexual abuse were heard and considered by the superior court,but her charges were never credited.nevertheless,morgan persisted in her claims and continued to rebuff foretich efforts to secure visitation rights with his daughter.in her final act of defiance,morgan hid hilary from the court and from the child guardian ad litem and refused to reveal her whereabouts.morgan consequently served over two years in jail on civil contempt charges and ultimately fled the country to go into hiding with her daughter.
the custody dispute gained extraordinary notoriety in the media as morgan pressed her unproven charges of sexual abuse against foretich and his parents.in september,congress intervened and passed the elizabeth morgan act.the act achieved two principal aims.first,morgan and her daughter were able to return to the united states without being subject to the outstanding orders of the superior court.second,even though the superior court had never credited morgan allegations of sexual abuse and had deemed hilary visitation with her father to be in the child best interests,the act made it clear that foretich could no longer secure visitation with his daughter without first obtaining hilary consent.morgan returned to the united states with hilary shortly after the act passage.
the elizabeth morgan act gives a fleeting hint of neutrality,referring to any pending case involving custody over a minor child,as if to suggest that the act is broad in scope.however,the act then goes on to describe the visitation rights of a parent of a minor child in the superior court which is described in subsection b,and states that,after the child attains years of age,the party to the case who is described in subsection b may not have custody over,or visitation rights with,the child without the child consent.it is clear from the terms of subsection b that the party to whom the act refers is foretich and the child is his daughter,hilary.indeed,the government concedes that the act is aimed solely at foretich.
on june,while hilary was still a minor,foretich and his parents filed this lawsuit against the united states challenging the act as an unconstitutional bill of attainder and a violation of due process,separation of powers,and principles of home rule.morgan intervened as a defendant.five years later,the district court rejected foretich constitutional claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the united states and morgan.foretich united states,civ.action,foretich,reprinted in joint appendix.
we reverse the judgment of the district court and hold the elizabeth morgan act to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder.despite a feeble attempt at generality,there is no doubt that congress targeted foretich for application of the act unique child custody standard.the government concession on this point merely confirms what is otherwise clear congress singled out foretich on the basis of a judgment that he committed criminal acts of child sexual abuse.the act thus embodies legislative determinations that foretich was a danger to his child and that the custody dispute had to be resolved against him in order to protect hilary from future harm.in making those determinations,congress both inflicted extraordinary reputational injuries upon foretich that support our jurisdiction over this lawsuit and imposed punishment within the meaning of the bill of attainder clause.we therefore find that congress violated the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder by singling out foretich for legislative punishment.
background 
this appeal arises against the backdrop of a bitter and protracted dispute between appellee jean elizabeth morgan and her former spouse,appellant eric foretich,over the custody of their daughter,hilary foretich.hilary,who is now known as ellen morgan,was born in washington,on august.by the time of her birth,hilary parents were already separated,and custody proceedings in the district of columbia superior court soon followed.see morgan foretich,civ.action no,slip op.at,custody order,reprinted in.pending the outcome of the litigation,morgan retained custody of hilary,though foretich and his parents spent time with hilary on several occasions pursuant to court orders.see custody order,slip op.at,am.compl.morgan objected to these visits,and on several occasions in the superior court found it necessary to admonish morgan for obstructing foretich visitation with hilary.see custody order,slip op.at,am.compl.
on november,the superior court awarded custody of hilary to morgan,but permitted broad visitation for foretich.custody order,slip op.at.the court found that foretich had built a fine home life for hilary and that he and his parents,who had moved in with foretich,demonstrated an impressive love and concern for the child.id.at.similarly,the court found that morgan had revealed a truly deep and abiding attachment to and love for her child,id.at,and provided a stable and nurturing home for hilary,id.at.morgan only failure to act in hilary best interest,the court found,was her intolerant attitude towards visitation and her unwillingness to allow the father any significant role in bringing up this child.id.at.in light of these findings,the court imposed its own schedule of unsupervised visitation for foretich.id.at.
the first allegations of sexual abuse in this case arose just months after the superior court issued its custody and visitation order.see foretich,slip op.at,am.compl.morgan first raised her accusations in january with a doctor at children hospital in the district of columbia and later raised them in legal proceedings before the superior court and the district court for the eastern district of virginia.see am.compl.according to morgan,foretich and his parents repeatedly subjected hilary to acts of sexual abuse of a most disturbing nature.see am.compl,pls.mot.summ.ex.c,reprinted in.the allegations were graphic and shocking and described behavior that,if true,would subject the foretichs to criminal liability under both and federal law.see code.despite the foretichs strenuous denials,morgan continued to press her claim that her daughter was the victim of horrific acts of abuse.acting on her own beliefs,morgan refused to produce hilary for scheduled visits with foretich and embarked instead on what proved to be a prolonged battle against both the foretichs and the superior court to block all contact between hilary and her father.
from to,the superior court issued several orders reinforcing its initial ruling that foretich was entitled to visitation with hilary.see morgan foretich,civ.action no,reprinted in morgan foretich,civ.action no,reprinted in morgan foretich,civ.action no,reprinted in.morgan remained intransigent.although foretich did have some contact with hilary under the supervision of a guardian ad litem,morgan generally refused to cooperate with the court visitation orders.the superior court consequently held morgan in contempt of court on at least three occasions.see foretich,slip op.at.
throughout this period,morgan continued to charge foretich and his parents with sexual abuse.however,none of her allegations ever resulted in any judicial finding of wrongdoing by the foretichs.see foretich,slip op.at.rather,the superior court repeatedly found morgan unable to prove her charges.in november,after a hearing,the superior court determined that morgan allegations of sexual abuse were not proven and,therefore,did not warrant termination of foretich visitation rights.am.compl.one month later,the superior court reiterated that the results of medical evaluations of hilary were at most inconclusive.morgan foretich,civ.action no,slip op.at,reprinted in.in august,the superior court again reaffirmed foretich visitation rights,finding that morgan had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that foretich in any way sexually abused hilary.morgan foretich,civ.action no,slip op.at,reprinted in.one year later,in a similar judgment,the superior court once again declined to credit morgan charges of sexual abuse.morgan foretich,civ.action no,slip op.at,reprinted in.
in a related case,a jury in federal district court in virginia rejected morgan claims of sexual abuse.see morgan foretich,cir.following an appeal to the court of appeals for the fourth circuit,the case was remanded to the district court because of the trial court erroneous exclusion of certain evidence that had been offered by morgan.id.on remand,however,the case was dismissed after morgan refused to comply with a discovery order.am.compl.in dismissing the case,the trial judge admonished morgan for her willful defiance and flagrant disregard of court orders.id.
there is no evidence that the foretichs were ever the subjects of any criminal indictment or arrest warrant in connection with morgan allegations.am.compl.in its august order,the superior court succinctly captured the unfortunate state of affairs in the case 
if morgan allegations of sexual abuse by foretich of the minor child are true,then foretich is a psychologically deranged child sex abuser.on the other hand,if foretich is correct in his allegations that the child has been programmed by morgan and that the allegations of sexual abuse are fabricated,then morgan is a psychologically deranged and vindictive mother.

notwithstanding her failure to persuade any court of the truth of her allegations,morgan stood fast.after two brief periods of incarceration in the jail on charges of civil contempt,morgan was ordered to jail a third time in august for her failure to produce hilary for visitation or to reveal the child whereabouts.morgan foretich,civ.action no,slip op.at,final order,reprinted in.it later came to light that morgan had sent hilary abroad with morgan parents,who ultimately took up residence in new zealand with their granddaughter.foretich,slip op.at.morgan remained incarcerated for months.id.
in the meantime,the custody dispute had attracted extraordinary publicity.morgan resolve to keep hilary from her father garnered the support of congressman frank wolf.in april,congressman wolf sponsored a bill that became the district of columbia civil contempt imprisonment limitation act of.pub,stat.within days of the law enactment in september,morgan was released from jail pursuant to this statute.in march,morgan secured the release of her passport from the superior court and joined her daughter in new zealand.while there,morgan successfully petitioned the new zealand family court for sole custody of hilary.see foretich,slip op.at.
in,after spending five years in new zealand,morgan sought to return to the united states with her daughter.the august order of the superior court mandating visitation for foretich with hilary remained outstanding,however.that order required any law enforcement officer to take hilary into custody and bring her to the social services division of the superior court to be placed in accordance with further order of the court.final order,slip op.at.morgan accordingly feared that returning to the united states would mean turning hilary over to the superior court and,ultimately,to foretich.morgan supporters in congress intervened once more on her behalf.the elizabeth morgan act was the product of that intervention.
passed on september,as a legislative rider to the department of transportation appropriations act,the elizabeth morgan act amended title of the code to restrict the authority of the superior court.the act provides 
a in any pending case involving custody over a minor child or the visitation rights of a parent of a minor child in the superior court which is described in subsection b 
at anytime after the child attains years of age,the party to the case who is described in subsection b may not have custody over,or visitation rights with,the child without the child consent and 
if any person had actual or legal custody over the child or offered safe refuge to the child while the case or other actions relating to the case was pending,the court may not deprive the person of custody or visitation rights over the child or otherwise impose sanctions on the person on the grounds that the person had such custody or offered such refuge.
b a case described in this subsection is a case in which 
the child asserts that a party to the case has been sexually abusive with the child 
the child has resided outside of the united states for not less than consecutive months 
any of the parties to the case has denied custody or visitation to another party in violation of an order of the court for not less than consecutive months and 
any of the parties to the case has lived outside of the district of columbia during such period of denial of custody or visitation.
department of transportation and related agencies appropriations act of,pub,stat,codified at code.the act undisputedly prohibits the superior court from awarding or enforcing custody or visitation rights to foretich without hilary consent and prevents the superior court from sanctioning morgan on the basis of her previous custody of hilary.
members of congress considered the proposed legislation in a subcommittee hearing in august.see,to amend title,district of columbia code,to restrict the authority of the superior court over certain pending cases involving child custody and visitation rights hearing before the subcomm.on the district of columbia of the house comm.on gov t reform oversight,cong.hearing,reprinted in.according to the chairman of the subcommittee,the proposed bill would permit ellen morgan to be and to feel free to return to the united states with no cloud of legal intervention over her head,and reflect ed the common sense basic principle that the law ought not to compel one who has reached the age of reason into being forced to be unsupervised with someone whom that person asserts has been sexually abusive.hearing at,statement of davis.although members of the subcommittee disclaimed retrying the case,the clear focus of the hearing was on the custody dispute,and discussion during the hearing emphasized the need to vacate the orders of the superior court so that morgan and hilary would be free to return to the united states.see hearing at.members also spoke of the need to correct an injustice and to protect hilary best interests by facilitating her safe return to the united states.see id.
the subcommittee heard testimony from foretich,as well as from morgan mother and brother.morgan and hilary each submitted written statements expressing their desire to return to the united states without hilary being forced to see her father.during foretich testimony,members of the subcommittee repeatedly attempted to broker a deal with him if he would give up his parental rights and voluntarily seek vacatur of the superior court visitation orders,the subcommittee would withdraw the proposed legislation.see hearing at.no agreement could be reached,however,because foretich was unwilling to relinquish all of his parental rights.
having failed to negotiate a deal with foretich,congress passed the elizabeth morgan act on september.the act was signed into law on october.morgan successfully petitioned the new zealand family court for permission to leave the country and,in may,she returned to the united states with hilary,who was by this time years old.foretich informed the superior court of their return and indicated his intent to seek enforcement of that court prior orders.to that end,foretich filed a motion in superior court in june to compel morgan to disclose hilary location and to reappoint a guardian ad litem.morgan opposed the motion on the grounds that the superior court lacked jurisdiction over the matter,in part because of the elizabeth morgan act.see am.compl.no subsequent activity in the superior court appears on the record before us.
foretich and his parents filed this suit on june,against the united states and the district of columbia,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.foretich challenged the elizabeth morgan act as an unconstitutional bill of attainder,a violation of his substantive and procedural due process rights,and a violation of separation of powers and home rule.am.compl.while foretich parents also participated as plaintiffs in the action before the district court,the claims before us principally focus on injuries suffered by foretich,so we will focus our discussion accordingly.
in addition to the negation of favorable superior court orders awarding visitation as well as costs and fees,foretich alleged extraordinary injuries to his reputation resulting from the passage of the act.foretich elaborated on these injuries in an august affidavit in opposition to the united states motion to dismiss.see pl.mem.opp def.mot.dismiss ex.foretich aff.foretich described the subcommittee hearing on the act as a nightmare and the most humiliating experience of his life.id.he stated that after passage of the act he was continually harassed by the media and reminded by strangers that congress considered him a danger to his daughter.id.foretich neighbors also learned of the act in a constituency mailing from congressman wolf.id.
the act also damaged foretich professional reputation.once a prominent oral surgeon,foretich business suffered a decline following adoption of the act.id.forced to seek employment outside of northern virginia,he was denied a position at a north carolina university in part because of the act.id.he further stated that he was asked to resign his position as regent of the american college of oral and maxillofacial surgeons on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for an officer to serve after congress had taken action finding that i had abused my daughter.id.
on october,the district court granted morgan motion to intervene as a defendant.the district of columbia subsequently realigned itself as a plaintiff in the case.all parties moved for summary judgment in august.on june,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion and granted summary judgment to the united states and morgan,rejecting each of foretich constitutional challenges.on july,foretich filed a notice of appeal.
morgan moved to dismiss the foretichs appeal as moot on the grounds that hilary turned in august and that the superior court therefore no longer has child custody jurisdiction over her.we ordered the parties to address the jurisdictional issue,in addition to the merits of the foretichs constitutional challenges.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.levitan ashcroft,citing summers dep t of justice.applying this standard,we hold that the elizabeth morgan act is an unconstitutional bill of attainder.in light of this conclusion,we need not address appellants other constitutional claims.before deciding the merits,however,we assured ourselves of our jurisdiction over this appeal under article iii.we will first discuss the jurisdictional issue,then address the merits of the bill of attainder claim.
jurisdiction 
hilary foretich turned years old on august.for this reason,and because the child custody jurisdiction of the superior court extends only to minor children,appellees contend that foretich claim is moot insofar as it challenges the act negation of his visitation rights.we agree.
appellees further contend that the foretichs can not maintain article iii standing with respect to any of their other alleged injuries,including harm to foretich personal and professional reputation.we reject this contention.foretich reputational injuries are sufficiently concrete and amenable to redress by a declaratory judgment in his favor as to satisfy the requirements of article iii standing.as the supreme court has made clear,the fact that one aspect of a lawsuit becomes moot does not automatically deprive a court of jurisdiction over remaining,live aspects of the case.see,super tire eng g mccorkle,d.
article iii of the constitution limits our jurisdiction to actual,ongoing controversies.honig doe,d.this limitation gives rise to the doctrines of standing and mootness.to satisfy article iii standing requirements,a plaintiff must show that,at the time the suit is filed,
he has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a plaintiff must maintain standing throughout the course of litigation.if events outrun the controversy such that the court can grant no meaningful relief,the case must be dismissed as moot.mcbryde comm.to review,cert.denied,d.
foretich alleges three principal injuries.first,he argues that the elizabeth morgan act extinguishes visitation rights he previously enjoyed under the orders of the superior court and restricts his ability to seek future custody or visitation orders.this injury is premised on the requirement in subsection a of the act that hilary give her consent before foretich may have any visitation with her.normally,under the best interest standard that generally applies in the district of columbia,a judge considers the child wishes as one factor in determining custody and visitation disputes,but the child consent is not determinative.see code a a.foretich visitation rights were thus changed by the act in a way that adversely affected him as a parent,causing him to carry a burden that is not shouldered by other parents in the district of columbia.
as appellees correctly contend,foretich challenge to this alleged injury is moot.the superior court child custody jurisdiction extends only to minor children.creamer creamer,see also code.because hilary foretich reached the age of majority in august,the superior court can no longer award any custody or visitation rights relating to her.even in the absence of the elizabeth morgan act,law thus precludes foretich from obtaining or enforcing any visitation orders with respect to his daughter.consequently,to the extent the act infringed on foretich visitation rights,this injury is unredressable and can not support a finding of jurisdiction.
second,foretich asserts that the act prevents him from collecting fees and costs from morgan that the superior court awarded to him prior to morgan flight to new zealand.foretich bases this alleged injury on subsection a of the act,which states that,where the act applies,the superior court can not impose sanctions on a person in morgan position on the grounds that she maintained custody of hilary or otherwise gave her safe refuge while the custody suit was pending.code a.foretich can not demonstrate a cognizable injury on this ground.subsection a prohibits the superior court from impos ing sanctions on morgan.this language does not prevent foretich from seeking enforcement of sanctions the court had previously imposed.indeed,appellees conceded at oral argument before this court that the act would not have this effect.because we agree with this interpretation of the statute,and because the government gave us its assurance at oral argument that it would not oppose collection of these previously awarded fees and costs,we conclude that foretich does not have standing on the basis of this alleged injury.
in a similar vein,foretich argues that the act forecloses his ability to obtain new awards of fees and costs associated with morgan fleeing the jurisdiction.at first blush,this alleged injury appears better founded than appellants first argument relating to fees and costs.it is not unreasonable to conclude,as the government conceded at oral argument,that the act prohibition on impos ing sanctions precludes the superior court from entering any new orders awarding fees or costs against morgan.nevertheless,the claim is too speculative to satisfy article iii standing.foretich points to no effort on his part to obtain any such costs,although it has been six years since morgan returned to the united states.the mere prospect that foretich may one day wish to press a claim for costs associated with morgan flight to new zealand is too remote to impose an actual or imminent injury in fact,particularly where foretich has given us no indication of what such a claim might entail.we therefore can not base a finding of jurisdiction upon this alleged injury.
foretich third and final claim rests on his contention that he suffered extraordinary injuries to his personal and professional reputations as a result of the act.in particular,he asserts that the elizabeth morgan act embodies a congressional determination that he engaged in criminal acts of child abuse from which his daughter needed protection.as foretich detailed in the unrefuted affidavit submitted to the district court,passage of the act led to harassment by the media,estrangement from his neighbors,and loss of business and professional opportunities.see foretich aff.according to foretich,these reputational harms resulted directly from the congressional determination that he had abused his daughter.id.these injuries are both cognizable and redressable and therefore satisfy the requirements of article iii.
appellees concede,as they must,that injury to reputation can constitute a cognizable injury sufficient for article iii standing.see meese keene,d joint refugee comm.mcgrath.opinion of burton,mcbryde,at mut.help ass califano.furthermore,there can be no serious doubt that foretich suffered harm to his reputation as a result of this act and its attendant publicity.foretich affidavit to that effect was not contradicted.there are two components of foretich reputational injury that must be distinguished,however,as only one permits a finding of article iii standing.
first,foretich reputation arguably was harmed by the vitiation of his custodial rights.when a government entity abrogates an individual parental rights on the basis of a judgment that the person is unfit as a parent,the official abrogation undoubtedly damages that person reputation and standing in the community.accordingly,some portion of the harm to foretich reputation plausibly derives from the act effect on his visitation rights.as noted above,however,to the extent that the act infringes upon foretich parental rights,this infringement is not redressable.even if we invalidated the act,law would still preclude foretich from obtaining or enforcing any visitation orders in superior court in light of hilary age.accordingly,this component of foretich reputational injury is merely the secondary effect of an injury that is otherwise moot.
our case law makes clear that where reputational injury is the lingering effect of an otherwise moot aspect of a lawsuit,no meaningful relief is possible and the injury can not satisfy the requirements of article iii.see mcbryde,at.in mcbryde,a federal district judge challenged various sanctions imposed against him for misconduct by the judicial council for the fifth circuit,including suspensions from new case assignments.id.at.the suspensions had expired by the time we heard the appeal.id.at.among his alleged injuries,the appellant asserted harm to his reputation.we held that the reputational injury alone did not support the appellant standing to challenge the suspensions.rather,when injury to reputation is alleged as a secondary effect of an otherwise moot action,we have required that some tangible,concrete effect remain,susceptible to judicial correction.id.at quoting penthouse int l,meese.
similarly,in penthouse international,meese,we expressed skepticism that the continuing reputational injury caused by a government letter that labeled appellant publication as pornography and discouraged retailers from selling it could,by itself,keep the controversy alive after the government had retracted the letter,cert.denied,d.because the reputational injury in that case was the lingering effect of an otherwise moot action,we distinguished cases in which the reputational injury was the direct effect of the legal action the government had taken,id.at distinguishing reeve aleutian airways,united states,or where the incremental reputational harm was accompanied by more concrete injuries,id.distinguishing am.fed of gov t employees reagan,doe united states air force.likewise,in aulenback,fha,we held that a continuing reputational injury did not confer standing to seek declaratory relief when that injury derived from charges of misconduct that had been rendered moot by consent decree.id.at.
these cases illustrate that where harm to reputation arises as a byproduct of government action,the reputational injury,without more,will not satisfy article iii standing when that government action itself no longer presents an ongoing controversy.because the cause of the reputational harm is an otherwise moot government action,a judicial declaration that the action was unlawful is not likely to provide any further relief beyond that resulting from the expiration of the action itself.for this reason,we stated in mcbryde that,because the appellant reputational injuries derived from suspensions that had already expired,w e can not see how a declaratory judgment that the suspensions were unlawful would rehabilitate his reputation.at.similarly,we held in penthouse that if the retraction of the letter that was the source of the appellant reputational injuries had not relieved those injuries,we saw no reason why a declaratory judgment would be likely to do so.at see also aulenback,at noting that appellants offer ed no reason why,if the rescission of the government action did not bring back their customers,a declaratory judgment would be likely to do so.accordingly,to the extent that the injuries to foretich reputation derive from the act abrogation of his visitation rights,these injuries constitute the lingering effect of an otherwise moot government action and can not be the basis for article iii standing.
foretich does not limit his alleged reputational injury in this manner,however.there is a large second component to his reputational injury that constitutes an ongoing controversy and consequently supports our jurisdiction.as foretich uncontroverted affidavit makes clear,his principal complaint is that the elizabeth morgan act harmed his reputation by embodying a congressional determination that he is a child abuser and a danger to his own daughter.this claim clearly gives foretich standing in this case.congress act of judging foretich and legislating against him on the basis of that judgment the very things that,as we will see,render the act an unconstitutional bill of attainder directly give rise to a cognizable injury to his reputation that can be redressed by a declaratory judgment in foretich favor.
case law is clear that where reputational injury derives directly from an unexpired and unretracted government action,that injury satisfies the requirements of article iii standing to challenge that action.in meese keene,the supreme court held that the appellee had standing,on the basis of injuries to his personal and professional reputation,to challenge a federal statute classifying films the appellee wished to exhibit as political propaganda,d.finding that the injury to the appellee reputation occurs because the department of justice has placed the legitimate force of its criminal enforcement powers behind the label of political propaganda,the court held that the alleged injury was likely to be redressed by a favorable decision declaring the act unconstitutional and enjoining its application to the appellee.id.at.at.
in mcbryde,we relied on keene to uphold the appellee standing to challenge a public reprimand issued by the judicial council rebuking the appellee for his misconduct.at.unlike the suspensions,which had expired and therefore could not be challenged on the basis of reputational injury,t he dispute over the public reprimand remain ed alive.id.at.the reprimand constituted an official characterization of the appellee as having engaged in a pattern of abusive behavior that was prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts,and therefore inflicted direct injury to his reputation.id.at.consequently,we held that if the appellant prevailed on the merits,it would be within our power to declare unlawful the defendants issuance of stigmatizing reports and thereby to relieve the appellant of much of the resulting injury.sullivan comm.on admissions,holding that an attorney charged with misconduct had standing on the basis of reputational injury to appeal those portions of the district court opinion that reflected unfavorably on the attorney professional conduct even though the district court had otherwise dismissed the charges.
as these cases demonstrate,reputational injury that derives directly from government action will support article iii standing to challenge that action.redress is possible in such a case because the damage to reputation is caused by the challenged action.a declaratory judgment that the government actions were unlawful will consequently provide meaningful relief.see keene,at.at mcbryde,at.in this case,as in keene and mcbryde,foretich contends that the cited government action,here the elizabeth morgan act,directly damages his reputation and standing in the community by effectively branding him a child abuser and an unfit parent.this is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of article iii.this alleged injury to foretich reputation is a concrete and direct result of the legislation.a judicial determination that congress acted unlawfully in enacting the elizabeth morgan act will provide a significant measure of redress for the harm to foretich reputation.this alleged injury therefore supports a finding of jurisdiction in this case.
our conclusion might be different if the government had repealed the elizabeth morgan act.even where a government action embodies a characterization or condemnation that damages an individual standing in the community,the resulting reputational injury would not satisfy article iii standing if the challenged action had been rescinded and if the government satisfied its burden of demonstrating that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur.payne enterprises,united states,quoting county of los angeles davis,d.thus,as noted above,the lingering effects on reputation of a retracted or repealed government action normally do not furnish a basis for article iii standing.compare keene,at.at official condemnation was a continuing threat,and mcbryde,at stigmatizing reports were a continuing part of the historical record,with penthouse,at letter accusing retailers of distributing pornography had been retracted.this is not such a case.the elizabeth morgan act remains in force.we therefore retain jurisdiction over foretich challenge to its constitutionality.
the government argues that foretich lacks standing to sue on the basis of reputational injury because,even under our reading of keene and mcbryde,his injuries are not redressable.specifically,the government contends that any adverse impact on foretich reputation derives not from the existence of the elizabeth morgan act,but from the legislative process and surrounding publicity that led to its enactment.although the government conceded at oral argument that the legislative process had an adverse impact on appellant reputation,it was unwilling to attribute that impact to the statute itself.instead the government asserted that the statute does not reflect anything on its face about the foretichs.thus,the government argues that a decision from this court declaring the act to be unconstitutional can not redress foretich reputational injuries.in support of this argument,the government attempts to distinguish the public reprimand at issue in mcbryde on the ground that express condemnations of the appellant in that case appeared on the face of the challenged reprimand.see at.
we reject the government argument.it makes little sense to view the act in isolation,divorced from the legislative process that produced it.the statute represents the culmination of that process,and it memorializes judgments about foretich that congress formed during the course of that process.the government argument is particularly tenuous in the context of a bill of attainder challenge,in which the alleged constitutional defect arises not only from the statute text,but also from the underlying process of legislatively determining guilt without the protections of a judicial trial.see nixon adm r of,d.it is therefore not plausible to suggest that the elizabeth morgan act itself does not contribute to the harm suffered by foretich reputation.
furthermore,contrary to the government objections,a declaration by this court that congress exceeded its constitutional bounds by enacting the elizabeth morgan act will provide relief for foretich and his parents.see mcbryde,at were the plaintiff to prevail on the merits it would be within our power to declare unlawful the defendants issuance of stigmatizing reports and thereby to relieve much of the resulting injury.emphasis added doe,at we think that a declaratory judgment that the materials and information were obtained from the plaintiff by violating the constitution would constitute relief.mut.help ass n,at finding the plaintiff assertion that its good name and reputation have been damaged to be an injury capable of direct redress through the requested declaratory and injunctive relief.such a declaration will remove the imprimatur of government authority from an act that effectively denounces foretich as a danger to his own daughter.
in keene,the attorney general argued that enjoining the government from labeling appellant films as political propaganda would not provide relief because,even if the designation was removed,members of the community might continue to react negatively to the appellant and his films because of their having once been labeled.at.at.notwithstanding this possibility,the supreme court concluded that the injunction would at least partially redress the plaintiff reputational injury,because it would remove the legitimate force of the government criminal enforcement powers from the label.id.at.at emphasis added.
in other areas of the law,courts have proceeded on the assumption that a favorable judicial decision will provide meaningful relief even if not complete to a party who alleges an injury to his or her reputation.our circuit has joined others,for example,in finding that an attorney charged with misconduct has standing on the basis of reputational injury to appeal a judgment finding the attorney guilty but refraining from imposing any concrete sanctions.see sullivan,at see also walker city of mesquite,cir.similarly,it is foundational to the law of libel and defamation that a party who prevails on a claim that the defendant tort has harmed his or her reputation is in some sense relieved by that judgment.see,masson new yorker magazine,d t he tort action for defamation has existed to redress injury to the plaintiff reputation by a statement that is defamatory and false.white fraternal order of police,noting that a defamation tort redresses damage to reputation.
it may be true,as the government argues,that the damage to foretich reputation comes in part from the publicity surrounding the custody dispute and morgan allegations,not solely from the elizabeth morgan act.but this misses the point.the act itself has caused significant harm to foretich.therefore,by vindicating foretich assertion that congress unfairly and unlawfully rendered a judgment as to his character and fitness as a father,declaratory relief will provide a significant measure of redress sufficient to satisfy the requirements of article iii standing.here,a decision declaring the act unlawful would make clear that congress was wrong to pass judgment on foretich and wrong to single him out for punishment on the basis of that judgment.in doing so,a declaratory judgment in foretich favor would give redress for his reputational injuries.
as a final matter,appellees invite us to exercise our discretion under the doctrine of prudential mootness to refrain from hearing this appeal.we decline to do so.because the exercise of our equitable powers is discretionary,we may decline to hear an appeal for declaratory or injunctive relief w here it is unlikely that the court grant of declaratory judgment will actually relieve the injury.penthouse,at.this is especially true where the court can avoid adjudication of difficult or novel constitutional questions.id.at.these conditions do not obtain in this case.as we have said,a favorable judgment for appellants will provide a real measure of redress to foretich.moreover,this case does not raise unusually complex questions of law.rather,appellants claims implicate a constitutional provision with respect to which case law provides ample interpretive guidance.accordingly,we proceed to review the merits of those claims.
bill of attainder 
foretich argues that the elizabeth morgan act violates the bill of attainder clause by singling him out for legislative punishment.we agree and hold the act to be an unconstitutional bill of attainder.
article i,section of the constitution provides that n o bill of attainder shall be passed.const.art.i,cl.this provision prohibits congress from enacting a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.nixon adm r of,d.as the supreme court explained in united states brown,d,the clause was intended to serve as a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function,or more simply trial by legislature.id.at.at.the infrequency with which courts have relied upon this provision to invalidate legislation has not prevented its meaning from evolving to fulfill this purpose.see bellsouth fcc,bellsouth ii.
early in our country history,a bill of attainder was seen to refer to a legislative act that sentenced a named individual to death without benefit of a judicial trial.see bellsouth fcc,cert.denied,d bellsouth i.as early as,however,the scope of the prohibition was extended to include bills of pains and penalties,or legislative acts that sentenced specified persons to penalties short of death,including banishment,deprivation of the right to vote,corruption of blood,or confiscation of property.see fletcher peck,cranch.see also brown,at.at bellsouth i,at.by,the supreme court wrote that a forbidden attainder could embrace t he deprivation of any rights,civil or political,previously enjoyed,if the attending circumstances and causes of the deprivation demonstrated that the deprivation amounted to punishment.cummings missouri,wall.decisions from the supreme court since the civil war have invalidated as bills of attainder legislation barring specified persons or groups from pursuing various professions,where the employment bans were imposed as a brand of disloyalty.nixon,at.at.
under the now prevailing case law,a law is prohibited under the bill of attainder clause if it applies with specificity,and imposes punishment.bellsouth ii,at.the element of specificity may be satisfied if the statute singles out a person or class by name or applies to easily ascertainable members of a group.united states lovett.as the supreme court made clear in nixon,however,specificity alone does not render a statute an unconstitutional bill of attainder.see at.at.rather,a law may be so specific as to create a legitimate class of one without amounting to a bill of attainder unless it also satisfies the punishment element of the analysis.id.at.at.for this reason,we have upheld statutes against bill of attainder challenges even where the disputed statutes applied to specifically named parties.see bellsouth ii,at bellsouth i,at.both specificity and punishment must be shown before a law is condemned as a bill of attainder.
in this case,there can be no serious dispute that the elizabeth morgan act satisfies the specificity prong of our analysis.although congress stopped short of including the names foretich and morgan in the text of the statute,the applicability of the act depends on such a narrow set of circumstances that it applies to no known cases other than the custody dispute.the statute does not apply unless the minor child in a pending custody case has attained years of age the child has resided outside of the united states for not less than consecutive months any party to the case has denied custody or visitation to another party in violation of a court order for not less than consecutive months any party to the case has lived outside of the district of columbia during that period of denial of custody or visitation and the child has asserted that a party to the case has been sexually abusive with him or her.code.this combination of facts is so exceedingly narrow and unlikely to coincide that the affected persons are indeed easily ascertainable.for this reason,the government conceded at oral argument that there was no genuine issue as to the law specificity,stating that there no question that this law was specific to this family.
while the elizabeth morgan act thus satisfies the specificity requirement,this is only the beginning of our inquiry.recognizing that virtually all legislation operates by identifying the characteristics of the class to be benefited or burdened,we stated in bellsouth i that it is not clear that the specificity requirement retains any real bite.at.rather,the principal touchstone of a bill of attainder is punishment.
to ascertain whether a statute imposes punishment,the supreme court has instructed that a court should pursue a inquiry 
whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment whether the statute,viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed,reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes and whether the legislative record evinces a congressional intent to punish.
selective serv.pub.interest research group,d quoting nixon,at.at.the court has applied each of these criteria as an independent though not necessarily decisive indicator of punitiveness.see selective serv,at.at nixon,at.at see also seariver.fin.holdings,mineta,cir w e weigh these factors together in resolving a bill of attainder claim.consol.edison pataki,cir,cert.denied,d a statute need not fit all three factors to be considered a bill of attainder rather,those factors are the evidence that is weighed together in resolving a bill of attainder claim.
our cases have noted,however,that the second factor the functional test invariably appears to be the most important of the three.bellsouth ii,at quoting bellsouth i,at.indeed,compelling proof on this score may be determinative.in bellsouth i,we explained that where an enactment falls outside the historical definition of punishment,therefore failing to satisfy the first test,the legislation may still be a bill of attainder under the functional test if no legitimate nonpunitive purpose appears.at.this ensures that congress can not circumvent the clause by cooking up newfangled ways to punish disfavored individuals or groups.id.
the historical test 
with these principles in mind,we begin by examining whether the elizabeth morgan act imposes a burden that falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment.selective serv,at.at see also nixon,at.at the infamous history of bills of attainder is a useful starting point in the inquiry whether the act fairly can be characterized as a form of punishment.the historical experience with bills of attainder in england and the united states offers a ready checklist of deprivations and disabilities so disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends that they unquestionably have been held to fall within the proscription of art.i.nixon,at.at.this checklist includes sentences of death,bills of pains and penalties,and legislative bars to participation in specified employments or professions.see bellsouth ii,at.
we agree with the government that the elizabeth morgan act does not obviously impose burdens that historically have been identified as punishment.in other words,there are no past cases that involve the precise situation that we face here,so history is not conclusive.appellants rely on dictum in cummings missouri to the effect that d isqualification from the pursuits of a lawful avocation,or from positions of trust,or from the privilege of appearing in the courts,or acting as an executor,administrator,or guardian,may also,and often has been,imposed as punishment,wall.at,arguing that guardian and parent are equivalent.this is a stretch.cummings addressed a requirement imposed by the missouri state constitution that certain persons take an oath of loyalty before entering into certain professions.id.at.thus,at least at first blush,the reference to guardian does not appear to implicate parental child custody arrangements.
although the particular burden imposed on foretich under the act is not precisely identical to any of the burdens historically recognized as punishment,the elizabeth morgan act is not entirely incongruous with historical notions of punishment.first,it is noteworthy that,in past cases,in assessing whether a statute is a bill of attainder,the court has looked to determine whether there is a rational connection between the restriction imposed and a legitimate nonpunitive purpose.for example,in dent west virginia,the court upheld a law imposing certain educational and certification requirements on individuals before they could practice medicine.the court found that such restrictions did not amount to a bill of attainder because they were appropriately related to the medical profession and therefore constituted a reasonable means of ensuring the public safety.id.at.at the court distinguished the statutes invalidated as bills of attainder in cummings and ex parte garland on the ground that the loyalty oaths at issue in those cases bore no relation to the restricted individuals fitness for the pursuits and professions designated.id.at.at discussing cummings,wall.ex parte garland,wall.these early decisions foreshadowed the development of the functional test and reinforce the necessity of a coherent and reasonable nexus between the burden imposed and the benefit to be gained.see nixon,at.at describing historically recognized bills of attainder as deprivations and disabilities so disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends that they unquestionably have been held to fall within the proscription of art.i,emphasis added.
second,the early cases also demonstrate that a statute will be particularly susceptible to invalidation as a bill of attainder where its effect is to mark specified persons with a brand of infamy or disloyalty.see id.at.at noting that laws barring designated individuals from participation in specified professions were a mode of punishment commonly employed against those legislatively branded as disloyal.borrowing from blackstone,the fifth circuit recently discussed the common law concept of attainder limited to sentences of death in terms of the ignominy such laws imposed 
when sentence of death,the most terrible and highest judgment in the laws of england,is pronounced,the immediate inseparable consequence by the common law is attainder.for when it is now clear beyond all dispute,that the criminal is no longer fit to live upon the earth,but is to be exterminated as a monster and a bane to human society,the law sets a note of infamy upon him,puts him out of it sic protection,and takes no farther care of him than barely to see him executed.he is then called attaint,attinctus,stained,or blackened.he is no longer of any credit or reputation 
sbc communications,fcc,cir quoting william blackstone,commentaries.while the prohibition against bills of attainder has evolved far beyond the original context of capital sentences,it continues to focus on legislative enactments that set a note of infamy on the persons to whom the statute applies.see brown,at.at holding that a statute is not a bill of attainder where it incorporates no judgment censuring or condemning any man or group of men emphasis added.
viewed in this light,the elizabeth morgan act,while not squarely within the historical meaning of legislative punishment,is not dissimilar to the types of burdens traditionally recognized as punitive.as our discussion of foretich standing to pursue this lawsuit makes clear,one effect of the act has been that foretich is no longer of any credit or reputation.if anything,the burdens imposed on foretich under the act deprivation of parental rights and the opprobrium of being branded a criminal child abuser may be of even greater magnitude than many of those at issue in the historical cases.if deprivation of the right to hold office in a labor union,see brown,at.at,or to practice a certain profession,see lovett,at.at,can constitute punishment,surely deprivation of foretich right to be with his own daughter on the basis of a legislative determination of criminal sexual abuse also qualifies for that description.a finding that the act constitutes a bill of attainder therefore would not be an inconsistent extension of the historical category.
in any event,even if the act does not fall precisely within the historical meaning of punishment,this conclusion would not preclude a finding that the act constitutes an unconstitutional bill of attainder.case law makes clear that our inquiry is not ended by the determination that the act imposes no punishment traditionally judged to be prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.nixon,at.at.were this not the case,new burdens and deprivations might be legislatively fashioned that are inconsistent with the bill of attainder guarantee.id.for this reason,the category of bills of attainder has continued to evolve and expand.see bellsouth ii,at.we therefore proceed to apply the other criteria for legislative punishment to determine whether the act constitutes an impermissible bill of attainder.see selective serv,at.at to ensure that the legislature has not created an impermissible penalty not previously held to be within the proscription against bills of attainder,we must determine whether the challenged statute can be reasonably said to further nonpunitive goals.
the functional test 
under the second prong of the bill of attainder analysis,we must consider whether the law under challenge,viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed,reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes.nixon,at.at.where such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear,it is reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decisionmakers.id.at.at.under this functional test,the nonpunitive aims must be sufficiently clear and convincing before a court will uphold a disputed statute against a bill of attainder challenge.bellsouth ii,at.
courts have conducted this inquiry by examining both the purported ends of contested legislation and the means employed to achieve those ends.in nixon,the supreme court rejected a bill of attainder challenge to an act directing the administrator of general services to take custody of the presidential papers and tape recordings of former president nixon.at.at.the court found the objectives of the act,which included the need to preserve information necessary to the completion of prosecutions and the desire to safeguard documents of historical significance,to be legitimate justifications for its passage,id.at.at,that did not support an implication of a legislative policy designed to inflict punishment on an individual.id.at.at.in addition,the court noted aspects of the statute designed to protect the rights of the burdened party.id.at.at.the court therefore found the act to be a fair exercise of congress responsibility.id.
more recently,in selective service system,the court examined the constitutionality of a statute denying federal financial aid to male students who failed to register for the draft.at.at.the court first noted that the statute served the nonpunitive legislative goal of encouraging those required to register to do so.id.at.at.the court further examined whether the means employed in the statute conditioning the receipt of federal aid on registration was a rational means of achieving the goal.id.since the group of young men who must register for the draft overlaps in large part with the group of students who are eligible for federal aid,the court found,congress reasonably concluded that the statute would be a strong tonic to many nonregistrants.id.the court also found the scope of the legislation to be relevant under the functional test.id.at.at.that the statute applied equally to unintentional violators,rather than singl ing out intentional nonregistrants,evinced the statute nonpunitive spirit.id.
our own cases have emphasized the need for a legitimate nonpunitive purpose and a rational connection between the burden imposed and nonpunitive purposes of the legislation.in bellsouth ii,we found that the challenged portion of the telecommunications act of did not inflict punishment because it was a rational means of serving a fair and legitimate nonpunitive purpose.see at citing cases indicating the need for a meaningful nexus between the restriction imposed and the legitimate government purpose.we further noted that the differential treatment of the parties specified in the act was neither suggestive of punitive purpose nor particularly suspicious.id.at see also bellsouth i,at finding other portions of the telecommunications act to serve rational and nonpunitive purposes and that the selectivity of the act was quite understandable without resort to inferences of punitive purpose.
by contrast,other cases make clear that where there exists a significant imbalance between the magnitude of the burden imposed and a purported nonpunitive purpose,the statute can not reasonably be said to further nonpunitive purposes.see consol.edison,at holding a statute to be a bill of attainder where the legislature piled on a burden that was obviously disproportionate to the harm caused.
because such an imbalance belies any purported nonpunitive goals,the availability of less burdensome alternatives becomes relevant to the bill of attainder analysis.see nixon,at.at in determining whether a legislature sought to inflict punishment on an individual,it is often useful to inquire into the existence of less burdensome alternatives by which that legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives.seariver,at considering whether there existed any less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its purpose consol.edison,at noting that there were plainly less burdensome alternatives to the law enacted where the legislature made no attempt whatsoever to ensure that the costs imposed on con ed were proportional to the problems that the legislature could legitimately seek to ameliorate.
certain principles emerge from these cases.first,to avoid designation as a bill of attainder,a statute that burdens a particular person or class of persons must serve purposes that are not only nonpunitive,but also rational and fair.see selective serv,at.at nixon,at.at bellsouth ii,at.in addition,as the historical cases foreshadowed,there must be a nexus between the legislative means and legitimate nonpunitive ends.see selective serv,at.at bellsouth ii,at.additionally,a court must weigh the purported nonpunitive purpose of a statute against the magnitude of the burden it inflicts.see nixon,at.at stating that the question under the functional test is whether the law under challenge,viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed,reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes emphasis added.it is not the severity of a statutory burden in absolute terms that demonstrates punitiveness so much as the magnitude of the burden relative to the purported nonpunitive purposes of the statute.a grave imbalance or disproportion between the burden and the purported nonpunitive purpose suggests punitiveness,even where the statute bears some minimal relation to nonpunitive ends.see id.at.at consol.edison,at.
other aspects of a challenged statute also bear on the bill of attainder analysis.for example,the inclusion of protective measures designed to safeguard the rights of the burdened individual or class weighs against a finding that a statute is a bill of attainder.see nixon,at.at.moreover,the selectivity or scope of a statute may indicate punitiveness where the differential treatment of the affected party or parties can not be explained without resort to inferences of punitive purpose.bellsouth i,at see also navegar,united states,cert.denied,d holding that the breadth of a challenged statute indicated that congress was aiming not to punish appellants,but rather to regulate an entire class bellsouth ii,at.finally,the availability of less burdensome alternatives can also cast doubt on purported nonpunitive purposes.see nixon,at.at seariver,at consol.edison,at.to be sure,these considerations are not alone decisive,and congress must have sufficient latitude to choose among competing policy alternatives so that our bill of attainder analysis will not cripple the very process of legislating.nixon,at.at.nevertheless,the presence in a challenged enactment of the features highlighted in these cases undercuts the plausibility of any purported benign purposes and points us toward a finding of punitiveness.
applying these principles to the instant case,we conclude that the elizabeth morgan act constitutes punishment under the functional test.as an initial matter,there can be no doubt as to the magnitude of the burden the act imposes on foretich.by singling out foretich as virtually the only parent subject to the act,congress has permanently associated him with criminal acts of child sexual abuse.the act memorializes a judgment by the united states congress that foretich is guilty of horrific crimes.congress reached this determination despite the repeated and unwavering rejection of such claims by every court that considered them.as a result,the act inflicts significant and costly injury to foretich reputation,while it also takes a significant step toward permanently severing foretich relationship with his own daughter.
the government argues that the act serves the nonpunitive purposes of promoting the best interests of the child,reuniting a family,and facilitating the return of citizens to this country.in the government view,the burden on foretich is merely incidental to legitimate purposes,so the burden does not make the act a bill of attainder.the difficulty with this argument is that the government appears to suggest that it can defend the constitutionality of the statute simply by positing any nonpunitive purpose,regardless of the nature of the burden imposed or the relationship between that burden and the asserted goal.this view is entirely contrary to the prevailing case law noted above.the law is clear that if there exists an extraordinary imbalance between the burden imposed and the alleged nonpunitive purpose,and if the legislative means do not appear rationally to further that alleged purpose,then the statute in question does not escape unconstitutionality merely because the government can assert purposes that superficially appear to be nonpunitive.
what is most noteworthy here is that the government asserted purposes in this case conveniently beg two telling questions why did the protection of hilary best interests require this legislation why were morgan and hilary unable to return safely to this country to reunite with their family before the passage of the act the only plausible answer to each question is that congress believed foretich had abused his daughter and posed a continuing threat to her security and.the purposes the government alleges thus can not be viewed as nonpunitive.
this conclusion is inescapable when it is seen that the particular means congress adopted in this act belie any nonpunitive aim.although it asserts that the act is primarily concerned with promoting the best interests of the child,the government offers no answer to the question of why the best interest standard of the act was not made available in other child custody cases.if the disputed act had been enacted to apply to all pending custody disputes involving children over,this would be a different case.foretich would still have to secure hilary consent before obtaining any visitation with her.however,such a burden,while weighty,could not be viewed as punitive under the bill of attainder clause.
in this case,however,the fact that foretich was singled out for this severe burden belies the claim that congress purposes were nonpunitive.evidently,congress believed that the existing standard ordinarily applied in custody cases was perfectly adequate to protect the best interests of mature minor children in all cases save one,the custody dispute.under the normally applicable standard,a superior court judge must take account of several factors in determining the best interests of the child,including the child own wishes.see code a a.it is only in the case that congress chose to make the child consent determinative.the government asserted at oral argument that this alteration to the standard was necessary to give a mature minor the right to say no,that she does not have to be with someone who she believes abused her.yet,surely there are other mature minors in the district who prefer with good reason to be placed in the custody of one parent rather than the other.apparently,in congress view,the best interests of those other children are adequately served by the existing standard.in light of the act narrow applicability,the government asserted purposes are simply implausible.it is the relative imbalance between the burden in this case and the implausible nonpunitive purposes that compels us toward a finding of punitiveness.
the government responds that a statute is not punishment merely because congress could have written it more broadly.it is true that underinclusiveness or specificity,alone,do not render a statute an unconstitutional bill of attainder.the statute must also inflict punishment.see nixon,at.at brown,at.at.nevertheless,narrow application of a statute to a specific person or class of persons raises suspicion,because the bill of attainder clause is principally concerned with t he singling out of an individual for legislatively prescribed punishment.selective serv,at.at quoting communist party subversive activities control,d emphasis added.therefore,the functional test necessarily takes account of the scope or selectivity of a statute in assessing the plausibility of alleged nonpunitive purposes.see selective serv,at.at navegar,at bellsouth ii,at bellsouth i,at.unlike our previous cases,the instant case is one in which the narrow focus of the disputed act can not be explained without resort to inferences of punitive purpose.bellsouth i,at.
in this case,it is the act specificity that renders the asserted nonpunitive purposes suspect.and it is the act specificity that creates the injury to foretich reputation.if the act applied in all custody disputes,its provisions for dealing with allegations of sexual abuse would not cast aspersions on any particular person.but as the government concedes,the act targets only foretich.as a consequence,the act officially associates foretich with criminal sexual abuse because it implies that his daughter alone needs special protections.whereas the statute at issue in nixon created a legitimate class of one,at.at,and served significant public purposes beyond the burdens inflicted on former president nixon,the elizabeth morgan act creates a vilified class of one with no attendant nonpunitive purposes.accordingly,we find that the act imposes punishment under the functional test because it can not reasonably be said to further nonpunitive purposes.
motivational test 
the final test of legislative punishment is strictly a motivational one inquiring whether the legislative record evinces a congressional intent to punish.nixon,at.under this prong,a court must inspect legislation for a congressional purpose to encroach on the judicial function of punishing an individual for blameworthy offenses.id.at.at.courts conduct this inquiry by reference to legislative history,the context or timing of the legislation,or specific aspects of the text or structure of the disputed legislation.see selective serv,at.at nixon,at.at.
given the obvious constraints on the usefulness of legislative history as an indicator of congress collective purpose,this prong by itself is not determinative in the absence of unmistakable evidence of punitive intent.selective serv,at.at quoting flemming nestor,d.s everal isolated statements are not sufficient to evince punitive intent,bellsouth ii,at quoting selective serv,at.at,and can not render a statute a bill of attainder without any other indicia of punishment.evidence in the legislative history can bolster our conclusion,however,where other factors suggest punitiveness.see lovett,at.at,finding an employment ban to constitute a bill of attainder where committee reports characterized the affected persons as subversive and unfit for government service nixon,at.at finding no bill of attainder where the relevant committee reports cast no aspersions on appellant personal conduct and contain ed no condemnation of his behavior as meriting the infliction of punishment.
in this case,the legislative history is replete with evidence that the statutory purpose of the elizabeth morgan act was to correct an injustice and take sides in a notorious custody dispute.hearing at,statement of molinari.the focus of the act and the unusual committee hearing in consideration of the bill demonstrate that the legislative process in this case amounted to precisely that which the bill of attainder clause was designed to prevent a congressional determination of blameworthiness and infliction of punishment.see nixon,at.at brown,at.at deveau braisted,d.for example,the chairman of the subcommittee spoke with apparent passion and sympathy for hilary foretich and stated that he sponsored the bill because he knew how it feels to be filled with pain as a child.hearing at,statement of davis.other members agreed that the act was necessary to bring justice and satisfaction to one little girl who can only be claimed as a victim.hearing at,statement of molinari.members of the subcommittee also expressed contempt for the superior court handling of the case.the act would provide a way of deal ing with the inadequacies of the court system,so that by bringing justice to this family,congress can send an inspiring call to judges all over this country.see also hearing at,statement of wolf i do know why superior court judge dixon did do anything what is wrong with them hearing at,statement of morella the original court order on this case is clearly outdated,and no longer addresses ellen best interest,if it ever did.
the government invites us to conclude that congress purposes were entirely benign on the basis of statements in the legislative record disclaiming any judgment as to whether foretich had indeed abused his daughter.see,hearing at.aside from the fact that these statements appear conveniently,the supreme court has made clear that a formal legislative announcement of moral blameworthiness or punishment is not necessary to an unlawful bill of attainder.nixon,at.at.all that is necessary is that the legislative process and the law it produces indicate a congressional purpose to behave like a court and to censure or condemn.see brown,at.at.
the attempt by the act sponsors to broker a deal with foretich for him to relinquish his parental rights removes any doubt that congress purpose in this case was to assume the role of a judicial tribunal and impose its own determinations of who was or was not a fit parent.see hearing at,statement of davis would you agree to vacate the order if you do that,there obviously no need for a bill.see also hearing at.that congress would not have enacted the act if foretich had voluntarily vacated the visitation orders reveals the true purpose behind the act.whether through negotiation or legislation,congress purpose was to overturn the superior court orders so that foretich could have no contact with his daughter.this legislative history alone can
