the parents of minors and appeal from the juvenile court order terminating their parental rights.welf.inst.code.father father contends the order must be reversed because the trial court failed to comply with the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act of et icwa.mother joins in that argument.she also contends the order must be reversed because minor is not adoptable,and because the sibling bond exception to adoption applies.we reject mother separate contentions but reverse for icwa error.
combined statement of case and facts 
initial detention,jurisdiction and disposition 
age two,and,age four,were detained after their parents residence was raided by the mendocino major crimes task force on june.on june,the mendocino county health human services agency,children and family services agency filed a section petition against both parents alleging,among other things,that the parents were engaged in marijuana cultivation and other illegal activity and were unable to meet the children basic needs,including a safe and home.both parents were alleged to have substance abuse problems that made them unable to care properly for their children,and father was in mendocino county jail.following argument,the parents submitted on the agency report for detention and the children were ordered detained.
at the jurisdiction hearing on july,the parties agreed to certain amendments to the petition,then mother and father submitted on the amended allegations and the court found the amended allegations true.the boys were placed together in a shelter home.father remained in county jail.at the disposition hearing on august,the court ordered the children to be returned to mother under a family maintenance plan.
section petition,joint hearing,and review.
on october,the agency filed a supplemental petition after mother was arrested in another task force raid in which drug paraphernalia and honey oil were found within the children reach on the property.the children were detained.on november,a joint jurisdictional and dispositional hearing was held,and parents submitted on the reports.both parents were in custody.mother was ordered into reunification services.
on april,father services were terminated for lack of compliance and because he would be serving a state prison sentence.mother was also in custody and her services were terminated for lack of compliance and inability to have the children returned to her by the review.visitation for parents was set at one time per month if allowed by their respective penal institutions.over mother objection,visitation was terminated on july,due to the distance between the parents custodial settings and the children.mother was at the central california women facility in chowchilla and father was at san quentin state prison.
section hearings 
the agency filed a report recommending termination of parental rights and an adoption report finding both children adoptable on july.at the hearing held on august,adoptions specialist janice milthaler testified in favor of the children adoptability.parents offered no evidence.the court found both children adoptable,but did not terminate parental rights at that time because no adoptive families had been as yet identified.
the agency filed a second report recommending termination of parental rights and an adoption report finding both children adoptable.adoptive families for each child had been identified.at a hearing on february,the court found the exception to adoption for sibling bond preservation did not apply and terminated parental rights.
the minors possible wailaki native american ancestry was first noted by the agency in the initial petition based on mother report,the detention summary stated father had native american heritage with a wailaki tribe,and mother had no indian ancestry.at the detention hearing,father attorney informed the court that father had provided to the social worker a completed form indicating he had both wailaki and pomo heritage.mother attorney stated she had no native american ancestry.however,on june,mother completed an icwa parent history chart indicating she was the minors biological parent,born in new mexico,and had potential mohawk ancestry through her deceased grandmother,kristen,who was born on june,possibly in.she provided a phone number and address for her grandfather,who was still alive.she also claimed mohawk ancestry through her,joseph of mcnabb ranch,who also was alive.
on june,father signed an form parental notification of indian status,averring under penalty of perjury he is or may be a member of,or eligible for membership in,the wailaki and pomo tribes.the signed by father was filed with the court on june,father completed an icwa parent history chart indicating he was the biological father of the minors,born in covelo,and was enrolled as a child in the round valley tribe.he claimed indian ancestry through his father,steve,whom he had never met but believed was possibly a member of the covelo tribe.he listed the name,date of birth,address and phone number for his adoptive mother,who had no known tribal affiliation,and who was listed as one of the persons giving information.
in the jurisdictional report filed july,the agency noted mother possible wailaki and mohawk ancestry and father possible native american ancestry with the round valley band of pomo indians,and indicated it had noticed the bureau of indian affairs bia,the secretary of the interior,and the mohawk,wailaki,and round valley tribes.
on july,the agency mailed notices of the dispositional hearing to be held on august,to the sacramento area director of the bia,the secretary of the interior in washington,kenneth wright,president of the round valley tribe pomo indians in covelo,california donald arnold,chairperson of the scotts valley rancheria,in lakeport,california pomo indians,ronald kirk,chairman of the grindstone rancheria in elk creek,california and paul thompson,ronald lafrance,and randy hart,chiefs of the regis mohawk tribe in akwesasne,new york.as of august,signed receipts for certified mail had been returned from all notified parties except the secretary of the interior.as of the disposition hearing on august,only the pomo indians of the scotts valley band had returned a determinative response to the icwa notice.they reported they would not intervene in the dependency proceedings neither mother,father,nor the minors were enrolled members of the tribe and e nrollment is a prerequisite for membership under scotts valley tribal law and custom.
on september,the agency mailed notices of the icwa review hearing to be held on september,to the sacramento area director of the bia,the secretary of the interior,kenneth wright of the round valley band of pomo indians,ronald kirk of the grindstone rancheria,and the chiefs of the regis mohawk tribe,at the addresses noted above.on september,the agency received a letter from the saint regis mohawk tribe indicating the tribal clerk office had researched the names of the biological parents and other listed relatives and had been unable to find any link of tribal affiliation therefore,the minors were not enrolled or eligible for enrollment with the tribe and no further notices to the tribe were required.
on october,the court found days had elapsed from the time notice had been given to the wailaki and round valley pomo and no determinative response from them had been received.since the mohawk tribe and scotts valley band of pomo indians had responded the minors were not eligible for membership in those tribes,icwa did not apply to the case unless further evidence of the applicability of icwa was later received.at both section hearings,the court found icwa did not apply.
discussion 
icwa notice 
it is undisputed that no pomo indian tribes or bands other than the round valley and scotts valley bands were noticed.parents argue the order terminating parental rights must be reversed because the trial court and the agency did not comply with icwa and state law by sending notices to all of the tribes or bands of pomo indians,as required by in re th the agency relies on in re edward th edward,which held that notice to some but not all possible tribes in which a dependent child may be eligible for membership does not violate the icwa provided the bureau of indian affairs also receives notice edward,at.
congress enacted icwa in to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.in re damian th.icwa reflects a congressional determination that it is in the best interests of indian children to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations.in re kadence th,kadence.pursuant to title united states code section a,in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a similarly provides that if the court,a social worker,or a probation officer knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,notice to the tribe shall be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested.notice is a key component of the congressional goal to protect and preserve indian tribes and indian families.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under icwa irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.in re alice th,alice.
california has the second largest indian population in the country.in re abbigail cal th,abbigail,citing of the interior,bia,american indian population and labor force report,native americans.according to the california department of social services cdss,this includes bands and rancherias affiliated with the pomo tribe nevertheless,in,due to persistent noncompliance with icwa abbigail,at,legislation was enacted to incorporate icwa requirements into california statutory law in re cal th,see.these provisions affirm icwa purposes citation and mandate compliance with icwa.isaiah,supra,cal th at.
in edward,supra,th,after the father indicated he had reason to believe he belonged to a tribe out of arkansas,inquiry was made and notice was sent to two choctaw tribes and the bia.id.at.neither the tribes nor the bia declared the children to be indian children under icwa,and at the section hearing the trial court found icwa did not apply.on appeal from the termination of his parental rights,father argued a third choctaw tribe should have been notified.as noted,the edward court held notice to the bia was sufficient.at the time,former california rules of court rule f required notice to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership.however,the court declined to follow the rule because it did not track the federal statutory language on this issue.edward,at.federal law required notice to the indian child tribe a and authorized service of notice upon the secretary of the interior i f the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined edward,at,italics added.under the statutory scheme,the burden of identifying and providing notice to the proper tribe in these circumstances shifts from the state court to the secretary,who presumably has resources and skill with which to ferret out the necessary information.ibid.since,in the court view,the identity of the actual choctaw tribe in which the children might be eligible for membership was unknown,the bia as well as an indian tribe was authorized to conclusively determine whether a child is an indian.ibid.
edward was decided well before the enactment of the legislation that governs this case,and the court in declined to follow edward i n light of this superseding legislation,supra,th at see alice,supra,th at following.in,the mother identified possible sioux and cherokee ancestry.authorized federal and california lists identified three cherokee tribes and sioux tribes,at.the bureau of children and family services argued that service of the notices on the bia was sufficient because the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined a.looking to the purpose and notice requirements of the then recently enacted statutes codifying icwa as a feature of state law under senate bill reg,ch,and to preexisting rules of court and court opinions,the court concluded that notice must be sent to all of the sioux tribes.the court reasoned that section had incorporated former rule requirement of notice to all tribes of which the minor may be a member or eligible for membership.section,subdivision d had adopted the federal requirement that heightened state law standards shall prevail over more lenient icwa requirements.and sections,subdivision a and subdivision a imposed an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire about a minor potential indian ancestry,required notice if the court knows or has reason to know the child is or may be an indian child,and mandated varied biographical data be included on the notice forms,at.
in alice,supra,th,the mother answered american indian,in response to a question on the parental notification of indian status form asking if the minor child is or may be a member of,or eligible for membership in,a federally recognized indian tribe.id.at.notices were sent to all federally recognized navajo and apache tribes,but the court of appeal determined the notices did not meet the requirements of federal or state law.id.at.
the court also held that notice to the bia was not an adequate substitute for inadequate notice to the tribes.section,subdivision a,effective january,requires that notice be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership,until the court makes a determination as to which tribe is the child tribe in a case such as this,the language of subdivision a must be construed as requiring notice to all federally recognized tribes within the general umbrella identified by the child parents or relatives.based on the information provided by appellant,all recognized apache tribes are tribes of which alice may be a member,even if the family precise tribal affiliation,if any,has not been determined.as the first district court of appeal concluded in in re,supra,th,the statutory adoption of the higher standard in section prevails over more lenient icwa requirements and undermines the rationale of edward h.the application of the broader all tribes requirement,which may be viewed as more protective of the tribes than the icwa requirement,is supported by statute.subdivision d of section states that i n any case in which this code or other applicable state or federal law provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of the indian child tribe,than the rights provided under icwa,the court shall apply the higher standard.we therefore conclude that notice to the bia is not an adequate substitute,in this case,for notice to all federally recognized apache tribes.alice,supra,th at.
the agency argues that our supreme court opinion in abbigail,supra,cal th has breathed new life into edward,effectively overruling.we disagree.abbigail involved the validity of former rule c.at that time,the rule provided if after notice has been provided as required by federal and state law a tribe responds indicating that the child is eligible for membership if certain steps are followed,the court must proceed as if the child is an indian child and direct the appropriate individual or agency to provide active efforts to secure tribal membership for the child.abbigail,supra,cal th at,first italics added,second italics in original.in abbigail,the children biological and presumed father informed the court he believed he had cherokee ancestry.to obtain the information necessary to determine whether abbigail and justin were indian children to whom icwa applied,the court ordered the department of health and human services dhhs to notify the relevant tribes pursuant to federal and state law.see a welf.inst.code,subd.a.abbigail,supra,cal th at,italics added.one of these tribes,the cherokee nation,informed dhhs the children were eligible for enrollment and affiliation with the cherokee nation by virtue of their direct lineage to father,an enrolled member.cal th at.however,the children were not indian children under federal law because neither biological parent was a member.abbigail,at.the cherokee nation recommended applying all the protections of icwa to this matter from the beginning of the case to prevent future delays if or when the parents or become enrolled members.ibid.
the father informed the trial court he intended to apply for membership.over the dhss objection,the trial court stated it would proceed as if the children were indian children to whom icwa applied,and directed the dhhs and counsel to make reasonable efforts to secure tribal membership for the children.the court held jurisdictional and dispositional hearings that complied with both state and federal law,assumed jurisdiction,and placed the children with their maternal grandmother,which placement also complied with icwa.b i.abbigail,supra,cal th at.dhhs appeal challenged the validity of former rule c and rule c,and argued the court erred by proceeding as if icwa applied and directing the agency to make efforts to secure tribal membership for the children.dhss did not challenge the court jurisdictional or dispositional orders.ibid.
the supreme court concluded rule c was invalid as a matter of state law because t he primary objective of senate bill,which incorporated icwa requirements and definitional provisions into california statutory law,was to increase compliance with icwa.citations.nothing in the bill language or history demonstrates the legislature intended to apply icwa requirements to,or require membership applications be made on behalf of,children who are not indian children as defined in icwa.instead,the legislature left cases not involving indian children subject to the statutes generally applicable in dependency proceedings.rule c is inconsistent with those statutes.abbigail,supra,cal th at.
one of several arguments rejected by the court was father argument that section,subdivision d higher standard of protection afforded by section,subdivision d validated rule c.the court observed section,like the related federal statutes,speaks only to the rights of persons and tribes connected with an indian child.welf.inst.code,subd.d,italics added.section can not reasonably be understood to authorize the adoption of,or require deference to,a rule purporting to apply icwa requirements in cases involving children who are not indian children.by analogy,another court has explained that icwa minimum federal standards language refers to the removal of indian children,it does not refer to the definition of an indian child.citations.n othing in icwa suggests that the definition of indian child is a minimum federal standard.abbigail,supra,cal th at.
by contrast,the court found rule c was valid because it did not direct the court to act as if a child were an indian child,but rather spoke only to the court obligations in a case involving an indian child as defined by law.read in this manner,according to its plain language,the rule is not inconsistent with any state statute implementing icwa.abbigail,supra,cal th at.the court also clarified that the trial court was free to direct that steps be taken to pursue tribal membership for a child who,while not a member of a tribe,is already an indian child to whom icwa applies because he or she is both eligible for membership and also the biological child of a member.id.at.
because notice had already been given to the cherokee nation in accordance with federal and state law,questions concerning what kind of information triggers a duty of inquiry and notice,or to whom notice must be given,or whether the notice given was proper or sufficient,were not before the court in abbigail c ases are not authority for propositions not considered.people alvarez cal th.
furthermore,this case,unlike abbigail,does not involve the validity of a rule of court under state law.at issue here is one of the very statutes enacted to ensure compliance with icwa,namely,section,which expressly provides that whenever the court,a social worker,or probation officer knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,any notice sent in an indian child custody proceeding under this code shall be sent to c all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership,until the court makes a determination as to which tribe is the child tribe,after which notice need only be sent to the tribe determined to be the indian child tribe,subd.a,italics added.section is in line with the bia recently revised guidelines for state courts and agencies in indian child custody proceedings,which supersede and replace the guidelines published at federal register.see of the interior,bureau of indian affairs,guidelines for state courts and agencies in indian child custody proceedings,bia guidelines.
finally,to extend the rationale of abbigail to icwa notice requirements makes no sense.the purpose of icwa notice requirements is to identify children who are indian children,and,if a child is identified as an indian child,give the tribe or tribes in which the child is a member or may be eligible for membership advance notice of pending dependency proceedings so they may intervene in the proceedings or assert jurisdiction over the child as the tribe or tribes deem fit.see isaiah,supra,cal th at icwa notice requirement,which is also codified in california law,enables a tribe to determine whether the child is an indian child and,if so,whether to intervene in or exercise jurisdiction over the proceeding.nothing in abbigail suggests that section gives tribes heightened protections not otherwise afforded by federal law,that section is inconsistent with federal law,or that has been overruled sub silentio.
this point is underscored by isaiah,supra,cal th,decided one week before abbigail,which does discuss notice issues.isaiah was removed from his parents at birth and placed in foster care.cal th at.although the mother indicated she may have indian ancestry id.at,and the department developed information indicating isaiah grandfather may have had blackfoot ancestry and his may have been a member of the cherokee tribe,the court concluded the possibility isaiah was an indian child was too attenuated and remote to warrant notice to tribes or the bia.ibid.
the mother did not appeal from the dispositional order or object to or appeal from the court icwa finding.isaiah,supra,cal th at.a year later,the court terminated the mother parental rights and again ruled it had no reason to know that isaiah was an indian child.the mother appealed the court termination of her parental rights,arguing the trial court had reason to know isaiah was an indian child but failed to comply with icwa notice requirements.id.at.the court of appeal found mother was foreclosed from raising that issue on appeal from the order terminating her parental rights because she had failed to timely appeal from the court icwa finding and dispositional order.cal th at.the supreme court reversed,holding that b ecause icwa imposes on the juvenile court a continuing duty to inquire whether the child is an indian child,the parent may challenge a finding of icwa inapplicability in an appeal from the subsequent order,even if she did not raise such a challenge in an appeal from the initial order.cal th at.
isaiah holding rests on the centrality of icwa notice requirements.icwa establishes minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture.isaiah,supra,cal th at.these minimum standards include the requirement of notice to indian tribes in any involuntary proceeding in state court to place a child in foster care or to terminate parental rights where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved.a.icwa notice requirements serve two purposes.first,they facilitate a determination of whether the child is an indian child under icwa.defining indian child as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.second,icwa notice ensures that an indian tribe is aware of its right to intervene in or,where appropriate,exercise jurisdiction over a child custody proceeding involving an indian child.isaiah,at,italics added.
a juvenile court has an affirmative and continuing duty in all dependency proceedings to inquire into a child indian status,subd.a.if a court determines it has reason to know a child is an indian child,the court must notify the bia and any relevant tribe so that the tribe may determine the child status and decide whether to intervene.if adequate and proper notice has been given,and if neither the bia nor any tribe provides a determinative response within days,then the court may determine that icwa does not apply to the proceedings,subd.e.at that point,the court is relieved of its duties of inquiry and notice,subd.b,unless the bia or a tribe subsequently confirms that the child is an indian child,subd.e notice must be provided where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved a,and section,subdivision b sets forth a nonexhaustive list of circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child.importantly,t he relevant question is not whether the evidence supports a finding that the minor is an indian child it is whether the evidence triggers the notice requirement of icwa so that the tribes themselves may make that determination.citation.after proper notice has been given,if the tribes respond that the minor is not a member or not eligible for membership,or if neither the bia nor any tribe provides a determinative response within days,then the court may find that icwa does not apply to the proceedings.at that point,the court is relieved of its duties of inquiry and notice unless the bia or a tribe subsequently confirms that the child is an indian child.to maintain stability in placements of children in juvenile proceedings,it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice and examining thoroughly whether the juvenile is an indian child.isaiah,at,citing in re th.isaiah strict compliance with icwa notice requirement enforces our view abbigail did not intend to call holding into question.
in this case,the information provided by parents concerning the minors potential indian ancestry was sufficient to trigger a duty of inquiry and notice under both state and federal law.see kadence,supra,th at and cases cited therein.no one argues otherwise,and the trial court found it sufficient to require notice to two of tribes.in light of the authorities examined above,the trial court erred in failing to require notice to the remaining tribes.
when the record shows noncompliance with icwa notice requirements,the remedy is a limited remand to the juvenile court with directions to direct the agency to comply with the notice provisions of icwa.upon remand the juvenile court shall direct the agency to send icwa notice to all unnoticed tribes in accordance with icwa and california law.the agency shall thereafter notify the court of its actions and file certified mail,return receipts for any icwa notices that were sent,together with any responses received.the court shall then determine whether the icwa inquiry and notice requirements have been satisfied and whether and are indian children.if the court finds they are indian children,the court shall conduct a new permanency planning hearing,as well as all further proceedings,in compliance with icwa and related california law.if,after proper notice,the court finds that and are not indian children,the order terminating parental rights and selecting adoption as the permanent plan shall be reinstated.
ii.adoptability 
the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that minor is both generally and specifically adoptable.mother argues the court finding of adoptability for is not supported by clear and convincing evidence because neither the adoption assessment,nor the rest of the record in this case,establish that this child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.we disagree.
the juvenile court may terminate parental rights only if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely the child will be adopted within a reasonable time,subd.c in re jennilee th.clear and convincing evidence requires a finding of high probability.the evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.it must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.in re jerome th.
a determination of adoptability is reviewed for substantial evidence.in re th,in re lukas th.if,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the juvenile court,we must uphold those findings.we do not pass on the credibility of witnesses,attempt to resolve conflicts in the evidence or weigh the evidence.citations.rather,our task is to determine whether there is substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find,by clear and convincing evidence,that the minor is adoptable.citation.the appellant has the burden of showing there is no evidence of a sufficiently substantial nature to support the finding or order,at in re th.
the issue of adoptability requires the court to focus on the child,and whether the child age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt.citations.it is not necessary that the child already be placed in a preadoptive home,or that a proposed adoptive parent be waiting.citations.however,there must be convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will take place within a reasonable time.in re brian th.the fact that the child is not yet placed in a preadoptive home nor with a relative or foster family who is prepared to adopt the child,shall not constitute a basis for the court to conclude that it is not likely the child will be adopted,subd.c.if the child is in a preadoptive home,but is generally adoptable,questions concerning the suitability of the prospective adoptive parents are irrelevant and impermissible in a section hearing,supra,th at in re carl th,carl in re scott th,scott.rather,a caregiver willingness to adopt serves as further evidence the minor is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time either by the caregiver or by some other family,at,italics omitted.the statutory scheme requires the agency to provide the court with a preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of the prospective adoptive parents for the section hearing.that assessment includes a social history,screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect,together with an assessment of the capability of the prospective adoptive parents to meet the child needs,and whether they understand the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption.carl,at.
mother argues that autism diagnosis and related behavioral issues have made it difficult for the agency to find appropriate services for him,created problems for his caregivers,required constant monitoring and a high level of care,and resulted in a number of placement changes.mother also launches an attack on the prospective parent suitability as a foster parent.she notes the prospective parent already has five disabled adopted children,has three caregivers to help her take care of them,and once made a mistake about nighttime medications,which she rectified when it was brought to her attention.further,due to licensing issues,which were subsequently cleared up,previously had to leave her home.however,if the child is considered generally adoptable,we do not examine the suitability of the prospective adoptive home.scott,supra,th at.given the court finding of general adoptability,whether was also specifically adoptable by a particular person is irrelevant.scott,at in re sarah,supra,th at in re th.
in any event,these facts were disclosed to the court and considered by the social worker and the adoptions specialist who recommended the court find adoptable.the first section repor
