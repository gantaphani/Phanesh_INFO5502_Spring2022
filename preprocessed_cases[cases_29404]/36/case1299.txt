in this consolidated appeal,barbara grandmother appeals from two juvenile court orders entered on june,and august,denying her petitions for disclosure of the juvenile court records of her grandson,anthony grandmother seeks disclosure of her grandson juvenile records under welfare and institutions code section for purposes of prosecuting her federal civil action against riverside county,the riverside department of social services dpss,and two dpss social workers defendants.grandmother contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying her two records disclosure petitions.
we find no abuse of discretion in the juvenile court june order since proceedings to determine the records disclosure matter were pending in the federal court.however,the juvenile court erred in denying grandmother august records disclosure petition on the ground the federal court had decided the matter.to the contrary,the federal court appropriately refused to decide whether any of the records could be disclosed.the federal court concluded the juvenile court had exclusive authority under section to determine the matter.since neither the juvenile court nor federal court decided grandmother first or second petitions,or defendants petition on the merits,grandmother august petition third petition for records disclosure was not barred by res judicata.
the juvenile court august,order denying grandmother august records disclosure petition is reversed,with directions to the juvenile court to decide grandmother petition on the merits.the juvenile court june,order denying grandmother second petition is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
on august,grandmother and anthony plaintiffs filed in federal district court a complaint,first amended complaint,and second amended complaint complaint against defendants.the civil lawsuit contains causes of action for violation of federal civil rights,conspiracy,fraud,deceit and misrepresentation,violation of state constitutional rights,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
plaintiffs alleged in the complaint that their state and federal constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were violated during the juvenile dependency proceedings.anthony was removed from their care and placed for adoption allegedly in violation of their rights to care for and adopt him.plaintiffs claim defendants submitted false social worker reports to the court,fabricated evidence,omitted material facts,and misled plaintiffs concerning material facts regarding the juvenile dependency proceedings.
plaintiffs allege in their complaint the following facts.anthony was born in september.until he was taken into protective custody in november,he lived with his mother and plaintiffs.grandmother was his primary caretaker.
in october,a passerby found anthony,who was two years old,walking unattended down the driveway of his home.the passerby took anthony to the door of his home,left him with his family,and notified the dpss.a dpss social worker went to anthony residence and spoke to mother.mother stated that she had left anthony in his care.she admitted she was a recovering addict.
the dpss removed anthony from his home and filed a dependency petition.the court declared anthony a dependent of the juvenile court,and in december,placed him with mother in a residential treatment program.mother,however,was forced to leave the rehabilitation center within a few days due to threatening one of her counselors.a social worker called grandmother at work and told her to pick up anthony.she said she would as soon as she got off work.the dpss,however,reported grandmother said she would not pick up anthony and therefore the dpss placed anthony in foster care.
the dpss social worker asked grandmother to adopt anthony but grandmother felt adoption was premature since reunification with mother was still possible.grandmother said she would like legal guardianship of anthony but the social worker said he had to be adopted.unfortunately,shortly thereafter,mother was incarcerated.grandmother claims she told the social worker that,if mother lost custody,she would adopt anthony.nevertheless,in may,anthony was moved to a nonrelative preadoption home.
grandmother filed a section motion and motion for de facto parent status but the court denied her motions.in september,grandmother appealed the ruling,and did not prevail.meanwhile,in october,the juvenile court terminated mother parental rights.
in march,grandmother filed a petition to adopt anthony but her petition was denied and,in june,he was legally adopted by his current foster family.
in furtherance of prosecuting grandmother federal lawsuit,in january,she filed a petition for disclosure of anthony juvenile dependency records under section first petition.grandmother asserted that she needed the records to pursue her federal action.the juvenile court summarily denied the petition.
in february,defendants filed in juvenile court a similar petition for disclosure of anthony juvenile dependency records on the grounds the records were necessary for defendants to provide a defense in the federal lawsuit.anthony adoptive parents opposed the petition on the ground that disclosing his records would cause irreparable harm to anthony and his relationship with them since they were the only parents he knew.he had lived with them for nearly three years,since he was two and a half.
the juvenile court set defendants petition for a hearing on march.during the hearing,counsel for defendants informed the court that the dpss was not opposed to the juvenile court releasing under seal anthony juvenile court file to the district court for review.the district court judge could then determine which records were relevant to the pending federal action and should be disclosed.the court accordingly ordered anthony juvenile dependency records released under seal to judge phillips of the federal district court for review and determination as to which records should be released.the court further ordered the records returned under seal to the juvenile court upon completion of the federal proceeding.
on march,the juvenile court forwarded anthony records to the federal district court.upon receipt of the records,judge phillips permitted the parties to file motions regarding disclosure of the records.grandmother sought the records for use during pretrial discovery,pretrial motions,and as evidence during the trial.defendants sought access to the records for the purpose of defending themselves in the federal action.
meanwhile,in may,grandmother again petitioned in juvenile court for disclosure of anthony records second petition.on june,the juvenile court summarily denied the petition on the ground the court already released juvenile file to judge phillips.
on june,grandmother appealed the june,order denying her petition for disclosure.anthony did not appeal the ruling and are not parties to this appeal.
on july,judge phillips denied the parties request to release anthony juvenile court file,and ordered the file returned under seal to the juvenile dependency court.judge phillips noted in her written statement of decision that under section,the juvenile court is vested with exclusive authority to decide whether to disclose juvenile records to third parties.acknowledging principles of strong federal court deference to state court determinations in juvenile dependency matters,judge phillips explained in her written decision that principles of comity and federalism advise against the release of the information at issue,and plaintiffs offer no authority which suggests that any court,other than the juvenile court,may release confidential juvenile records to the parties in a civil action.in light of the significant interests involved,the court will not assume this authority.
in august,grandmother filed in state court her third petition for disclosure of anthony juvenile dependency records third petition.the court summarily denied the petition on the ground the matter was already released and reviewed by federal court judge.
on september,grandmother appealed the august,order.this court ordered consolidated grandmother appeals of the june,and au
