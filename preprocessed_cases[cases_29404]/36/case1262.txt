tamika has been a dependent child of the juvenile court placed in foster care almost her entire life.the kern county department of human services department filed a petition seeking to terminate dependency after tamika reached the age of majority.the department basis for termination was to relieve itself of the increased financial obligation that must be borne by the department when a dependent child reaches the age of.tamika,through her counsel,objected to the termination of dependency because she wished to remain a dependent child of the court until she completed her high school education,scheduled for june of.the trial court terminated dependency.tamika appeals from this order,claiming the trial court erred in terminating her dependency.
we must determine if it would be in tamika best interests to remain a dependent until she graduates from high school,or if the department stated desire to save money is sufficient to override tamika best interests.we reverse.

a hearing was held on march.the court indicated it had read the report of february.tamika was present at the hearing and,although her usual counsel was not present,tamika was represented by substitute counsel for the hearing.counsel stated that tamika was opposed to the dismissal of dependency and wanted to complete high school.counsel stated he believed it would be in tamika best interest for the court to continue dependency in her case.counsel emphasized that tamika intended to participate in her schooling and she had a serious desire to complete high school.counsel offered to have tamika testify about her seriousness in wanting to complete her schooling.
the court asked to be educated and asked if tamika is disqualified from continuing jurisdiction because she would graduate after her birthday.tamika counsel stated that the court can maintain jurisdiction until the age of.
the court asked the department for its position on the matter.counsel for the department stated the department recommendation is that the matter be dismissed at this time because she would graduate after her birthday.
if jurisdiction is continued for a child under extremely unusual circumstances until the child is years of age then the department bears the full financial responsibility of maintaining that child with federal and state assistance to,between and,and it highly unusual circumstances when that ever happens.
now,she has action here.that is why gilliam and i met with the school counselor and the child,or the young lady,to find out whether or not she could graduate in the fall of this year which would be before her birthday and be maintained in the foster care system until that time.but it her election to graduate with her class in june.
counsel representing tamika at the hearing stated he did not know a lot about the plan to have tamika graduate early because he was not her usual counsel.he offered to put tamika on the stand and ask her questions about her graduation plans or the court could continue the matter until her counsel got back.
the court stated it did not want to put tamika on the stand without a full awareness of the consequences to her.the court stated that someone should talk to tamika about the consequences of continuing with the plan of graduating in.the court continued the matter.
at the outset of the continued hearing,the court stated that the purpose of continuing the hearing was to give counsel and tamika an opportunity to further consider whether she wants to graduate from,on her,after her birthday.tamika usual counsel represented her at the hearing.she stated that tamika was already in rsv classes,which are classes for slow children.she said it would get tamika nowhere to expect her to complete school in an abbreviated fashion.counsel pointed out that tamika is in school,she is participating,and she is doing very well.counsel argued that tamika should be able to finish out high school with the class she is familiar with.counsel argued it would not be to tamika advantage to have her dependency jurisdiction terminated now.counsel acknowledged that funding is a problem when a child becomes years old,but the court needs to look at the best interests of the child in making its decision.
the court asked for additional comments.the attorney representing the county commented as follows i stated my position last time that to maintain jurisdiction beyond the child birthday there has to be extremely unusual circumstances that do appear to be present here.and the total financial burden would fall to the department of human services with no assistance from the federal government or the state.
the court terminated the dependency.it found that all requirements were met.in addition it stated,the child is not to graduate before her birthday and t he court finds no extenuating circumstances that would cause the department to continue that jurisdiction at this time.
tamika appeals.
discussion 
the court may retain jurisdiction over any person who is found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court until the ward or dependent child attains the age of years.tamika contends the trial court abused its discretion when it terminated her dependency after she reached the age of majority but before she graduated from high school.
we have numerous concerns about what occurred in this case we begin with the burden of proof.the burden of proof on the issue of termination rests with the party seeking to terminate jurisdiction.in re robert th,d in re holly th,d.in determining whether to terminate jurisdiction over a child in foster care,the issue to be addressed is the best interest of the child.in re robert,supra,at,d in re holly,supra,at,d.
contrary to the law,the department came up with its own burden of proof requiring extremely unusual circumstances to maintain jurisdiction and,rather than looking at the best interests of the child,utilized as its reason for termination protection of its sacred dollars.the trial court apparently adopted the department newly invented burden of proof when it stated,the court finds no extenuating circumstances that would cause the department to continue that jurisdiction at this time.
the department and the court turned the burden of proof on its head,requiring extenuating or unusual reasons presumably to be brought forth by tamika to maintain jurisdiction,rather than requiring the department to prove that termination of jurisdiction was in the best interests of the child.for this reason alone the judgment must be reversed.
in addition,the trial court found that a ll requirements have been met.one of the requirements that must be met before dependency jurisdiction over a child who has reached the age of majority may be terminated is satisfying section.section was enacted in and is a checklist of things that the department must furnish with some exceptions to a minor who has reached the age of majority before dependency jurisdiction can be terminated.the purpose of section was to reverse a disturbing trend of foster youth being emancipated before they are ready to live independently.the author of section noted e very year in california,thousands of youth in foster care reach the age of,and suddenly are left to their own devices.most are not adequately equipped for more than basic survival.often they lack a high school diploma,have no job skills,and many have no place to live.yet they are expected to become productive members of society.the odds are against them and many become homeless,become involved in crime,or once again become the responsibility of the state.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,ab cfa asm comm.html as of july.
pursuant to section,subdivision b,before dependency may be terminated the department is required to submit a report verifying that the information,documents,and services set forth in section have been provided to the child.if the department has not met the requirements,dependency may not be terminated,except in circumstances not relevant to this discussion.
we begin by noting the problems we perceive from the form signed by tamika and the social worker and the section report signed by the social worker.as set forth previously,on the form signed by tamika,above her signature it states i certify that i have received the information and services that i initialed above.there are no initials on the form.in addition,the form stated that six pages were attached,yet these pages are not attached to the form in the clerk transcript.there is a report later in the record and this appears to be the report purportedly referred to as the attachment to the termination of jurisdiction form signed by tamika.although this appears to be the correct report,the report is dated and signed by the social worker on february,nine days after tamika and the social worker signed the form.we further note that the form,signed by tamika and the social worker,states i declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing and all the attachments are true and correct.because these defects were not raised in the trial court and are not raised as error on appeal,they do not amount to a cognizable issue we merely note them as evidence of the manner in which this case was treated by the department.
one of the items that must be contained in the report is verification that the dependent has been provided a ssistance in applying for admission to college or to a vocational training program or other education institution and in obtaining financial aid,where appropriate,subd.b.
the form provided to tamika stated that assistance had been provided to her in several areas.one area that was checked off was application for college,vocational training program,or other educational or employment program has been completed.the report summarized the services provided to tamika in this area.tamika will graduate from high school in june.on january,the undersigned discussed with tamika and her academic counsel,ross shafer,the possibility of her graduating after the fall semester of.this would enable her to remain in the foster care system because she would graduate before her birthday.tamika decided that she wanted to complete her senior year and graduate with her class in june.she informed shafer of her desire to attend lyles college of beauty.shafer explained to her that she would have to improve her grades in order to be accepted into the program.
the department is required to provide assistance to the dependent in applying to schools to further his or her education.the department assistance here amounted to forcing tamika to attempt to finish high school in an abbreviated timeframe,knowing that she was a slow student,knowing she was taking rsp classes,and knowing that she needed to improve her grades in order to be accepted into beauty school while section does not require that the department assure the dependent obtains her high school diploma,the educational component portion of this section surely does not envision that the department will throw roadblocks in the dependent educational goals.the actions of the department here are more in the nature of sabotage rather than assistance.
respondent argues that the educational assistance portion of section contained in subdivision b does not apply because tamika was not yet applying for beauty school.if it does not apply,then we question why the social worker declared under penalty of perjury that t he following assistance has been provided to the child a pplication for college,vocational training program,or other educational or employment program has been completed.
we further find that the department actions regarding whether tamika could retain her status as a dependent of the juvenile court resembled let make a deal except there were no good prizes behind any of the doors rather than looking out for the best interests of the dependent.the department stated that if tamika went along with the accelerated plan to graduate before her birthday in february of she would be retained in foster care until her early graduation presumably in december of.if she chose to continue her education in the normal fashion,the department was seeking immediate termination while tamika was but still a junior in high school.this bargain was stated by counsel for the department at the first hearing regarding termination.now,she has an action here.that is why gilliam and i met with the school counselor and the child,or the young lady,to find out whether or not she could graduate in the fall of this year which would be before her birthday and be maintained in the foster care system until that time.but it her election to graduate with her class in,june.the court went along with the department plan and indicated that tamika counsel needed to explain to her the consequences of perhaps continuing with the plan of an graduation.the court continued the matter so this discussion could take place.
the court began the next hearing by stating it had continued the hearing to give counsel and child an opportunity to further consider whether she wants to graduate from,on her,after her birthday.tamika counsel made her plea for the continuation of services 
furlong counsel for tamika your honor,tamika is in rsv classes which are classes for slow children.
the court okay.
furlong so,to expect her to do in six months which is going to basically take a year to do is going to get her nowhere.and we are in a situation where she is going to school.she is participating.she is doing very well.she,as the court knows from the way the code reads,the code tries to give the child a normal life as possible.
when they are in foster care,she would be able to graduate with the class that she is familiar with,finish out high school,and she is just not in a situation where she would be to her advantage to have this terminated now.and i ask the court to understand that funding becomes a big problem with the department once a child is over.
but that is a funding issue and i think the court really needs to look at the best interests of the child.
the department reiterated the financial burdens of continuing one in dependency after he or she reaches the age of.
again,rather than requiring the county to prove that termination of dependency was in the best interests of tamika,the burden was placed on tamika to chose between continued dependency under the unrealistic plan of the county or to face termination of dependency so she could finish high school in the normal course.having chosen the latter,more realistic,course her dependency was immediately terminated.we find it incongruous that on the one hand the department would recommend that tamika be continued in dependency if she agreed to their accelerated plan,yet on the other hand recommend that dependency be terminated immediately,merely days after she turned and was in her junior year of high school,if she did agree to the department plan.if tamika met the criteria to remain as a dependent to finish high school under the accelerated program,why would she not also meet the requirements for continued dependency so she could finish her senior year in high school,much less complete her junior year in high school other than financial considerations espoused by the department,there is nothing in the record to explain the inconsistencies between the two positions.again,rather than focusing on whether termination of dependency would be in tamika best interest,the entire focus was on whether termination of dependency would be in the best fiscal interest of the county 
all of the above leads us to our final discussion whether the trial court abused its discretion when it terminated tamika dependency.we begin by noting that even if the trial court correctly found that all of the requirements of section were met,section,subdivision c expressly states that this is not a limitation on the discretion of the juvenile court to continue jurisdiction for other reasons.we examine the two cases relied on by the parties that discuss whether the trial court abused its discretion in its decision regarding whether to terminate the jurisdiction over a dependent who had reached the age of majority.
in re robert,supra,th,d was decided before the enactment of section.although it was determined before section was enacted,it is pertinent on the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion here.robert,born in,and his sister michelle,born in,were placed with their maternal grandparents in foster care.robert and michelle both excelled in school and each obtained jobs during high school.robert began attending state college in.he continued to live with his grandparents and worked before and during college.in july of he had completed two years of college with a b average.his sister michelle was active in activities during high school and worked during high school.she planned to attend state college and to continue to live with her grandparents.robert,supra,at,d.
in july of,just prior to robert birthday,the department recommended termination of jurisdiction over robert because he was almost years old,had graduated from high school,had successfully completed two years at a university,lived in a stable home,and was a young adult.robert opposed termination of jurisdiction because his grandparents needed the income to help defray educational and living expenses.the court retained jurisdiction.in re robert,supra,th at,d.
at the next hearing in january of,the department recommended that jurisdiction over robert and michelle be terminated.the social worker stated that both dependents had graduated from high school,were doing well academically in college,and were residing in a stable home.the dependents opposed termination of juvenile court jurisdiction because of the financial burden it would place on their grandparents.the court did not terminate jurisdiction but scheduled a hearing for march of.in re robert,supra,th at,d.
the department requested termination at the march hearing.robert stated at the hearing that if his grandparents did not receive assistance,he would not be able to graduate from college.he argued that his graduation from college would benefit society because he would have increased earnings and be paying higher taxes.the court denied the department request and retained jurisdiction.in re robert,supra,th at,d.
the department appealed,claiming the trial court abused its discretion in retaining jurisdiction.the appellate court agreed.it found that the sole basis for extension of jurisdiction was to afford special assistance to michelle and robert to allow them to complete their college education.we are aware of no legislative mandate that the dependency system is to be utilized to subsidize higher education absent any evidence of current or future threatened harm to michelle and robert,the juvenile court abused its discretion in extending jurisdiction over michelle and robert.in re robert,supra
