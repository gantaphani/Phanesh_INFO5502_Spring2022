marcus father appeals from the juvenile court order terminating his parental rights to his then son.he contends the juvenile court committed reversible error when it appointed a guardian ad litem without inquiring about his competence and explaining the purpose of the appointment and failed to obtain a knowing waiver of father right to be present at the hearing where the court terminated his parental rights.the department of children and family services dcfs concedes the juvenile court erred when it appointed a guardian ad litem without advising father of the consequences of the appointment,but argues the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.dcfs also asserts father forfeited his right to be present at the hearing where his parental rights were terminated.we conclude the juvenile court error in appointing a guardian ad litem without inquiring about father competence and explaining the purpose of the appointment was a structural error requiring reversal of the order terminating father parental rights.
facts and proceedings below 
on september,james was detained from the home of his paternal grandparents,where he had been living in the custody of his parents.dcfs had received hotline referrals indicating james was being emotionally abused by father and generally neglected by his mother.father,who appeared agitated and nervous when social workers came to the home,blocked the door and said he did not want james to be detained.the social workers asked law enforcement to assist them in the detention.according to dcfs,a sheriff deputy who responded to the scene told the social workers deputies were often called to the home and considered it a high threat due to drugs and father combative nature.apparently,father had physically fought with deputies in the past when they were called to the home.when the social workers returned to the home with several sheriff deputies,james mother was cooperative and gave james to a sergeant.james was placed in foster care.
on september,dcfs filed a section petition,which only included allegations against james mother at the detention hearing on the same date,although father was not yet a defendant,the juvenile court issued an order appointing an expert under evidence code section to conduct psychological and neurological testing on father and to evaluate father abuse and its effect on james.the court also asked the expert to evaluate the causes of father left leg twitching and the fact father jolts his head side to side and perspires heavily,as observed by social workers.the juvenile court also ordered father to participate in random drug testing and parenting and granted him monitored visitation with james.the following day,the expert notified the court her office could not accept the appointment to conduct an evaluation of father.
on october,dcfs filed a first amended section petition,which included several allegations against father.the petition alleged father had been diagnosed with disorder,had been prescribed psychotropic medication and had demonstrated numerous emotional and mental problems.the petition also alleged father had a history of violent behavior,which included a conviction for assault with a firearm,and had a history of substance abuse.
in its report for the october,hearing,dcfs detailed what it described as father extensive criminal history.dcfs also reported father had been admitted to patton state hospital because of his mental condition in november and november,while he had criminal prosecutions pending.james paternal grandfather told a social worker father had been diagnosed with disorder and had been prescribed three medications for the condition.according to dcfs,the grandfather claimed father emotional and mental problems began four years before when he was physically assaulted by several members of the east los angeles sheriff department.the grandfather also reported,when father was not taking his psychotropic medications,he would become very aggressive,and the grandfather feared father would hurt him.when a social worker attempted to interview father at the paternal grandfather home,he witnessed behavior which caused him to believe father might physically assault the grandfather,but this did not happen.the grandfather also seemed to express concern for the social worker safety based on father behavior.
in the report,dcfs also described father discussions with the social worker.father said he wanted visits with james.he claimed he was trying to find an apartment and a job.dcfs reported father readily admitted to not taking his prescribed psychotropic medication.the social worker stated father did seem to understand the allegations contained in the juvenile dependency petition and did not appear to be able to focus on the subjects discussed.dcfs recommended the juvenile court order reunification services and monitored visitation for father.
at the hearing on october,father denied the allegations in the first amended petition.the juvenile court appointed another expert under evidence code section to evaluate,among other things,father mental condition,his abuse and whether he was capable of caring for an infant.the parties stipulated to continue the hearing so the court could receive the expert report.on november,when the court still had not received the report,it dissolved the requirement for a evaluation.dcfs explained it no longer needed the evaluation because it had subpoenaed father records from patton state hospital and found there was more than enough information in those records to explain the need for jurisdiction.
in an interim review report prepared for a december,hearing,dcfs reported it had reviewed father mental health records from patton state hospital and those records indicated father suffers from severe psychological problems,and his behavior has improved while prescribed a steady regimen of psychotropic medication.dcfs filed the records with the juvenile court.
on december,dcfs informed the court father had been arrested for robbery.the juvenile court continued the matter two times so father could be transported from jail to appear at the hearing.
on december,father appeared at the contested hearing.after the parties attorneys stated their appearances,another woman addressed the court and stated she was available for appointment as gal guardian ad litem for the father.the juvenile court responded you will be appointed.the parties stated they would submit on the reports the court had received.the court explained it also had received a waiver of rights form signed by father which father had reviewed with his attorney and the guardian ad litem.the court asked father if he understood the rights listed on the form and the consequences of entering a plea,and father said he understood.when the court asked father to confirm he was giving up those rights,father responded yes.yes.why,no,i do think that right,your honor,because i want a trial,because i want to get my baby back.the juvenile court explained,if father entered a plea and the court assumed jurisdiction,the court would order dcfs to provide services for father to try to help father get the child back.father said he wanted that to happen.father counsel joined in the plea,concurred in the waivers and stipulated to a factual basis for jurisdiction.
the juvenile court accepted father plea to the first amended petition,found the amended allegations to be true and declared james to be a dependent of the court.thereafter,james attorney stated your honor,i need to interrupt the court if i may.i certainly am in agreement with the ultimate decision of the i concerned for the record whether or not the record is sufficient to warrant an appointment of a gal,particularly when a court is taking a waiver from this gentleman who is alleged to require a gal.it is quite clear to me that he does not understand what is going on today,and i concerned about my client at some point in the future having his status in limbo due to an appeal.
in response to this concern,father counsel engaged in the following exchange with father 
father counsel do you need help today working on your case do you need to have two attorneys instead of one 
father yes.
father counsel does it help you to have another attorney help you with your case 
father i understand.
father counsel does it help you to have another attorney help you with your case did you like having another attorney help you understand 
father yes.yes.
james counsel asserted your honor,that not the inquiry.i would object.thereafter,the following exchange took place between james counsel and father 
james counsel do you know what you are here for today 
father for my children,to get my son back.
james counsel do you know what sic today was set for a trial of the issues in this case that you are alleged,things that you have been alleged to have done 
both james counsel and dcfs counsel stated it appeared father was looking to his relatives in the courtroom to tell him what to say.the juvenile court decided to continue the matter to give father attorney,his guardian ad litem and the paternal grandfather an opportunity to confer and to discuss this proceeding further with the father.father asked the court,what is the gal the court told father it was his second lawyer.father stated,well,i do know what gal here.sic.james counsel suggested the juvenile court conduct an in camera hearing on the next court date with regards to whether or not father even needs a gal.the court responded i think i can fairly say that he in a position or a condition where a gal would be to his benefit.that finding i would make today.the juvenile court struck father plea and set a date for an adjudication hearing.
in an interim review report prepared for a january,hearing,dcfs reported james was placed in the home of his maternal grandparents on december.in a report prepared for the march,adjudication hearing,dcfs reported father was still incarcerated,but was going to be moved to patton state hospital.based on this development,dcfs asserted father did not appear anywhere near to being able to resume custody of james.
on march,father guardian ad litem signed a waiver of rights form on his behalf.at the adjudication hearing the same day,the guardian ad litem stated she believed it was to father benefit to waive his rights because dcfs was offering him reunification services.she did not believe father current functioning allowed him to sign the waiver of rights form himself.the guardian ad litem confirmed she had read the rights to father and he understood them as well as the consequences of his plea.on father behalf,she submitted on the petition.father counsel joined in the plea,concurred in the waivers and stipulated to a factual basis for jurisdiction.the juvenile court accepted father plea,found the amended allegations to be true and declared james to be a dependent of the court.the court granted father monitored visitation and ordered him to participate in drug rehabilitation with random testing,an alcohol rehabilitation program with random testing or a program,parenting education and individual counseling.father counsel noted for the record father wanted james placed with the paternal grandparents.the court pointed out dcfs had already examined them.
in a status review report prepared for a may,hearing,dcfs reported father was transported to patton mental health state hospital on march,after he was deemed to be incompetent to stand trial in his criminal case.dcfs asserted father was not complying with his case plan.he was terminated from the alcoholics anonymous program at patton because of his uncontrollable anxiousness.he was participating in a behavior modification program to alleviate his anxiousness.he was not participating in drug testing or parenting because patton did not offer those programs.a social worker at patton told dcfs father suffered from s chizoaffective disorder and substance abuse,and had been prescribed and psychotropic medications.this social worker also stated father was not exhibiting any behavioral problems but was exhibiting behavior.the paternal grandparents were acting as father conservators.father had not had any visits with james,but father social worker at patton reported father was anxious to reunite with james and wanted to regain custody.dcfs recommended the juvenile court terminate father reunification services.
father appeared at the may,hearing.father guardian ad litem informed the juvenile court she would like to set the matter for a contest.father attorney said she planned to submit information to the court about father participation in programs at patton.james attorney objected to the guardian ad litem request to set the matter for a contest,asserting he did not believe there would be sufficient evidence to overcome the father mental problems.the court set the matter for a contest.father briefly addressed the court and reiterated he wanted james to live with the paternal grandparents.
in a status review report prepared for a july,hearing,dcfs informed the juvenile court father was in partial compliance with his case plan.he had been participating in narcotics anonymous and alcoholics anonymous programs for two months and,according to a social worker at patton,had been attending these programs faithfully.dcfs provided father with a folder with parenting literature because patton did not offer a parenting program.the paternal grandparents were in the process of completing the paperwork necessary to secure visits at patton for james and father.father reported he was doing well and wanted to finish out his stay at patton state hospital in order to regain custody of his child.father told social workers from dcfs he did not want to attend any court hearings in the dependency proceedings until he completed his rehabilitation at patton.he explained the hearings distract ed him and interfere d with his recovery.the paternal grandmother also told dcfs father did not want to attend the upcoming hearing,and she signed a waiver of appearance on father behalf,as his conservator.
dcfs attached to its report a june,letter from a social worker at patton,explaining during the first of father hospitalization he was not yet stabilized on his medication.however,within the last days father medication appears to be stable and he remains medication compliant although he still displays some signs of anxiety.however,this behavior does not impact his ability to interact appropriately with staff and his peers.the social worker described father as polite and cooperative and stated father often speaks of his son and his desire to get better so that he may someday be reunited with him.the social worker believed visits with james could very well be a factor in father recovery.
at the july,hearing to decide whether reunification services should be terminated,father attorney referenced the june,letter from the social worker at patton,and informed the juvenile court she was submitting the matter since it appears that father will not any time soon be ready to have the child returned to him and at such time that he is,she could file a petition.the paternal grandfather addressed the court.he said father was doing well at patton and the court should give him a chance.the juvenile court explained to the grandfather the strict timeline applicable to a dependency proceeding involving a child under three years old.the court stated it could not return james to a man that in patton state hospital.the court terminated father reunification services and set the manner for a permanency planning hearing.
in a report prepared for the permanency planning hearing,dcfs informed the juvenile court james was visiting father at patton approximately every other week.in a status review report for a january,hearing,dcfs reported father had been released from patton in november and was serving a sentence in prison dcfs also stated the paternal grandparents were no longer father conservators.
at the january,hearing,the juvenile court identified adoption as the permanent plan for james.the maternal grandparents wanted to adopt james and dcfs was working on getting the home study completed.
the section hearing was continued several times for various reasons.both father guardian ad litem and his counsel asked the juvenile court to issue an order for father appearance at the hearing.the court did.father was not transported for the august,hearing.a note on the order for father appearance stated unable to transport v in points restraints.in anticipation of father request at the next hearing and to avoid another continuance,james counsel asked the juvenile court to set the matter for a contested section hearing.father guardian ad litem said she believed father would want a contested hearing.the court set the matter for a contest.
father was not present at the september,hearing.apparently the juvenile court received another note indicating father was in restraints.father guardian ad litem and counsel said the hearing should not go forward because father wanted to be present.the juvenile court questioned whether it was necessary for father to be present at the hearing given a guardian ad litem had been appointed to represent his interests.nonetheless the court continued the matter and asked the parties to research the issue before the next hearing.the court also issued another order for father appearance.
on october,the statewide office for tracking inmates notified the juvenile court it was returning to the court the order to transport father to the october hearing because father had been transferred to california medical center.thus,father was not present at the october hearing.father counsel requested the juvenile court continue the hearing again.she represented father had spoken with the paternal grandparents the night before and he was upset that he was brought to court.james counsel and dcfs counsel objected to any further continuance.dcfs counsel argued there was authority supporting the proposition the matter could proceed in father absence.father counsel said father wanted to testify and she planned to call him as a witness.the juvenile court found good cause to grant one further continuance.
father did not appear at the continued hearing on december.a handwritten note on the order for his appearance stated refused waived.another copy of the same order had a handwritten note stating wavied sic willcox.father counsel represented the paternal grandparents could explain why father did want to come to court.the juvenile court stated it had been informed his father perception was a safety reason.later,the court explained,if he father does trust the sheriff of los angeles county to protect him,then he made that choice.father counsel said she was ready to proceed and she wanted to call the paternal grandfather to testify.she explained father contention is that he has a close bond with the child and that termination of his parental rights would be detrimental to the child.she also asserted father had had frequent visitation with james at patton.
the paternal grandfather testified.he claimed james had lived in his home with father for about months,and father took care of him.the grandfather took james to visit father at patton state hospital,maybe six months a year sic.during those visits,father fed james and changed his diaper.father had not seen james in the last five months.father talked to james on the phone about six times a month.james mother also testified.in response to a question from the juvenile court,james mother said father would be released from prison in december.
the juvenile court found the paternal grandfather testimony james had lived in his home with father for months to be completely incredible.james was detained from the paternal grandparents home two months after he was born and he never lived there again.this discrepancy caused the juvenile court to distrust the balance of the grandfather testimony,especially the portion about the frequency of james visits with father at patton.the court also stated it did not believe speaking with a two year old over the phone establishes any bond between the parent and the child.
the juvenile court terminated father parental rights.the court found james was adoptable,father visitation had not been regular,and james would not suffer any detriment if father parental rights were terminated.
discussion 
father contends the juvenile court committed reversible error when it appointed a guardian ad litem without inquiring about his competence and explaining the purpose of the appointment.dcfs agrees the juvenile court erred when it appointed a guardian ad litem without advising father of the consequences of the appointment.given dcfs concession of error,the focus of our discussion is on our determination whether the juvenile court error was structural,requiring automatic reversal of the order,or subject to a harmless error analysis.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,a parent in a dependency proceeding who is incompetent shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the juvenile court the appointment should be made if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent is incompetent within the meaning of penal code section or probate code section the test for incompetence in this context is whether the party has the capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the proceedings,and is able to assist counsel in preparation of the case.
the introduction of a guardian ad litem into the case is no small matter.the effect of the appointment is to remove control over the litigation from the parent,whose vital rights are at issue,and transfer it to the guardian.in the case of dependency proceedings,the litigation can affect the fundamental parental right to the companionship,care,custody,and management of one own child.the guardian ad litem is given the power to control trial tactics as well as the procedural steps necessary to the conduct of the litigation.for example,the guardian ad litem has the power to waive the parent right to a contested hearing at critical stages of the proceedings.given the appointment of a guardian ad litem deprives a parent of the right to control and participate in dependency litigation a parent due process rights must be protected before a guardian ad litem is appointed.
where a parent refuses to consent to the appointment of a guardian ad litem or is not asked to do so,and the parent counsel requests the juvenile court appoint a guardian,the court must hold an informal hearing before making the appointment and allow the parent an opportunity to be heard on whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem is necessary at the informal hearing,the court or counsel must explain to the parent the purpose of a guardian ad litem,why counsel believes the appointment is necessary,and what authority the parent will cede to the guardian ad litem.moreover,the court should make an inquiry sufficient to satisfy it that the parent is,or is not,competent under the standard set forth above the informal hearing provides the juvenile court with an opportunity to inquire of both the parent and the attorney to gain a full understanding of the circumstances.
in this case,the juvenile court did not explain to father what a guardian ad litem is or what a guardian ad litem does.the court did not apprise father of the significant rights which would be transferred away from father and to the guardian ad litem upon appointment.given father had no idea what purpose the guardian ad litem would the record makes was not afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard on whether he believed the appointment was necessary.father due process rights were not protected.dcfs concedes the error 
as we discuss below,there is a split of authority in the appellate courts as to whether the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding constitutes a structural error requiring automatic reversal or whether it is a trial error subject to a harmless error analysis.as the united states supreme court explained in arizona fulminante structural errors involve basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence,and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.citation.california courts have applied this same structural error analysis to dependency proceedings in analogous situations in which the fundamental constitutional right to parent is the subject of some error.in the criminal context,structural errors include the total deprivation of the right to counsel at trial,a biased judge,unlawful exclusion of members of the defendant race from a grand jury,denial of the right to at trial,denial of the right to a public trial,and an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction to the jury.in the case of structural error,automatic reversal of the order or judgment is required without regard to the strength of the evidence or other circumstances.
in arizona fulminante,the united states supreme court defined trial error as error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the chapman standard the supreme court explained the harmless error doctrine is essential to preserve the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant guilt or innocence,and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.citation.the supreme court cited the erroneous admission of evidence as an example of trial error subject to a harmless error analysis 
in in re division four of this appellate district in an opinion authored by presiding justice epstein concluded the juvenile court error in appointing a guardian ad litem without explaining to the mother the nature of the appointment or making an adequate inquiry into her competence was structural error requiring automatic reversal of the order placing the dependent child under legal guardianship.the appellate court emphasized the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem deprived mother of her status as a party in the case where her basic right to the companionship,care,custody and management of her child was at stake the juvenile court transferred to the guardian ad litem the mother right to be consulted,to express positions and interests,and to give or withhold consent to a course of action.the mother attorney was permitted to take direction from the guardian ad litem,rather than the mother.the attorney had no obligation to keep the mother informed of what was going on in court,or even solicit her views.
subsequently,in in re enrique division one of the fourth appellate district concluded the appointment of a guardian ad litem in violation of a parent due process rights is a trial error,not a structural one.the juvenile court in that case also had appointed a guardian ad litem without explaining to the mother the nature of the appointment or making an adequate inquiry into her competence.in support of its conclusion,the court of appeal in in re enrique cited other appellate court decisions which had applied a chapman harmless error standard to this type of error the court also stated the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem in this case is not like other errors that have been found to be structural such as the failure to attempt to give a parent statutorily required notice of a selection and implementation hearing and the failure to serve the mother with the status report at least days before the review hearing at which the juvenile court set a section hearing the court found it could assess the harm resulting from the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem,and concluded the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt 
were we to conclude a chapman harmless error analysis is applicable to this type of error,we would find the error in this case to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.based on the record before us,it is clear the juvenile court would have assumed jurisdiction and eventually terminated father reunification services and parental rights regardless of whether the court had erroneously appointed the guardian ad litem.we can not conceive of any additional testimony father could have presented or evidence he could have submitted which would have altered these outcomes.during the pendency of these proceedings,father was never ready to assume custody of james due to his mental condition and his incarceration.james contact with father during the first two months of his life,his brief period of visitation with father at patton,and his telephone calls with father could not have created the type of bond and relationship necessary to force this child to forgo adoption 
notwithstanding these facts,and keeping in mind t ime is of the essence in dependency matters,we conclude the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem in this case was structural error requiring automatic reversal of the order terminating father parental rights.the juvenile court stripped father of the right to participate in litigation involving his entitlement to the companionship,care and custody of his son without affording him the process he was due.the court took away father status as a giving father counsel and guardian ad litem the power to disregard father telling him why or even that it was doing so.if this is not structural error,it is difficult to understand how any error in a dependency proceeding could be deemed structural error.we are also mindful of another important consequence of the decision to categorize this error as structural rather than merely trial error.that is its effect on the trial bench and the enhanced incentive to avoid error of this nature.when a trial court knows a given misstep will result in certain reversal,it will have far more reason to dot the i and cross the t than if the judge can count on the possibility,indeed probability,the appellate court will deem the error harmless.in this case,the judge ignored repeated objections and warnings from trial counsel reminding the court it had not made the proper explanations and inquiries before appointing the guardian ad litem.as a matter of fact,the juvenile court misrepresented the functions and powers of the guardian ad litem,telling father he was merely receiving the benefit of a second lawyer.it is unlikely the juvenile court would have ignored those warnings if automatic reversal were perceived as the sanction for doing so.
we follow the lead of division four of this appellate district regardless of the strength of the evidence against father,this error requires automatic reversal of the order terminating father parental rights 
the dissent argues our ability to conduct a harmless error analysis in this case strongly suggests the error at issue can not be deemed structural.as the united states supreme court has acknowledged,the difficulty of assessing the effect of the error is not the only criterion courts have used in deciding whether or not an error is structural in some cases,it is the irrelevance of harmlessness which indicates a structural error we find this to be such a case.father was stripped of his status as a party with no explanation or assessment of whether this procedure was even necessary.in the absence of due process,everyone was free to ignore father requests and wishes in a case about james future and father relationship with james contrary to the dissent position,we believe the appointment of a guardian ad litem under these circumstances undermine s the integrity and fundamental fairness of the dependency proceeding itself.reversal is required.the presence or absence of harm is irrelevant.in certain cases,our evaluation of the process used to achieve the ultimate outcome in the case must take precedence over an evaluation of the merits of that outcome.this is one of those cases.
disposition 
the order terminating father parental rights and the order appointing the guardian ad litem are reversed.the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent.
without question appointment of a guardian ad litem for an incompetent parent is a significant step in a dependency proceeding,directly affecting that parent fundamental interest in the companionship and care of his or her child.see,in re daniel th,d in re
