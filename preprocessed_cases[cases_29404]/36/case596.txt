the alameda county social services agency agency appeals an order continuing an month review hearing and extending the family reunification services for up to months.the agency contends the court erred in extending services based on a finding that the agency had failed to provide reasonable reunification services.although significant services undoubtedly were provided,we shall affirm the juvenile court finding that the services were not reasonably sufficient because they were not tailored to the particular needs of the family arising out of the unique circumstances of the situation.we also conclude that amendments made to welfare and institutions code sections and do not restrict the court authority under section to extend reunification services from to months upon a showing of good cause.
factual and procedural background 
on august,the then year old minor was taken into protective custody by the oakland police department after running away from her mother home.mother had refused to allow her to return home and asked that she be taken into the custody of child protective services.
on august,the agency filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that minor came within section,subdivisions b and g.the petition alleged that mother was overwhelmed and unable to supervise minor due to minor behavioral challenges,which included,chronically running away,and suicidal ideations.
according to the detention report prepared by the agency,minor had been residing in oakland with her mother,her older sister then age and a younger sister then age.mother reported feeling very stressed and overwhelmed for some time because of minor behaviors.mother stated that minor is manipulative and lies a lot.further mother is concerned about minor cutting behaviors,statements of suicidal ideation,an attempt to set her bedroom on fire,smoking marijuana,drinking alcohol,chronic running away,and an incident in november in which minor molested her younger sister.mother believes that she is not able to meet minor needs at this time.minor reported to the agency that she ran away because she was beaten by her mother and also claimed that she had been molested by her older sister when they were younger.at the uncontested detention hearing,minor was detained with temporary placement and care vested with the agency.
in a combined report,the agency recommended that minor be declared a dependent of the juvenile court,placement continue,and family reunification services be provided to mother.according to the social worker,mother expressed concern for minor safety and as well as a desire to protect her younger daughter from minor behavior.mother wanted minor to receive the help she needs and admitted she had struggled to obtain consistent therapy for minor and other supportive services for the family.mother articulated her need for family therapy for herself,minor,and her younger daughter.minor also expressed her desire to participate in family therapy with her mother to work on their relationship.
the social worker reported that a referral was made for individual therapy and a psychological evaluation for minor.in the meantime,minor would be seen by a clinician through her group home.the initial reunification case plan required minor to participate in and complete a psychological evaluation and comply with the recommendations provided therein and to participate in individual and family therapy.mother was also required to engage in family therapy.
at the uncontested jurisdictional hearing,mother submitted to the petition on the basis of the social worker report,and the court found the allegations true.the court ordered the agency to provide family reunification services to the child and to the mother.visitation was ordered to be as frequent as possible consistent with the child.
at the status review,in february,the agency recommended that minor remain in her placement and reunification continue.minor reported that she wanted to return home to her mother,participate in family therapy,and visit with her younger sister.the agency and mother were concerned,however,about minor returning to the home because of her previous molestation of her younger sister.the social worker reported that both mother and minor were participating in weekly individual therapy and had begun family therapy in january.the agency reported that the family therapist would incorporate the younger sister in the family therapy when appropriate the review was submitted on the social services report.the court found that reasonable services had been provided by the agency and mother progress was partial.the court ordered reunification services continued.
at the time of the month status review,in july,the agency recommended that minor remain in placement and family reunification services be continued.although minor wanted to return home and participate in services,mother was not able or willing to have minor returned to her home because of her ongoing concerns for the safety of minor younger sister.the report explains,mother believes that her daughter requires therapeutic services and intervention to address her history of behaviors and harm to others.the agency reported minor younger sister had attended several family therapy sessions,but minor was a trigger for her younger sister because of the past sexual abuse.mother reported that minor younger sister had either been taken to the emergency room for unsafe behaviors or placed on a section hold on eight occasions since april.the younger sister treating psychiatrist recommended that visits between minor and her younger sister be temporarily suspended.
since the last review hearing,minor placement had been changed twice.at the time of the hearing,minor was residing with a fictive family member in sacramento.because of transportation problems after moving to sacramento,minor missed several family therapy sessions and her individual therapy was interrupted.the agency attempted to mitigate the transportation problems by providing minor amtrak tickets.in may,minor completed a medication evaluation,but was not taking the prescribed medication.mother continued to attend family therapy each week,even when minor was not present,and continued her individual therapy.the month review was submitted on the agency report.the court found that reasonable services were provided by the agency and minor placement was necessary and appropriate.
at the time of the month status review hearing in january,the agency recommended that minor remain a dependent in placement and that family reunification services be terminated.the agency reported that after going awol from her sacramento foster home in early january,minor was placed in a group home in oakland on an emergency basis.minor was very unhappy in the placement and wanted to return home.the agency did not think she should be returned home because her younger sister continued to be triggered by minor.the report states that the younger sister has a history of unsafe behaviors and hospitalizations in part due to sexual abuse she experienced by her sister minor can not live in the home with her mother and sister because she is a trigger to her sister,until the issue is fully addressed.the report also states that mother and minor need to participate in family therapy and then incorporate the younger sister into family therapy in order to make reunification possible and sustainable.the family therapist,however,had discharged the family from therapy in august because of minor missed sessions.the report indicated that mother and minor had not participated in family therapy since the termination in august in part because mother rejected the social worker offer to find a therapist in the sacramento area and in part because minor inconsistent contact prevented minor individual therapist from conducting collateral family sessions with mother.
at the month review hearing,the court rejected the agency recommendation that reunification services be terminated.the court expressed significant concerns about the agency failure to provide services specifically targeted at resolving the impediment to minor reunification minor sexual abuse of her younger s
