iii.discussion 
mike argues the trial court had no subject jurisdiction because of the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act,et,probate code section,or the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction the hague convention.subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by constitutional or statutory law.dial fesbinder th,d in re marriage of jensen th,d marlow campbell th,d.the supreme court has held,subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court over a cause of action or to act in a particular way.greener workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,dial fesbinder,supra,th at,d trafficschoolonline,superior court th,d people jackson,d supp,overruled on a different point in people posey cal th,fn,d.by contrast,the lack of subject matter jurisdiction means the entire absence of power to hear or determine a case,an absence of authority over the subject matter.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,accord greener workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d,in re marriage of jensen,supra,th at,d buckley california coastal com.th,d.where the evidence is not in dispute,a determination of subject matter jurisdiction is a legal question subject to de novo review.superior court th,d robbins foothill nissan th,d finnie district coast dist.th,d.
the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act and probate code section 
there is no merit to mike argument that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act and probate code section provided the trial court with the authority to make the orders under review.in california,the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act,et governs custody matters,which include guardianship proceedings.brossoit brossoit th,d guardianship of donaldson d.the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act is the exclusive method of determining subject matter jurisdiction in california custody cases,including international custody disputes.in re stephanie cal th,d,in re th,d in re nada th,d.section,subdivision f provides court means an entity authorized under the law of a state to establish,enforce,or modify a child custody determination.section provides in part a except as otherwise provided in section,a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if any of the following are true this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding,or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph,or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that this state is the more appropriate forum under section or,and both of the following are true a the child and the child parents,or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent,have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence.b substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child care,protection,training and personal relationships.all courts having jurisdiction under paragraph or have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under section and.no court of any other state have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraph,or.b subdivision a is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.c physical presence of,or a personal jurisdiction over,a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination.
section,subdivision c defines a child custody determination as follows child custody determination means a judgment,decree,or other order of a court providing for the legal custody,physical custody,or visitation with respect to a child.the term includes a permanent,temporary,initial,and modification order section subdivision d states a child custody proceeding means a proceeding in which legal custody,physical custody,or visitation with respect to a child is an issue.the term includes a proceeding for guardianship section,subdivision e defines the term commencement to mean the filing of the first pleading in a proceeding.section,subdivision g provides in part home state means the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding a period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period.section,subdivision k provides modification means a child custody determination that changes,replaces,supersedes,or is otherwise made after a previous determination concerning the same child,whether or not it is made by the court that made the previous determination.
thus,a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over guardianship matters when a petition is filed concerning a child,such as ariana whose home state is california.also,trial courts have subject matter jurisdiction when a child lives in california for six months before the petition is filed,subd.g,subd.a in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d,taylor superior court th,d guardianship of lee d.in this case,kyriaki and barbara had initially filed a guardianship petition on january.the trial court correctly found that the original guardianship proceeding was sufficient to establish jurisdiction to determine the custody issues concerning ariana.in any event,the undisputed evidence established the trial court had resolved the custody issues concerning ariana because california was her home until july,two months prior to september,the date when the second guardianship petition was filed,in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d,taylor superior court,supra,th at,d.
further,once the trial court had acquired subject matter jurisdiction in,it continued to retain the authority to adjudicate the custody and visitation disputes among the parties in and.the supreme court has held,in situations involving guardianship and custody orders subsequent proceedings to obtain changes in custody are continuations of the original proceeding to determine custody.jacobs superior court cal d,accord,haldane haldane d.once the trial court had jurisdiction in,it retained the authority to consider the and petitions.
there is no merit to mike contention that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because of probate code section.probate code section states,the superior court has jurisdiction of guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.probate code section expressly vested the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction over the guardianship claims of barbara and ariana.probate code section,the statutory provision relied upon by mike,which is entitled residents venue states,the proper county for the commencement of a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding for a resident of this state is either of the following a the county in which the proposed ward or proposed conservatee resides.b such other county as may be in the best interests of the proposed ward or proposed conservatee.as can be noted,probate code section is a venue a jurisdictional provision.recommendation proposing new probate code cal.law revision com.nothing in probate code section deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction.
in this case,on january,barbara and kyriaki filed their temporary guardianship petition.on january,the conciliation court order providing barbara and kyriaki with visitation rights was signed.on march,an amended stipulation modifying the january,conciliation court agreement was filed.on september,barbara and kyriaki filed their temporary guardianship petition and order to show cause concerning a contempt.the september,temporary guardianship petition and contempt request was filed in the same case as the initial january,temporary guardianship petition.on july,the trial court made a child custody determination within the meaning of section,subdi
