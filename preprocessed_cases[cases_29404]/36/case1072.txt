robert appeals an order of the juvenile court terminating his parental rights with respect to.we conclude the juvenile court erroneously denied robert family reunification services on the basis his whereabouts were unknown,without first requiring the department of children and family services dcfs to provide a completed declaration of due diligence.however,robert forfeited the right to raise this issue on appeal by failing to raise it in the juvenile court.we further conclude the juvenile court made findings of parental unfitness sufficient to support the order terminating robert parental rights.because each of robert assignments of error lacks merit,we affirm the order terminating parental rights.
