in these dependency proceedings,the mother appeals from an order terminating parental rights and freeing the minor for adoption and the maternal grandmother appeals an order denying a petition under welfare and institutions code section we affirm both orders.
procedural background 
the dependency proceedings concern the three children of stephanie,a single mother who was alleged to suffer from a mental illness that impaired her ability to care for the children and maintain a safe and sanitary home.the youngest of the children,aaron,was three months old when the dependency petition was filed in san francisco superior court on october.the initial detention order filed october,placed aaron in the custody of his maternal grandmother,irie,together with his older siblings,then age,and earl,then age.on january,following jurisdictional and dispositional hearings,the court placed aaron and with a foster parent,michelle,who resided in stockton,california the oldest brother,earl,was returned to irie care on april.
on may,the court terminated reunification services for the mother and placed aaron in the foster care of michelle,subject to review.the department of human services dhs reports submitted for the hearings on october,and april,found that aaron was thriving in michelle care,but reported problems associated with the mother visitation of aaron and his older brother.the status review report for the april hearing mentions that michelle was considering adoption and that a home study was then in progress.
on june,the dhs filed an interim review report that stated that it had received an approved adoption home study for michelle and recommended that the court schedule a section implementation hearing to modify the permanent plan from foster care to adoption.after several continuances,the court held a contested section referral hearing on november,and set the case for a section hearing the next year following receipt of a dhs report.the hearing was rescheduled and continued several times and ultimately held on august and.
the report filed by the dhs gave a highly favorable evaluation of michelle as a prospective adoptive parent and reported that the dhs had suspended visits with the mother,stephanie,because of difficulties encountered in past visits.in january and february,the dhs arranged for aaron and to visit their older brother earl,who remained in the custody of irie 
in the year,irie,became an active participant in the dependency proceedings.michelle reported that the grandmother called the children infrequently and appeared superficial in these contacts.nevertheless,on april,irie filed a petition under section for modification of the previous order to provide for placement of aaron and with her under a guardianship and ultimately adoption.the court summarily denied the petition at a hearing on april.
about this time,expressed a desire to live with his grandmother and,acceding to his request,the dhs placed him with irie at the end of april.on july,irie filed a second petition requesting transition of child aaron from present foster care location to grandmother irie house.the petition relied on the recent change in custody as a change of circumstances and argued that the preservation of sibling relationships called for placement of all three children with her.shortly thereafter,attorney filed a supporting section petition that opposed the proposed adoption of aaron by michelle and requested that aaron be given the same placement as to preserve the sibling relationship.
before the scheduled august hearing,aaron attorney filed an ex parte application for affirmation of michelle status as de facto parent of aaron and suspension of sibling visitation between aaron and his older brothers.the application noted that aaron had been in michelle custody nearly all his life and asked that the determination of her de facto parent status be made on an expedited basis so that she could appear at the hearing.on july,michelle herself requested to be declared aaron de facto parent.on july,the trial court granted michelle request for de facto parent status and appointed counsel to represent her at the upcoming hearing.
in the same ex parte application,aaron attorney represented that and earl had been arrested twice for robbery since joined the home of irie p.the application also described an unsuccessful visitation on june,in which had treated aaron with indifference and engaged in a hurtful teasing behavior.a few days later,aaron attorney supplemented his application with the notes of the social worker regarding his observation of the sibling visitation.acting on this information,the court suspended any further visitation between aaron and until therapeutic visits could be arranged.
at the commencement of the hearing on august,the court summarily denied irie section petition and the portion of section petition seeking a change in aaron placement.the court granted the portion of petition asking for permission to participate in the hearing for the purpose of addressing the significance of the sibling relationship.with regard to irie participation,the court stated that she could be present at the hearing and express her views but would not be entitled to witnesses since she was technically not a party.
the bulk of the hearing was devoted to the dhs social workers,james gould and kossouth bradford,who had been assigned to the cases of aaron and,respectively.the direct testimony of both social workers consisted of an offer of proof to which they expressed agreement.bradford was most troubled by disruption of the sibling relationship but,like gould,he thought that aaron would benefit more from adoption by michelle than from maintaining his relationship with near the close of the hearing,marchia,the sister of the mother,stephanie,made a brief statement to the court.irie then addressed the court to defend her qualifications to parent the boys.
in an order filed august,the trial court terminated the parental rights of stephanie to aaron and referred him to the dhs for adoption.irie appeals the denial of her section petition at the hearing on august.the mother,stephanie,appeals the order filed august,terminating her parental rights to aaron and ordering adoption as the permanent plan for the minor.
discussion 
grandmother standing 
at the outset,we face the perplexing question of the grandmother standing to appeal the order denying her petition under section.the right to appeal in dependency cases is governed by section,which provides a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment the term judgment in the statute refers to the dispositional order in a dependency proceeding.in re meranda th,d.subsequent orders subject to appeal as orders after judgment include orders denying section petitions to modify an order of the juvenile court.such orders are reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re stephanie cal th,d,in re josiah th,d.
the right of appeal,however,extends by statute only to a party aggrieved by the order appealed from.code civ,in re crystal th,d witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.the peculiar difficulty of the grandmother appeal is to identify any prejudice that she suffered as a result of the denial of her section petition.we construe the petition as being from the order filed may,placing aaron in foster care.she sought to change that order so as to place him in her care during the dependency proceedings,but filed the petition shortly before the permanency hearing that brought the dependency proceedings to a close.whether a child is in the custody of a foster parent or relative during the dependency proceedings has no bearing on the issue of the parent reunification rights or other parental rights.hence,the modification of the custody order filed may,could not affect the order terminating the mother reunification rights and setting a permanency hearing or the outcome of the permanency hearing itself.the change in custody could give the grandmother only a fleeting status as aaron caretaker before he is placed for adoption pursuant to the j
