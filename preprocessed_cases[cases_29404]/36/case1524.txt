chad the father,the presumed father of victoria the minor,challenges the juvenile court summary dismissal of his welfare and institutions code section petition seeking modification of the court custody order and requesting the removal of the minor from the custody of her mother,becky the mother.we conclude the court erred,but find the error harmless and affirm the judgment.
the minor parents have never been married and do not currently live together.pursuant to family court proceedings,the minor lived with her mother and visited her father every other weekend and on wednesdays.the minor parents have ongoing problems regarding custody and visitation.as a result,the father filed custody order violation police reports in the first seven months of.
the family came to the attention of orange county social services agency ssa in july.the mother told authorities the father hit the minor on numerous occasions,which left marks and bruises,and burned the minor with a glue gun.she also reported other instances of physical abuse dating back to.the mother also reported that the minor had twice been hospitalized for suicidal ideation and depression,took medication for depression,and was involved in ongoing individual and group counseling.the minor frequently indicated that she did not want to visit her father.
when contacted by ssa,the father acknowledged he had used inappropriate physical force to discipline the minor and occasionally argued with the mother in front of the child,but also claimed the mother verbally abused the minor and contributed to the minor reluctance to visit him.the father had voluntarily taken anger management and parenting courses,but continued to have problems with the mother.
in late july,ssa advised the mother to obtain a restraining order prohibiting the father from contacting the minor.ssa took the minor into protective custody when the mother failed to follow through in a timely manner.the minor was immediately released to the mother custody.
on august,ssa filed a dependency petition alleging the minor suffered serious physical and emotional harm,subds.a,c,and the mother knew of the harm and failed to protect the minor,subd.b.the mother and the father pleaded no contest to the allegations and the court declared the minor to be a dependent child of the juvenile court.the court ordered the minor to remain in the mother custody,with weekly monitored visitation with the father,and the preparation of a psychological evaluation of the minor.
in april,the minor arrived for a supervised visit with the father wearing a black ski mask,screaming,and crying,and refused to visit with her father.the night before,the minor wrote a letter to her family,threatened other children in her household with a knife,and appeared to be responding to auditory and visual hallucinations.the minor counselors recommended she stop visiting with the father and the father agreed to temporarily discontinue visitation.however,the social worker noted in an interim report that she was puzzled with this situation.she observed that the mother had not timely reported the minor hallucinations,suicide note,or threatening behavior.the social worker stated,it appears the only emergency in the mother mind was getting the visits with the father stopped.
on may,the court terminated the father visitation and ordered psychologist david garland to prepare an evidence code section evaluation of the minor and her parents.garland concluded both parents had demonstrated poor judgment with respect to their treatment and interaction with the minor,but that if the minor is allowed to continue to live with her mother at this time,she will continue to demonstrate periods of decompensation.garland averred,t hat dramatic measures would need to be taken to sever the pathological ties that the minor has with the mother,and to enable her to have a positive relationship with both parents.as long as the minor continues in the custody of her mother there is no chance of her having a positive relationship with her father.he recommended placement in a highly structured group home or residential treatment setting,with monitored visitation for both parents.
on july,ssa filed a supplemental petition under section.the petition alleged,referring to garland report,that the mother subjected the minor to emotional abuse,interfered with the minor relationship with the father,and demonstrated poor judgment to the detriment of the minor.notwithstanding the evaluation,the court dismissed the supplemental petition three days later,without prejudice on motion of county counsel.all parties stipulated to the dismissal and the case was continued for a review hearing,leaving the prior custody order and order prohibiting the father visitation intact.
before the review hearing,the father filed a section petition for modification of the court custody and visitation orders,requesting that the minor be removed from the care of her mother and the father resume visitation according to the father declaration,the supplemental petition was dismissed because there was no alternative placement available.the father had relinquished visitation rights in hopes of improving the situation,but now wanted to resume visitation with the minor.with respect to the request for removal,the father stated,nothing has changed since the social worker originally filed the supplemental petition.in fact,my daughter has been allowed to remain in a home where she is subjected to emotional abuse and put in the role of being a parent to her mother.i feel that it would be in my daughter s best interest to be removed from her mother care based on the results of the evaluation.i feel that i need to protect my daughter interests since the social services agency has not yet refiled the supplemental petition.
county counsel opposed the father removal request,arguing t he bottom line is the legislature has put the duty of investigation on the social worker and the filing of the petition on the social worker and it is the sole discretion of the social worker when it comes to removal from the parent.and there nothing contrary to that in the case or statutory law.the court agreed t he relief sought regarding the minor being removed from the care of her mother is not permitted under the statute,nor case law that has been cited to me.so i not address that issue in the.however,the issue of visitation is clearly within the realm of the court regarding a,so we are going to hear the.i order it be filed in regards to visitation.however,that issue runs concurrent with the review hearing i granting an evidentiary hearing regarding visitation.
during the combined hearing,the court admitted ssa reports and garland report,and received the testimony of garland,the social worker,and the minor.garland reiterated his opinion that the mother repeatedly attempted to alienate the minor from her father,was not really able to focus appropriately on the minor needs,and posed an emotional risk to the minor.it was his opinion,that as long as the minor is in the custody of her mother the mother will continue to undermine that relationship and interfere with any relationship between the minor and her father.garland acknowledged the father prior physical and emotional abuse of the minor.without minimizing the damage the father had caused,garland recommended something dramatic to take the minor out of her mother home and to put her in a neutral setting where therapeutic efforts can be attempted.
the minor,who testified outside the presence of her parents,stated,i do not want to see my dad because of how he hurt me and when i around him,i can still feel the anger and sadness that he put me through and i hate him.i would not want visitations with him.i would love to live with my mom and to stay with her because i do like my dad.however,she later indicated that she would attempt monitored visitation with the father and counseling if ordered by the court.
the social worker testified that despite the filing of the supplemental petition,ssa did not recommend removing the minor from the mother custody.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court retained jurisdiction,ordered custody of
