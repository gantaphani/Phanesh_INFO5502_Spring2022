introduction 
plaintiff connie armijo sued defendants jamie miles,miles,labriute medical group incorporated labriute and sherman oaks hospital and health center sherman oaks hospital for the wrongful death of her domestic partner,dana schwartz dana.the trial court sustained defendants demurrers to plaintiff causes of action,concluding that plaintiff lacked standing to sue under the version of the wrongful death statute stats,ch,in that she and dana had not registered their domestic partnership with the secretary of state.
plaintiff appealed from the order and judgment dismissing her action.during the pendency of this appeal,and after the parties had filed their briefs,the legislature amended the wrongful death statute stats,ch.based upon this amendment,which took effect on january,and which applies retroactively to plaintiff wrongful death claim,we conclude the facts plaintiff alleged in her operative complaint are sufficient to establish her standing to sue for wrongful death.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiff and dana first met in.after dating for six months,the two women made a decision to be committed to each other exclusively as life partners and spouses.
plaintiff and dana jointly were responsible for each other living expenses.during their relationship,neither woman entered into any other relationship or domestic partnership.they lived with one another,and,in,they purchased a home together,where they resided until dana death.
plaintiff and dana were not related by blood in a way that would have prevented them from marrying each another if they could have been married.each was over the age of when they met and formed their relationship.
on august,dana died at defendant sherman oaks hospital,where she had been hospitalized for pain management and associated rehabilitation.miles,an employee of labriute,had been dana physician.
procedural background 
on august,plaintiff and dana sister,lori schwartz who is not a party to this appeal,filed this wrongful death action against defendants.their operative second amended complaint was filed on december.plaintiff alleged that dana died as the result of defendants medical malpractice.plaintiff sought compensatory damages,including compensation for the loss of love,companionship,comfort,affection,solace and moral support,that she suffered as a result of dana death.plaintiff also sought compensation for burial and funeral expenses,as well as the loss of dana income and future earnings.
defendants demurred to plaintiff causes of action.relying on code of civil procedure section section or the wrongful death statute and family code section,defendants asserted that plaintiff lacked standing to sue them for wrongful death,in that she and dana had failed to file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state.
plaintiff opposed the demurrers.although she acknowledged that she and dana had not fulfilled the registration requirement necessary to establish a domestic partnership,she argued that they had fulfilled the statutory intent and underlying purpose of domestic partnership registration despite the lack of registration.
the trial court,believing it had no discretion in this matter,sustained the demurrers without leave to amend based on the failure to file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state.on may,the trial court dismissed all of plaintiff causes of action with prejudice.this appeal followed.
contentions 
the trial court decision to sustain defendants demurrers without leave to amend was based upon the version of the wrongful death statute.plaintiff contends that under the most reasonable construction of that statute and the domestic partnership law,she need not allege that she and dana registered their domestic partnership with the secretary of state in order to establish standing.plaintiff further contends that a registration requirement would run afoul of the state and federal equal protection clauses and that,apart from whether she and dana were domestic partners under the wrongful death statute,she nevertheless was entitled to bring this lawsuit under the equal protection and privacy guarantees of the california constitution and under the equal protection and due process provisions of the united states constitution.we conclude that registration is a prerequisite for standing under the version of the wrongful death statute.we further conclude,however,that the version of the wrongful death statute affords plaintiff standing to sue.we therefore need not and do not address plaintiff remaining constitutional contentions regarding the wrongful death statute.
with respect to the wrongful death statute,assembly bill ab,defendants contend that the legislature amended the wrongful death statute for the sole purpose of changing the results in three cases presently on appeal.defendants concede that the statute expressly provides that it is to have retroactive effect but contend that various constitutional provisions prevent the statute retroactive application in this case.defendants further contend that even if there is no constitutional impediment to the statute retroactive application,ab can not be enforced because it violates proposition,an initiative measure approved by california voters during the march election.for the reasons that follow,there is no merit to these contentions.
discussion 
overview of pertinent statutory provisions 
in order to place the issues in this case into perspective,an understanding of the evolution of the wrongful death statute in relationship to california domestic partnership law is required.in,the legislature passed assembly bill ab,which became effective on january.among other things,ab added division,entitled domestic partner registration commencing with section,to the family code.stats,ch.this division set forth the definitions of domestic partners and domestic partnership,the procedural steps to be taken to register or to terminate a domestic partnership,the legal effect of registering a domestic partnership,and preemption provisions.
as originally enacted,family code section provided that r egistration as a domestic partner under this division shall not be evidence of,or establish,any rights existing under law other than those expressly provided to domestic partners in this division and section of the health and safety code.ab require d a health facility to allow a patient domestic partner and other specific persons to visit a patient,except under specified conditions and authorize d state and local employers to offer health care coverage and other benefits to domestic partners.legis.counsel digest,assem.bill west california legislative service,ch.the new legislation conferred no other rights.
when dana died in august,california wrongful death statute did not confer standing on a surviving domestic partner.legislation passed in,shortly after dana death,changed this.on october,assembly bill ab stats,ch.was enacted.effective january,ab amended subdivision a of section to add the decedent surviving domestic partner to the list of individuals entitled to sue for wrongful death.
ab also added subdivision f to section,which specified that for purposes of the wrongful death statute,the term domestic partners has the meaning provided in section of the family code.stats,ch.subdivision d of section,which prior to the amendment provided that the wrongful death statute applies to any cause of action arising on or after january,was reenacted without change,thereby reflecting the legislature clear intent that the amendment have retroactive application.
in,the legislature enacted assembly bill ab,the california domestic partner rights and responsibilities act of.stats,ch.among other things,ab amended family code section definition of domestic partnership.stats,ch.
ab also significantly expanded the rights and protections provided to registered domestic partners.specifically,it extend ed the rights and duties of marriage to persons registered as domestic partners on and after january.legis.counsel digest,assem.bill west cal.legislative service ch.ab added section to the family code.it provided in part a registered domestic partners shall have the same rights,protections,and benefits,and shall be subject to the same responsibilities,obligations,and duties under law,whether they derive from statutes,administrative regulations,court rules,government policies,common law,or any other provisions or sources of law,as are granted to and imposed upon spouses.family code section stats,ch,and the amendment to family code section stats,ch,became operative on january.stats,ch.
in,while this appeal was pending but after the parties had fully briefed this case,ab was enacted into law stats,ch.the legislative counsel digest to ab,as amended in the senate august,states,in part,that e xisting law provides that a cause of action for the wrongful death of a person may be asserted by his or her domestic partner,as defined.under certain circumstances,this bill would allow a cause of action for wrongful death to proceed pursuant to the above although a declaration of domestic partnership was not filed with the secretary of state,if other specified requirements are met.italics omitted.
ab amended subdivision f of the wrongful death statute.effective january,section,subdivision f,provides for the purpose of this section,domestic partner means a person who,at the time of the decedent death,was the domestic partner of the decedent in a registered domestic partnership established in accordance with subdivision b of section of the family code.
notwithstanding paragraph,for a death occurring prior to january,a person may maintain a cause of action pursuant to this section as a domestic partner of the decedent by establishing the factors listed in paragraphs to,inclusive,of subdivision b of section of the family code,as it read pursuant to section of chapter of the statutes of,prior to its becoming inoperative on january.
the amendments made to this subdivision during the regular session of the legislature are not intended to revive any cause of action that has been fully and finally adjudicated by the courts,or that has been settled,or as to which the applicable limitations period has run.italics added.
ii.under the version of the wrongful death statute,only registered surviving domestic partners have standing to sue for wrongful death 
we reject plaintiff contention that under the wrongful death statute,registration of her partnership with dana was not a prerequisite to her standing to sue for dana wrongful death.in holguin flores th,d,division seven of this court held that registration as a domestic partnership was required in order for the surviving domestic partner to sue for the wrongful death of the deceased partner.the court reached this conclusion after an extensive review of the wrongful death statute,relevant provisions of the domestic partnership law and legislative history underlying those provisions.id.at,d.
we agree with holguin and adopt its reasoning.accordingly,we hold that a surviving domestic partner can sue for wrongful death under the version of the wrongful death statute only if at the time of the decedent death the partnership had been registered with the secretary of state.inasmuch as plaintiff and dana were not registered domestic partners at the time of dana death,and plaintiff could not amend her complaint to allege registration,the trial court correctly determined that plaintiff lacked standing to sue for dana wrongful death under the version of the wrongful death statute.we nevertheless must reverse the judgment because a subsequent amendment to the wrongful death statute,which amendment applies retroactively,confers on plaintiff the requisite standing even in the absence of partnership registration.we therefore need not and do not reach the merits of plaintiff remaining contentions with respect to the wrongful death statute.we now turn to defendants challenges to the wrongful death statute.
iii.the legislature passed ab for the purpose of clarifying previous legislation 
ab was a bill designed to clarify through technical changes that various provisions of the california domestic partner rights and responsibilities act,et,added by stats,ch.apply to domestic partners.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,as introduced.this particular bill was sparked by inquiries as to whether ab applied to domestic partners registered at one of the local jurisdictions.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra.
the august,senate floor amendments to ab sought to clarify application of existing law to wrongful death actions brought by domestic partners among the provisions amended by ab was section of the civil code sic,to allow domestic partners to assert wrongful death claims in the same manner as spouses.apparently courts have interpreted the amendment made by ab to section of the civil code,as applied to deaths prior to its effective date of january,in different and conflicting ways.these amendments to ab clarify the application of the ab amendments to those wrongful death actions.the amendments will not affect actions that have been adjudged or settled or where the statute of limitations has run.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill,as amended.
contained in the legislative history materials supplied by plaintiff is a senate committee on the judiciary background information request.following as background material in explanation of the bill,is a document entitled explanation of proposed amendment to wrongful death statute code of civil procedure section for possible inclusion in ab goldberg.
this document references ab,which amended the wrongful death statute effective january,by adding surviving domestic partners to the list of individuals who had standing to bring a wrongful death cause of action.of particular interest is part c of the document entitled,the need for clarification with respect to suits for wrongful deaths occurring prior to january.it explains that u nfortunately,some of the plaintiffs for whom the legislature contemplated that ab would authorize is,plaintiffs bringing wrongful death actions for found themselves in a legal that the legislature did not contemplate.during the lifetimes of their partners,the plaintiffs that the legislature expected to benefit from the retroactive availability of the wrongful death cause of action had no reason to expect that registration would entitle them to the protections of the wrongful death statute.indeed,for the duration of years and,family code section expressly prohibited courts from considering registration as evidence of the right to bring any cause of action.
part c further explains that lawsuits filed under ab with regard to deaths have resulted in incongruent holdings,necessitating clarification by the legislature of the standing requirements.such clarification effectively would conserve judicial resources in ongoing litigation by obviating the need for the legislature to decide complex constitutional issues relating to partners previous inability to sue for wrongful death.claims barred by the statute of limitations would not be revived.in addition,legislative clarification would confirm that these surviving partners have a fair and rational legal remedy,as was intended by ab.
the legislature decision to amend the wrongful death statute therefore was fueled by its recognition that ab,as enacted,did not fully achieve its desired enjoyment of the benefit of the wrongful death statute by all surviving domestic partners for deaths occurring prior to january.references in the legislative materials to ongoing litigation and the disparate results reached therein served only to highlight the need for amendment of the wrongful death statute.contrary to defendants assertion,such references do not evince an intent on the part of the legislature to usurp the function of the judiciary.
iv.defendants have failed to demonstrate that there is a constitutional impediment to the retroactive application of ab 
defendants concede that the wrongful death statute as amended by ab provides that it is to apply retroactively.defendants argue,however,that it would be unconstitutional to apply ab retroactively here because it violates miles due process rights by substantively changing the law regarding wrongful death tort liability,thereby upsetting miles vested rights it violates the separation of powers by directing courts how to rule on pending appeals it constitutes an unconstitutional bill of attainder by singling out for punishment a small discreet group of defendants and violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws and it violates miles equal protection rights by treating her differently from other similarly situated doctors who will not be liable in wrongful death actions brought by surviving domestic partners.as we now explain,each of defendants constitutional challenges lacks merit.we discuss each in turn.
due process 
defendants contend that it would be unconstitutional to apply ab amendment of the wrongful death statute retroactively.in defendants view,ab is a legislative act that deprives them of a vested right without due process of law.we disagree.
our state high court has long held that the retroactive application of a statute may be unconstitutional if it deprives an individual of a vested right without due process of law.in re marriage of buol cal d.a right is vested when it is already possessed or legitimately acquired.standard oil feldstein d,quoting harlow carleson cal d.
the right to sue for wrongful death by a person on whom the legislature has conferred such right vests on the decedent death.once that right has vested,the legislature can not impair it.wexler city of los angeles d.defendants assert that s imple fairness dictates that the reverse must also be a potential wrongful death defendant is protected by the law from any liability at the time of decedent death the legislature should be barred from retroactively imposing liability where none existed before.we reject this argument.
defendants do not cite to any california or federal case law that compels the conclusion that a person who wrongfully or negligently causes another death has a right,vested or otherwise,to have the class of potential plaintiffs frozen as of the time of death.expansion of the class of plaintiffs who can sue for wrongful death does not change the legal definition of negligence,the standard by which liability is assessed,or the character of defendants acts or omissions.it simply enlarges the class of plaintiffs to whom defendants may be liable for their purported negligence.
defendants reliance on theodosis keeshin motor express.is misplaced.in theodosis,the question before the illinois appellate court was whether the injuries act of,which increased the limit of recovery from to,should be construed to apply retroactively.at.the illinois court concluded that it could not be applied retroactively based on case law and a specific statute prohibiting retroactive application of statutes.id.at.theodosis did not bar retroactive application of the injuries act of on due process grounds.theodosis is of no aid to defendants and,in any event,we are not bound by the decisions of courts of other states.we conclude that defendants have not demonstrated a due process violation 
separation of powers 
defendants contend that ab violates the separation of powers doctrine by attempting to legislate judicial interpretation of the ab amendment.more specifically,defendants maintain that ab constitutes an impermissible legislative intrusion into the function of the courts because the legislature is purporting to make findings interpreting the meaning of an existing statute.but interpreting a statute and determining whether it is ambiguous is the role of the courts,not the legislature.such an intrusion into the judicial function should not be permitted.accordingly,ab should not be applied in this case.we disagree with defendants characterization of ab.
separation of powers principles do not preclude the legislature from amending a statute and applying the change to both pending and future cases,though any such law can not readjudicat e or otherwise disregard judgments that are already final.citation.people bunn cal th,d,accord,mcclung employment development cal th,d.although the legislature intent in passing ab was to clarify existing law,the portion of ab that retroactively amends the wrongful death statute to allow nonregistered partners to sue for wrongful death constitutes a change in the law designed to fill a gap left open by ab.we do not construe ab amendment of the wrongful death statute to be a subsequent legislative declaration as to the meaning of a preexising statute,which in any event would not be binding or conclusive.hunt superior court cal th,d.defendants have failed to demonstrate a separation of powers violation.
bill of attainder 
there is no merit to defendants assertion that ab,to the extent it amends the wrongful death statute retroactively,violates the federal and state constitutional proscriptions against passing a bill of attainder,art.i,cl,cl.cal,art.i.l egislative acts,no matter what their form,that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the constitution.united states lovett.accord,estate of castiglioni th,fn,d california state employees flournoy d.
apart from whether ab applies to readily identifiable members of a particular group or constitutes punishment under a functional approach sagaser mccarthy d,as defendants assert,defendants do not contend,let alone attempt to demonstrate,that the wrongful death statute,as amended by ab,punishes anyone without a trial.the version of the statute merely sets forth the standing requirements that a surviving domestic partner must fulfill in order to obtain access to the courts and maintain a wrongful death action for a death occurring prior to january.defendants therefore have failed to demonstrate that ab is an unconstitutional bill of attainder.
ex post facto law 
the united states supreme court has long recognized that the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.collins youngblood,d accord,ins,d calder bull dall.opn.of chase,id.at opn.of paterson,id.at opn.of iredell.we interpret our state ex post facto provision cal,art.i,identically to that of its federal counterpart.people grant cal th,d,people mcvickers cal th,d,advocates gomez th,fn,d.
defendants acknowledge that we are powerless to set aside the united states supreme court determination that the ex post facto clause applies only to criminal laws.nevertheless,in an effort to preserve the issue for any future petition for writ of certiorari,defendants argue that the ex post facto clause applies to civil cases and would operate independently to invalidate the legislature attempt to retroactively apply ab to this case.we reject this argument.
equal protection 
defendants assert that application of ab to this case would violate the equal protection clause.they maintain that the legislature acknowledges that there are perhaps only three cases in the entire state which will be affected by this new statute thus,miles will be treated very differently from the numerous other doctors and medical groups who were sued by domestic partners for wrongful deaths that occurred prior to and who were not subject to any liability.there is no rational basis to create liability for miles and two others when all other doctors in the state are immunized from any similar liability.there is no merit to this assertion.
in order to withstand an equal protection challenge,ordinarily a legislative classification need only bear a rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.in re marriage of carpenter d.although miles and labriute cite numerous cases as authority for general principles of constitutional law,they cite no authority and no facts establishing that ab actually violates their right to equal protection of the law.
we reject outright their specious suggestion that ab was enacted for the purpose of subjecting miles and two other individuals to liability.ab was not designed to target any particular defendant.under the version of the wrongful death statut
