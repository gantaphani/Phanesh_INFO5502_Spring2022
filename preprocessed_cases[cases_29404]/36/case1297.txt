the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,codified in civil code section et,permits defrauded creditors to reach property in the hands of a transferee.mejia reed cal th,d,unspecified statutory references that follow are to the civil code.in this case,the court concluded that marioara also known as mary bucurenciu and her daughter roxanne conspired with mary former husband petru also known as peter bucurenciu to transfer property to prevent plaintiff from collecting on a judgment owed by peter.part of this scheme involved transferring property to loomis land,lli,a business in which mary and roxanne were the sole shareholders.in their appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiff,defendants mary and lli challenge the basis for liability under the ufta and raise related issues.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the ufta applies to property transactions associated with a marital dissolution and property settlement agreement.we affirm the judgment.
ufta provisions 
a very brief overview of the ufta is in order before we set forth the facts of this case.
a fraudulent conveyance under the ufta involves a transfer by the debtor of property to a third person undertaken with the intent to prevent a creditor from reaching that interest to satisfy its claim.kirkeby superior court cal th,d.a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made,if the debtor made the transfer as follows with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.
section,subdivision a sets forth creditors remedies,which include avoidance of a transfer,attachment,and the equitable remedies of injunction and receivership as well as a ny other relief the circumstances may require,subd.a c.a transfer is not voidable against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee,subd.a.
facts and proceedings 
the transactions forming the basis for this appeal are numerous and convoluted,and we do our best to set them out in a coherent manner.
in,marin filip filed a complaint for fraud against peter.a court trial ensued and,in february,judgment was entered against peter for in damages plus interest,for a total of.this court affirmed the judgment in a nonpublished opinion.filip bucurenciu.
in trying to collect on that judgment,filip learned that peter had transferred property in which he had an interest to a trust and to lli.in september,filip filed a complaint that included causes of action for conspiracy and relief under the ufta,naming as defendants peter,mary,roxanne,the bucurenciu family trust,and lli.filip also asserted a cause of action for constructive trust over property subsequently acquired by defendants titus and silvia bujdei.
during the course of this litigation,filip died and plaintiff was named in his stead.for ease of discussion,we use the term plaintiff to refer to both marin filip and his estate.
at trial,plaintiff introduced evidence relating to transfers of a number of properties in which peter had originally had an interest.briefly,this evidence demonstrated the following 
in,soon after plaintiff filed his complaint against peter,mary and peter created the petru bucurenciu family trust to hold four parcels of real estate.in keeping with the parties nomenclature,we refer to these properties by their street addresses chisom trail,chisom trail,north cirby,and north cirby.mary ran a residential care facility at the chisom property.
on november,after the trial court had announced its tentative decision to award plaintiff in damages,plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment for signature.
events were transpiring at the same time in peter and mary personal lives.on december,they entered into a settlement of agreed separation of property for divorce.this document stated that peter and mary have separated and are living separately and apart since may.the agreement added that t he parties have no community property and no community debt and it set forth a division of property.mary was to receive the chisom trail properties and peter received the properties on cirby way.the agreement also stated that peter who resides in oregon received the provided from refinancing of the chisom trail property.it continued at a later date,peter will receive an additional from mary.this payment will be the last dollar exchange between peter and mary concerning assets accumulated in the past during marriage.
according to the settlement agreement and mary testimony at trial,mary intended to build and operate a residential care home at the chisom trail property.
only weeks later,on december,mary formed lli,a company in which she and roxanne were the sole stockholders.on december,the petru bucurenciu family trust transferred the chisom trail property to lli.
despite the representation in peter and mary settlement agreement that mary owned the property at chisom trail and that there were no community debts,the construction loan application for the care facility at this site was in both peter and mary names.financing statements were signed by both peter and mary,even after the date of the settlement agreement,and some of these statements showed the chisom way address as peter mailing address.
although the property at north cirby was allocated to peter in the property agreement,this property was also transferred to lli on december.at trial,mary insisted this transfer was an innocent mistake,but the evidence also established that she continued to pay the tax bills for cirby way properties.
in august,lli transferred the property at chisom to defendants titus and sylvia bujdei in exchange for a promissory note for.the bujdeis apparently also received equipment worth as part of this transaction.
plaintiff argued that the timing and nature of these transactions evidenced efforts to hide assets and avoid the judgment.mary countered that these transfers were legitimate and reflected a division of property pursuant to the settlement agreement reached in her divorce from peter.that agreement was incorporated in their nevada divorce decree.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff.the judgment provided plaintiff has met the burden of proof with regard to each of the elements necessary to sustain a cause of action to set aside the fraudulent transfers in this case.plaintiff shall be entitled to the following relief that defendants peter,mary,roxanna bucurenciu,the petru bucurenciu family trust,lli,sylvia bujdei and titus bujdei and each of them engaged in a conspiracy to defraud plaintiff as defined in the ufta causing plaintiff damages in the amount of his attorney fees and costs that the transfer of chisom trail from the petru bucurenciu family trust to defendant lli was fraudulent as to plaintiff and the court will set aside that transfer that plaintiff may foreclose on chisom trail for partial satisfaction of his judgment against peter in the prior litigation and all defendants in this case that transfer of north cirby way from defendant petru bucurenciu family trust to defendant lli was fraudulent as to plaintiff the subsequent sale of north cirby way by defendant lli and mary was fraudulent as to plaintiff the transfer of chisom trail from defendant petru bucurenciu family trust to defendant lli was fraudulent as to plaintiff the transfer of from defendant lli to defendant titus and sylvia bujdei was fraudulent and the court will set aside that transfer that plaintiff may foreclose on chisom trail for partial satisfaction of his judgment against peter in the prior litigation and all defendants in this case and that plaintiff may seize or foreclose on any assets owned by any defendant for satisfaction of plaintiff judgment in the prior litigation or this case.
the court did not award plaintiff punitive damages,attorney fees,or costs.
the court added mary affirmative defense that she is divorced from peter does not bar plaintiff from recovery in this case.although the nevada divorce decree is valid insofar as it dissolves the marriage,the property transfers integral to the divorce were not perfected pursuant to nevada law and therefore not valid as to third persons pursuant to nevada law.as a separate and independent ground on the denial of this defense,mary was not an innocent spouse in this matter,the court finding that she knew of the existence of plaintiff claim prior to the transfers complained of by plaintiff,and the property transfers in which she participated with her husband and daughter peter and roxanna bucurenciu were in furtherance of her scheme to prevent plaintiff from foreclosing on such properties to satisfy plaintiff claim judgment.
defendants mary and lli appeal.
discussion 
relief awarded under the ufta 
defendants offer a variety of contentions in asserting that the court erred in granting relief under the ufta.none is persuasive.
initially,we note that defendants present a skewed view of the facts by reiterating that the challenged transactions were simply part of peter and mary property settlement agreement and part of mary financial planning needs,not evidence of a plot to bilk plaintiff out of his judgment.the court,however,concluded otherwise,stating explicitly in its judgment that mary was not an innocent spouse in this matter,the court finding that she knew of the existence of plaintiff claim prior to the transfers complained of by plaintiff,and the property transfers in which she participated with her husband and daughter were in furtherance of her scheme to prevent plaintiff from foreclosing on such properties to satisfy plaintiff claim judgment.while defendants no doubt wish this language would go away,wishing does not make it so.as we explain,the court characterization of defendants motives dooms many of defendants claims.the substantial evidence rule dooms the rest.
w e may not confine our consideration to isolated bits of evidence,but must view the whole record in a light most favorable to the judgment,resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the decision of the trial court.citation.we may not substitute our view of the correct findings for those of the trial court rather we must accept any reasonable interpretation of the evidence which supports the trial court decision.however,we may not defer to that decision entirely.i f the word substantial means anything at all,it clearly implies that such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance.obviously the word can not be deemed synonymous with any evidence.it must be reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value it must actually be substantial proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular case.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d.
we turn to each of defendants claims.
evidence of actual fraud.
despite the evidence outlined above,defendants nonetheless assert that there was no evidence of actual fraud to support relief.defendants claim is plainly unmeritorious.
as we have already noted,a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent under the ufta if the debtor made the transfer with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor,subd.a.whether a conveyance was made with fraudulent intent is a question of fact,and proof often consists of inferences from the circumstances surrounding the transfer.annod hamilton samuels th,d.over the years,courts have considered a number of factors,the badges of fraud id.at,d described in a legislative committee comment to section,in determining actual intent.see annod hamilton samuels,supra,at,d.effective january,those factors are now codified at section,subdivision b and include considerations such as whether the transfer was made to an insider,subd.b,whether the transferee retained possession or control after the property was transferred,subd.b,whether the transfer was disclosed,subd.b,whether the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit before the transfer was made,subd.b,whether the value received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the transferred asset,subd.b,and similar concerns.according to section,subdivision c,this amendment does not constitute a change in,but is declaratory of,existing law.
in defendants mind,only two factors are present here,namely,that the transfer was made to an insider and was made after plaintiff sued peter,and therefore can not establish actual intent.setting aside the question of whether defendants properly count the number of factors present,we note a more fundamental problem with defendants approach these factors do not create a mathematical formula to establish actual intent.there is no minimum number of factors that must be present before the scales tip in favor of finding of actual intent to defraud.this list of factors is meant to provide guidance to the trial court,not compel a finding one way or the other.see annod hamilton samuels,supra,th at,d.
here,abundant evidence was presented that defendants worked together to hide assets from plaintiff.a finding of actual intent was virtually compelled.defendants claims to the contrary are belied by the record.
value of chisom trail.
defendants assert that the property at chisom trail was not an asset for purposes of the ufta because it was encumbered for more than its fair market value.however,the evidence reflects that the property fair market value was more than defendants claim.
section,subdivision a excludes from the definition of asset under the ufta the property of a debtor to the extent it is encumbered by a valid lien.the property at chisom trail was encumbered with a loan of approximately.defendants note that lli transferred this property to the bujdeis in for no money down and a promissory note for under these circumstances,they argue,the encumbrances and fair market value were equivalent and the property was not an asset for purposes of the ufta.
while the record reflects that the property was transferred in exchange for a note equivalent to the encumbrance amount,the evidence also suggested this transaction was less than aboveboard.in march,mary had estimated the value of this property at and estimated the equipment on site at.an appraiser subsequently valued the property at.when the title company preparing the title report for this transaction uncovered the pending judgment against peter,the parties decided not to use an escrow company.instead,lli transferred the property to the bujdeis in exchange for a promissory note for.the bujdeis apparently also received worth of equipment used in operating the residential care facility on the site.
the evidence leads to the inference that mary was more interested in transferring the property to the bujdeis than in obtaining its fair market value.the bujdeis acquired the property for far less than its appraised worth.the fact that the amount promised by the bujdeis did not exceed the encumbrance amount is irrelevant under these circumstances.the court properly concluded that the property at chisom was worth more than it was sold for,and was therefore an asset for purposes of the ufta.
equalizing payments 
defendants assert the court erred in granting relief because mary transferred the property in good faith and for value.the evidence supports the trial court decision.
section,subdivision a,provides a transfer or an obligation is not voidable under the ufta against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee or oblige.
mary asserts that since she did not learn of plaintiff judgment against peter until,she could not have been acting in bad faith when she transferred the properties in.that ignores the fact that plaintiff filed suit against peter in for acts that occurred in and.mary was apparently aware of the underlying financial dealings between plaintiff and peter and admitted that she knew in january that plaintiff had filed suit against peter for more than.the transfers occurred after mary knew that a judgment against peter might be forthcoming.transfers made under those circumstances do not evidence good faith.
mary also insists that she paid peter to compensate him for the chisom trail properties.the fact that mary testified to such payments did not obligate the court to accept that testimony.no evidence
