factual and procedural background 
in november,the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction over manolito and paradise.the basis for the dependency of the minors was appellant use of methamphetamine,the lack of adequate food for the minors,and the need of paradise for medical treatment for pneumonia and a fungal infection.thereafter,on december,the court ruled the minors were dependent children,ordered reunification services for appellant,and ordered the children removed from appellant custody.the children have been in foster care ever since.
appellant failed to complete the elements of her reunification plan.moreover,for some time appellant was inconsistent in her attendance at scheduled weekly visitation sessions with the minors.thereafter,with visitation every other week,appellant visited regularly and her visits with the minors went well.
on march,the juvenile court terminated appellant parental rights.thereafter,on august,pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,this court reversed the order terminating parental rights and remanded the matter to the juvenile court for further proceedings.the basis of that stipulation was the possibility of a violation of the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act.
on october,the siskiyou county human services department the department filed a petition for modification of the juvenile court previous order granting appellant visitation with the minors.the department sought a new order denying appellant visits with the minors on the ground such visits would be detrimental to the minors.in support of its request,the department averred that the last contact the minors had with appellant was in february allegedly appellant had cancelled a scheduled april visit and did not reschedule another one.
the department also claimed the minors were more closely attached to their prospective adoptive parents than to appellant,and had not asked to see appellant.according to the department,visits between the minors and appellant would be confusing to the minors,would cause them emotional trauma,would interrupt the bonding process that is currently taking place with their foster parents,and would thereby threaten the stability of their current potential adoptive placement.
manolito counselor submitted a report in which she concluded that visits with appellant would be extremely disruptive to the minor bonding process with his prospective adoptive parents.the counselor recommended that appellant not be permitted to visit with manolito,as visits would be potentially detrimental to the growth,development,and adjustment process the minor is undergoing.
paradise counselor reported the minor had no memory of appellant.the counselor opined that visitation between appellant and paradise would be very confusing to the minor and interfere with the bonding process with paradise prospective adoptive parents.the counselor believed visitation would not be helpful to paradise and could potentially be detrimental to her.
adoption specialist hilary locke testified at the october,hearing on the petition for modification.locke acknowledged the minors had some bond with appellant.however,locke believed it would set the minors back if they were to see appellant.it would create a lot of confusion in their mind s as to where they belonged.
according to locke,the situation could not be explained to the minors,due to their ages.noting manolito was six years old and paradise just three,locke opined that neither minor had the cognitive ability to understand the nature and implications of the adoptive process.locke also told the juvenile court that,if the minors visited with appellant,the harm would come from the disruption of the minors ability to move forward where they are now.i do know that the actual visit would be a bad experience,but what happens afterwards would be detrimental.
appellant testified she wanted to visit with the minors.she could think of no reason why a visit would be harmful for the minors.appellant acknowledged she cancelled the scheduled april visit with the minors because she did not want them to see how upset she was at the prospect of not seeing them again.
at the conclusion of the hearing,counsel for appellant argued no evidence was adduced establishing that visitation between appellant and the minors would be detrimental to the minors.counsel also criticized the department for telling the minors previously that they would be adopted before the matter had become final.counsel argued that the minors should be told the truth about the underlying circumstances of the dependency proceedings.
the juvenile court found by a preponderance of the evidence that visitation between appellant and the minors would be detrimental to them.the court stated that,if the correct evidentiary standard were the stricter clear and convincing evidence standard,it would not have found detriment.according to the court,visits would be detrimental to the minors because they would be confusing and interfere with the minors adjustment process.the court also suggested that the reports by the minors counselors contained evidence of actual,rather than merely potential,detriment to the minors.
on november,the juvenile court entered an order providing in relevant part,visits between the minors and their mother shall not be allowed.on the same day,appellant filed a notice of appeal from the order.
discussion 
ithe juvenile court correctly adjudicated the termination of visitation by a preponderance of the evidence 
appellant claims the finding by the juvenile court that visitation between appellant and the minors would be detrimental to the minors was erroneous because it was based only on the preponderance of the evidence standard.according to appellant,the correct standard applicable to the visitation issue in this case is the stricter clear and convincing evidence standard.for reasons that follow,we disagree with appellant.
a.the applicable statutes call for an adjudication of detriment by a preponderance of the evidence 
section generally specifies procedures applicable to status review hearings.see,subd.a.subdivision h of section provides in any case in which the court orders that a hearing pursuant to section shall be held,it shall also order the termination of reunification services to the parent or legal guardian.the court shall continue to permit the parent or legal guardian to visit the child pending the hearing unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.italics added.
section generally specifies procedures applicable to permanency review hearings.subdivision a of section provides in pertinent part that,if the juvenile court sets a hearing pursuant to section,t he court shall continue to permit the parent or legal guardian to visit the child unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child.italics added.
an initial question arises whether these statutory requirements apply in the context of the present case.this case does not involve a review hearing or a permanency planning hearing.rather,the appeal is from an order entered following a hearing on a petition for modification brought pursuant to s
