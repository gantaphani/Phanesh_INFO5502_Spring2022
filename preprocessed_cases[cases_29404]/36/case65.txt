david smith appeals from the judgment following his conviction for willfully failing to pay child support in violation of supp.iv.he contends that the district court erred in defining willfulness in its jury instructions by omitting language smith requested and by including language to which he now objects.we conclude that the jury instructions were adequate and we affirm the judgment.
smith married joyce poirier in.their daughter jade was born in.when he married poirier,smith was attending harvard business school.he completed his master degree in business administration in,and he had earlier studied for two years at the fletcher school of law and diplomacy at tufts university.smith and poirier separated in and divorced in.smith voluntarily began paying child support upon the couple separation,and the massachusetts judgment of divorce ordered that smith continue child support payments in the amount of per week.
from to,smith worked overseas on various economic development projects.he continued to make child support payments during this time,although he and poirier disagree about whether he paid the correct amounts following modifications of the support order.poirier testified that she successfully moved for modification in january to per week and again in january to a week.smith acknowledged the increase,which he characterized as an agreement with poirier rather than a court order,but he denied knowing that his obligation increased in january.poirier testified that she moved for contempt when smith did not provide a week,and that he was present at the contempt hearing in july.smith,on the other hand,described a new agreement with poirier whereby he would continue paying a week in child support and set aside an additional a week for jade college education.
in early,smith returned to the united states to live in washington.he remained there through may.his consulting work was sporadic at best,and he invested and lost in a dry cleaning business,so his income did not provide him enough money to meet his expenses.nevertheless,he continued to fulfill his support obligations by relying on savings he had accumulated while he was working abroad.
in the spring of smith married marisela de torres,a native of venezuela,and together they moved to venezuela in may.they began a business selling books,first used and then new,operating from a house they rented and lived in.they later planned to rent a smaller house to reduce their expenses,but the house was not ready when their lease expired and they moved into smith apartment in june.they were unable to sell books from the apartment,and their retail business plummeted.when smith went to the united states in july to vacation with jade and bring her back to venezuela for a visit,his income had dropped precipitously.when he returned with jade to venezuela in august,he learned that a certificate of deposit he had in a bank in bolivia was inaccessible because he could not get in touch with the bank.by that point he had no other savings and virtually no income,and he asked poirier to agree to a reduced level of support.she refused and instead filed a motion seeking to have smith held in contempt.that motion was heard and ruled on in october.neither party was represented by counsel,and the massachusetts trial court ordered smith to pay the arrears.he paid the past due amounts two days after the hearing by borrowing the money from his brother,and at the same time smith filed a motion to modify his support obligation.the trial court agreed that smith could pay per week for thirteen weeks,at which point he would resume his regular payments.
smith complied with the order for the thirteen weeks,but he paid only one month support following that time.poirier received no further support payments from smith until may when she received three checks,each in the amount of.that same month,smith borrowed an additional from his brother michael and deposited it with the federal court.at the time of trial the court was in the process of transferring that money to poirier,who knew nothing about the money until the court spoke of it because the underlying statute required the jury only to find that smith obligation had exceeded,see a,the government did not argue the exact amount at issue.at sentencing,however,the government argued that smith owed poirier in child support payments 
smith incurred other expenses and encountered other obstacles during the two years he was paying support.marisela gave birth to their first child,andres,on december.the following february,they were able to rent a room at a church which they hoped would allow them to immediately their store,but the building needed more work than they anticipated and the store did not open until april.once opened,they soon realized that the space was not large enough to display and sell the books effectively,and in september they employed a contractor to expand it by about square feet.the construction was not completed until october,but they operated out of the space anyway because they wanted to resume sales.business picked up considerably in late,but in january marisela gave birth prematurely to their second child,althea.the smiths had no medical insurance,and althea required intensive care in a private clinic at a cost of about per day.when they could no longer come up with the money to pay for her care,they transferred her to a public hospital by borrowing money from marisela sister to pay the remaining charges.they also borrowed from marisela first husband and from her mother for various expenses associated with althea care.althea died on march.
the financial result of this personal tragedy was that the smiths owed to suppliers.it was not until they paid their outstanding debts that the business began making more money than they owed,and that is when smith resumed his child support payments in may.
smith was arrested when he entered the united states on november.he was indicted and convicted by a jury on one count of willfully failing to pay child support.the district court sentenced him to six months incarceration,fined him,and ordered smith to pay restitution in the amount of.
smith argues that the district court erred by refusing to give part of his proffered instruction on willfulness.the language he offered required the government to prove that smith did not have a good faith belief in his inability to pay.he argues that if he subjectively and in good faith believed that he did not have the ability to pay,his failure to do so could not constitute voluntary and intentional disobedience or disregard of the law.we conduct a de novo review to determine whether the instructions,taken as a whole,show a tendency to confuse or mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.united states fulmer,cir.
the government argues that smith failed to object timely and sufficiently to the instruction as given and that he therefore failed to preserve his objection.the record reveals otherwise.at the conclusion of the instructions the court called a sidebar to confer with the attorneys,explaining to the jury b efore i can let you go,i may have misstated something under the law,or i may have left something out,and the lawyers get a chance to call that to my attention now.during the sidebar,smith attorney opined that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he lacks the good faith belief that he had the ability to pay.when the court commented in response that it was satisfied with the willfulness instruction as given,smith attorney stated note my objection.the court replied noted.we conclude that smith sufficiently preserved his objection.see.no party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.
smith submitted a willfulness instruction that included the following language 
to prove wilfulness,the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that smith had sufficient funds to enable him to pay support in view of all of his financial circumstances.in doi
