some cases hit closer to home than others.deciding whether grandparents should have visitation with their grandchildren over the objection of a parent is the type of case that tugs at the hearts of most trial judges,evoking memories of personal experiences with their own good and bad.as a result,the temptation seems to be more than in other types of cases to allow the heart to rule over the letter of the law.it is for this reason that we publish here to remind our district able trial bench of the law governing these emotionally difficult cases and the need to set aside personal feelings and experiences when making their rulings.
stephanie zasueta,mother of the minor child the minor child,appeals an order granting visitation to the minor child paternal grandparents,erasmo and cynthia zasueta under family code section.stephanie contends section is unconstitutional,both facially and as applied.we conclude section,as applied in this case,unconstitutionally infringed on stephanie fundamental rights.accordingly,we reverse the order in its entirety.
factual and procedural histories 
stephanie and paul zasueta were married sometime in.on february,stephanie gave birth to the minor child.stephanie and paul separated the following year.they were in the process of obtaining a marital dissolution when paul committed suicide on june.
on september,the zasuetas filed a petition in superior court requesting visitation with the minor child.stephanie opposed the petition.a hearing was held on october.
during the hearing,cynthia testified that before her stepson paul died she saw the minor child about every other weekend.paul would usually bring the minor child over to visit with the zasuetas on saturdays at their car wash business in bakersfield.the visits would last two to three hours.the minor child never spent the night at their home.however,they occasionally would go out to eat pizza together.
cynthia stated that she had not been able to visit with the minor child since paul death.she had called stephanie at work about two months afterward and asked whether they would be able to see the minor child.stephanie told her that it was the right time.when cynthia asked why,stephanie said they first needed to sort out things regarding paul personal belongings.cynthia then told stephanie to g ive us yes or no if you will let us see her.stephanie repeated that she did not think it was the right time and indicated she would not allow any visitation with the minor child until some of paul belongings were returned to her.
cynthia testified that she and erasmo lived in a mobile home behind their car wash business.according to cynthia,their home was clean and suitable for a to visit.cynthia denied there was drinking and swearing going on constantly.she was not aware that stephanie had ever spent time inside her home to be able to observe such behavior.
cynthia indicated that the minor child was paul only child.however,she had other grandchildren,including a grandson and a granddaughter.according to cynthia,these grandchildren visited during the weekends and sometimes spent full days or spent the night at the zasuetas home.cynthia explained that she had beds for them to sleep in,and their parents would bring high chairs or whatever else they needed.
on,cynthia acknowledged that stephanie was a good mother.cynthia also confirmed that,although she did not agree with stephanie decisions,she had no grounds for suggesting that stephanie would do anything other than what she believed was best for the minor child.
erasmo testified that he occasionally drank alcohol when he got off from work.however,he did not drink around his grandchildren.erasmo loved his grandchildren and played with them when they visited.he also agreed with cynthia testimony regarding their past contact with the minor child.
stephanie testified that after paul died,members of his family,including cynthia,would call and accuse her of saying or doing something to cause paul to commit suicide.as a result,stephanie tried to avoid the zasuetas.
stephanie further testified that,prior to the separation,she used to go with paul to visit the zasuetas at their previous homes in bakersfield and tehachapi.during these visits,stephanie observed members of paul family drinking alcohol excessively and becoming loud and boisterous.according to stephanie,erasmo swore,using t he f word a lot bitch and beaver.stephanie testified she did not want the minor child to be around alcohol or any individual who used such language.she further stated that paul spoke like his father when they first started dating,but he never spoke in that manner around the minor child.
stephanie testified that she definitely thought the minor child should,at some point,spend time with the zasuetas.however,she currently objected to visitation because she believed it would be traumatizing for the minor child.stephanie explained that before paul died,the zasuetas only visited once every three or four months.when they came over,it would take a couple hours for the minor child to get used to them.stephanie was also concerned about the feelings the zasuetas would express about paul death and the minor child physical resemblance to him.
stephanie did not know where paul took the minor child on his visitation days.she had told paul not to take the minor child to his parents home because the minor child came back upset,tantrums and dirty.
on,stephanie testified that,although it might be important to the zasuetas to have a continuing relationship with their grandchildren,it was not necessarily important to the minor child,who would not know the difference.stephanie explained that the minor child had a close relationship with stephanie parents and received plenty of love.stephanie indicated that visitation with the zasuetas would be acceptable when the minor child gets older and understands what happened and wants to,that is her decision.
stephanie testified regarding another source of animosity between herself and the zasuetas.she explained that after paul died,the zasuetas took all his personal belongings,including his watch,wedding band,cologne,clothing,and home videos.stephanie felt the zasuetas had acted disrespectfully toward the minor child by leaving her without anything to remind her of her father.stephanie indicated she would be willing to allow some visitation,m aybe limited to a couple hours a month,if the zasuetas would be helpful in resolving the issues pertaining to paul belongings.
after listening to argument from both sides,the court ruled in favor of granting visitation to the zasuetas.the court reasoning in support of this ruling is reflected in the following discussion 
the court an analysis of the reaction and testimony of the mother of this child reflect to this court that she agrees this child should spend some time with the grandparents.
her response to the question in this proceeding when she said a day is too long,by implication there is some time less than a day that is not too long.i do know maybe i got spoiled because i had grandparents that i dearly enjoyed spending time with from the time i could walk until,as a matter my grandparents owned a chocolate store and gave away chocolate and ice cream and grandparents do those sort of things.
i know with my seven grandchildren today all living here in bakersfield,my my wife does the best she can to spoil those kids and that is what grandparents should do and that is what grandchildren should expect grandparents to do and,therefore,it makes it very difficult for me to make a finding in a case like this there is not to be a continuing relationship between a grandparent and a child.
i think by virtue of analyzing the testimony of your client that she would agree at least by implication she has agreed there should be some time spent with the child by the grandparents.
kilpatrick stephanie counsel she said some time in the future.
the court when they are 
kilpatrick i do know that,your honor.
the court that is wrong.that relationship should start today when this child is two plus years old and continue.certainly these allegations of drinking and swearing the court has to take with a grain of salt when that information is provided.
the fact that the home is not clean,that is significant an allegation but apparently there are other grandchildren that spend time with these folks and that time can be spent with them in other situations.
kilpatrick your honor,that is because the other parents make that choice.
the court this court is going to make a choice.this court is going to make a choice that it is appropriate for this relationship to continue and i would certainly agree with stephanie that a day is a long time with a and not appropriate at this point in time.i think what is appropriate is a visitation plan.
a couple times a month maybe,and just to identify maybe the first and third weekend of each month starting out with one hour visitation i n the meantime these folks have to get their head out of the sand and straighten the relationship around and to not have a relationship between a and her deceased husband parents is ridiculous.that is the kind of relationship that should be fostered and not ignored and both sides of this process need to address that issue in their own thoughts.
kilpatrick will the court then make a finding that my client is an unfit parent you have to do that.
the court i am not going to do that.she is unfit if she continues to maintain a position that her child can not develop a relationship with her grandparents so in that regard,yes,she is unfit.i do think she is unfit in other ways.
she is an intelligent and attractive young lady and i can not go back and undo what has been done in her life.these folks have to get on and not make detrimental comments to her about causing her husband to take his life or whatever.that is a subject that needs to be ignored.
kilpatrick is the court saying there is clear and convincing evidence it would be detrimental to the child because my client objects to the visitation.
the court no,it is the relationship that this child is deprived of because of that attitude.come back in six months.we will set a date today for further hearing and review of this matter.
on october,the court entered its order on the zasuetas petition,compelling visitation to occur on the first and third saturdays of each month for a period of one hour,then six months later increase to one and hours,then six months later increased to two hours.in so ordering,the court made the following finding 
the biological mother,stephanie zasueta,is unfit.the court hereby finds that the biological mother decision to not continue or foster a relationship between the paternal grandparents and the subject minor by objecting to grandparent visitation in and of itself,at least as far as that decision is concerned,is the decision of an unfit mother.the court further finds that in other areas of parenting that stephanie zasueta is a fit mother,however,as to the objection to grandparent visitation the court finds that said objection is in and of itself,inherently an unfit decision and,therefore,as to that decision alone,stephanie zasueta is an unfit mother.
on december,stephanie timely filed her notice of appeal challenging the court ruling.on january,we granted stephanie petition for a writ for supersedeas,staying enforcement of the visitation order pending resolution of the appeal.
discussion 
the court granted the zasuetas visitation with the minor child pursuant to section,which provides 
a if either parent of an unemancipated minor child is deceased,the children,siblings,parents,and grandparents of the deceased parent may be granted reasonable visitation with the child during the child minority upon a finding that the visitation would be in the best interest of the minor child.
b in granting visitation pursuant to this section to a person other than a grandparent of the child,the court shall consider the amount of personal contact between the person and the child before the application for the visitation order.
c this section does not apply if the child has been adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent of the child.any visitation rights granted pursuant to this section before the adoption of the child automatically terminate if the child is adopted by a person other than a stepparent or grandparent of the child.
stephanie contends section is facially unconstitutional because it interferes with a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution and violates the right to privacy set forth in the california constitution.cal,art.i.we need not decide whether section is unconstitutional on its face because its application here unconstitutionally infringed upon fundamental parenting rights protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
background 
the controlling case authority is troxel granville,d.in troxel,the parents of the deceased father of two girls were granted increased visitation pursuant to an order under washington nonparental visitation statute.the statute allows any person to petition the court for visitation rights at any time and provides visitation rights may be granted to any person when it may serve the child best interest.the washington statute provides any person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time including,but not limited to,custody proceedings.the court may order visitation rights for any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.troxel,supra,at,quoting.the children mother in troxel had sought to limit the grandparents visitation to once a month.however,the trial court found more extensive visitation was in the children best interest even though there were no allegations or findings the mother was an unfit parent.troxel,supra,at.
the washington supreme court reversed the trial court order,holding the nonparental visitation statute unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental right of parents to rear their children.id.at.the washington supreme court identified two infirmities in the statute which,in its view,rendered the statute facially invalid the failure of the statute to require harm to the child to justify a disputed visitation order,and the statute authorization of any person at any time to petition for and to receive visitation rights subject only to a standard troxel,supra,at.conc.opn.of souter.
the united states supreme court affirmed.a plurality of the high court held the washington statute was unconstitutional as applied to the circumstances of that case after citing extensive precedent,the plurality recognized that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.troxel,supra,at.the plurality then held that the washington statute,as applied,unconstitutionally infringed on that fundamental parental right.we quote extensively from the plurality reasoning to shed light on our conclusion that section,as applied to the facts of this case,unconstitutionally infringed upon stephanie fundamental right as a parent to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of the minor child.
the washington nonparental visitation statute is breathtakingly broad.according to the statute text,a ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time,and the court may grant such visitation rights whenever visitation may serve the best interest of the child.citation.that language effectively permits any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent children to review.once the visitation petition has been filed in court and the matter is placed before a judge,a parent decision that visitation would not be in the child best interest is accorded no deference should the judge disagree with the parent estimation of the child best interests,the judge view necessarily prevails.thus,in practical effect,in the state of washington a court can disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition,based solely on the judge determination of the
