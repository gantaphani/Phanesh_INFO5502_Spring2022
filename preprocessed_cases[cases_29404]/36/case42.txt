in,dominik kufner filed a petition in the united states district court for the district of rhode island alleging that his wife,tina kufner,wrongfully removed the couple two minor sons,and,from germany to rhode island.he sought an order returning them to germany in his custody,pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,hereinafter hague convention,as implemented by the international child abduction remedies act,et.tina argued that returning their sons to germany would create a grave risk of harm,a defense to a petition under article b of the hague convention.the district court granted dominik petition and ordered that the sons be returned to germany.
tina kufner appeals,arguing,inter alia,that the district court erred by concluding that she had wrongfully removed the sons and that the hague convention violates the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.because none of her arguments has any merit,we affirm.
tina is a united states citizen and native of rhode island.dominik is a german citizen who owns a business in munich,germany.they married in and settled in munich.in,they had their first son,and in they had a second son,tina and dominik began having marital problems and they separated in.during the separation period,they informally agreed to share time with their sons.at first,this arrangement worked well because dominik traveled often,but in early their relationship began to deteriorate after tina discovered graphic photographs of the sons taken by dominik.
dominik took photographs of the sons at his house in.tina submitted of them to the court in support of her article b defense that her sons would face a grave risk of harm if returned to germany.the district court described of the photographs as relatively innocuous pictures of the children playing and laughing,naked,in the living room of dominik house.the other four photographs were more graphic in nature.dominik stored the photographs on his computer.
tina learned of the photographs in january.in early february,dominik spent ten days alone with the sons during ski week,a german school holiday.after returning from the ski week holiday,the sons began to display disturbing physical symptoms,including,nervous eye twitching,sleeplessness,and nighttime crying and screaming.the parents blamed each other for the problems.
tina german lawyer sent a letter to dominik demanding an explanation for the photographs.when she did not receive an adequate response,she petitioned for sole custody in the german court.dominik feared that she would leave the country with the sons,so he obtained an order requiring her to deposit their passports with the court.the german court ordered a home study for both parents homes and talked with the sons in camera.it then issued a written opinion,holding that the parents must exercise joint parental custody,specifying the dates on which the parents can have access to the sons and where they can travel with them,and ordering that their passports be returned to tina.
the next few months were comparatively peaceful,but in summer,dominik petitioned the german court for sole custody.the court requested a social worker with the department of youth and families to conduct an evaluation of the parents and the sons.the social worker recommended that the court deny his petition for sole custody and expressed concern about the acrimony between the parents.also in summer,the parents feuded over medical care.had developed problems with his ear,nose,and throat.tina believed that he needed an operation on his adenoids,but dominik asserted that an operation was not medically necessary.this dispute further increased the tension between the parents.
tina petitioned the german court to suspend dominik visitation rights or,in the alternative,to permit only supervised visitation.four days later,she petitioned for permission to relocate the sons to the united states.without ruling on either petition,the german court ordered an investigation of the photographs.a company was supposed to conduct this investigation,but,because of a file mixup,it never received the photographs and it never conducted the investigation.instead,the gwg performed a custody evaluation,including an evaluation of the photographs.
the gwg appointed a certified psychologist to interview each member of the family.after conducting the interviews,she advised the court by letter that both parents should retain contact with the sons.the gwg later produced a psychological expert opinion that concluded that dominik personality was within the normal range,that the interactions between him and the sons were positive and loving,and that they were happy,healthy,and displayed development.the report concluded that the photographs had not negatively affected the sons.it further warned that the continuing deterioration of the parents relationship was harming them,and it noted that tina was unable to appreciate his role in raising them.
on october,without a prior hearing,the german court issued a temporary ruling on access and contact,which was to be followed until the court determined the final merits of the custody case.in this ruling,the court ordered that dominik be given rights of access to the sons and that the parents must refrain from having disputes in their presence.the court concluded that the photographs did not indicate that he was a pedophile and that he did not inappropriately encourage sexualized behavior of the sons.
on november,the german court issued an injunction structuring dominik visitation rights over the christmas holidays.the injunction forbade tina from traveling to the united states with the sons.the court ordered her to deposit their american passports with the department of youth and families.on december,the court conducted a hearing and met with the sons in the absence of their parents.later,at the same hearing,the parents agreed to a settlement on visitation rights during the holidays that conformed with the november injunction.the agreement required tina to deposit the sons american passports with the united states consulate and to refrain from traveling to the united states over the christmas holidays.
in january,in direct violation of the german court orders,tina obtained the sons american passports from the consulate and fled to the united states without notifying dominik or the german court.on january,dominik filed a petition in the district court seeking return of the sons to germany in his custody.while this case was pending,on february,he obtained a temporary order from a german court awarding him full custody.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c and with the consent of the parties,the district court appointed sharon as guardian ad litem and attorney for the sons.recommended that the district court view all of the photographs,appoint an independent expert with clinical training and expertise to determine whether the photographs were pornographic,consider the german child welfare agency view on the photographs and its evaluation of the parents,and analyze the effectiveness of the german investigations.after interviewing the sons,determined that they had taken an unhealthy view of their power and responsibility in the custody determination,and that any more involvement of the children in the proceeding would be significantly harmful.reported that the sons stated they were attached to their mother and,if asked,they would want to live with her.
upon recommendation,the district court ordered the parents to take to a physician to address his medical issues.after a sleep test,the physician diagnosed with mild to moderate sleep apnea and recommended surgery to remove his tonsils and adenoids,but he stated that this surgery was not urgently needed.
the district court heard evidence from the parties.the heart of tina argument was the article b grave risk of harm defense based on the photographs of the sons and the alleged failure of german officials to take the photographs seriously.the district court relied heavily on its independent expert in pediatrics,child abuse,child sexual abuse,and child pornography,carol
