stephen stephen,the father of justice,devin,stephen,and hunter,appeals the termination of his parental rights pursuant to welfare and institutions code section stephen contends the juvenile court should have granted an evidentiary hearing on his petition to modify the court earlier rulings that he had been given notice of the proceedings as required by law and that the san diego county health and human services agency agency had made reasonable search efforts to find him.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,agency took justice,seven years old,devin,five years old,stephen,three years old,and hunter,one year old,into protective custody after their mother,tricia,was arrested for using a stolen credit card 
tricia identified the children father as stephen and said she believed he was living in arizona.stephen and tricia were married in june tricia said they had separated and she was divorcing him.agency initiated a parent search for stephen.susan,the maternal grandmother maternal grandmother who was living in arizona at the time,told the social worker that stephen was released from jail on september.the maternal grandmother subsequently moved to idaho.
on october,agency filed dependency petitions on behalf of the children,alleging there was a substantial risk of harm to them because they had been exposed to domestic violence between tricia and her boyfriend,subd.b,and they had been left without any provision for support because tricia was incarcerated and the whereabouts of stephen were unknown,subd.g.at the detention hearing,tricia filled out paternity questionnaires for all four children in which she identified stephen as their father and provided his birth date and social security number.the court ordered agency to conduct a reasonable search to locate stephen and notify him of the proceedings.
on october,the court made true findings on the section,subdivision b,allegations and sustained the petitions.the court found notice had been given as required by law,stephen whereabouts remained unknown,and reasonable search efforts had been made.
in anticipation of the upcoming disposition hearing,the social worker reported that when she searched the internet for stephen using his name,there were no results.the worker internet search using the address listed on stephen arizona driver license showed that stephen had used the address of the maternal grandmother and her husband.the social worker telephoned the maternal grandmother,who said stephen used the address without permission.on november,the social worker received information listing a different phoenix address colter street from the parent search.the social worker mailed a parent notification letter to stephen at that address the letter stated the four children were in protective custody,listed the date for the next hearing and explained how to have an attorney appointed for him.
at the november,dispositional hearing,the court ordered tricia to comply with her case plan.the court also made notice findings as to stephen.
on november,after being notified by postal officials in phoenix that stephen was not known at the colter street address,agency parent search clerk sent a letter to the maricopa county sheriff in phoenix seeking assistance in locating stephen.a sheriff employee wrote a note on the letter that an individual with stephen name and social security number was in custody in the durango jail and mailed back the letter to the agency.apparently,agency received the letter in early december.the new social worker did not pursue this lead,and as late as april,was reporting to the court that stephen whereabouts were unknown.
on may,agency mailed a parent notification letter to stephen at the durango jail.the letter was returned to agency because stephen was no longer in custody.
for the upcoming review hearing,agency recommended services be terminated and a section hearing be set.after visiting the children twice,tricia had moved to arizona the preceding november.tricia did not recontact the children until march,when she visited them for one and hours at a fast food restaurant.it was tricia last contact with the children.
at the review hearing on may,the court found notice had been given as required by law to all parties except stephen,whose status at that time was alleged father.tricia had not enrolled in any of the reunification services offered to her.the court terminated services and set a section hearing for the children.
at the end of june,agency prepared a notice of the upcoming section hearing for stephen addressed at the arizona state prison in buckeye,arizona.stephen was served with the notice on july.at that time,stephen signed a waiver of the notice requirement for notice of a section hearing.
on october,stephen wrote a letter to the court,saying he would never relinquish my parental rights and did not understand why the agency concluded he did not want his children.stephen said he did not have time to reply earlier or the postage to do so.he also said he had written and attempted to telephone the maternal grandmother at her previous phoenix address and telephone number,but the letters were returned and the telephone was disconnected.
on october,the court appointed counsel for stephen and distributed stephen letter to all counsel.
on december,the court found stephen to be the presumed father of the children and amended the petitions.
meanwhile,the court continued the section hearing for several months to provide notice to tricia.
in january,stephen telephoned the adoption assessment worker and left a voice mail message requesting contact with the children.later that month,the worker wrote a letter to stephen,telling him he could write the children through her,the letters would have to be appropriate,the letters would be given to the children therapist,who would decide when they would be shared with the children.in reply,stephen wrote the worker,stating that he adamantly opposed adoption of his children,tricia lied and hid the children from him,but for his incarceration,the children would be with him,his release date from prison is august,and while in prison he had completed a parenting class and various trade courses.
on january,stephen filed a section motion to modify the court november,notice findings the petition alleged that a parent search conducted with due diligence would have uncovered stephen whereabouts much earlier,and agency due process violation was a per se violation of the best interests of the children.the petition sought to vacate the section reference order and to set a new disposition hearing in which a case plan for stephen could be ordered.
on february,the juvenile court denied an evidentiary hearing on stephen section motion.proceeding to the section hearing,the court found it was likely that each child would be adopted if parental rights were terminated,none of the statutory exceptions to adoption existed,and adoption was in the best interests of each child.the court terminated the parental rights of stephen and tricia.
discussion 
stephen contends the juvenile court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on his section motion because the petition established the requisite prima facie showings for a hearing.stephen also contends the denial of a hearing violated his due process rights.
relevant law 
due process requires that a parent is entitled to notice that is reasonably calculated to apprise him or her of the dependency proceedings and afford him or her an opportunity to object.in re melinda d.the child welfare agency must act with diligence to locate a missing parent.see,david superior court th,d.reasonable diligence denotes a thorough,systematic investigation and an inquiry conducted in good faith.in re arlyne th,d.
however,there is no due process violation when there has been a good faith attempt to provide notice to a parent who is transient and whose whereabouts are unknown for the majority of the proceedings.in re melinda,supra,d at.see also mullane central hanover bank trust.in the case of persons missing or unknown,employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permit
