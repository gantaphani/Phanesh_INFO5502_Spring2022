factual and procedural background 
in july terrance and his siblings,rodney and rachel collectively the minors were taken into protective custody because of ongoing domestic violence between cherilynn and terrance father,edwin b.in september the minors became dependents of the juvenile court and were placed in care based on findings edwin physically abused them.despite having received reunification services,cherilynn had not regained custody of the minors by the review hearing.the court terminated services and set a section selection and implementation hearing for terrance.
the minors were originally in separate placements,but were later placed with the same caregiver,who was willing to provide a permanent home for all of them.the permanent plan for rodney and rachel was another planned permanent living arrangement,with the prospect of eventually returning them to cherilynn custody.
the social worker for the san diego county health and human services agency agency recommended adoption as terrance permanent plan.she assessed terrance as adoptable based on his age,the commitment of his current caregiver to adopt him and the existence of other families willing to adopt a child like terrance.in the social worker opinion,terrance relationships with cherilynn and his siblings did not outweigh his need for stability and a permanent home,and terminating parental rights would not be detrimental to terrance.
at a contested selection and implementation hearing,the court received into evidence agency reports and heard the testimony of two social workers.the court found,by clear and convincing evidence,it was likely terrance would be adopted and none of the circumstances of section,subdivision c applied to preclude terminating parental rights.finding adoption was in terrance best interests,the court terminated parental rights and referred terrance for adoptive placement.
cherilynn appealed the judgment terminating her parental rights,contending the evidence was insufficient to support the court finding the beneficial relationship did not apply to preclude terminating her parental rights the court failed to ensure compliance with the notice provisions of icwa and terrance received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney had a conflict of interest when he represented all three minors.
in a nonpublished opinion,in re terrance b,supra,this court held substantial evidence supported the juvenile court finding there was no beneficial relationship within the meaning of section,subdivision c a and cherilynn had not shown minors counsel had an actual conflict of interest.we further held,however,the juvenile court failed to ensure compliance with the notice provisions of icwa.consequently,we issued a limited reversal and remanded the matter with directions that the court order agency to comply with icwa notice requirements and case law interpreting icwa.our disposition provided that i f,after proper inquiry and notice,a tribe claims terrance is an indian child,the juvenile court shall proceed in conformity with all provisions of icwa.if,on the other hand,no response is received or no tribe claims that terrance is an indian child,the judgment terminating parental rights shall be reinstated.
following the issuance of our remittitur,cherilynn filed a section modification petition,alleging circumstances had changed in that rodney and rachel were recently returned to her.cherilynn requested the juvenile court reverse the order terminating parental rights,conduct a new selection and implementation hearing to consider this new evidence,and place terrance with cherilynn and the siblings.as to best interests,cherilynn alleged a bonding study showed there is a highly significant and positive relationship between terrance and his siblings.thus,she claimed,terminating parental rights substantially interferes with terrance sibling relationships and maintaining this relationship outweighs the permanency and stability of adoption.
at a hearing to address the effect of our remittitur,the court ordered agency to comply with icwa notice provisions as discussed in the nonpublished opinion,in re terrance,supra.the court stated it would set a special hearing to address only compliance with icwa notice and,if proper notice had occurred,it would reinstate the judgment terminating parental rights.counsel for cherilynn then asked for a hearing on her section modification petition,arguing the court should consider new evidence as to the beneficial sibling relationship exception of section,subdivision c e based on the siblings recent return to cherilynn care.the court denied the request for a hearing,finding our opinion directed a limited reversal and remand for icwa notice only,and the opinion did not permit the juvenile court to revisit issues from the selection and implementation hearing that were previously resolved and affirmed on appeal 
discussion 
the issue before us is whether the juvenile court had jurisdiction to hear cherilynn section modification petition when the matter before it had been remanded for the limited purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of icwa.cherilynn contends the juvenile court mistakenly believed its jurisdiction was limited by this court remittitur,resulting in the erroneous failure to hear evidence of terrance current circumstances in accordance with the court continuing duty to consider a minor best interests.she asserts because the judgment terminating her parental rights was reversed,the juvenile court should have considered the beneficial sibling relationship exception of section,subdivision c e as presented in her section modification petition.
the propriety of limited reversals and remands in icwa cases was recently addressed by this court in in re francisco th,d francisco.in that case,the appellants challenged our practice of issuing limited reversals in cases with icwa irregularities by which we order the judgment terminating parental rights to be reinstated if no indian tribe intervenes after proper notice is given.francisco at,d.appellants argued that once the judgment terminating parental rights is reversed,due process requires a new selection and implementation hearing under section to allow the court to consider changes in circumstances that affect the child adoptability before his or her biological ties are severed.francisco at,d.appellants also argued we act in excess of our jurisdiction by ordering the juvenile court to revisit only the icwa issue,essentially requiring the court to ignore the legislative mandate for a selection and implementation hearing based on a minor current adoptability.francisco,supra,at,d.
in rejecting both arguments,we held the practice of issuing limited reversals is legally authorized,consistent with the best interests of children,and in keeping with fundamental principles of appellate practice.francisco,supra,th at,d.first,we noted the appellate court power to order a retrial on a limited issue is based on the rationale that when an issue can be separately tried without prejudice to the litigants,requiring a complete retrial would unnecessarily add to the burden of already overcrowded court calendars and could be unduly harsh on the parties.citation.ibid.the appellate court order for a retrial on a limited issue,contained in its
