discussion 
although mother and father agreed to the termination of their parental rights,we address the merits of their contentions because icwa is intended to safeguard the interest of the tribe that may wish to claim the child as a member,and that interest may not be waived,forfeited,or lost by reason of any omission or failure by an individual.in re th,failure to give tribal notice is not an issue forfeited by a parent failure to object.
indian child 
father contends the juvenile court erred by finding icwa does not apply in this case.
we apply the substantial evidence standard of review to the juvenile court icwa findings.fresno county of children and family services superior court th.
icwa procedural and substantive requirements must be followed in involuntary child custody proceedings when an indian child is involved.in re jeffrey th.an indian child,under federal and california law,is defined as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe,subd.a.
in regard to the first option being a member membership criteria are the tribe prerogative,membership is not a term defined by federal or state statutes.a tribe membership decision is conclusive for purposes of icwa.in re th.the letter from the cherokee nation reflects needs to apply for membership in the tribe.the tribe requested birth certificates be provided in order to officially establish direct lineage to a tribe member.received a letter from the tribe reflecting they needed to complete the membership application.the evidence reflects was not a member of the tribe because he had not applied,and his lineage had not been officially established via birth certificates.accordingly,does not qualify as an indian child based upon membership in the tribe.
we now address the second option being eligible for membership and being the biological child of a tribe member.the evidence reflects is eligible for membership,because the tribe sent a letter reflecting is eligible for enrollment and affiliation with cherokee nation by having direct lineage to an enrolled member.however,there is no evidence reflecting is the biological child of a tribe member.rather,the evidence reflects is the biological great,of a tribe member.there is nothing in the record indicating mother or father are members of the tribe.the cherokee nation letter reflects only great,was a member,and the tribe requested birth certificates tracing back to the great,in order to establish lineage.thus,it does not appear mother or father were members of the tribe.as a result,there is not substantial evidence of being an indian child via the second option because he is not the child of a tribe member.therefore,the juvenile court correctly found icwa does not apply in this case,because is not an indian child.
mother asserts qualified as an indian child pursuant to section,subdivision e,which provides,a determination by an indian tribe that a child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in that tribe,or testimony attesting to that status by a person authorized by the tribe to provide that determination,shall be conclusive.information that the child is not enrolled or eligible for enrollment in the tribe is not determinative of the child membership status unless the tribe also confirms in writing that enrollment is a prerequisite for membership under tribal law or custom.
the first sentence of the subdivision concerns the conclusive nature of the determination by the indian tribe.we agree the tribe conclusively determined is eligible for membership.we have found no dispute on the conclusive nature of the determination.however,being eligible for membership does not equate with being an indian child as discussed ante.therefore,we continue with our analysis.
the second sentence of the subdivision concerns a child who has been determined to not be enrolled or eligible for enrollment in the tribe.in this case,has been found to be eligible for enrollment,so the not eligible language is inapplicable in this case.accordingly,we focus on the not enrolled portion of the second sentence.in the tribe letter to the department,it wrote,enclosed you will find a membership application,and cherokee nation is not empowered to intervene in this matter unless the or eligible parent apply for and receive membership.italics added.the letter goes on to reflect the tribe may intervene in the case when father become enrolled members meeting federal icwa compliance.thus,the tribe confirmed in writing that was not a member of the tribe because he had not yet receive d membership.
additionally,the letter reflects is eligible for enrollment and affiliation with cherokee nation by having direct lineage to an enrolled member.accordingly,the tribe also confirmed in writing that is not enrolled in the tribe his ancestor was enrolled.in sum,the tribe letter confirms in writing that is not enrolled in the tribe and is not a member of the tribe.therefore,to the extent icwa could be applicable pursuant to section,subdivision e,it is not applicable in this case.
notice and inquiry 
father contends the department erred by not continuing to provide notice to the tribe,and the court erred by not ordering the department to provide notice to the tribe.father also contends the department and court erred by not continuing to inquire into indian ancestry.
icwa protects the interests of indian children and promotes the stability and security of indian tribes by establishing minimum standards for,and permitting tribal participation in,dependency actions.citations.if there is reason to believe a child that is the subject of a dependency proceeding is an indian child,icwa requires that the child indian tribe be notified of the proceeding and its right to intervene.citations.in re th.
accordingly,federal and state law require that the notice sent to the potentially concerned tribes include available information about the maternal and paternal grandparents and,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates place of birth and death current and former addresses tribal enrollment numbers and other identifying data.citations.to fulfill its responsibility,the agency has an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire about,and if possible obtain,this information.citations.thus,a social worker who knows or has reason to know the child is indian is required to make further inquiry regarding the possible indian status of the child,and to do so as soon as practicable,by interviewing the parents,indian custodian,and extended family members to gather the information required in paragraph of subdivision a of section citation.that information shall include a ll names known of the indian child biological parents,grandparents,and,or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases,as well as their current and former addresses,birthdates,places of birth and death,tribal enrollment numbers,and any other identifying information,if known.citation.because of their critical importance,icwa notice requirements are strictly construed.citation.in re,supra,th at.thus,an agency must inquire into the identifying information,and include that information in the notice to the tribes.
challenges to the adequacy of icwa notices and the department inquiry into a child indian ancestry are reviewed for substantial evidence.in re rebecca th,fourth,div.two substantial evidence for the duty of inquiry see also in re merrick th,to determine whether notice was adequate,court must review whether sufficient information was provided by the agency.
we address the inquiry issue first.as set forth ante,the department was required to inquire into parents,grandparents,and names,addresses,birthdates,birth places,dates of death,and tribal information,subd.a c.on october,father alerted the department that may have indian ancestry.a department social worker spoke to,who supplied information about great,being cherokee.the notice sent to the tribes included mother and father names,birthdates,and places of birth.it also included the possible tribe affiliations for father.the notice included grandmothers names,his maternal grandmother date of birth,and his paternal grandmother date and place of death.the notice had information about paternal grandfather name and possible tribal affiliations.also included was name,address,date of birth and birth place,and possible tribal affiliations,along with great,name,date of birth,place of birth,tribal enrollment number,possible tribal affiliations,year of death,and place of death.
based upon the information provided in the notice,the cherokee nation was able to determine was eligible for enrollment in the tribe due to having direct lineage to an enrolled member,specifically paternal great.given the amount of information in the notice,and that the information was sufficient for the cherokee nation to find a direct lineage,which caused to be eligible for enrollment,we conclude there is substantial evidence reflecting the department satisfied its duty of inquiry regarding familial information.
the same analysis applies to the notice issue.the notice was sent to the tribes in october,prior to the january jurisdiction hearing.the notice was sent to the cherokee nation,which found to be eligible for enrollment based upon the information provided in the notice.the foregoing is substantial evidence that the notice sent was sufficient,because it permitted the cherokee nation to locate direct ancestry.
it appears the notice may have been deficient in that it failed to include a copy of birth certificate,subd.a e.however,this error is harmless,because,even without the birth certificate,the tribe was able to locate direct lineage to an enrolled member.in re th,where notice has been received by the tribe errors or omissions in the notice are reviewed under the standard.the tribe later requested copies of all the birth certificates for,father,grandfather,and,to officially establish the direct lineage,presumably for the application process however,the failure to include birth certificate in the notice was harmless because the lineage was still found without the birth certificate.
in sum,the inquiry and notice were sufficient,and any error related to the birth certificate not being included in the notice was harmless.the department gathe
