we address the construction and application of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,which deals with the public disclosure of the juvenile records of deceased dependent minors.we hold that redaction,from the records pertaining to a deceased child,of information about a living child is not the sole statutory means by which the juvenile court may protect the interests of the living child a finding by the juvenile court that disclosure of information relating to the deceased child is detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical,or emotional of ibid.a living child is sufficient to justify withholding some or all of the information about to the deceased child and implies a finding that redaction would be insufficient to protect the interests of the living child substantial evidence is the proper standard for the review of such express and implied findings by the juvenile court and the juvenile court order in this case refusing to release any information about the deceased child is supported by substantial evidence.
summary of facts and proceedings below 
on february,jaime,a minor and a dependent child under the provisions of welfare and institutions code section died while in the care of a foster mother the foster mother was later charged with the murder of jaime.
on march,appellant amy pack,publisher of the visalia times delta,filed a petition in kings county superior court for disclosure pursuant to section,subdivision a the subdivision or subdivision a,of all juvenile case files pertaining to jaime m.the petition was summarily denied on the same date.pack then filed a request for reconsideration,citing recent amendments to subdivision a.on march,appellant mcclatchy company,doing business as the fresno bee mcclatchy,filed a similar petition for access to jaime juvenile court files this petition was amended on march.mcclatchy sought disclosure of all jaime juvenile court records covered by section,subdivision e and california rules of court,rule,subdivision a 
a hearing on both press petitions was set for april.on april,the california department of social services department moved for permission to file opposition,under seal,to the petitions for disclosure.this motion was denied.no written opposition or objection to either petition was filed by the department or by any other person or entity.
at the hearing on the petitions,respondent kings county human services agency hsa,the department,both parents,and a court appointed advocate for jaime appeared and orally objected to any disclosure of jaime juvenile records.the juvenile court considered the arguments of the parties and approved the parties agreement that the court review the records in camera.the court performed the review and then,on may,denied both press petitions.the court found that release of any information from jaime files would be detrimental to the safety,protection,physical,or emotional of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case,subd.a.
both mcclatchy and pack subsequently asked the court to make additional findings explaining why appropriate redaction of jaime records would not adequately protect the interests of the other child.the court did not respond and took no further action on the petitions.
on july,pack filed her timely notice of appeal from the order denying her petition on july,mcclatchy filed its timely notice of appeal.only hsa is participating as a respondent on these appeals 
discussion 
appellants suggest that redaction was the required remedy under subdivision a.we understand appellants to mean that redaction was the only tool available to the juvenile court to protect information pertaining to any child other than jaime,and consequently,the juvenile court was without power to deny appellants all access to jaime records.
section sets the current parameters of this state policy with respect to the confidentiality of juvenile records and governs the release of such records.in re keisha,supra,th,d see also superior court cal d,in re tiffany th,d in re michael th,d lorenza superior court d.navajo express superior court d.the juvenile court has both the sensitivity and expertise to make decisions about access to juvenile records and is in the best position to consider any other statutes or policies which may militate against access.in re maria d.in re keisha t,supra,th at,d superior court,supra,cal d at.
subdivision a,which concerns the records of deceased dependents,was amended in.as so amended,it states 
notwithstanding any other law and subject to subparagraph a of paragraph which is not pertinent to this appeal,juvenile case files,except those relating to matters within the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to section or,which pertain to a deceased child who was within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to section,shall be released to the public pursuant to an order by the juvenile court after a petition has been filed and interested parties have been afforded an opportunity to file an objection.any information relating to another child or which could identify another child,except for information about the deceased,shall be redacted from the juvenile case file prior to release,unless a specific order is made by the juvenile court to the contrary.except as provided in this paragraph,the presiding judge of the juvenile court may issue an order prohibiting or limiting access to the juvenile case file,or any portion thereof,of a deceased child only upon a showing that release of the juvenile case file or any portion thereof is detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical,or emotional of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.
the legislation was prompted by the deaths of several dependent children.the legislature decided that opening the records of a deceased child to public scrutiny would promote free investigation,uncover any government culpability,and prompt necessary changes in the system of placing and monitoring dependents.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended may.
subdivision a constitutes one of several inroads into the barrier of confidentiality that protects juvenile records.though it is still the legislature intent that juvenile court records,in general,should be confidential,subd.b,this policy has become less absolute,and the lawmakers in the recent past have authorized significant departures from it for example,since a juvenile court may permit,upon good cause shown,any person to inspect the records of a juvenile dependent,subd.a m,as amended by stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.newspapers and other representatives of the press qualify as persons under this provision.see in re keisha,supra,th,d.in addition,certain specific categories of individuals may inspect juvenile records without first obtaining a court order.as of and after,the list includes city attorneys and prosecutors who handle criminal or juvenile cases,judges,referees,hearing officers,and law enforcement officers actively participating in criminal or juvenile proceedings involving the minor,the superintendent of the school district where the minor is enrolled,members of child protective agencies,children multidisciplinary teams,and persons or agencies providing treatment or supervision of the minor,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.
in cases not governed by subdivision a where a prior court order is required for is,whenever any person other than one who falls within a specified category seeks juvenile court must inspect the file in question and determine what information,if any,should be released,subd.a m in re keisha t,supra,th at,d.the court must take into account any restrictions on disclosure found in other statutes,the general policies in favor of confidentiality and the nature of any privileges asserted,and compare these factors to the justification offered by the applicant.subd.a in re keisha t,supra,th at,d.the process may be lengthy,and the balance of the concerns weigh predominately against access.com.on judiciary,on bill,reg.sess.as amended,see also in re keisha,supra,th,d.
in cases governed by subdivision a,the legislature has decided that the considerations favoring confidentiality are for the most part trumped by the considerations favoring public view,government accountability and reform.the legislators concluded that,when a dependent child dies in the care of a public agency,the need for confidentiality evaporates and the requirement for an expedited decision becomes manifest,because community reaction to the child death may abate with the passage of time,and,without prompt investigation and assessment,the opportunity to effect positive change may cease,supra,as amended,assem.com,supra.
in contrast to the veritable presumption in favor of confidentiality that attends the juvenile records of a living child,subdivision a reflects a veritable presumption in favor of release when the child is deceased.see assem.republican analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may,june,assem.com,supra,at com.on judiciary,reading analysis of on bill reg.sess.as amended july.thus,unlike records pertaining to a living dependent,which must be maintained as confidential unless some sufficient reason for disclosure is shown to exist,records pertaining to a deceased dependent must be disclosed unless the statutory reasons for confidentiality are shown to exist.
we find two exceptions to disclosure written into subdivision a.the first arises when the records pertaining to the deceased child contain information about another living child.obviously desiring that the presumption in favor of confidentiality should persist as to such living children,the legislature in subdivision a required the juvenile court to resort to the simple expedient of redaction as the principal means by which to protect the other child.com,supra,as amended,rules,on bill reg.sess.as amended may.however,the legislature also obviously recognized that redaction may not in every case be sufficient to serve this end,given the potential complexities of dependency proceedings,including consolidated actions involving several children and multiple placements with a single foster home.the subdivision therefore articulates a second exception to the presumption of limitation or outright prohibition of access to all or a part of the records relating to a deceased child when disclosure is shown to be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical,or emotional of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition.subd.a.
considering the subdivision in its entirety,we disagree with appellants that redaction is the required remedy to protect information pertaining to other children.to the contrary,we think the grant of power to the juvenile court to restrict or entirely deny all access to some or all of the records of a deceased child,when the statutory conditions are proved,is an alternative separate and apart from redaction first,the two remedies are inconsistent.redaction,on the one hand,reduces the amount of information disclosed from a deceased child file,but the retained information relates only to the other child,not to the deceased child.the inclusion of the phrase except for information about the deceased child in the statutory text dealing with redaction is consistent,for it appears to manifest a legislative intention that information about the deceased child is not to be excised even if this information may also relate to or identify another child.on the other hand,the last portion of subdivision a authorizes the court to limit or prohibit the dissemination of information about the deceased child when the court,even after it has redacted all information pertaining solely to the other child,concludes that information about the deceased child should not be released because it will somehow tend to harm the other child 
second,the two remedies must be presumed to have been intended to be effective.the legislature would have had no conceivable purpose in authorizing the juvenile court to curtail all access to the records of a deceased child under the specified conditions if it intended redaction of information about another child to be the only means by which to protect that other child.see stafford realty bond service cal d,courts do not presume the legislature indulged in an idle act.
third,the two remedies are separated by the statutory language itself.the final sentence of the subdivision is introduced by the clause except as provided in this paragraph.the prior sentences of this paragraph,subdivision a,mandate that disclosure of a deceased child records be ordered,with the redaction of information relating solely to other children.the introductory words of the last sentence therefore can only be read as manifesting a legislative desire that the grant of judicial power to wholly or partially deny access to the deceased child records is separate from the provisions of the preceding portion of the subdivision.in addition,the fact that the last paragraph of the subdivision gives the court the power to take into account other living children who are indirectly connected to the case involving the deceased child demonstrates that the legislature contemplated situations where there might be little or nothing about another child to redact and yet the nature of the information in the deceased child file,if released,would tend to prejudice the other child 
the juvenile court order was accompanied by the statement,framed for the most part in the relevant statutory language,that the release of jaime records would be detrimental to the safety,protection,physical,or emotional of another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile court case.appellants maintain this expression does not promote meaningful appellate review.according to appellants,the juvenile court was compelled to do more than just repeat the words of subdivision a.as mcclatchy puts it,
the juvenile court was required to provide specific factual findings demonstrating that its denial of the petition to release juvenile case files served some overriding interest.mere conclusory statements which parrot the language of the statute are insufficient.in addition,the juvenile court findings should also reveal whether less restrictive alternative to outright denial of the petition were considered and the reasons such alternatives were not acceptable.
appellants rely on several cases,both state and federal,which have held that certain specific factual findings are required when the press is denied access to otherwise public information.times mirror superior court cal d,municipal court d.united states brooklier cir united states criden cir,nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,nbc subsidiary.while we have no quarrel with these opinions,we do not find them dispositive here.first,as appellants implicitly acknowledge,the information they seek is not public there is no overarching first amendment right to unfettered access to juvenile court proceedings.san bernardino county of public social services superior court d.in re keisha,supra,th at,d in re tiffany,supra,th at,d.logically,the same must be said for juvenile court records.see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d access issues involve both closure of proceedings and sealing of records.
second,this is not a case analogous to nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,where the statute in issue,code of civil procedure section,contained no provisions identifying what findings were necessary before a civil proceeding could be closed to the media,and therefore the supreme court was constrained to construe the statute constitutionally by judicially engrafting onto it acceptable standards.here,by contrast,the subdivision does state the to another authorizes complete or partial nondisclosure.appellants have not made any argument or offered any authority to the effect that the protection of other,involved children is not a legitimate overriding interest that can legally support a restriction or outright ban on the disclosure of a decedent child juvenile records.see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.in point of fact,the authorities favor the statutory condition.see superior court,supra,cal d at,in re tiffany,supra,th at,d in re michael,supra,th at,d lorenza superior court,supra,d at.navajo express superior court,supra,d at.the primary concern raised by a request for access to juvenile records is the best interests of the impacted child or children.in re tiffany,supra,at,d.the showing required by subdivision a as a condition to the restriction or denial of access to information detrimental to a child other than the deceased child addresses that concern directly.see in re john cal d,in re lawrence d,dis.opn.of jefferson.
third,the statutory language describes a circumstance that is as concrete as it rationally can be,given the confidential nature of the information about the other child.a closure order must articulate the interest involved and be accompanied by a statement of reasons,specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.superior court,d nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.the goal to be served by subdivision a is best interests of a living child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case that is the subject of the petition,subd.a see superior court,supra,cal d at,in re tiffany,supra,th at,d.a conclusion by the juvenile court that release of information relating to the deceased child is detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical,or emotional of an involved living child recites a legitimate reason for retention and provides the appellate court with a point on which to focus its evaluation of the record,subd.a topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles,supra,cal d at,adequate findings relieve the appellate courts of having to grope through the record to determine whether some combination of credible evidentiary items which supported some line of factual and legal conclusions supported the ultimate order or decision.given the myriad of unpredictable circumstances that could serve to connect a child with the former dependency of a deceased child,any more specific standard would risk,on the one hand,the exclusion of a case where the maintenance of confidentiality is appropriate and,on the other,the disclosure of confidential information in an effort to support a decision intended to protect that information.
fourth,though the juvenile court did not expressly find that redaction was not available as a less restrictive alternative to complete secrecy,the court determination that preserving the confidentiality of jaime records was necessary to protect another child was tantamount to a finding that redaction of the information pertaining solely to the other child was inadequate to do so.see in re jesse th,d order terminating reunification in juvenile case implies a finding that child will not suffer detriment as a result of termination.we explained above that the statute requires full disclosure of the information about the deceased child even if it relates to or identifies another child,unless whole or partial retention of that information is necessary to safeguard the interests of the other child.consequently,the juvenile court ruling in this case that the withholding of all of jaime files was necessary to protect another involved child reflects an implicit determination by the court that redaction of any information pertaining solely to such child would not guard the interests of that child because of the nature of the information pertinent to jaime.
we are not persuaded by pack alternate argument that the juvenile court statement does not comport with subdivision a because the court used the subjective tense would be detrimental instead of the declarative is detrimental found in the statute.subdivision a unambiguously addresses conditional the information in the file is released,harm will or is likely to follow.the juvenile court expression accurately reflects this sentiment.there is no material difference between the language of the statute and the language used by the juvenile court.
moreover,the variance is not of such import as to compel either reversal with directions to the juvenile court to enter an order releasing jaime records or an outright order to that effect by this court.at most we would remand for correction,a needless waste of time which we are confident would not result in the entry by the juvenile court of a finding favorable to appellants.see people osband cal th,d,no prejudice in a criminal case where reversal of technical sentencing error would not likely result in the imposition of a different sentence on remand witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,no reversible harm in civil case when technical error can be corrected witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal,inadvertent misuse of terms by court not prejudicial.
now that we have determined the issues of statutory construction raised by appellants briefs,we address the standard of review applicable to the juvenile court order.
a juvenile court decision to grant or deny a petition to release confidential juvenile records under subdivision a of section and california rules of court,rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re th,d see also in re keisha,supra,th at,d.mcclatchy says this test is not pertinent to subdivision a and we must assess the record de novo and exercise our independent judgment as to the merits of appellants petitions because the interpretation of a statute such as subdivision a is a question of law there were no disputed factual issues raised in the juvenile court and the petitions present first amendment issues.mcclatchy maintains the proper remedy on appeal is for this court to conduct an independent review of the juvenile case files and to issue a ruling on the merits of the petitions releasing the juvenile case files in question.hsa takes the position the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion.
we agree appellate interpretation of a statute or rule is a question of law and is evaluated de novo by the appeals court.hansen mechanical,superior court th,d jefferson compton unified school dist.th,d.however,other than with respect to appellants allusion that subdivision a establishes redaction as the only remedy available to the court to protect other children and appellants challenge to the formal sufficiency of the juvenile court findings,issues we have already resolved,the contentions advanced by appellants relate not to the construction or interpretation of the subdivision but instead to its application in this case that is,whether the juvenile court refusal to allow access to any part of jaime file was in some manner in violation of the statute.
next,though we agree there were no written objections filed in the trial court,appellants petitions were not unopposed foreclosed by the trial court refusal to permit a confidential response to the petitions,hsa and the other objectors were relegated to orally stating their respective positions and arguing in general terms at the hearing against disclosure.the hearing record leaves no doubt the objectors took the position the petitions should be denied in toto under section,subdivision a,even though the ability of the objectors to present facts and specific reasons supporting this stance was compromised by the need to maintain confidentiality in the absence of a protective order.for example,the minor advocate,for one,stated that 
if there is another child involved in this case,there can be some very serious issues.i feel a little bit restricted of what i can say here because of the nature of the hearing and the press being here and the confidentiality issue.but i think there could be some very serious issues and information that i think will have to be redacted from the file and the court would have to look at it very carefully in determining what information that the press should have access to.
counsel comments were not limited to the name of or identifying information about another child,but included information that pertains to jaime that could be detrimental to another child.the same points were made by counsel for the mother.
in addition,the juvenile court was not obliged to grant appellants petitions even in the absence of opposition or objection,written or oral.as the parties themselves acknowledged at the hearing,subdivision a imposes an independent duty on the juvenile court to seek out the positions of interested third parties and protect the interests of any child directly or indirectly connected to the case.subd.a.the children to whom the benefits of the statute extend need not be parties to the case or even be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
the legislature knew precisely what it was doing when it wrote the provisions relating to the protection of other children.com,supra,as amended july,assem.republican analysis,supra,as amended july,see also fn.senate bill as initially authored allowed release of the juvenile court file without court intervention,unless a petition was filed by some person contesting the release.early in the process,this procedure was rejected,and a court supervised release process was substituted.compare bill,proposed subd.a,as introduced with bill as amended april,proposed subd.a.it seems apparent the legislature was unwilling to leave to unknown persons the responsibility for looking after the interests of involved other children and was quite content to place this responsibility on the juvenile courts.
furthermore,the juvenile court had evidence,in the form of the records pertaining to jaime,relating to the issues raised by appellants petitions.even if the contents of these records were not in dispute,the same can not be said about the inferences and conclusions that might be drawn from the facts stated in the records.the records were before the court by virtue of the parties unanimous agreement that the juvenile court would review jaime records in camera and on that basis decide how best to protect the interests of any directly or indirectly involved other children.the records were themselves sufficient proof of the nature of the information they contained.see in re maria,supra,d at.if the contents of these records rationally supported a conclusion that disclosure would be detrimental to another child,we know of no authority or reason,and appellants have provided none,which made necessary any further proof.in re keisha,supra,th at,d the juvenile court is best suited to evaluate what is in the child file and what,if anything,contained in that file might be detrimental to another child in re tiffany,supra,th at,d same.in camera review was an appropriate procedure,and is routinely used when a judicial decision concerns information claimed to be covered by some rule of confidentiality or privilege.in re maria,supra,d at.cases involving media claims to access are not exempted.globe newspaper superior court,fn,d richmond newspapers,virginia,fn,d,municipal court,supra,d at.
if the foregoing appears to presage a decision that the correct standard of review is abuse of discretion,it is deceiving because we think the subtly different substantial evidence test is the appropriate one when an appellate court is called upon to review a juvenile court order under subdivision a withholding all or part of a deceased child records based upon prejudice to another involved child.though both the abuse of discretion test and the substantial evidence test entail considerable deference to the tribunal department of parks and recreation state personnel bd.d,the former centers upon legal,in light of the record,the trial court ruling falls within the permissible range of options set by the legal criteria dorman dwlc th,d while the latter centers upon evidentiary the trial court factual conclusions are rationally supported by record evidence winograd american broadcasting th,d.
we are led by the relevant language of subdivision a,which permits retention of the deceased child records only when a showing of prejudice to another child is made.the juvenile court thus does not have,given the evidence,a range of viable alternative options within the bounds of the law.instead,it has no discretion and must release all the records of the deceased child in the absence of proof that there exists another child who is directly or indirectly connected to the juvenile case,and that release of all or a portion of the deceased child records is detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical,or emotional of the other child.subd.a.by contrast,a request for disclosure of juvenile records under subdivision a of section puts the court in the position of balancing the preference for confidentiality and the best interests of the minor against the benefits of public disclosure and the legitimate interest of the person seeking access,and then selecting a course of action which best deals with the conflict among the competing concerns.see in re keisha,supra,th at,d.the same is true,for example,under section when the juvenile court must decide whether to terminate parental rights and place the child for adoption or instead to consider alternate placement options because termination would be detrimental to the child,subd.c.this decision necessitates the weighing of the child need for stability against the extent of the detriment that would flow from termination and the identification of a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child.in re jasmine th,d.review of such an order is governed by the abuse of discretion test.id.at,d.
the determination to withhold all or part of a deceased child records under subdivision a is more like a ruling under section when the juvenile court must decide whether a minor comes within the statutory description of a dependent child.in re brison th,d.in this instance,the juvenile court must evaluate whether the evidentiary facts prove any one or more of the statutory criteria indicative of a dependent child.in re brison,supra,th at,d.review of such an order is governed by the substantial evidence test.ibid.analogous also is a ruling under section,subdivision b when the juvenile court must decide whether to deny reunification services to a parent,subd.b in re brian th,d.in this instance,the juvenile court must evaluate whether the evidentiary facts prove any one or more of the statutory criteria justifying the disallowance of services.see in re brian,supra,th at,d,sub.b.review of this type of order is likewise governed by the substantial evidence test.id.at,d.
in in re jasmine,supra,th at page,d,the court found that abuse of discretion was a better fit than substantial evidence as the standard applicable to the review of juvenile court custody rulings under section because custody decisions are typically reviewable for abuse of discretion and because the statutory mandate that a refusal to terminate be supported by a compelling reason is a quintessentially discretionary determination.we think substantial evidence is the better fit for purposes of review of decisions under the last sentence of subdivision a.first,although this part of subdivision a does not expressly require the juvenile court to find by any measure of proof that detriment to another child would result from disclosure of the deceased child records,the language used is tantamount to such a directive,for,unless the specified ultimate existence of and prejudice to another established,the court is without authority to withhold the sought after records.thus,subdivision a does not contemplate a balancing of a variety of competing interests and the fashioning of an order which represents a reasonable adjustment of the several factors.the court has no discretion to deny release of the deceased child records for some compelling reason borne out by whatever circumstances may be found to be material the court can not do anything but release the records in the absence of a showing,evidence,demonstrative of prejudice to another child.second,the application of the substantial evidence standard is consistent with the presumption of disclosure inherent in subdivision a and better protects the interests of the public and furthers the legislature intent to promote governmental responsibility and reform.review on the basis of substantial evidence ensures that restrictive orders will be rigorously tested against the record facts and upheld only when there is evidence of sufficient value to justify the effective rebuttal of the presumption favoring disclosure.
we now turn to the q
