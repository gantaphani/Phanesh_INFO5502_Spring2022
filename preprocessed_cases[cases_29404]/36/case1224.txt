in this appeal we review a juvenile court judgment terminating the parental rights of robert under family code section as to his biological daughter,baby girl section authorizes the termination of parental rights when a parent has been convicted of a felony the facts of which are of such a nature so as to prove the unfitness of the parent to have future custody and control of the child,subd.a.in accordance with this statutory language,and the fact that the involuntary termination of parental rights is an extreme measure implicating core constitutional rights,section reach traditionally has been limited to those situations where a parent commits a heinous felony offense,often against a family member,which in and of itself demonstrates that the parent will be forever unfit to have any measure of custody of his or her children.
in the instant case,the juvenile court terminated robert parental rights based on felony convictions for burglary,attempted burglary and drug possession an extensive misdemeanor criminal record and the court finding that robert had not adequately addressed the problems which have led to his criminality.while we recognize the juvenile court legitimate misgivings about robert parental fitness based on his general criminal record,the court ruling revoking his parental rights on this basis is contrary to the legislature intent as expressed in the statutory text of section and the corresponding legislative history.our review of those materials demonstrates that the legislature,in amending the statute in,clearly intended that section apply to terminate parental rights only where a parent unfitness is demonstrated by the facts underlying a felony conviction.stats,ch.in this parent fitness is called into question by factors other than the facts underlying a felony conviction,the legislature intended that courts would apply other statutory provisions relating to child welfare,which as a general matter contain more gradual termination procedures and include procedural safeguards absent from section.consequently,we reverse.
we also remand,as requested by baby girl prospective adoptive parents,and the,for the juvenile court to determine guardianship and that are by no means resolved by our conclusion that the extreme measure of the permanent termination of robert parental rights was unauthorized.
factual and procedural background 
in february,robert estranged wife carla gave birth to baby girl carla,who claimed that baby girl biological father was not robert but a man named justen,authorized baby girl adoption by the.baby girl was placed in the care shortly after her birth.in march,the filed a petition in superior court to adopt baby girl robert contested the adoption,alleging that he was the child biological father,an allegation that was proven by subsequent genetic testing.
robert subsequently filed a petition seeking visitation rights and custody of baby girl m.in support of his petition,robert submitted reports by a private investigator who interviewed robert,his fiancée and his mother.these reports,and later hearing testimony,stated that robert has been living with his mother,sister,and his other three children since his release from custody in december and was,according to the interviewees,a good father to these children.
in june,the filed a petition under section to terminate robert parental rights with respect to baby girl,alleging that robert prior felony convictions rendered him an unfit parent they also petitioned for guardianship of baby girl m.the various petitions were consolidated and the juvenile court acted first on the section petition,deferring ruling on the guardianship petition and other related petitions filed by the parties.
in july,the juvenile court held a hearing on the section petition at which the,robert,robert fiancée,two social workers,and a psychologist testified.the hearing lasted approximately three hours.the evidence adduced at the hearing,examined in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in re james d.james,is as follows.
robert has three felony convictions a conviction for attempted burglary a conviction for possession of methamphetamine and a conviction for burglary.the evidentiary record reveals these convictions to be based on the following facts 
attempted burglary robert knocked on the door of a residence and when no one answered drove his car into the driveway,climbed the fence to the backyard and tried to pry open a window with a stick.robert unsuccessful efforts to enter the residence were observed,the police were called and he was arrested.robert pleaded guilty to attempted burglary.
possession of methamphetamine there was no evidence admitted at the hearing with respect to the facts underlying this conviction,except that robert pleaded guilty 
burglary robert and an accomplice climbed a wall into the backyard of an unoccupied home and opened a bedroom window.after removing a screen,the accomplice went through the window,unlocked a sliding glass door,and both men removed valuables from the house.as they were exiting,a neighbor yelled at them and they dropped some of the valuables and fled in their car.the neighbor recorded the license plate number of the car and they were later apprehended 
robert testified at the hearing.he admitted to having the three felony convictions,as well as a number of misdemeanor convictions,including two convictions for domestic violence.he also admitted using methamphetamine extensively in the past,failing to enroll in a spousal abuse treatment course required by the terms of his probation for the most recent misdemeanor domestic violence conviction,and not being currently enrolled in any drug treatment program.robert fiancée,a supervisor for the department of social services in victorville,testified on robert behalf,stating that robert was a good parent to his children and very involved in their lives.she also acknowledged that she had visited baby girl in the home and the child appeared comfortable there.
the each testified,explaining that they had been caring for baby girl since her birth and she was flourishing in their home.in addition,they stated that were they to be awarded custody of baby girl,they would remain open to her forming and maintaining a relationship with robert and her biological siblings,robert other children.a psychologist,patricia yglesias,testified that baby girl is closely attached to the,who have become her psychological parents,and is thriving in their home.yglesias opined that there was a high likelihood of detriment if baby girl were removed from the care.in part,yglesias testified,this was because baby girl had been exposed to methamphetamine and alcohol prior to her birth,making her more vulnerable to negative effects of disruption.if removed from the custody,yglesias testified,baby girl may have difficulty reestablishing a relationship that secure and loving and reciprocal.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court terminated robert parental rights.the court subsequently issued a written ruling with the following pertinent findings 
robert w.is the biological and presumed father of baby girl m.
robert w.is a parent within the meaning of section,in that he has been convicted of a felony,the facts of which are of such a nature so as to prove the unfitness of the parent to have the future custody and control of the child.
in making this determination,the court considered the fact that w.has been convicted of three felonies,as well as having a long history of misdemeanor criminal convictions,and that he has never adequately addressed the problems which have led to his criminality and has failed to show rehabilitation.
granting the petition is necessary to serve the child best interests,and placement of the child with robert would be detrimental to her.
the parental rights of robert to baby girl m.are terminated.
discussion 
robert appeals the juvenile court termination of his parental rights.while robert frames his appeal as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the juvenile court ruling,his contention is primarily a legal one.robert contends that a termination of parental rights is not authorized by section absent some evidence that the facts underlying a felony conviction,as opposed to the mere existence of the conviction or convictions,prove parental unfitness.in light of the express language of the statute,and the case law interpreting it,we are compelled to agree.
the fundamental nature of parental rights and standard of review for a termination order 
the termination of parental rights is a drastic remedy to be resorted to only in extreme cases.in re terry d.terry in re angelia cal d,angelia parenting is a fundamental right,and accordingly,is disturbed only in extreme cases of persons acting in a fashion incompatible with parenthood see also adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey the child has a genetic bond with its natural parents that is unique among all relationships the child will have throughout its life.
the fundamental nature of parental rights requires that there be clear and convincing evidence of the facts necessary to terminate such rights.terry,supra,d at.santosky kramer,d in light of the fundamental liberty interest at stake,the facts underlying termination of parental rights must be proven by at least clear and convincing evidence angelia,supra,cal d at,the very essence of the proceeding is the complete and final legal termination of a relationship which is biological in nature and most personal in form in re marriage of d.an order to terminate parental rights constitutes a termination of a most fundamental and basic civil right and results in a total severance of the natural ties between the parent and the child.this standard mandates that the evidence be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.terry,at,quoting angelia,at.
the decision to terminate parental rights lies in the first instance within the discretion of the juvenile court,and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.in re arthur d.arthur.while the abuse of discretion standard gives the court substantial latitude,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action city of sacramento drew d.action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.id.at.with respect to challenged factual findings,we will affirm if there is any substantial evidence to support the trial court findings,if the evidence is reasonable,credible and of solid that a reasonable trier of fact could find that termination of parental rights is appropriate based on clear and convincing evidence.terry,supra,d at,citing angelia,supra,cal d at.
a termination of parental rights under section must be based on the facts underlying a felony conviction 
the sole legal ground urged by the and relied upon by the juvenile court in terminating robert parental rights was that robert felony convictions rendered him an unfit parent under section.we begin,therefore,by analyzing the pertinent statute and the principles governing its application.
statutory text and legislative history of section 
section,subdivision a provides for the permanent termination of parental rights where both of the following requirements are satisfied 
the child is one whose parent or parents are convicted of a felony.
the facts of the crime of which the parent or parents were convicted are of such a nature so as to prove the unfitness of the parent or parents to have the future custody and control of the child.
this statutory language is the result of a amendment to the statute intended to l imit the use of a person felony conviction as a grounds for depriving him or her of custody or control of his or her children.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.the legislative history of that amendment demonstrates two aspects of the legislature intent with respect to application of the statute as amended.first,the legislature intended the statute to apply only when the facts underlying a felony conviction demonstrate future parental unfitness.second,when a parent fitness is called into question by something other than the facts underlying a felony conviction,the legislature intended that courts would rely on other statutory provisions,and not section,to terminate parental rights remove the child from a natural parent custody.
the amendment made two substantive changes to the statute.first,the amendment altered the statutory language so that it now focuses on the facts underlying the felony conviction as opposed to the felony conviction itself.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,the existing law focuses on the crime itself,but the bill focuses on the facts of the crime.second,the amendment eliminated statutory language that had allowed termination of parental rights on the grounds of a lengthy sentence of incarceration.assem.com.on criminal justice,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,assem.bill.no.would delete the last provision which allows the termination of parental rights on the grounds of a lengthy sentence com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,under the bill,an action could no longer be predicated upon conviction of a felony the sentence for which is of such length that the child will be deprived of a normal home for a period of years legis.counsel,assem.bill,stats.reg.sess.summary,the amendment would delete authority for such an action where such parent or parents are sentenced to a term of such length that would deprive the child of a normal home for a period of years.
the legislative history also reveals that the legislature recognized that limiting the statutory authority for the termination of parental rights of felony offenders in this way had the potential to result in children remaining in the custody of parents of questionable fitness.both the senate committee on the judiciary and the assembly committee on criminal justice,in their analyses of the bill,emphasized,therefore,that passage of the bill would not alter other provisions of california law,which remained available to terminate parental rights or remove a child from a parent custody where the parent was unfit for reasons other than the facts underlying a particular felony conviction.assem.com.on criminal justice,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,noting in bill description that other provisions of law still provide for termination of parental rights based on abandonment,neglect,parental disability due to use or mental deficiency,and dependency placement in juvenile court for two years and a finding of detriment and stating in comments that existing law already allows for termination of parental rights if there are two years of w elfare i institutions code placement com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,noting same provisions of law that would be unchanged by amendment and stating that proponents of the bill point out that other statutory provisions permitting temporary removal of a minor from his parents custody would not be affected by the bill assem.off.of research,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,existing law already provides for termination of parental rights if the child is in placement by the juvenile court,welfare department or other child placing agency for a period of two years and the court finds that the return of the child to the parents would be detrimental or that the parents will be unable to provide for the child.
consequently,it is clear that section is intended to be distinct from other statutory provisions relating to child welfare,such as those that govern dependency,custody or guardianship proceedings unlike those provisions,under section the welfare of the child is not the sole determining factor.terry,supra,d at.compare in re christopher th,d in the context of juvenile dependency,weighing the best interests of the dependent child is always the court paramount concern guardianship of zachary th,d zachary upholding appointment of nonparent guardian over objection of natural parent despite absence of any finding that the natural parent was unfit.rather,section focus is on the parent,requir ing clear and convincing proof of the parent unfitness to have the future custody and control of the child,and such unfitness must be demonstrated by the facts underlying a felony conviction.terry,at,subd.a.where parental unfitness is demonstrated not by the facts underlying a felony conviction,but by other factors,courts must rely on other statutory provisions,if applicable,to terminate a parent parental rights.
case law regarding termination of parental rights based on a felony conviction 
given the statutory text and legislative history,as well as the fundamental rights to parenting that are at stake,courts interpreting section and its predecessor statute have upheld termination of parental rights only where felony convictions have involved egregious underlying facts that have a direct bearing on parental fitness,such as the murder of a family member.for example,in in re sarah d,the father beat the mother to death in the children presence,and four months later he killed a man in a bar.in in re geoffrey d.geoffrey,the father violently strangled the child mother after having consumed a substantial amount of intoxicants the night before and his criminal record showed numerous past arrests and convictions for intoxication.in in re mark d.mark,the father fatally stabbed the mother while the children were asleep in the residence.see also arthur,supra,d at.upholding termination of father parental rights where father,with extensive history of violence and substance abuse,stabbed mother times in the neck,chest,abdomen,back and extremities.
further,even where such egregious underlying facts of violence depravity underlie a felony conviction,the record may still be insufficient to prove the unfitness of the parent for future custody under section,subdivision a.in james,supra,d at,the reviewing court upheld the trial court determination that the underlying facts of a murder conviction were insufficient for the termination of parental rights where the father stabbed the mother times and received a sentence.similarly,in terry,supra,d at,the court of appeal reversed a judgment terminating parental rights despite the parent felony convictions for false imprisonment,oral copulation,subd.d and penetration by a foreign instrument,all of which resulted from an overnight abduction of a victim who,while bound and threatened with death,was repeatedly forced to perform sex acts 
in light of this body of case law,the recognize that the underlying facts of robert felony convictions are unlike those relied on in previous cases upholding the termination of parental rights.they nevertheless argue that the juvenile court ruling was proper based on other factors,including robert general criminal record,failure to adequately address his drug problem,lack of credibility,failure to act like a responsible parent,and likelihood that he would offend again based upon his extensive past,thus leaving baby girl without a stable home.
in making this argument,the rely on the sole california case affirming parental rights termination absent the egregious crimes of intrafamily violence noted above,adoption of d.adoption of.adoption of,however,does not support the core contention that parental unfitness under section can be demonstrated through means other than the facts underlying a felony conviction.
in adoption of,the parent rights were terminated not based on a generalized history of crime and irresponsibility,but because of the facts underlying a particular felony armed burglary conviction.adoption of,supra,d at.the court emphasized that the conviction arose from a series of burglaries committed by the parent with his wife,and that the parent committed the burglaries while on parole for armed robbery and while armed with an illegally purchased firearm and switchblade knife.ibid.as we have demonstrated,the evidence was sufficient for the trial judge to find that the particular circumstances of defendant crime rendered him an unfit parent,italics added.thus,in the court view,the facts of that conviction were sufficient to demonstrate future parental unfitness as they showed,inter alia,that the defendant had a propensity to violent crime and would not hesitate to involve family members of a tender age in crime.id.at.
it is true that the adoption of court added,in dicta,that in making this determination,the lower court did not err in considering other past criminal activities.however,we do not read this language in adoption of as completely unmooring the termination decision from the explicit statutory text of section,subd.a authorizing termination of parental rights based on the t he facts underlying a felony conviction judiciary com.analysis,noting that statutory language was amended to focus on the facts of the crime,underlining in original kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,in construing a statute,courts may not add provisions to a statute where the legislature has expressly provided the circumstances to which the statute applies.rather,the adoption of court,by explicitly basing its determination on the particular circumstances of defendant crime,makes clear that an extensive criminal record alone is not sufficient for termination of parental rights,and holds only that a criminal record preceding a felony conviction can inform a court determination of whether the facts underlying that particular conviction prove future parental unfitness.adoption of,supra,d at.past criminal activities may be considered in deciding whether a natural parent has rendered himself an unfit parent for the future by commission of a felony see also arthur,supra,d at.court properly considered father past criminal acts of violence and substance abuse when considering whether felony conviction for stabbing the mother times in neck,chest,abdomen,back and extremities rendered him unfit under statute,citing adoption of,at.geoffrey,supra,d at.stating that trial court may properly consider past criminal activities in determining whether a natural parent has rendered himself an unfit parent for the future by commission of a felony where father violently strangled child mother after having consumed a substantial amount of intoxicants the night before and father criminal record showed numerous past arrests and convictions for intoxication,citing adoption of,at.
thus,given the statutory text and legislative history of section,and the case law interpreting it,we must reject the contention that a court can base a termination of parental rights under section on factors other than the facts underlying a felony conviction.to the contrary,there must be a nexus between the decision to terminate parental rights under section and the underlying facts of a parent felony conviction.this requirement of a nexus is not satisfied simply by the existence of a felony conviction or even the existence of multiple felony convictions absent evidence that the underlying facts of those convictions prove the unfitness of the parent to have the future custody and control of his child,subd.a.in so holding,we do not preclude consideration of other factors,such as an extensive criminal record,history of substance abuse,domestic violence,which,in appropriate circumstances,can inform the court evaluation of the facts underlying a felony conviction or convictions.under section,however,such factors can only inform that evaluation they can not themselves form the basis for termination.
the juvenile court abused its discretion in terminating robert parental rights 
having set forth the principles of law applicable to a termination of parental rights under section,we next determine whether the juvenile court exceeded the bounds of its discretion in terminating robert parental rights under that section.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that it did.
we reach this conclusion for two reasons.first,the juvenile court in its oral and written rulings explicitly stated that its decision terminating robert parental rights was based on factors other than the underlying facts of robert felony convictions.in the proceedings below,the attorney never referenced the underlying facts of robert convictions in arguing for termination,and the court never mentioned any underlying fact in its oral or written orders granting the petition.rather,as the court explicitly stated in its written order terminating robert parental rights the determination was based on the fact that robert has been convicted of three felonies,as well as having a long history of misdemeanor criminal convictions,and that he has never adequately addressed the problems which have led to his criminality and has failed to show rehabilitation.similarly the court oral ruling issued at the conclusion of the hearing states that termination of robert parental rights was based on his long criminal history,including three felonies,the ongoing criminality,the absence of ongoing drug treatment,the incident of domestic violence,robert lack of credibility,and his exposure to potential future incarceration that would make him unavailable for parenting.while,as we have stated,these factors may inform the court decision under section that the facts underlying a felony conviction prove future parental unfitness,such factors can not,as appears to be the case here,themselves form the basis for the termination decision.
second,and most significantly,our review of the evidence properly before the juvenile court with respect to the underlying facts of robert convictions demonstrates that these underlying facts can not support a termination of parental rights under section.terry,supra,d at.trial court decision must be supported by substantial evidence,evidence that is reasonable,credible and of solid that a reasonable trier of fact could find that termination of parental rights is appropriate based on clear and convincing evidence.robert felony convictions do not contain the direct indicators of parental unfitness as did the felony involved in the least grave case cited by the parties,adoption of,supra,d.and have nowhere near the gravity of the felonies involved in other parental termination cases going back over the past years,including cases like terry in which the court of appeal reversed the lower court parental rights termination order in fact,unlike all of the cases previously upholding the termination of parental rights based on a felony conviction,the facts of the felonies of which robert was the evidentiary record before no indications of violence,lewd behavior,use of the family home,harm to family members,involvement or victimization of minors,or other direct indicators of parental unfitness.consequently,the underlying facts of robert felony convictions simply can not support the requisite finding that t he facts of the felony of which the parent or parents were convicted are of such a nature so as to prove the unfitness of the parent or parents to have the future custody and control of the child,subd.a.
that the juvenile court acted outside the authority granted to it in section is further demonstrated by the structure of the statute itself.as discussed above,the statute does not contemplate that every felony conviction will jeopardize the parental rights of an offender.mark,supra,d at.purpose of statute authorizing termination of parental rights is not to punish the criminal offender.rather,the statute applies only to felony offenses the facts of which prove the unfitness of the parent to have the future custody and control of the child,subd.a.if the underlying facts of the felony offenses for which robert was convicted properly formed the basis for termination of parental rights,virtually all felony convictions would supply such a the express legislative intent to limit the scope of section kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,the primary role of the court in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent i f the legislature has provided an express definition,we must take it as we find it and may not violate the cardinal rule that courts may not add provisions to a statute as well as reopening the statute to constitutional challenge see in re melkonian d,upholding predecessor statute to section in face of constitutional challenge on the grounds,in part,that statute does not permit parental rights termination based on simple fact of felony conviction,but only where the felony involved is of such nature as to prove the unfitness of such parent to have the future custody and control of the child in re michele d.similarly upholding statute against constitutional challenge.
the reversal of the termination of robert parental rights does not resolve the issues of custody or guardianship 
our determination that the juvenile court abused its discretion in terminating robert parental rights is only a partial resolution of the issues in this case.the juvenile court still has pending before it the petitions for guardianship and other related petitions which must be addressed along with the question of custody based on wholly different legal principles than those involved in a parental rights termination proceeding under section.see,subd.a,subd.a if the court make s a finding that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the best interest of the child,it may,over the objection of a natural parent,grant custody to the person or persons in whose home the child has been living in a wholesome and stable environment zachary,supra,th at,d affirming grant of guardianship and resulting custody to prospective adoptive parents despite objection of biological father,after petition to terminate biological father parental rights denied,despite no finding that biological father unfit.therefore,we remand the case to the juvenile court for resolution of the issues still outstanding with respect to baby girl welfare,and emphasize that our opinion regarding robert parental rights should not be read to constrain the juvenile court determination of these matters.see terry,supra,d at.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed,and the matter is remanded with direction to reinstate robert parental rights.the court shall consider pending petitions for custody and guardianship of baby girl 
all statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise specified.all statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise specified.
an attachment to the trial brief includes a rough summary of the purported facts of the drug conviction that indicates the conviction resulted from a traffic stop where robert,a passenger in the car,was found to have drugs in his pocket.the summary also contains the sentence robert revealed knife and sheath,without any further explanation.even were we to determine that this information supported termination of robert parental rights,we could not rely on it because the counsel agreed not to offer the trial brief or the attachment thereto into evidence,after an objection by robert counsel regarding its filing.the trial brief attachment references trial exhibit as the source of the information contained therein,but there was no exhibit at the hearing,and the exhibit that appears to correspond to this entry,exhibit,does not contain these facts.
we presume for purposes of this appeal that these are the facts of the underlying felonies because there does not appear to have been any objection to the admission of the source material for these facts unauthenticated police reports submitted by the attorney.
we consult the legislative history of a statute if there is ambiguity in the statute and select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.day city of fontana cal th,d.
prior to,the statute authorized termination of parental rights for any child w hose parent or parents are convicted of a felony,if the felony of which such parent or parents were convicted is of such nature as to prove the unfitness of such parent or parents to have the future custody and control of the child,or if any term of sentence of such parent or parents is of such length that the child will be deprived of a normal home for a period of years.former,subd.a stats,ch,italics added f
