ii.procedural history 
on october,the los angeles county department of children and family services the department filed a section petition.the petition was filed on behalf of noah and newborn jose g.the petition alleges the children are dependents of the juvenile court under section,subdivision b.the petition alleges the mother has a history of illicit drug abuse,including marijuana and methamphetamine this drug use renders her incapable of providing the children with proper care and supervision the mother used illicit drugs throughout her pregnancy with jose the mother tested positive for methamphetamine at jose birth on october,and the mother drug abuse endangered the children health and safety and placed them at risk of physical harm and damage.
at the october,detention hearing,the juvenile court found the department made a prima facie showing that the children were described by section,subdivision c.the juvenile court released the children to the mother over the department objection.the department was ordered to provide family maintenances services to the mother and father refer the family to family preservation services make unannounced home visits and refer the parents for weekly random and on demand drug testing.
at the march,adjudication and disposition hearing,the juvenile court sustained the amended petition under section,subdivision b.the children were placed in the home of the parents under the supervision of the department.the parents were ordered to participate in individual,drug and alcohol counseling,random alcohol and drug testing,and parenting classes.
on august,the department filed a supplemental petition pursuant to section.the section petition alleges the parents tested positive for drugs and failed to regularly participate in a substance abuse treatment program.the parents failure to comply with the juvenile court orders endangered the children health and safety and placed them at risk of physical harm.at the detention hearing on the supplemental petition,the juvenile court detained the children.the juvenile court ordered the department to provide the family with family reunification services.the parents were granted monitored visits at least twice a week with the department having discretion to liberalize visits and to release the boys to a parent.
at the september,jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the juvenile court sustained the allegations in the section petition.the juvenile court ordered the children placed with their maternal grandmother.the department was ordered to provide the family with reunification services.the parents were granted monitored visits at least twice a week for at least one hour with the department having discretion to liberalize.the parents were ordered to participate in individual,alcohol and drug counseling random alcohol and drug testing and parenting classes.at the may,review hearing,the juvenile court found the children return to the parents custody would create a substantial risk of detriment to the youngsters.the juvenile court found the parents were not in compliance with the case plan and terminated family reunification services.
at the section hearing on september,the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that the children would likely be adopted.the juvenile court found the beneficial relationship exception did not apply and terminated parental rights.the juvenile court explained it is clear that the parents have had regular consistent visitation and contact and do have a parental role and relationship in the children lives,but they have participated in no programs in over a year.the younger child has lived with them less than half of his life.the case law and code discussed two different things one is the extent to which the parental role and relationship outweighs the benefit of permanence to adoption,which i do think the parents have shown,especially in light of their failure to participate in anything in the last year and the fact that they still have monitored visits.the limited amount of time that jose has lived with them and noah being out of their care for over a year.second issue is whether it would be emotionally detrimental to the children to terminate the parental role and relationship,and at this point there been no showing that it would be emotionally detrimental to the children,especially to jose.the children enjoy visiting with their parents and having the parents over,would like to be able to live with their parents,if they could,but that is impossible.even the extent to which the mother discusses noah being unhappy when she leaves at the end of the day,really did show that being to the level of emotional detriment.
the mother filed her notice of appeal on september.
