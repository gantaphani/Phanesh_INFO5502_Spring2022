when disputes arise,parents have the right to an administrative hearing at which they may present evidence,including testimony by independent experts.if the challenge is to the district eligibility finding and the parents have obtained an independent educational assessment,they are entitled to have their independent assessor observe their child in his current or proposed education placement or both.this much is conceded,and the dispute before us on this appeal arises in a slightly different the parents have accepted the district eligibility finding but have challenged the proposed placement.in this case,the school district made its eligibility and placement decisions based on its expert observation of the child in his present setting a private school but then refused to allow the parents expert to observe the placement proposed by the district.the parents sought assistance from the administrative hearing officer but were rebuffed,then sought assistance from the trial court by way of a petition for a writ of mandate but were rebuffed again.
because the parents have a statutory right to have their expert testify at their administrative hearing,they ipso facto are entitled to have their expert observe the proposed placement before they participate in the administrative hearing at which the propriety of the proposed placement will be determined.we reverse.
