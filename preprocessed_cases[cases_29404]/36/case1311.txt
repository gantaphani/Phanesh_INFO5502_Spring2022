the department of children and family services dcfs seeks writ review of an order of the juvenile court returning to the care of her maternal grandmother,sencere dcfs contends the order violated welfare and institutions code section,which requires a criminal records check of all adults living in the home of any relative caretaker who is not a licensed foster care provider before a dependent child may be placed in the home we agree the failure to complete the criminal records check contemplated by section precluded return of to maternal grandmother at her new home.however,we deny the writ petition because the issue in this case has been rendered moot by subsequent developments.
maternal grandmother moved with,on an emergency basis,to the home of maternal grandmother parents.a criminal records check revealed two of the residents of maternal grandmother new home had felony convictions that precluded placement of in the home.in such circumstances,section directs that a fingerprint clearance check be performed within five days to ensure the accuracy of the criminal records check.dcfs removed from maternal grandmother care and filed a petition for modification of the case plan.before the results of the fingerprint clearance check were available,the juvenile court ordered returned to maternal grandmother at the new home,ordering that not be left in the care of any person dcfs had not approved and noting continuously had been in maternal grandmother foster care.
we conclude that until such time as a fingerprint clearance check disproved the existence of the disqualifying convictions,or dcfs granted an exemption,the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to place in the new home,notwithstanding the continuity of maternal grandmother foster care.
factual and procedural background 
has been a dependent child since june of and has been in the foster care of maternal grandmother,sencere,since march of.more recently,in march of,the juvenile court indicated adoption was now the preferred plan.
on may,maternal grandmother husband,mark,reported to the children social worker csw that maternal grandmother had moved from their residence on place to the home of maternal grandmother parents on taper avenue.later that day,mark was arrested following an incident of domestic violence at the place residence.that evening,dcfs removed from maternal grandmother care.
on may,dcfs filed a supplemental petition under section alleging,inter alia,that maternal grandmother and mark had a history of domestic violence.at a detention hearing held that same day,the juvenile court released to maternal grandmother over dcfs objection.the juvenile court found the recent incident of domestic violence did not occur in the presence of and dcfs previously had recommended adoption of by maternal grandmother.
immediately after the hearing,the csw investigated the taper avenue residence and found maternal grandmother parents,juanita and george,and a family friend,eddie,living in the home.the csw referred the case for investigation under the adoptions and safe family act asfa.
on may,an asfa investigator reported the taper avenue home was unacceptable because,inter alia,a clets check revealed adults living there had criminal arrests or convictions,including a conviction of rape for george and convictions of hit and run and robbery for eddie 
on may,supervising dcfs case workers declined to grant an exemption authorizing to live in the taper avenue residence.the next day,the csw advised maternal grandmother to move and offered referrals and assistance.maternal grandmother refused and,on june,dcfs detained from the taper avenue residence.
at a hearing on june,dcfs amended the supplemental petition to reflect additional instances of domestic violence and dcfs belief that two residents of the taper avenue residence had disqualifying criminal convictions.counsel for dcfs represented to the court that preliminary results of the criminal records check disclosed one of the residents of the taper avenue home had a prior conviction of robbery,which under the code was not waivable but,in order to make a final determination,dcfs needed the results of the live scan,which were not yet available 
the juvenile court indicated george personally had appeared before the court on june,and denied ever having been convicted of rape.the juvenile court noted domestic violence no longer was a concern because maternal grandmother and mark had separated.pending confirmation of the prior convictions by a fingerprint clearance check,the juvenile court ordered to remain in maternal grandmother care but ordered maternal grandmother not to leave alone with anyone not approved by dcfs.
the juvenile court asked counsel for dcfs to put the matter on calendar as soon as further information on the prior convictions became available,especially if dcfs was unable to obtain a waiver.but i need accurate information before we start saying maternal grandmother ca keep was released to her,and i know maternal grandmother is moving,but i not placing the child in the taper avenue home.i have already placed the child with this caretaker,and right now she staying temporarily there 
in response to the juvenile court order,dcfs filed the instant writ petition.we issued an order to show cause.
thereafter,at a hearing below on the supplemental petition,maternal grandmother waived adjudication.the juvenile court removed from maternal grandmother care and granted maternal grandmother family services.
contentions 
dcfs contends the juvenile court lacked authority to place with maternal grandmother in the taper avenue residence.
counsel for contends the writ petition should be dismissed as moot.alternatively,counsel for claims the order under review was not an abuse of the juvenile court discretion.
discussion 
counsel for suggests the petition be dismissed because has been removed from maternal grandmother care and no effective relief can be granted in light of the resolution of the supplemental petition.in re jessica th,d.
dcfs argues the issue is capable of recurring without being resolved and the issue is one of continuing public interest.in re robert th,d in re jody d.
we agree with dcfs.clearly,the emergency movement of a relative caretaker from one home to another is not an unusual circumstance.because the issue is likely to recur without being resolved,we address the merits of the petition.
overview of the statutory scheme.
section,known as the lance helms child safety act of,was named in honor of a toddler murdered by his father.the legislative history of the act contains the argument of the author,senator richard polanco,in support of the bill.it discloses the bill was intended to replace vague and ambiguous statutes that allowed the courts,social workers and attorneys to take the line of least resistance when dealing with abused children.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.the argument noted that in,in los angeles county alone,children were murdered by either a parent or a caregiver.twelve of the children murdered had open cases with child protective services.ibid.
