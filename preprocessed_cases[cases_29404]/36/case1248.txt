appellant donna challenges two juvenile court orders restricting access to confidential case files in the dependency proceedings regarding her daughter gina s.the first order directed appellant to return copies she had received from the juvenile court file and prohibited her from disseminating the records without a prior court order.the second order denied appellant petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section section petition for disclosure of juvenile records.in affirming the order directing appellant to return documents,we conclude that although appellant is authorized to inspect juvenile court files,she is not entitled to make copies absent a prior court order.we find,however,that the juvenile court second order improperly denied appellant access to documents needed to pursue an invasion of privacy claim and therefore reverse the denial of appellant section petition.
factual and procedural background 
gina was born in july and was the subject of several referrals to child protective services beginning in,when she was five years old in march,respondent filed a petition based on allegations gina suffered serious emotional damage as a result of appellant behavior.the case number for the proceedings was the first dependency case.the first dependency case was dismissed after an agreement that gina would remain with her caretakers and appellant would cooperate so that gina could receive medical treatment and other services requiring parental authorization.a second petition was filed in july based on allegations that appellant rescinded previous authorization regarding medical care,which prevented gina caretakers from securing medical care for her.the new petition was assigned a different case number.gina was adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court in september,and the juvenile court later terminated reunification services.in in re gina i,supra,nos,we affirmed the juvenile court order finding jurisdiction over gina but reversed the court order terminating reunification services to appellant because the juvenile court failed to adopt a case plan for appellant.neither reunification services nor custody of gina are at issue in this appeal 
a.the section petition.
in december,appellant,acting in propria persona,served a section petition.the petition requested a ll records generated or supplemented between february,and september,that include any of the following terms.ssa.commissioner.social security office,or social security employee.variations of a first and last name.medical diagnosis medical condition of donna s,or any combination of those terms the petition also requested records that contained information about the past,present,or future physical or mental health or condition of donna s,information about any governmental agency inappropriately obtaining information referring to donna s,or misusing information referring to donna s,and any sworn declaration or affidavit that has been filed by any of appellant attorneys in this case.the petition stated that appellant believed her federal privacy act rights had been violated and sought the documents in order to allow her attorney to investigate what was disclosed and to evaluate the validity of possible legal claims.the petition was dated december,and bore the number of the first dependency case.it was stamped,received marin county superior court dec above the stamp was the handwritten note,lodged on demand.
respondent application for temporary restraining order.
according to a declaration filed in the juvenile court,gina counsel filed a preliminary response to the section petition on december.while filing the response,gina counsel was informed by a juvenile court clerk that another clerk had provided appellant with copies of documents from gina confidential juvenile file upon her request.it was unclear whether the copied documents had come from the file in the present action or in the first dependency case.according to the declaration of gina counsel,counsel informed the juvenile court clerk that appellant was not permitted to have copies of documents from the juvenile court file.
respondent filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause and temporary restraining order tro,requesting that appellant not copy or disseminate any of the information from her daughter confidential dependency files.the juvenile court entered a tro,effective until january,and ordered appellant not to copy,distribute,or disseminate any of the records.the tro was subsequently extended until february,when another hearing was scheduled.
c.the february,hearing.
the juvenile court considered both the request for appellant to return documents copied from the juvenile court file and appellant section petition on february.the court first considered the application for an order regarding the copies appellant received from the juvenile court file.after hearing argument from appellant counsel,the juvenile court granted respondent application and ordered appellant to return any and all documents copied from the juvenile court file and not to copy or disseminate any documents or information received from the file without obtaining prior court authorization.after the juvenile court issued its order,appellant counsel stated appellant had a problem recalling which documents she actually received from the clerk office.the juvenile court responded,i have a court order in place.if i were you,i would find out where those documents are and return them.
the juvenile court next considered appellant section petition.appellant counsel argued that appellant sought to have an attorney review a very limited class of documents in order to pursue a claim for an alleged wrongful dissemination of social security records to respondent.gina counsel argued that gina file documented the years of abuse gina suffered while in her mother care and that she did not understand how any information can come out of those files without it affecting gina privacy in some way.respondent counsel agreed and said it would be extremely difficult to separate the information appellant sought from private information about gina.in response to respondent counsel statement that appellant previously had received relevant information through discovery,appellant counsel acknowledged donna had the information but stated that she sought court permission to share that information with an attorney in connection with a possible privacy violation lawsuit.
the juvenile court reviewed in camera the child protective services cps files provided by respondent.after its review,the juvenile court stated,i took a look at several of the code sections,and specifically rule of court b which requires that the court balance the interests of the child and other parties to the juvenile court proceedings,interests of the petitioner,and interests of the public.the court must permit disclosure o r discovery,however access to juvenile court records only in so far as is necessary,and only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the records in question will disclose information or evidence of substantial relevance to the pending litigation.and it goes on to say that,the burden is on the petitioner to describe in detail the reason the records are being sought and their relevancy to the proceeding for which petitioner wishes to inspect the records.and i find that has not been met.the court then denied the section petition in its entirety.
appellant timely appealed from both the order that she return documents and the denial of her section petition 
discussion 
it is the express intent of the legislature that juvenile court records,in general,should be confidential,subd.b.this reflects a long recognized public policy of protecting the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and records.superior court cal d,keisha,supra,th at,d.access to confidential juvenile records is governed by section.section,subdivision a lists categories of people who have the right to inspect juvenile records without court order,including the child and his or her parents,as well as certain other designated persons who have a direct interest in matters related to the child,subd.a a n.section,subdivision a o also provides access to a ny other person who may be designated by court order of the judge of the juvenile court upon filing a petition.the juvenile court has exclusive authority to determine the extent to which confidential juvenile records may be released and controls the time,place and manner of inspection.lorenza superior court d.see also superior court,supra,cal d at,keisha,supra,th at,d.the juvenile court has both the sensitivity and expertise to make this determination.citation.keisha,supra,at,d.
appellant argues that the juvenile court erred in ordering her to return the copies she received from a clerk and denying her section petition because she has a right to access information about her own medical records in order to pursue redress for any violation of her privacy.respondent emphasizes the vast discretion the juvenile court has over access to confidential juvenile case files.gina has filed a brief asserting her right to privacy but supporting appellant position and arguing that there is no good faith argument that the orders at issue were lawful in light of significant procedural and evidentiary deficiencies.we review the juvenile court orders for abuse of discretion.in re elijah th,d in re th,d in re tiffany th,d in re robert th,d.
ordering appellant to return documents was not abuse of discretion.
section,subdivision a d provides that a case file in juvenile proceedings may be inspected by the minor parents.all parties as well as the juvenile court agree that appellant is permitted to inspect the confidential juvenile court file that relates to the dependency proceedings involving her daughter.see cal.rules of court,rule b specified persons in section may inspect juvenile court records without prior court authorization.the juvenile court order that appellant return copies she received and not make any further copies without the court permission can only be justified if the right to inspect documents does not include the right to copy the same documents.
we independently determine the proper interpretation of section burden snowden cal th,d,and conclude that the right to inspect a juvenile court file does not include the automatic right to copy documents in the file.right granted in section to inspect file does not include authority to copy without first obtaining a court order.the statute refers to the right to inspect,but not to copy,a case file,subd.a.we must look to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.white ultramar,cal th,d.the word inspect,which means to view closely in critical appraisal,does not encompass making an imitation,transcript,or reproduction of an original work,the definition of the word copy.collegiate dict.ed.as the attorney general observed in a opinion holding that a district attorney may inspect but not copy documents in juvenile case files without first obtaining a court order,the legislature would know,of course,how to say inspected and copied if it so intended,supra,at,citing,inspect and copy,inspection and copying,inspection and copying,inspection or copying,inspection or copying,inspection and copying see also bus,subd.c inspect and have copies,inspection and copying food,inspect and copy.we note that although section has been amended virtually every year since it first appeared in people superior court,supra,th at,d,the attorney general interpretation of the statute has not been modified by the legislature.meyer board of trustees d.legislature presumed to be aware of attorney general opinion and able to take corrective action if opinion contrary to legislative intent.that the legislature has modified at least three other statutes to permit copying of documents also demonstrates that it is capable of taking corrective action.see amendments,deering ann.bus,supp,ed.historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll.
sound public policy supports the legislature decision to afford some categories of people the right to inspect,but not to copy,documents in the juvenile case file.a juvenile case file is defined by statute as a petition filed in any juvenile court proceeding,reports of the probation officer,and all other documents filed in that case or made available to the probation officer in making his or her report,or to the judge,referee,or other hearing officer,and thereafter retained by the probation officer,judge,referee,or other hearing officer,subd.e,italics added.allowing parties the unfettered right to copy such a broad category of documents absent a court order would frustrate the juvenile court ability to safeguard the privacy of minors in order to protect their best interests and to control access to juvenile case files.superior court,supra,cal d at,in re tiffany,supra,th at,d.
appellant trial counsel argued that the language of rule b supports the position that appellant was permitted to copy documents from the juvenile court file.but the plain language of the rule permits a party to inspect,obtain,or copy juvenile court records only after securing an order from the juvenile court.rule b.that appellant does not have the automatic right to copy documents from gina case file does not mean she could not seek a court order to copy the documents,as respondent acknowledges.section,subdivision a b contemplates the release of a juvenile case file or any portion thereof italics added so long as interested parties are afforded due process,and courts have consistently interpreted the statute to vest the juvenile court with the authority to determine when the release of juvenile court records is appropriate.keisha,supra,th at,d.
the question remains whether the juvenile court abused its discretion in ordering the return of the copies appellant received from the juvenile case file.appellant does not precisely explain how the juvenile court erred and instead focuses primarily on the denial of her section petition.respondent emphasizes that appellant does not have an automatic right to copy documents in the juvenile case file and concludes that because she had no such right,the juvenile court order was within the court discretion and thus,was not an abuse of discretion.gina argues the juvenile court did not follow proper procedures and that the juvenile court order was not supported by any evidence.
as to gina procedural arguments,we first reject her argument that respondent lacked standing to request the documents be returned.social services department shall represent interests of minors in dependency proceedings in re tiffany,supra,th at,d juvenile court had authority to enter order following allegations in social worker report.we also conclude that the juvenile court had the authority to order appellant to return copies of juvenile case file documents,contrary to gina suggestion.in re anthony,supra,th at,d juvenile court has exclusive authority to determine whether juvenile records will be released.we likewise disagree that the juvenile court was required to follow the procedures for injunctions set forth in the code of civil procedure.pack kings county human services agency th,d pack section governs confidentiality and release of juvenile records people espinoza th,d same.
gina also overstates how much evidence was required to support the juvenile court order.indeed,the records at issue can provide sufficient proof of the harm that would be suffered were they disclosed.pack,supra,th at,d.it is beyond dispute that the juvenile case file here is filled with documents that detail the emotional abuse gina suffered,as well as incidents that would be embarrassing to gina were they to become public.it apparently also is undisputed that appellant actually received copies of documents from the clerk office.absent a court order,appellant might assume she was free to disseminate at will the copies she received,which would clearly undermine the court efforts to protect the minor and promote her best interests.in re tiffany,supra,th at,d.
in in re tiffany,the court found that the juvenile court was well within its authority when it ordered that a mother and stepfather not circulate confidential information from juvenile records after they had mailed copies of various
