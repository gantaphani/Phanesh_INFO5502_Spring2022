factual and procedural background 
petitioner deborah and real party in interest daryl were divorced in,and deborah was awarded primary custody of their two sons,who was years old at the time of the instant proceedings,and,who was years old at the time.
in september,deborah sought to have her child support amended.in response,daryl filed an order to show cause osc seeking a change in custody and visitation,as well as an order for drug testing.in support of the osc,daryl submitted a declaration from their son indicating that he believed that his mother used drugs.specifically,stated that his belief was based upon several incidences sic that have occurred over the past year.one incident which i have first hand knowledge of,occurred about a week before christmas,in the evening.i arrived home at about to find my brother,home alone.told me he had found mom stash.i told him i did not believe him so he showed me a small piece of paper folded up to form a pouch.i looked inside the pouch and saw a quarter size amount of white,clumpy,powdery substance.when deborah was confronted about the stash,she claimed that it was hers,it was for a friend.in his declaration requests that the court order deborah to take a hair follicle drug test because i am concerned that she may be using drugs and exposing and allowing access to drugs.
in support of the osc,daryl also submitted a mediation report from beverly pruitt,a counselor for the superior court family court services.in the report she related a mediation session which deborah and daryl attended.in the report,pruitt wrote of daryl contention that he was seeking primary custody of because deborah was using illegal drugs.this allegation was based on the facts stated in declaration.daryl claimed that deborah had a history of using drugs and that keeps finding drugs in the house.
in response,deborah told pruitt that she last used drugs in september and that she was opposed to any drug testing.deborah also related that daryl had not made consistent contact with and that daryl had recently been arrested for being drunk in public.she admitted that found cocaine in her dresser drawer,but claimed that it belonged to a friend.pruitt also interviewed before preparing her report.
pruitt recommended that the parents retain joint legal custody,but that primary physical custody be awarded to daryl.pruitt also recommended that deborah be subjected to drug testing.
in opposition to the osc,deborah submitted a declaration detailing the alleged lack of contact by daryl with and daryl arrest for drunk and disorderly conduct on a night when was staying with him.with regard to the drug use allegations,deborah stated that she was a flight attendant who was regularly tested for drugs and alcohol and had recently received a clear test result.
the hearing on daryl osc was held in january.at the hearing,pruitt testified to the matters stated in her report and her recommendations.the court then heard argument from the parties on custody,support,and the request for drug testing.after hearing argument,the court denied daryl request for a change of custody.however,the court made that order conditioned upon deborah submitting to hair follicle drug testing.the court ordered that a failure to submit to the drug testing would result in being placed in daryl physical custody.the court further ordered that if deborah complied and the test came back positive,the parties were to appear for a further hearing to determine what action should be taken.
deborah thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the court order exceeded its authority because,under section a,the court only had authority to order a urine,not a hair follicle,test.in support of that motion she lodged the results of a urine test she took on january,that was negative for marijuana,cocaine,amphetamines,opiates and pcp.
a hearing was held on january.after hearing argument,the court denied deborah motion,finding that section a allowed for a hair follicle test.however,the court ordered the matter stayed pending resolution by this court of deborah petition.
discussion 
deborah asserts that the court erred in ordering her to have a hair follicle drug test under section a,as that section only allows urine tests.we conclude that because section a requires any drug testing to conform to federal drug testing procedures and standards,and those federal standards at present only allow for urine tests,the court erred in ordering deborah to submit to hair follicle testing

ii.principles of statutory interpretation 
we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.in determining intent,we look first to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.citations.although we may properly rely on extrinsic aids,we should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citation.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.burden snowden cal th,d,see also lungren deukmejian cal d,i f the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature.
i f the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,see also harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.the legislative history of section a is entitled to great weight.see hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.
