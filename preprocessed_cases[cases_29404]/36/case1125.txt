the central question in this case is whether an unwed father has a right to withhold his consent to the biological mother decision to give up their child for adoption by a third party.we conclude the trial court properly found the father had not met the requirements of adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey,as further explained in adoption of michael cal th,d,michael,he did not show that he promptly came forward and demonstrated as full a commitment to his parental responsibilities as the biological mother allowed and the circumstances permitted within a short time after he learned or reasonably should have learned that the biological mother was pregnant with his child.id.at,d.consequently,the father has no protected right allowing him to stand in the way of the child adoption.we affirm the order dispensing with the need for father consent,terminating his parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child,and allowing the adoption to go forward.
we recite the evidence in the light most favorable to the court order,noting that the father version of facts,summarized separately,post,contradicts that evidence in virtually every material respect.
meghan mcg.was years old,in high school,and living with her parents when,on april,she had sexual intercourse with paul,a senior from another high school.it was the only time the two had intercourse.
meghan testified that in,after she had twice missed her menstrual period,she took a home pregnancy test,with a positive result.she called paul before the end of may and told him about the pregnancy.paul remained silent during the phone conversation as meghan said she would have the baby and give it up for adoption.he did not deny paternity,nor did he ask meghan if she needed anything.he did not offer to take her to the doctor.he did not offer to pay for medical care or otherwise help out financially.at the end of the phone call,he told meghan,well,good luck with that.
meghan said she and paul did not speak again for a few weeks,although at some point,paul left a message on meghan cell phone,asking her to have an abortion.then,according to meghan testimony,on june,paul came to her house,grabbed her by arm when she answered the door,and tried to pull her outside.she resisted,but agreed to speak to him,and they went to the back patio of the house,where paul confronted her gruffly when she refused to have an abortion.meghan explained due to personal convictions that i had that i did not feel comfortable with abortion and it was not a decision that i wanted to make,and paul then went on a little tirade,sprinkled with profanities,inter alia,calling meghan a bitch and a slut and using the f word.he did not ask meghan about how the pregnancy was going,although she volunteered to him that she had been extremely nauseous and vomiting excessively.he did not ask her whether she needed help of any kind the conversation ended when paul left,saying,get an abortion or else.
meghan version of the june encounter was corroborated by her friend,cody,who personally witnessed it.according to cody,paul first yanked meghan outside when she answered the door,then went with her to the back patio.cody,in the adjacent kitchen with meghan little brother,saw paul up in meghan face and heard him tell her,i want you to have an abortion.when meghan tried to explain why she intended to continue with the pregnancy,cody heard paul call her a slut,whore,and bitch and say she was an idiot and her decision not to have an abortion was stupid.
meghan did not see paul again until after the baby was born,but they had a few july telephone conversations in which,according to meghan,paul always said the same thing,that is,he talked only about abortion.meghan,without a job or means to pay for doctor visits on her own,told paul she had obtained emergency coverage.still,paul did not offer financial assistance.eventually,meghan asked paul to stop badgering her she had already told him there was nothing he could do to make her get an abortion because she had no legitimate health reason,like my life was in danger or something to that effect.nonetheless,she testified,abortion was all paul seemed to be focused on,and that seemed to be his only motive or reason for speaking to me.
in a late july phone call,meghan put her cell phone on speaker so two friends could hear the conversation.paul again asked meghan if she had gone to the doctor for an abortion.when she said she was not going to have an abortion,paul asked,well,have you told your parents yet meghan replied,no,what do you care paul said,well,you know,someone needs to knock some sense into you.i think that they will make you get an abortion.if you do get into the doctor next week and get the abortion i am going to anonymously tell your parents.meghan protested that she alone had the right to decide when to tell her parents,but paul said,you have one week and you better get to the doctor.
paul then moved to boulder to attend the university of colorado,and he remained there until january.he acknowledged he wrote meghan no letters,called her one time,in september,and talked for a couple of minutes,and had no contact with her until march or april,when he handed her a gift for the baby.according to meghan,throughout the pregnancy,paul offered her no emotional support,no friendship,and no assistance of any kind,except he volunteered to pay for the abortion which meghan so steadfastly opposed.
in the meantime,within days of her last july phone conversation with paul,meghan,by then four months pregnant,stressed with nausea,intense vomiting,and a weight loss taking double classes in school to graduate early so she could move on to college,and concerned about how disappointed her parents might be,finally told them that she was pregnant,she had contacted their church adoption agency,family services,and she wanted to give the baby up for adoption.
meghan parents,sterling and pamela,were supportive of meghan and arranged for her to see the obstetrician who had delivered her and her siblings.meghan began receiving prenatal care,and in short order,she and her parents attended a meeting at family services,where the parents asked the counselor whether they could adopt the baby.advised that the agency did not arrange kinship adoptions,but that a private attorney could do so,sterling,pamela,and meghan decided on that course of action,and by the end of august,they had all agreed meghan could proceed with her plan to attend college in utah after the birth and sterling and pamela would pursue adoption.
in late september,attorney david baum sent a letter to paul at his boulder apartment,advising him he represented sterling and pamela in their intended adoption of the baby.baum asked,inter alia,for paul waiver,as the alleged or presumed father,of any right to further notice of the adoption proceedings and advised paul that by signing the documents,he would have no further parental or financial obligations toward the child and no further rights once the adoption placement was successfully completed.paul attorney promptly advised baum that his client would not be signing the waiver.at the end of november,when meghan was eight months pregnant,paul filed a petition naming meghan as respondent and seeking to establish his parental relationship with the child and obtain legal and physical custody.he attested meghan had recently told him of her pregnancy and of her belief he was the father.
arthur was born about two weeks later,on december.paul was informed of the birth on december,and on december,he sought an order to show cause re child custody,visitation,and paternity testing.he attested he had been denied access to the child,which prevented him from establishing a parental relationship.he averred he was extremely excited to assume parental responsibility and was willing and ready to take this responsibility seriously.
sterling and pamela filed their adoption petition january.under the box asking for a ny further relevant facts they alleged,mother herein believes asserts that the pregnancy is a result of unconsensual forced intercourse committed by paul against mother.paul used drugs in such undertaking.in addition,respondent has failed to assume any parental responsibilities whatsoever towards the care of the child or with respect to the pregnancy.
the matters were consolidated and the parties stipulated to paternity testing.when testing established paul was arthur biological father,paul attorney sent a letter to counsel for sterling and pamela,dated february,offering paul financial assistance.the letter stated,my client would like to extend an offer of financial assistance to your client for baby arthur mcg.relating to the cases.my client has no way of contacting yours and would appreciate you conveying this offer of financial assistance to meghan.he intended to do this at the time of the baby birth,but was not notified that arthur was born until the end of december and was therefore unable to communicate this offer directly to your client.
in april,the court denied paul request for interim visitation with arthur and appointed counsel for the child.on june,in their first amended petition to determine the issues of paul parental rights and the necessity of his consent to the adoption,sterling and pamela alleged paul was arthur natural father and deleted any reference to the alleged rape set forth in the original petition.they repeated the allegation that paul had failed to assume any parental responsibilities,financial,physical or emotional,with respect to the care and custody of the child and with respect to the pregnancy.
paul testimony 
the trial commenced august.much of the testimony has been summarized,ante.we now recite paul testimony,which contradicts that of meghan and her witnesses in virtually every aspect of any consequence.
paul testified he and meghan dated probably less than a dozen times,but had sexual intercourse only once.when advised of the pregnancy by a third party,he called meghan to confirm the pregnancy and ask her to have a paternity test,unaware that he would have to await the birth of the child.he was uncertain whether he was father because,he said,meghan told me she was dating a new guy from her new school,and i had known all the previous guys she had dated from saint margaret.i knew she was pretty sexually active with all of them.through august,paul definitely had doubts,serious doubts that he was the baby father.
in may,when meghan told paul abortion was her only option he said he would support her in that decision if that was what she really wanted,but he never,ever,at any time during the pregnancy,suggested she have an abortion.rather,he urged her over and over to tell her parents and go see a doctor.he offered to put her on his medical insurance,drive her to the doctor meghan did not have a driver license,help her tell her parents about the pregnancy or even tell them all by himself so he could take the brunt of it and be there for her,you know,no matter what.meghan refused to let him help.she told paul that due to her plans to attend school,she was considering placing the child for adoption.even though paul doubted he was the child father,he offered to take care of the baby while meghan was in college because he firmly believed a child should not be adopted unless the natural parents were incapable of providing for it.he told meghan marriage was definitely a possibility.when he left for college in colorado,his doubts about his paternity grew with the day.
paul said that when he went to colorado,he rented an apartment with an extra room for meghan and the baby just in case meghan parents kicked her out of her house and she would need somewhere to live right away.he did not testify he invited meghan to come to colorado or told her he had a room for her.indeed,he had no contact with her in the interval between the end of august and january other than one telephone conversation,on september,that lasted only a couple of minutes.when,a few days later,he received baum september,letter seeking his waiver regarding the planned adoption,paul stated he called home.i asked my parents to retain representation for me in california immediately so i would lose any further rights.he then retained counsel who,on october,sent a letter to baum stating paul would not sign the waiver.the letter itself is not in the record,but a letter from baum to paul attorney,dated october,states,inter alia,i do not believe that there is any court that would order genetic testing and we ca agree to genetic testing because of the substantial risk of danger to the fetus and to meghan,and absent genetic testing any custody action is,i would respectfully suggest,premature.baum suggested genetic testing could take place promptly after the baby is born.thus,it reasonably can be inferred that paul attorney did,indeed,write to baum and one of the topics covered was paternity testing.as noted,ante in november,a few weeks before the baby birth,paul filed a petition to establish paternity and for custody of the yet unborn child,based on his understanding that meghan was placing the baby for adoption by her parents.
baum informed paul of arthur birth on december,two weeks after the baby was born.two days later,on december,paul filed an order to show cause requesting custody,visitation,and genetic testing,and declared he wanted to take responsibility for the child.in january,he took a semester off from college and moved back home with his parents.he got a job,and spent all his savings and college money on lawyers after receiving the results of the paternity test,paul told everyone he was arthur father,sent a birth announcement and a handwritten note to his grandparents and had a baby blanket delivered to meghan house.he set up a room for the baby nursery in his parents house,bought a stroller,a car seat,baby toys,clothes and food,enrolled in parenting classes,and started investigating local preschools.he planned to live with his parents,continue paying rent,work his way through school,and establish a career so he could move out on his own with arthur.he sent a letter to meghan,offering to reimburse her for her medical costs,including insurance payments,but received no response 
issue of rape charges 
we discuss the rape charges issue under its own heading because it is the focal point of paul argument that he was excused from promptly stepping up to the parental plate by circumstances beyond his control.in his briefs on appeal and again during oral argument,paul counsel vigorously attempted to convey the impression,albeit without alluding to specific calendar dates,that from late july,a few days after the conversation with meghan,and throughout the remainder of,continuing into the early months of,paul could not assume the supportive role defined under the kelsey and michael standards because he feared criminal prosecution arising from meghan rape charges.we have thoroughly searched the entire record on appeal,the appellant appendix and the reporter transcript,and we have paul briefs,carefully rechecking relevant record cites for the accuracy of references to evidence supporting the approximate time frame in which paul contends he was willing,but unable,to do what otherwise would have been demanded of him.we have come up.there is nothing in the record giving rise to a reasonable inference that paul knew about the rape charges at any time before january,after the baby birth,when he read or was told of the allegations contained in sterling and pamela original adoption petition.our comprehensive recitation of the relevant record summarizes what it says and does not say on the issue of paul knowledge of rape charges and is necessary to put into proper perspective our discussion of kelsey and michael 
nowhere did paul testify that he learned of the rape charges at any time in.the only reasonable inference to be gleaned from the record in its entirety is that paul first learned such charges existed after sterling and pamela adoption petition was filed on january,stating meghan belief that paul had forced her to have nonconsensual intercourse and may have given her a date rape drug.more specifically,paul testified he was concerned there might be a criminal case pending because of the things meghan told me at an unspecified time,allegations in the documents i was given the january,petition,and the fact that they filed with the at an unspecified time.he believed meghan must have falsely told her parents he had drugged and raped her not because of anything he heard at any time in,but because the parents stated these allegations in their january,original adoption petition.paul testified meghan may have reported the charges to the local police because,according to her trial testimony in august,she made a covert call to paul in august to see if they could get some kind of a confession out of him.there is no evidence,not even paul testimony,indicating he knew of the covert attempt to get his confession or that the police were monitoring the call from meghan.indeed,the very idea of a covert operation to obtain paul confession precludes an inference that anyone told paul what was going on.
paul testified he made no efforts to go to meghan home in or provide her or the child support because i was advised not to.paul was asked whether he ever attempted to contact meghan or her parents once he realized he was the biological father,after the paternity results confirmed his paternity,which was sometime in or after march.paul testified he believed or knew at that time that there was a potentially criminal action pending against him.paul also stated he was concerned about prosecution of a criminal action as soon as the told me they tried to file,but there is no evidence as to when that event occurred.likewise,paul testified he hired a criminal attorney,but there is no evidence as to when that occurred.paul stated he was advised by criminal counsel to stay away from meghan and her parents,but there is no evidence as to when that advice was given.paul said he took his lawyers advice because he was afraid he would be charged with harassment if he attempted any contact with meghan,but again,there is no time reference for that testimony.paul said he feared criminal prosecution for,inter alia,rape,statutory rape,and rape by use of a drug,but he did not say that fear arose at any time in,prior to the child december birth.moreover,nowhere in paul declarations supporting his parentage petitions is there any assertion that he stayed away from meghan and her family during the pregnancy because of fear of criminal prosecution arising from rape charges or an investigation or advice of counsel,even though such a factual assertion,under oath,would have been highly relevant to his kelsey and michael argument for parental rights.
we note paul testified he told his parents about meghan pregnancy days after he learned of it himself,that is,in may.he said his parents were concerned regarding the teenagers relative ages,paul being,meghan.as paul stated,they his parents were a little surprised,yes,about our ages.they were also worried about any kind of criminal action.but he never testified that his parents worries were based on any information regarding an actual investigation,nor did he testify his parents worries caused him also to worry or to stay away from meghan out of fear of criminal prosecution,and in point of fact,he had continuing contact with meghan after his conversation with his parents,urging her,throughout the next several months before he left for colorado,to have an abortion.indeed,the fact that paul was not fearful in the summer of is forcefully illustrated by his appearance at meghan house in june,where he and she had a heated discussion regarding abortion.
of further interest,although not of evidentiary value,we note paul trial brief alludes to the rape charges only as follows testimony in the present case will show that meghan mcg.refused to communicate with paul regarding whether or not she was indeed pregnant and whether or not she would go to a doctor.furthermore,meghan parents then successfully prevented paul from having access to meghan mcg.by alleging in their original january,adoption petition that the sex was unconsensual,an allegation now withdrawn as to these proceedings only.the trial brief further states,paul will testify as will his mother,maria,that his parents who he had told about these rumors regarding the pregnancy and paul paternity insisted that he stay away from meghan mcg.fearing her potential allegations would lead to him being arrested.the fears were confirmed when they received the mcgs petition to dispense with his parental rights,and alleged in that pleading that the pregnancy was allegedly the result of unconsensual sex or date rape.italics added.the trial brief further stated,this allegation in the petition and fear that charges were pending forced paul to hire a criminal attorney,ron brower.throughout the proceeding,from january,when the adoption petition was filed the threat of criminal prosecution has been held over paul head to deter him from actively going to the home or communicating with them.as a result of the criminal charges threatened and in fact filed at an unspecified date but rejected by the district attorney of orange county in june,paul has been forced to make all offers of assistance through counsel and has been forced to assert his fifth amendment rights.the trial brief also states,at an unspecified date,meghan mcg.file d a complaint against paul with the district attorney,contrary to testimony in the depositions of sterling and meghan mcg.those charges were being investigated immediately prior to the original court date in june.the district attorney refuse d to prosecute paul 
the court decision 
at the conclusion of the trial,the court found paul had failed to come forward promptly and assume his parental responsibilities.after a lengthy analysis of the kelsey and michael decisions and oral review of the testimony,the court stated,inter alia,t he evidence,in my mind,indicates that you have not risen to the status where you had the rights as if you were the presumed father by providing the full emotional,financial and other support required of the parent,of a father for the mother and the child during the time that you knew of the mother pregnancy to the time of the birth of the child,thus you have not achieved that status as a presumed father entitled to veto the adoption of this child.the court further commented,you asking for a paternity test y ou unsure.you have provided financial support.b y asking for an abortion,you not providing emotional support.you calling her names.that is not emotional support.that is emotional degradation.noting paul had gone away to school,leaving the mother in the lurch,when he should have been responsible to provide the financial,emotional and other support,such as prenatal tests and possible doctor visits,going with the mother to some classes and so on,the court observed,y ou had a parental responsibility when you were in colorado to provide for the child,but that after the fact.and i believe there was testimony here that you would agree to pay for an abortion but that is not supportive of a mother who said from the outset that she was going to keep the child.that was her intention all along.finding paul did not achieve the status of presumed father able to veto the adoption under either statutory,or case law kelsey,supra,cal th,d,michael,supra,cal th,d,the court ordered that paul consent to the adoption was not necessary,dismissed the paternity action,and allowed the adoption proceeding to go forward.paul appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
arguing for an independent standard of review,paul contends the dispositive facts are undisputed,that is,paul failed to provide significant financial and emotional support to meghan before arthur birth because he was afraid of meghan alleged rape charge.but undisputed signifies settled or not open to dispute or question webster new world dict.college ed,and the word is inapt with regard to the asserted reason for paul actions or inactions,as should be apparent from our summary of the record relating to paul knowledge of the rape charge.paul testimony about his mental state was not undisputed,but merely and not surprisingly uncontradicted,and the trial court is not bound by uncontradicted evidence.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d factfinder may reject a witness uncontradicted test
