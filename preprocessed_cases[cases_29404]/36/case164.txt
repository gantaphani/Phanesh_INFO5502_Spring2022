opinion of the court 
this controversy arises out of the tragic and fatal shooting of donta dawson dawson or the decedent in an encounter with officers of the philadelphia police department.dawson biological father,bobby mccurdy mccurdy,appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to mccurdy sole remaining claim from an action brought pursuant to.mccurdy invoked the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and asserted that defendants had violated his parental liberty interest in the companionship of his independent adult son.
the district court granted summary judgment on the ground that mccurdy was precluded from bringing his action after he had entered into an agreement with dawson mother to share the proceeds from her settlement of a prior civil action against the same defendants here.we find,however,that there is a controlling,threshold issue which obviates the need to address preclusion that is,whether mccurdy has adequately asserted the violation of a cognizable constitutional right.because the due process clause does not protect the interest of a parent in the companionship of his or her independent adult child,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
on the night of october,donta dawson was sitting alone in a parked car,with the engine running,on street near glenwood avenue in philadelphia.the headlights and interior lights were on,and the radio was audible.philadelphia police officers kirk dodd and christopher dipasquale spotted dawson vehicle and pulled up alongside it.officer dodd inquired why dawson was parked on the street and whether he needed any assistance.according to the officers,dawson looked at them and then looked away without responding.
officer dodd exited the patrol car and approached dawson on the driver side of the car.he asked dawson again whether he needed help.dawson looked at officer dodd,shrugged his shoulders,and turned away.the encounter rapidly escalated from there.the officers demanded that dawson raise his hands,at times yelling obscenities to emphasize their point.dawson did not respond.officer dipasquale drew his weapon and positioned himself by the hood of the patrol car.
while holding down dawson left arm,officer dodd reached in and removed the key from the ignition.he then drew his weapon and pointed it directly at dawson.repeated demands to show his hands were met with dawson silence.officer dodd then attempted to pull dawson left arm up without success.as he retreated,he told officer dipasquale that dawson had a gun.
after further demands that he raise his hands,dawson finally began to move his left arm.officer dipasquale then fired his weapon,fatally shooting dawson in the head.a subsequent investigation revealed that dawson was unarmed.
although the familial relationships between the decedent and his parents are important to this case,the factual record is disturbingly incomplete in material respects dawson was the son of cynthia dawson and bobby mccurdy.mccurdy and cynthia dawson apparently never married.it also appears as if dawson raised her son as a single mother.mccurdy did not provide any meaningful financial support to the decedent the defendants assertion that mccurdy never listed his son as a dependent on his income tax returns was not contested.it is unclear whether mccurdy ever resided with his biological son and whether he performed any parental duties during dawson youth.
some aspects of the familial relationships,however,are undisputed.in the years before his death,dawson had minimal contact with his father because mccurdy had been incarcerated since.at the time of the shooting,dawson was nineteen years old.app.at.there is no dispute that dawson was an independent adult,single and without any children of his own.
prior to the district court summary judgment disposition,there were a number of other proceedings that relate to the present appeal.approximately six months after dawson fatal encounter with the police,cynthia dawson,on her own behalf and as administratrix of her son estate,filed a civil action in state court against the city of philadelphia and several officers of the philadelphia police department,including officers dodd and dipasquale.she asserted six causes of action.the first three alleged violations of dawson civil rights.the fifth and sixth causes of action,also on behalf of dawson,were brought pursuant to the pennsylvania survival and wrongful death statutes,respectively.see.ann.her fourth cause of action,however,asserted the violation of her own constitutional rights for the loss of companionship of her son.at the outset,mccurdy was not a party to this action.
the defendants removed dawson action to federal court.upon the filing of answers,the defendants settled the matter for a total of.on july,dawson executed an agreement,releasing the defendants from all claims arising out of the death of her son.dawson then filed a petition for leave to settle the action and requested an order approving her proposed distribution of the settlement proceeds the district court granted dawson petition in part,permitted the settlement of the action and the payment of attorneys fees and costs,but denied her request to determine an appropriate distribution of the settlement proceeds.the denial of the distribution plan was entered without prejudice to the filing of an application in state court for approval of the plan.
dawson filed a petition for approval of the distribution plan in state court in august.in her petition and supporting memorandum,dawson contended that mccurdy had forfeited any right or interest in the settlement proceeds because,among other things,he failed to perform any parental functions or to provide any financial support.shortly thereafter,mccurdy filed an unsigned objection to dawson petition and a similarly unsigned memorandum of law in support of his objections.
while the distribution of the settlement proceeds was pending,mccurdy filed his own separate action in state court,which commenced the proceedings at issue in this appeal.mccurdy complaint,filed on october,was substantially similar to dawson complaint.the first three causes of action alleged violations of dawson civil rights.his fourth cause of action was almost identical to dawson,except that it asserted a violation of mccurdy own constitutional rights for the loss of companionship of his son.
the defendants removed mccurdy action to the district court on november,and promptly filed motions to dismiss.the district court granted the motions to dismiss the first three causes of action.the court held that dawson,as administratrix of her son estate,was the only proper party to bring claims on behalf of the decedent.see mccurdy dodd,wl,at.the court denied,however,the motion to dismiss the fourth cause of action for the deprivation of mccurdy constitutional rights.in pertinent part,the court held that o ur court of appeals has held that a parent whose child has died as a result of unlawful state action may,in certain circumstances,maintain an action under section for the deprivation of his liberty interest in parenthood.id.citing estate of bailey by oare york county,cir hereinafter bailey.having determined that mccurdy could continue with his due process claim based on the loss of companionship of his adult child,the court directed the parties to proceed with discovery as to mccurdy sole remaining claim.
meanwhile,the court of common pleas of philadelphia,orphan court division,scheduled a hearing with regard to dawson petition to approve her distribution plan.after the hearing,dawson and mccurdy agreed to settle their dispute as to the proper allocation of the settlement proceeds arising out of dawson civil action.therefore,on july,the court entered a decree approving a modified distribution plan reflecting the agreement reached between dawson parents.specifically,dawson was awarded for her individual constitutional claim.the balance of the proceeds,derived from dawson wrongful death claim,was allocated to dawson estate,which both parents were entitled to share in equal portions pursuant to statute.thus,mccurdy and dawson were awarded each.consistent with the decree,mccurdy then executed an agreement with dawson,releasing her and the estate from all claims arising out of dawson death.
based on these events,the defendants in mccurdy action filed motions in the district court for summary judgment.among other things,the defendants argued that mccurdy acceptance of his statutory share of the estate proceeds and his settlement of the dispute with dawson precluded his constitutional claim in the district court action.in addition,the defendants contended that mccurdy lacked standing to bring his fourth cause of action because there was no recognized constitutional right of parents to the companionship of their independent adult children.the district court agreed that mccurdy constitutional claim was precluded.it held that plaintiff accepted part of the funds attributed to the wrongful death action,and executed a release.the claims plaintiff pursues in the instant action for familial companionship are the same as the claims brought by dawson therefore,in partaking of those funds,plaintiff instant claims have been satisfied,and must be dismissed.mccurdy dodd,wl.may,at.the court did not address the defendants renewed argument that the constitution does not protect the interest of parents in the companionship of their adult children.mccurdy appeal followed,and the defendants now urge us to consider the novel constitutional question

in his sole remaining claim,mccurdy alleges that,as a parent,he has a liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment in the companionship of his son.according to mccurdy,when officer dipasquale shot and killed dawson,the defendants violated his parental rights.he seeks to hold the defendants liable for this purported violation pursuant to and.

although we are mindful of the broad remedial purposes of,we must also recognize that,in cases grounded on alleged parental liberty interests,we are venturing into the murky area of unenumerated constitutional rights.see troxel granville,d scalia,dissenting.for this reason,where liberty interests are asserted as a basis for liability pursuant to,courts have consistently undertaken a threshold inquiry at the onset of litigation first,courts must address the threshold issue in any action brought under whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all.butera district of columbia,quoting wilson layne,d see also conn gabbert,d.the purpose of the initial inquiry is to streamline the process of reasoned decisionmaking.b y establishing a threshold a challenged state action implicate a fundamental requiring more than a reasonable relation to a legitimate state interest to justify the action,it avoids the need for complex balancing of competing interests in every case.glucksberg,at.
this threshold inquiry requires us to identify the alleged due process right at issue carefully and precisely.see id.at.see also boyanowski capital area intermediate unit,cir the doctrine of judicial requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the contours of legal concepts such as liberty interests and fundamental rights are amorphous and indistinct therefore,we have cautioned that a ddressing the substantive due process claim requires scrupulous attention to the guideposts that have previously been established.id.at.as the supreme court noted in glucksberg by extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest,we,to a great extent,place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.we must therefore exercise the utmost care lest the liberty protected by the due process clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this court.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
it is by now that the due process clause protects certain narrowly defined fundamental rights of parents in their relationships with their children.there are substantive and procedural components to parental liberty interests.in troxel,the supreme court addressed the constitutionality of a washington state statute which permitted any person to petition a court for visitation rights at any time,when such visitation would serve the best interest of the child.at.in that dispute,the washington superior court had granted visitation rights to the grandparents of two minor children in a manner contrary to the wishes of the children mother.id.at.the supreme court held the statute unconstitutional as applied in that case because it violated the mother substantive due process rights.id.at.in so doing,the court observed that the liberty interest at issue in this interest of parents in the care,custody,and control of their perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.id.at.the court elaborated that the essence of the liberty interest was the right of parents to make decisions concerning the rearing of their children.id.at.see also valdivieso ortiz burgos,cir the emphasis in these cases on choice suggests that the right is one of preemption rather than an absolute right to a certain family relationship,family members have the right,when confronted with the state attempt to make choices for them,to choose for themselves emphasis in original.
the plurality in troxel relied on a line of cases which recognized the due process right of parents to make critical decisions about the upbringing of their children.see id.at.citing meyer nebraska.holding that the due process clause protects the right of parents to establish a home and bring up children and to control the education of their own pierce society of sisters.referring to the right to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control prince massachusetts.recognizing a parental liberty interest in the custody,care and nurture of the child.
in bailey,we also recognized a cognizable liberty interest in preserving the life and physical safety of a minor child a right that logically extends from a parent recognized liberty interest in the custody of his children and the maintenance and integrity of the family.at.in bailey,the biological father of a girl brought suit under when the york county children and youth services returned his daughter to the custody of her mother.id.at.the young girl died a month later from injuries inflicted on her by her mother and her mother paramour.id.supreme court and third circuit precedents are clear in one respect the cases extending liberty interests of parents under the due process clause focus on relationships with minor children.
some cases involving due process rights of parents have a procedural component as well.in stanley illinois,the supreme court invalidated an illinois statute which presumptively treated unwed fathers as unfit parents,without an individualized hearing,d.in that case,the father liberty interest was defined as the interest of a parent in the companionship,care,custody,and management of his or h
