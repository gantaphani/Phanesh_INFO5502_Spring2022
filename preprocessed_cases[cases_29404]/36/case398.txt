on january,emilia duarte duarte filed in united states district court for the southern district of california a petition for the return of her children pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention,as implemented by the international child abduction remedies act,icara.after duarte failed to appear before the court for a scheduled hearing,the district court entered judgment denying duarte hague petition.duarte timely filed a motion to vacate the judgment under.e rule e,which the district court denied.duarte now appeals the district court order denying her motion to set aside judgment.we reverse and remand,ruling that the district court abused its discretion by denying duarte rule e motion 
because the district court must decide the merits of duarte petition on remand,we also address whether equitable tolling of time requirements under the hague convention is available to duarte.we hold that it is available and therefore the district court may consider whether to apply equitable tolling to duarte hague petition.
factual background 
emilia duarte and hector bardales bardales entered the united states from mexico in.together they have four,age,age,and age duarte and bardales never married.in january,they separated and duarte returned to mexico with their four children.in,the two oldest children visited bardales in california.after expressing that they did not want to live with duarte,they established residency with bardales in san diego,california.the two youngest children remained with duarte in mexico.
on july,duarte brought the two youngest children to visit with bardales in tijuana,mexico.while there,bardales removed them from mexico and brought them to california to live with him.it is undisputed that bardales took the two youngest children without duarte knowledge or permission.bardales then immediately filed petitions in california superior court for emergency child custody and to establish paternity.the state court awarded bardales sole custody until duarte appeared in state court.
in september,duarte filed a hague petition with the central authority in mexico,which was transmitted to the central authority in the united states a month later in december,duarte petition was turned over to the san diego district attorney office and in august was assigned to a deputy district attorney.for reasons unknown,duarte petition was not filed in california state court until nearly a year later in april.
duarte state hague petition was consolidated with bardales paternity petition,and the case was set for a hearing in california superior court on april.duarte appeared at that hearing without counsel.the court granted a continuance to permit duarte to retain counsel.duarte,however,failed to show up at two subsequent court dates and as a result,the court removed duarte petition from the calendar without prejudice and awarded bardales sole custody of the children.duarte appealed this decision to the california court of appeal.
while her appeal was pending,duarte filed the present hague petition in federal court the california court of appeal stayed duarte appeal pending adjudication of her hague petition in federal court.
proceedings before the federal district court 
the district court scheduled a hearing on duarte hague petition for september.at the hearing,duarte counsel requested a continuance because duarte could not enter the united states.her counsel explained that two days prior to the scheduled hearing date,her bag,containing her passport and visa,was stolen as she was leaving a train station in mexico.the district court denied the request for a continuance on the grounds that duarte counsel failed to offer sufficient proof that duarte purse was stolen,and duarte had a record of before both the federal and state courts.the district court tentatively denied duarte hague petition because she was not present to establish a prima facie case of unlawful removal or retention.the court stayed entry of judgment for two weeks to give duarte an opportunity to file with the court a certified police report.if duarte failed to provide a certified police report by september,the court would enter judgment denying duarte petition.
on september,duarte filed,as proof that her purse was stolen,a declaration from a transit authority agent and a copy of the police report.duarte also indicated that it was not possible to obtain a certified police report in mexico because transit authority agents are not permitted to have such documents notarized.duarte requested that the district court accept the declaration and copy of the police report in lieu of a certified police report.the district court rejected duarte offer of proof finding the declaration and traffic report insufficient because there was no evidence that an agency generated the written report duarte counsel represented to the court that obtaining a certified police report would be no problem and it was highly improbable that the report was filed on the day of the theft.the district court lifted the stay on september,and entered final judgment denying duarte petition 
on september,duarte timely filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment of the district court pursuant to rule e.duarte argued that the district court committed manifest error in entering judgment denying duarte petition.specifically,duarte claimed that it was impossible for her to comply with the court order to provide a certified police report because such reports are not issued in mexico.in support of her motion,duarte presented evidence from several attorneys and government officials in mexico declaring that duarte reported to the police that her purse was stolen on august,and that the transit authority in mexico does not issue certified or police reports.
in a written order,the district court practically conceded that it may have committed clear error when,as a result of duarte failure to submit a certified police report,it entered judgment against her.the court,however,did not grant duarte rule e motion on that basis,but instead ruled on the merits of duarte hague petition.the court concluded that because duarte hague petition did not entitle her to any relief,the production and acceptance into evidence of a police report would not have affected the outcome of the case.accordingly,the court denied duarte rule e motion.this appeal followed.
a denial of a motion for reconsideration under rule e is construed as one denying relief under rule b and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.pasatiempo aizawa,cir citing barber hawaii,cir fuller jewelry,cir.
it is appropriate for a court to alter or amend judgment under rule e if the district court is presented with newly discovered evidence,the district court committed clear error or made an initial decision that was manifestly unjust,or there is an intervening change in controlling law.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.after reviewing the record,we determine that the court denial of the motion was clear error or manifestly unjust and thus an abuse of discretion.
first,in denying duarte rule e motion,the district court seemed to recognize that it was a mistake to enter judgment against duarte because she failed to provide a certified police report when it was impossible for her to obtain such certification.once the court acknowledged that the basis underlying its original judgment was wrong,it was error not to set aside the judgment.
second,it was clearly improper for the district court not to follow through with its representation that if duarte submitted proof that her purse was stolen it would reschedule the hearing.at the september,hearing,the court stated,failure to supply me with a certified copy of that report will result in the entry of that judgment which i just indicated as a sic tentative,hr g tr.at.the district court went on to state,and so if we see that on the,if you got that on the,then i put the matter back on the calendar for a status sic and we address any depositions or anything else that you want to address.id.at.in our view,the district court could not have been any clearer if duarte provided sufficient proof that her purse was stolen,the court would not enter judgment and would place the september hearing back on the calendar.at the very least,to preserve the fairness and the integrity of the judicial proceedings,the district court should have followed its own representations and put the case back on the calendar once duarte provided a certified copy of the police report or its equivalent.at the time the court denied duarte rule e motion,it was apparent that the proof submitted by duarte served the purpose of providing a certified copy of the police report.
finally,it was error for the district court to decide the merits of duarte petition when the only issue before it was whether,under rule e,the court should vacate the previously entered final judgment.
with respect to the merits of duarte hague petition,the record was incomplete.specifically,a significant dispute existed between the parties as to whether the filing period for duarte hague petition should be tolled this was a critical issue in determining the merits of duarte petition.if tolling did not apply,duarte had filed her petition more than a year from wrongful removal,and bardales could assert the affirmative defense that the children are well settled and should not be returned.see infra part iii.if,however,tolling did apply then the well settled affirmative defense was not available to bardales.
in denying duarte rule e motion,the district court determined that bardales did not hide the children from duarte and therefore equitable tolling did not apply.in so doing,the court disregarded the fact that the record was incomplete on the issue of tolling.indeed,duarte provided the district court with the names of witnesses and a list of exhibits she intended to introduce at the september hearing on the issues of tolling and removal.because the court ruled on the merits sua sponte and without notice to the parties when it denied the rule e motion,duarte was never given the opportunity to introduce this additional evidence and complete the record on tolling.this,we hold,was error.
accordingly,duarte is entitled to relief from the judgment.
on remand the district court will have to decide whether to toll the filing period.therefore,we must now address whether equitable tolling is available under the hague convention and icara,an issue of first impression in this circuit.
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction is an international treaty among the united states and fifty other countries and only applies when both countries are parties to it.gonzalez gutierrez,cir citing hague convention.the convention is intended to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained.hague convention.it is designed to restore the factual status quo which is unilaterally altered when a parent abducts a child and aims to protect the legal custody rights of the parent.feder,cir citing hague international child abduction convention,dep t of state march.in addition,the convention is intended to deprive parties of any tactical advantages gained by absconding with a child to a more favorable forum.holder holder,cir.a judicial proceeding under the convention is not meant,however,to inquire into the merits of any custody dispute underlying the petition for return.gonzalez,at hague convention.
article requires the judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child who has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention if at the date of the commencement of the proceedings a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention.hague convention.a person seeking the return of a child under the convention may do so by filing a petition in a court where the child is located.b.the petitioner has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the child has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention.e a.removal is wrongful when 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and

hague convention.
return is not required,however,if the abductor can establish one of the convention narrow affirmative defenses,gaudin remis,cir,which includes the well settled affirmative defense under article.article provides that return will not be required if the abductor establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the petition for return was filed more than a year from the wrongful removal and the child is well settled in her new environment.hague convention e b.
this filing period is of particular importance under the convention because the well settled affirmative defense is only available if the petition for return was filed more than a year from wrongful removal.the potentially prejudicial effect of failing to file within a year from removal has led courts to apply equitable principles to toll the period,notwithstanding the fact that both the convention and icara are silent as to whether such principles apply.see furnes reeves,cir,cert.denied,d giampaolo erneta,d,belay getachew,d,bocquet ouzid,d,mendez lynch mendez lynch,d,but see anderson acree,d,holding equitable tolling does not apply to petitions filed under the hague convention toren toren,d,vacated on other grounds,cir same.
the eleventh circuit is the only circuit to have decided whether equitable tolling is applicable under the convention.furnes,at.in furnes,the court held that the filing requirement could be tolled under circumstances where the abducting parent took steps to conceal the whereabouts of the child.id.in so holding,the court adopted the district court reasoning in mendez lynch.id.we agree that equitable tolling may apply to icara petitions for the return of a child where the parent removing the child has secreted the child from the parent seeking return.citing mendez lynch,d at.
in mendez lynch,the court reasoned that i f equitable tolling does not apply to icara and the hague convention,a parent who abducts and conceals children for more than one year will be rewarded for the misconduct by creating eligibility for an affirmative defense not otherwise available.id.at.on the other hand,courts rejecting equitable tolling have reasoned that there is nothing in the convention or icara to suggest that the period is a statute of limitations subject to tolling principles.anderson,d at.and furthermore,tolling the period would defeat the purpose of the well settled affirmative defense,to put some limit on the uprooting of a settled child.toren,d at.
we agree with furnes and hold that equitable principles may be applied to toll the period when circumstances suggest that the abducting parent took steps to conceal the whereabouts of the child from the parent seeking return and such concealment delayed the filing of the petition for return.while we recognize the serious concerns with uprooting a child who is well settled regardless of whether the abducting parent hid the child,and that both the convention and icara are silent on whether equitable tolling applies,we must give significant consideration to the overarching intention of the child abduction.see young united states,d it is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this background principle.internal quotations and citations omitted.
logic and equity dictate that awarding an abducting parent an affirmative defense if that parent hides the child from the parent seeking return would not only encourage child abductions,but also encourage hiding the child from the parent seeking return.see belay,d at c ourts must be wary of rewarding an abductor for concealing the whereabouts of a child long enough for the child to become well settled to reward the abductor as such would be to condone the exact behavior the convention seeks to prevent.indeed,this concern was reflected in the state department public notice on the hague convention,which states,if the alleged wrongdoer concealed the child whereabouts from the custodian necessitating a long search for the child and thereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding by the applicant,it is highly questionable whether the respondent should be permitted to benefit from such conduct absent strong countervailing considerations.hague international child abduction convention,dep t of state march.
we therefore hold that equitable tolling is available under the hague convention and icara because applying equitable principles to toll the filing period in circumstances where the abducting parent hides the child is consistent with the purpose of the convention to deter child abduction.
for the reasons stated above,the district court abused its discretion in denying duarte rule e motion.we also hold that equitable tolling is available under the hague convention and icara to toll the filing period.in so holding,we express no opinion on whether the filing period should be tolled in this case.we leave that determination to the district court after conducting further proceedings and finalizing the record on this issue.
as we read the record,it appears that duarte has not seen or visited her children for an extended period of time.should duarte seek temporary visitation rights pending final resolution of this case,we suggest that the district court take such action as may be appropriate.
reversed and remanded.
it always presents a sad case when children are removed from their mother it seems an even worse case when the mother has not had her day in court to testify why the children should be with her.
but here,in a federal court of appeals,it is still a legal case.a case must be decided by the rules of our law we must apply the correct standard of review and we must remember the procedural posture of the case.with respect,the majority fails to do so.
the question in this case is a litigant deprived of due process by not being heard in court when she has already shown through her offer of proof she has no relevant evidence to present rather than look at whether the mother should have been given a hearing,the majority should have focused on whether the mother motion to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e put forth any evidence that,had it been presented at the hearing,likely would have changed the hearing result.had the majority done that,it would have seen that the mother proved herself out of court she offered to prove only such evidence as would have lost for her at the hearing she claims she was unjustly denied.absent suffering any prejudice by the denial of a hearing,the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.in today argot no harm no foul.see.a judgment will not be set aside for harmless error.accordingly,i must respectfully dissent.
i agree with the majority holding regarding equitable tolling of the period in which to commence actions to recover possession of children.where the abductor hides the location of the children,and the parent or guardian does not know where to file a petition under the hague convention,the period should not run.
but those are not the facts of this case.all the evidence offered to the district court by the father bardales showed the mother duarte knew perfectly well where the children were,in the same house duarte and bardales had purchased in san diego and in which they lived with the children until when duarte took the children to mexico.the children were in the same public schools which they had always attended.
article of the hague convention provides 
where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of article and,at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the contracting state where the child is,a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention,the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.
the judicial or administrative authority,even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph,shall also order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in his new environment.
hague convention,emphasis added.the united states adopted the hague convention when it enacted the international child abduction remedies act icara.under icara,commencement of proceedings,as used in article of the hague convention,means the filing of a petition in any court which has jurisdiction of such action and which is authorized to exercise its jurisdiction in the place where the child is located at the time the petition is filed.b and f emphasis added.
duarte filed her petition for the return of her children in the san diego superior court on june,almost two years after bardales took the two youngest children from her on july.the majority discussion of duarte previous efforts to commence an action is to no avail.even duarte does not contend her filing of a hague convention application with the protection of human rights department in tijuana,mexico on september,or the subsequent receipt of her application by the san diego district attorney office,commenced proceedings under article.the only case to address the issue holds that filing an application with an administrative authority,as opposed to filing a petition with a court of competent jurisdiction,does not commence proceedings under icara.wojcik wojcik.
where,as here,an icara petition is not filed in a court of competent jurisdiction within one year of a child wrongful removal,the respondent can raise the affirmative defense that the child is now settled in his new environment and thus any custody proceeding should take place in the venue where the children now live.hague convention.this is known as the exception or defense.the respondent must establish the children are by a preponderance of the evidence.
thus,the merits of this case involve three questions first,did bardales wrongfully remove the children from duarte custody yes this is the prima facie case duarte must prove,and bardales concedes this first point if duarte had filed her petition within one year after july,day bardales took the would end our inquiry the children would be returned to duarte,and the parties would have to litigate the custody dispute in mexico.see hague convention.because duarte did not file her petition until june,however,we proceed to the second question.
did bardales hide the whereabouts of the children such that duarte did not know where to file her petition under the hague convention if so,then equitable tolling applies and duarte wins.if not,bardales is entitled to show the children are in their new environment and we proceed to the third and final question.are the children in san diego 
both parties in this case filed numerous declarations in response to the district court order to show cause,and were given the opportunity to brief the issues of whether bardales hid the children and whether the children are in san diego.the district court,acting as the trier of fact,found bardales did not attempt to hide the children whereabouts from duarte,and the children are in san diego.
the district court declined to give duarte a hearing because duarte declarations affirmatively showed she had no personal knowledge regarding whether the children are in san diego.therefore,duarte presence at a hearing would be immaterial.the record contains ample evidence to support the district court findings,set forth below.
the majority uses an incorrect standard for a rule e motion based on new evidence.
in evaluating the district court rulings,the majority cites the general standard for granting a motion to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e,without delving further into the rule requirements.
duarte rule e motion was based on a claim of newly discovered evidence.while i
