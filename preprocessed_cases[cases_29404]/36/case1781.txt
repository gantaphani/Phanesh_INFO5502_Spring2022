in this case,we must interpret a divorce decree that divided retirement benefits stemming from one spouse employment both during and after the marriage.the trial court held that the decree entitled the spouse to a specific percentage of the total amount of the benefits as of the employee spouse retirement.the court of appeals reversed,concluding that the decree awarded the spouse an interest in only the community portion of the benefits at the date of divorce,to be valued at the date of receipt.in accordance with our decision announced today in shanks treadway,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that the spouse is entitled to a percentage of the total amount of the retirement benefits.
edwin and gloria reiss married in.in,edwin started working for goodyear tire rubber company,and he participated in the company retirement plan until his retirement from goodyear in 
the couple divorced in.the trial court entered a final divorce decree that awarded gloria fifty percent of edwin retirement benefits,and neither party appealed the judgment.the decree provides in pertinent part 
the court finds that the parties own community property which should be divided in an equitable manner.it is therefore ordered that the community property owned by the parties shall be divided as follows 
the court further finds that the parties own as community a pension plan at goodyear tire rubber company,where edwin is employed at its houston,texas,plant,which pension plan the parties have a vested interest in.
it is further ordered,adjudged and decreed that if and when respondent,edwin reiss,retires receives a pension from goodyear tire rubber company,or for any other reason becomes entitled to receive retirement or pension benefits from goodyear tire rubber company,then,and in such event,gloria shall receive fifty percent of such retirement or pension benefit to which edwin reiss is entitled to receive from goodyear tire rubber company.
after edwin retired in,gloria sought to enforce the decree division of pension benefits by moving for a qualified domestic relations order qdro,see,that would entitle her to fifty percent of the total benefits earned under the pension plan,including any sums accrued after the divorce.the trial court granted the motion and entered a qdro awarding gloria half of all pension benefits.edwin appealed,arguing that the court qdro divested him of separate property.
the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment,stating that t he only property the divorce decree purported to divide was community property.at.accordingly,the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court to enter a qdro calculating gloria fifty percent interest in only the community property portion of edwin retirement benefits,that portion corresponding to the time the marriage and his retirement plan participation overlapped,but valuing those benefits as of the date of receipt.id.at.gloria now appeals that judgment,asserting that the divorce decree unambiguously awarded her a fixed percentage of her total retirement and that,because edwin did not appeal the original decree,res judicata bars his collateral attack of the judgment.we agree with the trial court interpretation of the decree and therefore reverse the court of appeals judgment.
for the sake of brevity,we refer to our discussion in shanks of the complexities involved in dividing retirement benefits,the state of the law at the time the decree was entered,and the changes made soon after.see shanks,at.we reiterate that we interpret a divorce decree like any other judgment,reading the decree as a whole and effectuat ing the order in light of the literal language used if that language is unambiguous.wilde murchie.
the portion of the reisses decree that divided the retirement benefits contains language very similar to the decree in shanks,and unlike the dissent,we see no valid reason to interpret the decrees differently as in shanks,the court that entered the reisses decree failed to apportion the community interest by using the formula set out in taggart taggart,the prevailing law regarding division of retirement benefits upon divorce at the time the decree was entered instead,the court awarded gloria half of the total benefits,in effect mistakenly classifying all of the benefits edwin was entitled to receive under the plan as community property and dividing them as such.
the court of appeals focused heavily on the fact that taggart and cearley cearley,were controlling when the trial court entered the decree.at.the court presume d the trial court knew of cearley and taggart and constructed his decree accordingly.id.at.but when the language of the decree is unambiguous,as it is here,we interpret the judgment literally.wilde,at.only when a judgment is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation do we adopt the construction that correctly applies the law.macgregor rich,per curiam.and though the effect of the decree is to divest edwin of his separate property that does not alter the decree plain language.
the dissent interprets the decree in this case differently than we did in shanks because this decree divides the retirement benefits in a section dedicated to apportioning community property and states that the reisses own the pension plan as community property.both the dissent and the court of appeals therefore interpret the decree to divide only the community portion of edwin retirement benefits.at jefferson,dissenting at.that analysis,however,ignores the decree plain language.the decree specifically recites that gloria shall receive fifty percent of such retirement or pension benefit to which edwin is entitled to receive if and when he retires or is otherwise entitled to the benefits.this language unequivocally awards gloria half of edwin total retirement benefits under the plan,regardless of when they accrued.
our interpretation does not,as the dissent contends,ignore relevant language in the decree or give effect to one isolated sentence at jefferson,dissenting.we recognize that the decree prefaced the substantive division by classifying the benefits as community property,but that certainly does not mean that all of the property characterized as community was done so correctly.it is clear that the trial court did not intend in a broad sense to divest edwin of separate property.but as we discussed in shanks,the complicated state of the law in this area and the difficulty inherent in dividing pension plans that involve both separate and community property indicate that interpreting such a division is not as simple as determining whether the trial court intended to divide only community property.shanks,at.and though a trial court incorrect characterization of property upon divorce that affects the just and right division of the community estate is grounds for reversal on appeal,jacobs jacobs,edwin did not appeal the judgment in this case.
again,we see no valid reason to interpret the reisses decree differently than the very similar decree in shanks.at.the district court correctly construed the divorce decree to award gloria fifty percent of edwin total retirement benefits.the qdro therefore serves its intended purpose of implementing the division of benefits set out in the original decree and does not impermissibly amend,modify,alter,or change the division of property made or approved in the decree of divorce.a.because the qdro entered in this case is consistent with the unappealed divorce decree unambiguous property division,the court of appeals erred in reversing the district court judgment.
finally,edwin contends that the divorce decree is a void judgment because the trial court that entered it did not have jurisdiction to divest him of his separate property.therefore,edwin argues,the decree is subject to attack at any time.we disagree.
