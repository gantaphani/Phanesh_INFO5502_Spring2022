bobby waters appeals from a family court order terminating his parental rights in his daughter,ashley ashley.waters claims that the division of family services dfs and the trial court denied him procedural due process by refusing to i allow him visitation rights,ii develop a reunification case plan,and iii attempt reunification as an option,before terminating his parental rights.waters also claims that the decision to terminate his parental rights is not supported by clear and convincing evidence,and was not in ashley best interests.for the reasons next discussed,we reverse.
on december,dfs filed a dependency and neglect petition involving three children of lenny bruce and tara gibson.the family court awarded dfs custody of those children on march.dfs created case plans for the parents,and attempted to reunify the parents with their three children.
on march,the children mother,tara gibson mother,gave birth to a fourth child,ashley.dfs petitioned for,and was awarded custody of,ashley,whose father identity at that time was undetermined.at the termination hearing,mother testified that before ashley was born she mother told waters that he might be the father.but,mother also testified that she told waters that the father was an unknown hispanic man.at the hearing waters testified that on one occasion mother told him that the baby was not his,on a second occasion that the baby might be his,on a third occasion that the baby father was her husband lenny bruce whose name is on the birth certificate,and on a fourth occasion that the infant was a spanish guy baby.waters also testified that lenny bruce told him that the baby was not waters,but was some mexican guy.
mother eventually informed dfs that waters might be the father.dfs then amended its petition for custody to add waters,a possible father,as an additional respondent in the family court proceeding.on april,the family court ordered bruce and waters to undergo genetic testing to determine ashley paternity.
dfs worked with mother to locate waters,but mother had no information as to his whereabouts,other than that waters might be in the seaford area.unable to locate waters through the state criminal information system records,dfs published a notice of the custody petition in a local newspaper in october,but waters did not respond.the reason it later was learned was that waters had been incarcerated at the sussex correctional institute sci from february,to june,and also from september,to april.
on november,dfs filed a petition for termination of parental rights tpr in ashley.waters was served with the petition at sci on december.on january,the family court held a permanency hearing as to all four minor children.at that hearing mother,bruce and three of whom were then present for the first time.waters requested visitation rights with ashley at the hearing,but dfs denied waters request.
at the january,hearing,the family court decided to end reunification efforts with the parents.the court also approved a permanency plan to terminate parental rights in all the children,in order to facilitate their adoption,and again ordered the genetic testing of bruce and waters to determine who was ashley father.
on april,the court held a status hearing on the tpr petition insofar as it related to ashley.at that hearing,the parties learned as a result of the genetic testing that waters was ashley biological father.again,waters requested visitation with ashley,and again dfs denied that request.the court assigned counsel to represent waters in the tpr proceedings.during those proceedings waters informed the court that he would be released from jail at the end of that april.
a trial on the termination petition took place on may to,december and,and february and march.at the may trial dates,waters appeared with counsel and again moved for visitation with ashley.the court denied that motion.waters did not appear on the december trial dates,because as he later explained to the trial judge he needed to get away because his life had been really stressful at that time.waters did appear on the trial dates,during which time he was incarcerated at the violation of probation vop facility.waters testified that to enable himself to care for ashley,he waters traded his five years of probation for days of time at the vop facility,so that he would be released without further probation on april.
on september,the family court terminated the parental rights of mother,based on her consent.the family court also terminated waters parental rights in ashley over waters objection.the court found clear and convincing evidence that i waters had failed to plan,and was unable to plan,for ashley ii ashley had been in the care of dfs for more than six months iii waters was incapable of discharging his parental responsibilities because of his repeated incarceration iv waters had intentionally abandoned ashley and that v terminating waters parental rights was in ashley best interests.waters appeals from the order entered as a result of those rulings.
the family court may terminate parental rights when facts justifying such relief exist,based always on the best interests of the child.dfs must prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights is essential to the child welfare 
dfs is a division of the department of services for children,youth,and their families the department the department,including dfs,is required by statute,to establish,implement,and follow procedures and standards compatible with due process of law with respect to any actions by the department that may affect the legal rights of a child and the child family.the due process that the statute requires the department to observe is also mandated by the united states and delaware constitutions.this court has held that those due process requirements apply in termination of parental rights proceedings 
waters claims that the family court deprived him of procedural due process by terminating his parental rights without requiring that dfs first make reasonable attempts to reunite him with ashley.waters further contends that the termination order was not supported by clear and convincing evidence,and was not in ashley best interests.this court reviews termination of parental rights determinations to ensure that i they are supported by clear and convincing evidence of record,and ii that the trial judge conclusions are the result of an orderly and logical reasoning process where a trial judge decision implicates a ruling of law,our review is de novo to determine whether the trial judge properly applied the law because we conclude that the state deprived waters of due process by terminating his parental rights without first providing a case plan for ashley or attempting reunification with her,we reverse without reaching waters evidentiary claims 
waters first claims that the family court violated procedural due process by terminating his parental rights before dfs had made any efforts to reunify him with,or prepare a case plan for ashley.in response the appellees,dfs and the court appointed special advocate casa,argue that the statutory scheme governing termination requires dfs to attempt reunification only where it is feasible once dfs began pursuing tpr,it was no longer feasible to attempt reunification the family court had previously decided that termination was the appropriate permanency plan for ashley,and that to change course and begin reunification efforts would contravene the adoption and safe families act asfa and family court civil procedure rule fccpr and in any event,no reunification efforts were legally required,because the family court granted the tpr petition on the ground that waters had abandoned ashley.
the family court held that waters had suffered no violation of due process rights because counsel had been appointed to represent him at the tpr proceedings,and because reunification services were not legally required in these circumstances.under,dfs is not required to perform reunification services where the ground for tpr is abandonment.here,the trial court found,waters had abandoned ashley.the trial court further found that reunification services were not practical in this case,because ashley had been in foster care for more than one year,and at the time the parties learned he was the time when reunification efforts would ordinarily have was incarcerated.
those contentions reduce to two issues on appeal was due process violated by terminating waters parental rights without dfs first attempting effectively to reunify waters with ashley,and was the trial court conclusion that waters had abandoned ashley supported by clear and convincing evidence,thereby obviating any reunification requirement under the applicable statute we address those issues separately.
when analyzing what process is due to a parent in a tpr proceeding,this court considers three factors 
the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk that there will be an erroneous deprivation of the interest through the procedures used and the probable value of an additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest involved,including the added fiscal and administrative burdens that addition or substitute procedure would require 
in daber division of child protective services we emphasized the fundamental importance of the first private interest at stake in termination cases 
fewer rights are more sacred than those which derive from the relationship.a society which arrogates to itself the power to intervene and disrupt that relationship can do so only for the most compelling reasons necessary to correct or protect a child from circumstances which directly threaten or affect the minor physical or emotional health.the state and its agencies are not in the business of determining or otherwise interfering with the relationship on any less substantial grounds.
in santosky kramer,the united states supreme court affirmed that same principle,stating that t he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,custody,and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the state.
the third governmental interest also very strong.as we stated in in re hanks,t he state has an important interest in protecting the welfare of its minor children who have been placed in the custody of the state because their natural parents are unable to provide adequate care.ashley has been in dfs custody since the day after she was born in march.she is well adjusted to her foster family where she lives with her.and,she has never met her biological father,waters.
because of the critical importance of the competing private and state interests in this case,the second risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parental interest through the termination procedures used and the additional burden created by utilizing the procedures advocated pivotal.in assessing that risk,our analysis begins with the statute that requires dfs to offer reunification services to parents whenever feasible.in that context,we have held that the family court,in addition to finding a statutory basis for termination and concluding that termination is in the child best interests,must also find that dfs has made reasonable efforts to reunite the family through written case plans or reunification services 
here,it is undisputed that dfs made no effort let alone a reasonable effort to unite waters with his daughter.instead,dfs denied all of his requests for visitation and sought to terminate his parental rights at a time dfs knew that waters might be ashley father.the risk created by that erroneously depriving waters of his parental extremely,indeed impermissibly,high.moreover,no showing was made that developing a case plan for waters and attempting to reunify ashley with waters would have added any significant fiscal or administrative burdens.
the appellees respond that to attempt to reunify ashley with waters was not feasible,because i he was incarcerated at the time paternity was established ii once dfs formally moved for tpr it was no longer legally required to attempt reunification and iii attempting to reunify ashley and waters after the family court had ruled that tpr was the permanent plan,would have contravened asfa and fccpr.none of these contentions has merit.
first,this is not a case where a parent prolonged incarceration prevented dfs from working with that parent to establish a case plan involving reunification although waters was incarcerated at the time of the paternity determination,he was released less than thirty days thereafter.and although waters was incarcerated during the last two days of trial,he was to be placed on work release the following month april with no further probationary obligation.
second,appellees argument that dfs was no longer required to offer reunification once tpr proceedings began,misreads our holding in in re burns in burns we held that there is no fundamental error in permitting the agency to discontinue reunification efforts if the state has acted properly to terminate parental rights.in such circumstances the state assumes an adversarial role vís a vís the parents.to require continued reunification efforts,while contending for termination,is illogical.we reversed the tpr order in burns,however,because the state had not exerted the required efforts to reunify the parent and child.that is,in burns the termination was invalidated because the state had failed to adhere to the minimum standards of due process,in that case,making a reasonable effort to reunify the child with his mother.in that respect,burns is on all fours with this case,because here too the state made no effort to reunify ashley with her father.
the appellees final claim is that reunification was not feasible because it would violate asfa and fccpr.that argument also fails.both asfa and fccpr require the family court to conduct a permanency hearing no later than twelve months after a child has entered foster care that is all the statute and rule relevantly mandated,and that is exactly what occurred.nothing in the statute or the family court rules cast the family court approval of a permanency plan tpr in concrete or rendered that plan final and unalterable indeed,the practice in tpr cases is instructive.quite often,the initial plan is family reunification.where it later becomes evident that the parents are unable to satisfy the requirements of that plan,the state then moves for tpr and the permanency goal changes to putting the child up for adoption.
here,the state sought termination before it knew the father identity.after the father identity became known,the state persisted with its tpr plan,even though there was no clear and convincing evidence that reunification was not feasible and no provision of law precluded changing the initial permanency plan.to be sure,ashley was entitled to a timely permanency decision,but in these circumstances that entitlement could not trump her father due process right to a reasonable opportunity for reunification.because dfs failed to provide waters with any meaningful case plan or reunification services where they were in this case required by state failed to comply with basic due process standards in termination of parental rights proceedings 
a contrary conclusion could be justified only if the trial court correctly found that waters had abandoned ashley we conclude,however,that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that waters intended to abandon his daughter.under.d,where the basis for terminating parental rights is abandonment,dfs is not legally required to offer reunification services to the parent.to establish abandonment,the state must present clear and convincing evidence that for six months before the state filed the petition to terminate,the parent failed to communicate or visit regularly with the child,or failed to manifest an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of that child no clear and convincing evidence establishes either of these two conditions for a finding of abandonment.
given the inconsistent and contradictory statements by mother and her husband to waters regarding the identity of ashley father,the trial court finding that waters aban
