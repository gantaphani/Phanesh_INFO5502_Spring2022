ronald mcclellan ronald appeals the superior court denial of his application for an order directing the county of san diego department of child support services county to omit certain accrued interest from its calculation of his unpaid child support arrearages.ronald disputes the legal effect of a december order that determined child support arrearages as of that date and established periodic payments to liquidate the arrearages.ronald contends that no further interest should have accrued on the arrearages that were the subject of the december order.the superior court denied the relief sought by ronald.we affirm.
statutory framework 
code of civil procedure section contains the basic rule for calculating postjudgment interest 
a except as provided in subdivision b,interest commences to accrue on a money judgment on the date of entry of the judgment.
b unless the judgment otherwise provides,if a money judgment is payable in installments,interest commences to accrue as to each installment on the date the installment becomes due.
further,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a establishes that i nterest accrues at the rate of percent per annum on the principal amount of a money judgment remaining unsatisfied.italics added.
delinquent child support payments accrue postjudgment interest under the rules applicable to installment judgments.statutory interest on unpaid child support payments accrues as a matter of law as to each installment when each installment becomes due accrued arrearages are treated like a money judgment for purposes of assessing statutory interest.unless otherwise specified in the judgment,interest accrues as to each installment when each installment becomes due and continues to accrue for so long as the arrearage remains unpaid.in re marriage of hubner th,d,fn.omitted.because accrued arrearages are treated like money judgments,courts can not retroactively modify or terminate the arrearages.ibid.interest accrues as a matter of law on unpaid child support,and parents are charged with knowledge of the law.in re marriage of thompson th,d.
dupont dupont th,d,held that an arrearages order establishing a periodic payment toward accumulated child support arrearages is a new installment judgment that stops the further accrual of interest on those accumulated arrearages dupont based its holding on the view that a court has equitable jurisdiction to determine the manner in which an order or judgment for child support will be paid and the extent to which a defaulting parent has satisfied or otherwise discharged the support obligation.dupont,at,d.according to dupont,a court could exercise that discretion by issuing a new installment judgment in the form of an arrearages order,with the implicit legal effect of stopping interest from continuing to accrue on support owed for prior periods.ibid.although dupont did not frame the issue as such,its effect was to give courts discretion to override the basic principle in code of civil procedure section that interest continues to accrue on the principal amount of a money judgment remaining unsatisfied,subd.a.
the legislature quickly reacted to dupont holding that courts have the discretion to cut off the further accrual of interest on child support arrearages set forth in an arrearages order.with the express intent to abrogate dupont,the legislature amended family code section,effective january.stats,ch.the amendment to family code section clarifies that the only installment judgment in the support context is the initial support order.ibid.the amendment thus undercuts the foundational assumption of dupont analysis that an arrearages order is a new installment judgment.specifically,the amendment to family code section states 
for the purposes of section of the code of civil procedure,only the initial support order,whether temporary or final,whether or not the order is contained in a judgment,shall be considered an installment judgment.no support order or other order or notice issued,which sets forth the amount of support owed for prior periods of time or establishes a periodic payment to liquidate the support owed for prior periods,shall be considered a money judgment for purposes of subdivision b of section of the code of civil procedure.stats,ch.
the legislative history makes clear that the legislature specifically intended to abrogate dupont to alleviate the confusion and uncertainty that it had caused.
the california court of appeal held in dupont dupont,supra,th,d,that a child support order which calculates the amount of past due support owed under a prior order and sets a monthly amount to reduce past due support constitutes a new installment judgment.
the decision in dupont has resulted in disparate application of the rules regarding accrual of interest from order to order,court to court,and county to county for the purpose of calculating interest under section of the code of civil procedure.
it is therefore the intent of the legislature to abrogate the holding of the california court of appeal in dupont dupont,to reaffirm that the legislative intent is that no support order or notice issued,which sets forth the amount of support owed for prior periods of time or establishes a periodic payment to liquidate the support owed for prior periods,be considered a money judgment for the purposes of subdivision b of section of the code of civil procedure stats,ch,a.
the question before us is whether the amendment to family code section applies to the accrual of interest on child support arrearages that were the subject of arrearages orders entered before the amendment took effect on january.
ii.factual and procedural background 
ronald and debbie mcclellan debbie separated in and divorced in.ronald was ordered to pay support for their two children.ronald failed to make many of the required support payments.in a december,order the december order the superior court determined that ronald owed in child support arrearages to the county as debbie had been receiving public assistance in child support arrearages to debbie plus in interest accrued as of that date.the december order directed ronald to make monthly payments of toward the arrearages,which would increase to monthly payments of six months later.
the december order did not expressly address whether interest would continue to accrue on the arrearages during the hearing,counsel for the county stated,i also asking that the court finds sic that interest continues to accrue on the entire unpaid balance,as provided for by law.the court did not explicitly rule on this request but impliedly assumed the continued accrual of interest on arrearages when it remarked that an initial per month payment toward the arrearages does even begin to pay the interest,and that when the payments rose to per month,ronald would be just about breaking even.
although the december order did not expressly address whether interest continued to accrue on amounts subject to that order,the county sent ronald a notice in november alerting him that in interest had accumulated on his arrearages obligation to the county,including the arrearages set forth in the december order and other support payments that ronald had missed since that time.the county gave him notice that t o avoid additional interest charges,you must pay,within fifteen days from the date of this letter,the amount of,which is the total amount due on your account,including the interest and arrears,and explained that any payments would be applied to any current obligation first,then to interest,then to arrears.
in march ronald filed a pleading with the superior court requesting an order directing the county to perform an audit of his child support obligations.the county performed an audit in july,showing that ronald owed including in interest for the arrearages and for additional missed support payments through may when debbie went off public assistance and that ronald owed debbie,including in interest for support payments missed since june.ronald challenged the county calculation of interest.he argued that the december order had the legal effect of stopping the future accrual of interest on all arrearages,and he requested that the court order a new audit without the inclusion of the disputed interest.
after considering the parties briefing on whether the amendment to family code section could be retroactively applied to the december order,the court rejected ronald challenge.the court concluded that interest continued to accrue on the arrearages because the amendment to family code section controlled the legal effect of the december order.ronald appeals,arguing that there is no legislative statement of intent that family code section be retroactive,and that to apply family code section retroactively violates due process of law.capitalization omitted.
iii.standard of review 
we apply a de novo standard of review to the superior court analysis of the legal effect of the amendment to family code section.see rambla,board of supervisors th,d applying de novo standard of review in analyzing the effect of amended statute hermosa beach stop oil coalition city of hermosa beach th,d retroactivity of new law reviewed de novo.
iv.discussion 
generally,we may retroactively apply a new statute only if it contains express language of retroactivity or if other sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the legislature intended retroactive application.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.even then,the retrospective application of a statute may be unconstitutional if it deprives a person of a vested right without due process of law.in re marriage of buol cal d.
as a threshold issue,however,we must determine whether the amendment to family code section was indeed a new law to which these retroactivity standards apply or,instead,merely a clarification of existing law.if we decide that the amendment to family code section only clarified existing law,then the application of the amendment to ronald case need not be analyzed as a retroactivity issue.see bowen board of retirement cal d,fn,because the court concluded that the statutory amendment clarified rather than changed existing law,there was no need to reach appellant arguments regarding the amendment retroactive application.
a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment because the true meaning of the statute remains the same.mcclung employment development cal th,d,quoting western security bank superior court cal th,d,see also gte sprint communications state bd.of equalization th,d where a statute or amendment clarifies existing law,such action is not considered a change because it merely restates the law as it was at the time,and retroactivity is not involved.thus,a clarification of existing law may be applied to transactions predating its enactment without being considered retroactive.citation.the clarified law is merely a statement of what the law has always been.riley hilton hotels th,d.
to decide whether the amendment to family code section merely clarified existing law,we may give due consideration to the legislature views,but a legislative declaration of an existing statute meaning is neither binding nor conclusive in construing the statute.western security bank superior court,supra,cal th,d,see also mcclung employment development,supra,cal th,d.a declaration that a statutory amendment merely clarified the law can not be given an obviously absurd effect,and the court can not accept the legislative statement that an unmistakable change in the statute is nothing more than a clarification and restatement of its original terms.mcclung,at,d.thus,although we may review the legislative history to enlighten our inquiry,the decision as to whether the amendment to family code section changed or merely clarified existing law must,in the end,turn on our own analysis.
applying this approach,we first review the legislative history to determine whether in amending family code section the legislature believed it was merely clarifying existing law.here,the legislature stated that the amendment was intended to abrogate the holding of dupont,address the disparate application of the rules regarding accrual of interest caused by dupont,and reaffirm the legislative intent that arrearages orders should not be treated as money judgments for the purpose of calculating postjudgment interest.stats,ch,a.further,an assembly committee report explained that application of the dupont decision is far from consistent because dupont based its decision on the equitable power of the court to enforce child support orders,so that whether a support recipient will be ordered to receive all interest owed on a support order will depend on the vagaries of which judge his or her case is before.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.according to the assembly committee report,the amendment returns california support law to the intended rule of law prior to the dupont holding and clarifies that the legislature did not intend to halt the accrual of interest on unpaid child support arrearages where the court issues an order which simply calculates the amount of past due support owed under a prior order and sets a monthly amount to reduce those arrearages.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra.
we conclude that the legislature viewed the amendment to family code section as a mere clarification of the law.the legislature indicates an intent to merely clarify existing law where,as here,it promptly reacts to the emergence of a novel question of statutory interpretation caused,for instance,by the disruptive effect of a court of appeal decision western security bank superior court,supra,cal th,d,or where,as here,it amends a statute to resolve ambiguity in the existing law.see kern county of imperial d.amendment clarified the law when it was clear that the intent of the sponsor of the bill was to clarify existing law and remove any ambiguity to specific fact situations tyler state of california d.statutory amendment merely clarified existing law when it was enacted in response to confusion created by a court decision.
we next turn to our own evaluation of whether the amendment to family code section changed or merely clarified existing law.in undertaking this analysis,we necessarily evaluate whether dupont,which the legislature expressly intended to abrogate by amending family code section,departed from existing law.having examined dupont and the surrounding legal context at the time it was decided,we conclude dupont departed from existing law.the amendment to family code section merely clarified the law as it existed prior to dupont by removing one of the assumptions on which dupont was based,namely,that an arrearages order is a new money judgment payable in installments.
it has long been the law that an enforceable money judgment comes into existence at the time that a child support payment is missed.see in re marriage of hubner,supra,th,d in re marriage of perez th,d jackson jackson d.dupont departed from existing law by determining that a previous judgment is satisfied or otherwise discharged by the creation of a new installment judgment and payment plan.dupont dupont,supra,th,d.we have found nothing in the law at the time dupont was decided that compelled this conclusion.
dupont cited keith suzanne th,d jackson jackson,supra,d.and in re marriage of trainotti d,for the principle that a trial court maintains continuing equitable jurisdiction to determine the manner in which an order or judgment for child support will be paid and to consider the extent to which a defaulting parent has satisfied or otherwise discharged a support obligation.dupont dupont,supra,th,d.however,those cases all limit their discussion to the court equitable power to modify the manner in which support payments are made or deemed satisfied such as reducing the payments or giving credit toward satisfaction of the support obligation when the child goes to live with the paying parent.they do not establish any ability by the court either to deem a judgment satisfied or otherwise discharged when no payment or offset exists,or to stop interest from accruing on delinquent support payments.
with its unprecedented holding that an arrearages orde
