david argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in making an uneven distribution of the parties community property in accordance with their oral agreement.he points out that,according to family code section,the court was statutorily mandated to order an equal division of community assets,e xcept upon the written agreement of the parties,or oral stipulation of the parties in open court.we agree with david that family code section renders the parties oral agreement void and unenforceable consequently,we reverse the judgment.
ii.facts and procedural history 
the parties were married on august.they have three children.david filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on september.the court found that the parties actually separated on december.
the extensive appellate record before us reflects that there exists a myriad of complex issues arising from the marital relationship,including issues related to child custody,child and spousal support,visitation,and the parties community property rights.however,this appeal focuses on a single issue,which was the subject of a bifurcated trial.relevant to this appeal,elizabeth described the issue before the court as follows the bifurcated trial issue addressed herein is whether or not the parties entered into an enforceable oral agreement dividing their major community assets.elizabeth contends that the parties entered into this agreement,fully performed this agreement,and are bound by this agreement.
on november,the trial court began taking evidence on this question.elizabeth testified that she and david had started discussing the property division in late,and they reached an oral agreement dividing their major community assets in march she testified about the significant financial effects of the agreement as evidenced by the documentary evidence.
briefly,the family home in san rafael,california,which was held by david,was transferred solely to elizabeth.
a second piece of real property in novato,california,which was held in both parties names,was transferred to david.a third piece of real estate in homewood,california,and moving images,the community business,were already in david name and were retained by him alone.elizabeth testified that under the oral agreement,each party was to retain his or her retirement plans.david was to keep two vehicles and she was to keep one.
david denied that he had any discussions with elizabeth in march regarding a settlement of their property rights.he attempted to provide a rational explanation,apart from the alleged oral agreement,why he had signed over the family home and the wachovia accounts to elizabeth,why he was given in refinance money,and why he was given sole ownership to the property in novato.
during closing argument,elizabeth attorney stated that the issues were whether the parties entered into a fully executed oral agreement dividing their property and are the property transfers that occurred between and enforceable property transmutations the attorney summarized elizabeth position that all property has been divided,that judgment should be entered on the parties fully performed agreement dividing their property,and that all property transfers were valid transmutations 
david trial counsel questioned whether an oral agreement existed.he said there is no executed marital settlement agreement.there is no agreement of any kind executed by the parties that divide s the community property or recognize s the separate property estates of the respective parties david position,in essence,was that the parties community property and separate property interests in these assets remained unadjudicated and unresolved.
on december,the trial judge filed a judgment and statement of decision.the following findings are particularly relevant to this appeal the court found that the parties fully executed their oral agreement and have disposed of the issues of the valuation and disposition of their real estate,the wachovia accounts,and david business by a fully executed oral agreement the court found it persuasive that in this case,assets were divided and necessary transfers were signed.there is no rational explanation for this other than that the parties were dividing their major community assets.elizabeth testimony on this issue was credible,and in large part supported by documentary evidence.furthermore,the parties were unquestionably separated from each other when the agreement was entered into.
the court then assigned values to and disposed of specific items of community property in accordance with the terms of the parties agreement.the judge found that this resulted in an unequal division of community property because david came out ahead in this agreement.
on december,the trial judge filed an order which denied david request for a certificate of probable cause for immediate appellate review of this issue.on may,the trial court issued its final judgment on numerous issues.on june,david filed a notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
in this case,the trial court resolved many disputed issues with regard to the parties community property by enforcing their fully executed oral agreement which was entered into after the date of separation.david contends that the trial court ruling directly violated family code section.
generally,we review a ruling dividing property under the abuse of discretion standard.in re marriage of quay th,d quay.factual findings are upheld if supported by substantial evidence.ibid.however,to the extent the trial court decision reflects an interpretation of a statute,it presents a question of law that we review de novo.in re marriage of pearlstein th,d in re marriage of rothrock th,d.
accordingly,we undertake our own statutory interpretation of family code section,the statute governing an agreement entered into during a dissolution proceeding to divide the community assets.that section provides as follows except upon the written agreement of the parties,or on oral stipulation of the parties in open court,or as otherwise provided in this division,in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation of the parties,the court shall,either in its judgment of dissolution of the marriage,in its judgment of legal separation of the parties,or at a later time if it expressly reserves jurisdiction to make such a property division,divide the community estate of the parties equally.italics added.
thus,family code section contemplates that the parties in a marital dissolution action can agree on a lopsided division of community property,but only if it is evidenced by a written agreement of the parties or by an oral stipulation of the parties in open court.if such an agreement is entered into,the court must accept the parties written agreement oral stipulation regarding the disposition of their property.in re marriage of cream th,d.the court only role with regard to a proper stipulated disposition of marital property is to accept the stipulation and,if requested,to incorporate the disposition into the judgment.id.at,d.
there is no evidence that the statutory requirements set out by family code section were met here.the record reveals that the parties in this dissolution action never reduced their agreement to writing,nor did they ever recite any stipulation for division of their community property in open court.david argues that the trial court decision to uphold this agreement,which resulted in a disproportionate split of the pa
