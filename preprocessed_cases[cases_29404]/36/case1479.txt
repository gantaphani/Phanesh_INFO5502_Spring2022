this is an appeal and from a final judgment dividing the community property and ordering scott nicholson to make an equalizing payment to his former wife,elizabeth sparks 
in his appeal,nicholson contends that that there is no substantial evidence to support the court finding that the value of the residence it awarded to him,fairlawn,in the city of berkeley hereafter fairlawn,and the one awarded to sparks,gravatt drive hereafter gravatt,in the city of oakland,were equal.
in her,sparks contends that the court erred in finding that nicholson should be credited,pursuant to family code section,subdivision b,in the amount of for separate property he used to pay down their community credit card debt which permitted them to qualify for a loan to purchase the gravatt residence.
we shall hold that the valuation of gravatt and fairlawn is supported by substantial evidence,but that section,subdivision b does not provide for reimbursement of the separate property nicholson used to pay community credit card debt.we therefore shall remand to the trial court for recalculation of the equalizing payment it ordered nicholson to pay.
reimbursement for separate property used to pay down community credit account 
the court also ordered that nicholson shall be entitled to a credit pursuant to family code b for his traceable separate property contributions to the acquisition of the gravatt drive real property.in its statement of decision the court found that,during the marriage,nicholson mother periodically transferred money to him.nicholson claimed these funds were loans which had to be repaid by the community,whereas sparks asserted they were gifts.with respect to most of the transfers of funds,the court found that nicholson failed to offer any credible evidence of the amounts transferred,or any documentation supporting his contention that they were loans.however,i t was not disputed that nicholson mother transferred approximately to nicholson which was used to pay down the credit card obligations to permit them to qualify for a loan to purchase the gravatt residence.nicholson claimed that this was a loan that had to be repaid.there was no writing associated with this loan.although it can not be treated as an enforceable loan,the court finds that it is equitable for scott to be credited this amount as a family code b contribution to the purchase of the gravatt drive residence,and he shall receive a credit in that amount in the property division.
sparks,in her,contends that the court erred in determining that nicholson be reimbursed pursuant section,subdivision b for the use of his separate property to pay community credit card debts,because the payment of credit card debts is not,under any reasonable construction,a contribution to the acquisition of property or payment for improvements within the meaning of this section nicholson,on the other hand,contends his payment of their debt does qualify as a contribution to the acquisition of gravatt because,without the paydown of credit card debt,the parties could not have obtained a loan,and therefore could not have acquired the gravatt property.we shall conclude the payment of community credit card debt is not a contribution to the acquisition of property within the meaning of section,and remand to the trial court to recalculate the amount of the equalizing payment it ordered nicholson to pay without this credit.
subdivision a of section provides that c ontributions to the acquisition of the property include downpayments,payments for improvements,and payments that reduce the principal of a loan used to finance the purchase or improvement of the property,but do not include payments of interest on the loan,or payments made for maintenance,insurance,or taxation of the property.italics added.
this section represents a specific legislative rejection of the general presumption that separate property used for community purposes is a gift,as it was applied in in re marriage of lucas cal d.in lucas,supra,the wife separate trust fund was used to make a down payment,and to pay for improvements to a house the couple purchased together,and took title to,as joint tenants.the court held that a separate property contribution during marriage to the purchase or improvement of a family home was presumptively a gift and,absent an agreement to the contrary,there was no right to reimbursement at the time of divorce.in re marriage of fabian cal d,lucas,supra,at,see see,supra,cal d at,in re marriage of walrath,supra,cal th at,d,in re marriage of koester th,d.in re marriage of cochran th,d.the legislative history of former civil code section now,reveals a legislative judgment that it would be fairer to the contributing party to allow separate property reimbursement upon dissolution.in re marriage of cochran,supra,th,d internal quotation marks omitted,citing in re marriage of walrath,supra,cal th at,d.
however,the rule of see see cal d,has been voided only insofar as the separate property contributions are within the category of contributions to the acquisition of property as defined in family code section.kirkland,cal.fam.law,at,italics added.thus,absent an agreement,the use of separate property to pay community debts is not reimbursable,except where the payment is made post separation.in this case,the parties had not separated when nicholson paid their credit card debt with the funds received from his mother.therefore,absent an agreement that he would be reimbursed,which he did not even attempt to prove,his payment of community credit card debt would not normally be reimbursable.the question,then,is whether the additional fact that the payment of these debts allowed the parties to qualify for a loan to purchase gravatt characterizes this otherwise nonreimbursable payment as a contribution to the acquisition of property within the meaning of section.
nicholson argues,in reliance upon the decision in in re marriage of cochran,supra,th,d,that if section does not expressly exclude payment of credit card debts from the category of reimbursable contributions to the acquisition of property,and payment of the credit card debt was necessary in order to qualify for the loan,which in turn facilitated the purchase of gravatt,then the payment contributed to the acquisition of gravatt,and should be reimbursable.the decision in cochran,supra is much narrower,however,than nicholson suggests.in cochran,supra,the husband sought reimbursement for,among other things,school fees that were a condition of obtaining a building permit to build a family residence.the court found that school fees were not a tax,and therefore were not specifically excluded from reimbursement.it further concluded that,because the payment of the fees was required by the local planning agency as condition of the building permit,the payment was one of the costs of making the improvement,and therefore reimbursable,as a payment for improvements,one of the specifically included items in the category of contributions to acquisition of property.id.at,d.
the obligation to pay the school fees in cochran,supra,was includable in the cost of improving the property because the payment was an express condition of the building permit,and the couple would not have had any obligation to pay the fees if they had not constructed a home.by contrast,here,the obligation to pay the consumer credit card debts preexisted the acquisition of gravatt,and the parties were obligated to pay these debts whether or not they acquired gravatt.it was necessary to pay the credit card debts down prior to purchasing gravatt only because the parties had accumulated too much debt in relation to their income to qualify to take on more debt.although the payment of the credit card debts facilitated qualification for a loan,the payments did not contribute to acquisition of the property.rather,the payment simply reduced preexisting consumer debt unrelated to acquisition of the property.
although the forms of reimbursable contributions listed in subdivision a of section are not exclusive,it does not follow that any type of expenditure which simply facilitates property acquisition is reimbursable under subdivision b of section.a
