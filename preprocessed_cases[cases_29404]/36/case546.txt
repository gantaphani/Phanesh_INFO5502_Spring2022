in this case,a parent who had been awarded sole legal and sole physical custody of a child after a contested custody dispute sought to relocate with her child to nevada.the noncustodial parent opposed the relocation and sought,among other things,to have the matter addressed in an evidentiary hearing,a contested hearing with live testimony.the trial court denied the noncustodial parent applications to restrain the relocation and to modify custody without holding an evidentiary hearing.the court of appeal reversed,holding that in a case,a parent without legal or physical custody is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.
we conclude the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying relief without holding an evidentiary hearing.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
the relevant facts are undisputed.
in,nicole brown and anthony yana obtained a dissolution of their marriage.in,the court awarded brown sole legal custody and sole physical custody of their son,cameron,following a psychological evaluation of the parties and a contested evidentiary hearing on custody.after these events,brown and yana each continued to reside in san luis obispo county.brown remarried and has two children with her second husband.
on june,yana filed an order to show cause to modify legal custody of cameron from sole to joint,to expand his visitation,and to appoint counsel for cameron,who was then years old yana asserted in a supporting declaration that his relationship with brown had improved significantly,that cameron expressed an interest in spending more time with him,and that cameron was doing well in his academic and social relationships.shortly thereafter,brown informed yana she was moving with cameron to las vegas,nevada,at the end of the summer.on june,yana filed an order to show cause to restrain any change of residence for cameron and to request a psychological evaluation and a contested evidentiary hearing on the issue.
also on june,brown filed an order to show cause to adjust yana visitation schedule upon her move to nevada.she stated in a supporting declaration that her husband had taken a job in las vegas and that the family would be residing in green valley,nevada.she also stated cameron was extremely close to his two half siblings,and that they miss one another when apart.brown asserted there was no basis for yana requested relief because,as yana admitted,cameron was doing well in her sole custody.moreover,she contended,she had a legitimate reason for the residential move,and the move would not constitute a change of circumstances.brown objected to a psychological evaluation on the ground that her family had already been through two of them,and claimed yana told her he wanted more time with cameron to stop her from moving.finally,with the planned relocation in mind,brown offered an increase in yana summer visitations with cameron in the event yana did not like her proposal to modify his weekend visitations.
the trial court temporarily restrained brown from moving away with cameron,appointed an attorney for cameron,and set the matters for a hearing.
at the hearing,the trial court expressed its reluctance to grant yana requests for relief although yana acknowledged that brown was not seeking to relocate in bad faith,he argued that cameron removal could be restrained if it would prejudice the rights or the welfare of the child.yana,however,disclaimed any obligation to plead or otherwise show prejudice before the setting of an evidentiary,a contested hearing where he would offer oral testimony on the matter.when the court queried whether yana should tell us a little something before we launch into all of this,yana reiterated the need for an independent evaluation to explore cameron feelings about moving to las vegas.he also repeated his request for an evidentiary hearing,stating he was prepared to offer a lot of evidence about las vegas,nevada,such as the high ratio the fact that the state of nevada has one of the highest dropout rates in junior high and high school of any state in the nation the amount of crime over there the volume of the people moving in and out of the community of las vegas,nevada,and what the transient effect has upon people in that community.
cameron attorney reported at the hearing what cameron had told him during interviews at each parent home.the attorney offered his opinion,based on everything cameron had said and done,that cameron was a conflicted young man,who said different things at different times,based upon who he happened to be with at the time.
at the hearing conclusion,the trial court denied yana requests for relief.in doing so,the court commented that a full contested hearing following psychological examinations had occurred in,resulting in an award of sole legal and physical custody of cameron to brown given that judicial custody order,the court determined that yana was required to assert some detriment to warrant an evidentiary hearing.the court expressed its awareness that children are disoriented when they move and it not comfortable for them,but concluded that that level of discomfort for the child is not what detriment or substantial changed circumstances is about sufficient to change custody from mom here to dad.in light of the move,however,the court found yana entitled to a hearing on visitation and later established a modified visitation schedule.
yana appealed.the court of appeal reversed in a split decision,holding that,in a case,a parent with no legal or physical custody rights is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.
we granted brown petition for review.
discussion 
the question presented is this in a case where sole legal and sole physical custody of a child has been awarded to one parent after a contested custody dispute,and the custodial parent subsequent decision to relocate with the child is opposed by the noncustodial parent,is the noncustodial parent entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the matter 
brown contends the court of appeal affirmative answer to this question is wrong.starting from the premise that a parent who has been awarded sole legal and sole physical custody has the exclusive statutory right and responsibility to make all decisions regarding the minor child residence and schooling,brown first argues the noncustodial parent may not obtain a change in custody,or any evidentiary hearing on the matter,based on the custodial parent decision to relocate.even assuming otherwise,she asserts,the trial court retains discretion to deny a custody modification request without a full evidentiary hearing where,as here,no prima facie showing of detriment to the child has been made.
we begin by addressing brown first contention,as it potentially is dispositive.
may a parent without legal and physical custody seek and obtain a custody change based on the custodial parent decision to relocate with their child 
california statutory scheme governing child custody and visitation determinations is set forth in the family code all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.under this scheme,the overarching concern is the best interest of the child.montenegro diaz cal th,d,montenegro.
for purposes of an initial custody determination,section,subdivision b,affords the trial court and the family the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.in re marriage of burgess cal th,d,burgess.when the parents are unable to agree on a custody arrangement,the court must determine the best interest of the child by setting the matter for an adversarial hearing and considering all relevant factors,including the child health,safety,and welfare,any history of abuse by one parent against any child or the other parent,and the nature and amount of the child contact with the parents,subd.a see montenegro,supra,cal th at,d.
once the trial court has entered a final or permanent custody order reflecting that a particular custodial arrangement is in the best interest of the child,the paramount need for continuity and stability in custody the harm that may result from disruption of established patterns of care and emotional bonds with the primary heavily in favor of maintaining that custody arrangement.burgess,supra,cal th at,d.in recognition of this policy concern,we have articulated a variation on the best interest standard,known as the changed circumstance rule,that the trial court must apply when a parent seeks modification of a final judicial custody determination.montenegro,supra,cal th at,d,relying on burchard garay cal d.under the changed circumstance rule,custody modification is appropriate only if the parent seeking modification demonstrates a significant change of circumstances indicating that a different custody arrangement would be in the child best interest.ibid.not only does this serve to protect the weighty interest in stable custody arrangements,but it also fosters judicial economy.ibid.
the family code contemplates that,in making a custody determination,consideration of the best interest of the child may lead the trial court to award custody either to both parents joint or shared custody or to only one parent sole custody.if a parent is awarded sole legal custody,that means the parent shall have the right and the responsibility to make the decisions relating to the health,education,and welfare of a child.if a parent is awarded sole physical custody,that means the child shall reside with and be under the supervision of the custodial parent,subject to the power of the court to order visitation for the noncustodial parent.
brown argues,in effect,that sections and permit a parent with sole legal and sole physical custody to unilaterally supervise and make all decisions regarding a minor child residence and schooling,thereby conferring a right to relocate with the child without interference from the noncustodial parent.in her view,the court of appeal conclusion that a parent with no legal or physical custody is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to relitigate custody over a proposed move away can not be squared with these statutory provisions.we are not persuaded.
brown concedes,as she must,that another provision of the family code,section,expressly addresses the right of a custodial parent to relocate with a child.by its terms,section unambiguously provides the right is not absolute and may be curtailed if the move would result in detriment to the child a parent entitled to the custody of a child has a right to change the residence of the child,subject to the power of the court to restrain a removal that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child,subd.a,italics added.notably,the statute contains no qualifying language purporting to limit its application to parents with only certain custodial rights.thus,while sections and recognize the general right of a parent with sole custody to supervise and make decisions regarding a child residence and education,section,fairly read,contemplates that even a parent with sole legal and sole physical custody may be restrained from changing a child residence,if a court determines the change would be detrimental to the child rights or welfare.
not only does section undermine any notion of a custodial parent absolute right to relocate with a child,but so does the lack of any california decision supporting such a proposition.the seminal decision of burgess,supra,cal th,d,referred to the right of a custodial parent to change the residence of a child as a presumptive right that might not prevail if the move would result in detriment to the child burgess,at,d.decisions subsequent to burgess uniformly acknowledge that,even where a permanent custody order is in place,the custodial parent right to relocate with a child remains subject to the changed circumstance rule,in re marriage of lamusga cal th,d,lamusga osgood landon th,d in re marriage of campos th,d campos in re marriage of edlund th,d in re marriage of whealon th,d.
brown attempts to distinguish burgess and its progeny on the ground they did not involve a parent with sole legal and sole physical custody.we are not convinced.like the situation here,some of the cases were decided in the context of a relocation sought by a parent with sole physical custody,burgess,supra,cal th at,d,stipulated order provided for temporary joint legal custody and sole physical custody to mother osgood landon,supra,th at,d stipulated order provided for joint legal custody,but default judgment awarded sole physical custody to mother campos,supra,th at,d judicial custody order provided for joint legal custody and sole physical custody to mother.those decisions hold or otherwise acknowledge that an order for sole physical custody may be modified,despite the general importance of maintaining ongoing physical custody arrangements,if relocation with the custodial parent will cause the child to suffer detriment,thus rendering it essential or expedient for the child welfare that there be a custody change burgess,supra,cal th at,d,see also lamusga,supra,cal th at,d.none of the decisions,moreover,attributes any significance to the presence of a joint legal custody arrangement or the absence of one for sole legal custody.
brown additionally contends that a parent with no custodial rights has no standing to challenge the custodial parent decision to relocate.that contention lacks merit.as indicated,section,subdivision a,provides that a custodial parent right to change the residence of the child is subject to the power of the court to restrain a removal that would prejudice the rights or welfare of the child.it is reasonable to infer from this language,as burgess and its progeny have,that the noncustodial parent may request a court to exercise this power.conversely,section language is not reasonably susceptible of a construction that bars a noncustodial parent from doing so.
moreover,we recently recognized in a similar context that an award of sole legal and sole physical custody of a child to one parent does not serve to terminate the other parental rights or due process interest in parenting.in re marriage of harris cal th,d,harris.in harris,we addressed section provisions for grandparent visitation over the objection of the parent with sole custody.as part of our analysis,we rejected the attempt of a mother who had been awarded sole legal and sole physical custody to liken the noncustodial father to a deceased parent and to equate herself to a sole surviving parent whose right to the custody and control over her child would be infringed by grandparent visitation under section.harris,at,d.consistent with harris,we find the award of sole custody to brown did not terminate any right of yana to seek relief under section.indeed,harris stands as an example that a parent can not rely on an award of sole custody to shield herself from a court order to which she objects,where such order is supported by the noncustodial parent and is in the best interest of the child 
in sum,we conclude that,where a final custody order had awarded sole legal and sole physical custody to the parent seeking to relocate with a child,the noncustodial parent opposing the relocation may seek and obtain a custody modification based on a proper showing pursuant to the changed circumstance rule.
b.what right,if any,does a noncustodial parent have to an evidentiary hearing to relitigate custody over a proposed move away 
having concluded that a parent without legal and physical custody may seek a change in custody based on the custodial parent decision to relocate with their child,we now determine whether and to what extent a trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter.although we generally described the standard for custody modification in a case in part a,ante,we elaborate on that standard as part of our analysis here.
a custodial parent seeking to relocate after dissolution of marriage need not establish the move is necessary in order to be awarded physical custody of a minor child,or to retain physical custody under an existing custody order.burgess,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,while a decision to change a child residence ordinarily does not reflect upon the parent suitability to retain custody,a n obvious exception is a custodial parent decision to relocate simply to frustrate the noncustodial parent contact with the minor child.id.at,fn,d.in this regard,e ven if the custodial parent is otherwise fit,such bad faith conduct may be relevant to a determination of what permanent custody arrangement is in the minor child best interest.ibid.
when a final judicial custody determination is in place see also ante,fn,and a noncustodial parent seeks to modify custody in response to a proposed relocation,the trial court must apply the changed circumstance rule.although the noncustodial parent is not required to show a custody modification is essential to prevent detriment to the child from the planned move,he or she bears the initial burden of showing that the proposed relocation of the child residence will cause detriment to the child,requiring a reevaluation of the existing custody order.lamusga,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d,ragghanti reyes th,d t he changed circumstances test requires a threshold showing of detriment before a court may modify an existing final custody order that was previously based upon the child best interest.imposing this burden on the noncustodial parent is consistent with the recognition that the paramount need for continuity and stability in custody the harm that may result from disruption of established patterns of care and emotional bonds with the primary heavily in favor of maintaining ongoing custody arrangements.lamusga,at,d,quoting burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
the changed circumstance rule requires a substantial showing to modify a final judicial custody determination.in a case,a change of custody is not justified simply because the custodial parent has chosen,for any sound good faith reason,to reside in a different location,but only if,as a result of relocation with that parent,the child will suffer detriment rendering it essential or expedient for the welfare of the child that there be a change.burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
in applying this rule,we affirmed a custody modification order where evidence established that the custodial parent tended to alienate the children from the noncustodial parent,the children relocation some miles away would not promote frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent,and the primary loss to the children pertained to the growing and improving relationship with the noncustodial parent.lamusga,supra,cal th at,d.in another case,a custody modification order was affirmed where evidence showed the child would not have adequate medical care in the new location and would not transition well to a new school or new surroundings.in re marriage of melville th,d involving a child with down syndrome and a heart condition.ultimately,t he extent to which a proposed move will detrimentally impact a child varies greatly depending upon the circumstances.lamusga,at,d.
if the noncustodial parent makes the required initial showing of detriment,the court is then obligated to perform the delicate and difficult task of determining whether a change in custody is in the best interests of the child.lamusga,supra,cal th at,d.among the factors the court ordinarily should consider when deciding whether to modify custody in light of a proposed move are the following the child interest in stability and continuity in the custodial arrangement the distance of the move the child age the child relationship with both parents the relationship between the parents,including,but not limited to,their ability to communicate and cooperate effectively and their willingness to put the child interests above their individual interests the child wishes if the child is mature enough for such an inquiry to be appropriate the reasons for the proposed move and the extent to which the parents currently share custody.lamusga,at,d.
the trial court enjoys wide discretion to order a custody change based upon a showing of detriment,including detriment caused to the relationship between the noncustodial parent and the child,if such a change is in the best interests of the child in light of all the relevant factors.lamusga,supra,cal th at,d.that is,a reviewing court generally will leave it to the trial court to assess the detrimental impact of a proposed move in light of other relevant factors in determining what is in the best interest of the child.id.at,d,
section,we observe,does not speak to the matter of evidentiary hearings in the event a noncustodial parent seeks to restrain a removal allegedly prejudicing the rights or welfare of the child.however,two other and section apply when a parent seeks to modify custody on any basis,including,accordingly,a proposed relocation.
section provides in relevant part a if it appears on the face of a petition,application,or other pleading to obtain or modify a temporary or permanent custody or visitation order that custody,visitation,or both are contested,the court shall set the contested issues for mediation.in turn,section provides a if issues that may be resolved by agreement pursuant to section are not resolved by an agreement of all the parties who participate in mediation,the mediator shall inform the court in writing and the court shall set the matter for hearing on the unresolved matters.italics added.
in re marriage of dunn th,d,considered the type of hearing required when a parent seeks modification of a postdissolution child custody order.there,the trial court had modified a preexisting custody order so as to effectively prohibit the father new wife from participating in certain school,church,and scouting activities during the times when the mother had custody of the children.the matter was handled in two unreported informal chambers proceedings with only counsel present.in reversing the modification order,dunn relied on sections and for the proposition that,where mediation fails to resolve a custody dispute,t he context of postjudgment modification orders appears to contemplate an oral hearing,where the party opposing a requested modification is apprised of the date,time and place of the hearing,sufficiently in advance to appear or otherwise protect his or her interests.dunn,at,d.after noting the need for a party to introduce admissible evidence of changed circumstances at a formal hearing,dunn indicated that an evidentiary hearing of contested factual issues should be conducted if necessary.ibid.in reaching its conclusions,dunn emphasized that i n spite of the need for efficiency,courts should not lose sight of the need that parties be given their day in court.ibid.dunn additionally observed that u nreported informal chambers proceedings hamper the opportunity for meaningful appellate review.ibid.
consistent with dunn,we hold an evidentiary hearing in a situation should be held only if necessary.where,as here,one parent has been awarded sole legal and sole physical custody of a child,and the noncustodial parent opposes the custodial parent decision to relocate with the child,a trial court may deny the noncustodial parent requests to modify custody based on the relocation without holding an evidentiary hearing to take oral evidence if the noncustodial parent allegation or showing of detriment to the child is insubstantial in light of all the circumstances presented in the case,or is otherwise legally insufficient to warrant relief.
needless to say,an evidentiary hearing serves no legitimate purpose or function where the noncustodial parent is unable to make a prima facie showing of detriment in the first instance,or has failed to identify a material but contested factual issue that should be resolved through the taking of oral testimony.as in other family law contexts,application of this procedure in cases fosters the goal of judicial economy and reduces litigation costs and unnecessary distress for the parents and children involved.it also serves to protect the policy considerations underlying the changed circumstance rule,particularly in the context of a case in which the trial court has already determined that the moving parent shall have the right and the responsibility to make the decisions relating to the health,education,and welfare of a child.
as sections and contemplate,the trial court here referred the underlying dispute to mediation and set the matter for a formal court he
