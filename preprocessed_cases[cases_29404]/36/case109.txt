the government appeals from the dismissal of a information in the southern district of new york jones.the information charged clifford kerley with violating the deadbeat parents punishment act the dppa,which criminalizes the failure to pay child support in certain instances.the district court dismissed the information,holding that the support order kerley failed to comply with was entered by a new york family court hearing examiner who lacked subject matter jurisdiction.united states kerley,cr.bsj,wl july.we now hold that defendants charged with violating the dppa can not collaterally challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of the state court that entered the underlying support order.thus,we vacate and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
in,clifford kerley had a brief relationship with judith lopez,the apparent result of which was the birth of twin girls in new york about a year later.kerley and lopez ended their relationship before the twins birth.
in,the commissioner of social services for the city of new york commenced a proceeding against kerley in new york state family court.the commissioner sought support payments for the twins on behalf of their mother,who had become a welfare recipient.after kerley initial appearance before a hearing examiner,at which kerley denied paternity,the hearing examiner ordered blood tests for kerley,lopez,and the children in order to determine paternity.
in may,lopez and the children appeared for their blood tests kerley did not.he also failed to appear for the next scheduled court date in july.despite kerley absence,a family court judge heard testimony and entered orders of filiation with respect to each child.
the family court judge remanded the case to the hearing examiner for entry of an appropriate final support order.this he did without the formality of first entering a temporary support order.the very same day that the orders of filiation were entered,the hearing examiner held an inquest and entered a final support order.the support order,which remains in effect,requires kerley,inter alia,to pay a total of per month in child support.
according to kerley,he attempted to attend the july hearing but,due to complications with his wife pregnancy,he arrived after the orders of filiation and support had been entered,and the court refused to recall his case.
kerley has consistently failed to meet his child support obligations.shortly after the support order was entered,he moved to indiana with his wife and their children.while his wages in indiana were occasionally garnished,such garnishment only amounted to about.
in,kerley filed a motion in family court seeking to vacate the support order,offering illness as his explanation for missing the july court appearance,an excuse different from the one he now tenders.a family court judge denied his motion.
by,kerley owed more than in child support.in july of that year,he was arrested for willfully failing to pay child support in violation of the dppa.he waived indictment and was charged in a information in the southern district of new york.
in,kerley moved to dismiss the information on several grounds,including his claim that the hearing examiner lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the support order.in,the district court agreed that the support order was invalid and therefore granted kerley motion to dismiss the information.united states kerley,cr.bsj,wl july.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the government challenges the district court dismissal of the information on two independent grounds.first,the government argues that the dppa does not permit collateral challenges to support orders on any ground,including subject matter jurisdiction.second,the government argues that even if kerley could mount a collateral challenge,the hearing examiner had subject matter jurisdiction to enter the support order.
because the district court dismissal of the information involves questions of law,we review the dismissal de novo.united states leyland,cir.
collateral challenges to support orders in dppa prosecutions 
every circuit that has addressed the issue has stated that defendants in dppa prosecutions can not collaterally challenge the substantive merits of the underlying support order see united states bigford,cir united states molak,cir united states faasse,cir united states kramer,cir united states brand,cir united states bailey,cir united states johnson,cir.similarly,we have earlier noted that the dppa accepts the validity of the state court judgment and the family policies that judgment embodies.united states sage,cir.
while the case law is clear with respect to collateral challenges in dppa prosecutions,kerley challenges the underlying support order on the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.the parties have not cited nor have we found any reported cases addressing kerley challenge.the seventh and tenth circuits,however,have held that defendants charged with violating the dppa can collaterally challenge the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued the underlying support order.see united states bigford,cir united states kramer,cir.
here,the district court recognized that collateral challenges to support orders are generally not permitted in dppa prosecutions.it held,however,that the language of the dppa allows for collateral challenges to support orders based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.it buttressed this holding by looking to the traditional rule that judgments entered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction are subject to collateral attack.we do not agree.
a.the plain language of the dppa 
under the dppa,any person who willfully fails to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than years,or is greater than,commits a felony.a.the statute defines support obligation as any amount determined under a court order or an order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a state or of an indian tribe to be due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living.id.f.
in wrestling with the statute,the district court focused on the definition of support obligation,particularly the phrase pursuant to the law of a state.the district court found that this phrase requires that the underlying order must be lawful in order to form the basis of a dppa prosecution otherwise,the statutory language would be superfluous.the court concluded that while a defendant can not collaterally challenge a support order as a general matter,a collateral attack ought to be permitted where the court rendering the underlying support order did not have jurisdiction.
in holding that the dppa allows collateral challenges to support orders based on personal jurisdiction,the tenth circuit in bigford interpreted the phrase pursuant to the law of a state in the same fashion as the district court has done here.bigford,at.to give operative effect to the language and at the same time foreclosing collateral challenges based on substantive issues of family law,the bigford court interpreted the dppa as permitting collateral challenges based on jurisdictional issues.id.at.
while we do not decide here whether lack of personal jurisdiction is ever cognizable as a basis for attacking a support order underlying a dppa prosecution as a constitutional matter,we do not agree with the district court and the tenth circuit holding that the language of the statute itself permits jurisdictional challenges.both courts recognized that the substantive merits of a support order can not be or litigated for the first time in a dppa prosecution,and thus limited collateral challenges to jurisdictional issues.yet,if the statutory language the district court and bigford relied upon pursuant to the law of a state allows collateral challenges based on jurisdiction,we fail to see how that same language does not also allow collateral challenges based on substantive grounds.to interpret the dppa as the district court and the tenth circuit did would require us to read into the statute a is not otherwise there.
instead,we interpret the statute in a manner that gives operative effect to the statute language while at the same time is consonant with both the case law and general rules of statutory construction.under the last antecedent rule,a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.barnhart thomas,d.following this rule,we read pursuant to the law of a state to modify only administrative process,the phrase it immediately follows in the statute.as so interpreted,the dppa distinguishes between administrative processes established by state law such as the use of hearing examiners and informal administrative processes such as mediation or voluntary arbitration accordingly,if kerley child support obligations had arisen solely from a private mediation,perhaps he could mount a challenge under the definition of support obligation.but the administrative process that created his support obligation was conducted pursuant to the law of a state.
our interpretation of the dppa accords with other federal statutes regarding child support.the dppa is part of a larger federal scheme of support obligation enforcement.the full faith and credit for child support orders act requires states to enforce a child support order made consistently with this section by a court of another state.a.an order is made consistently with this section if the issuing court had both personal and subject matter jurisdiction.id.c.additionally,in order to receive certain federal funds related to child support enforcement,states must adopt the uniform interstate family support act,f,which requires a state to enforce another state child support order if the issuing tribunal had jurisdiction,see,fam.act c.
these closely related statutes make clear that when congress intended to allow collateral challenges to support orders based on jurisdictional issues,it knew how to do so.united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting russello united states,d.
the seventh circuit considered these related federal statutes and found that it makes no sense that congress would allow a defendant in a civil enforcement action to challenge the personal jurisdiction of the court that entered the enforcement order but not allow a criminal defendant to do the same.kramer,at.we think,however,that congress could have decided rationally that there should be a broad criminal net to ensnare deadbeat parents such as kerley.indeed,allowing collateral jurisdictional challenges in civil cases but not in criminal cases is certainly not unprecedented.see infra 
a dppa case turns only on the defendant violation of a state court order,and not on whether that order is valid under state law.bailey,at.thus,we conclude that the plain language of dppa forecloses kerley attempt to challenge collaterally the subject matter jurisdiction of the hearing examiner 
b.the traditional rule 
in interpreting the statute,the district court viewed the dppa through the prism of the traditional rule that american courts have traditionally invalidated or denied recognition to judgments entered without subject matter jurisdiction.if confined to civil cases,we certainly agree with the district court formulation of the traditional rule.see united states forma,cir noting that default judgments are generally vulnerable to collateral attack on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
in criminal cases,however,the rule often differs.for example,a defendant charged with criminal contempt can not challenge the subject matter jurisdiction of the court that entered the violated order.united states united mine workers of.see also united states terry,cir stating that a defendant charged with criminal contempt generally is barred from collaterally attacking the constitutionality of the court order he is charged with violating.likewise,a defendant charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm may not challenge collaterally a previous conviction on any grounds.lewis united states,d.and criminal defendants can not raise collateral challenges,even those based on constitutional issues save one,to previous convictions used in sentencing enhancements.custis united states,d holding that defendants can not attack collaterally a previous conviction used to enhance a sentence under the armed career criminal act with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel emphasis added.
background principles of law in effect at the time congress passes a statute can be useful in statutory interpretation.see united states texas,d.in this case,however,they are,at most,ambiguous with respect to whether collateral attacks based on subject matter jurisdiction should be permitted in dppa prosecutions.in any event,because the language of the dppa is unambiguous,we can end our analysis there.see good samaritan hosp.shalala,d the starting point in interpreting a statute is its language,for if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
due process 
kerley also argues that he has a due process right to mount a collateral challenge to the support order based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court did not consider this argument,which we now reject.
kerley argument relies on the supreme court decision in united states,d.in that case,an alien charged with illegally reentering the united states after a deportation attempted to challenge the validity of the underlying deportation order.the court held that where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,due process requires that there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.id.at.thus,where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding,an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.id.at.
kerley reliance on is misplaced.in that case,the supreme court expressly concerned itself with the unavailability of effective judicial review of the deportation order at issue.id.at.here,it is undisputed that kerley knew about the support order the day it was entered,and he does not argue that he was foreclosed from appealing the order.indeed,kerley could have appealed the order based on the very same jurisdictional issues he raises now.see fam.act e permitting appeals of determinations made by hearing examiners.put simply,kerley had available all the process due under.thus,there is no constitutional bar to denying him an opportunity to challenge collaterally the subject matter jurisdiction of the hearing examiner for the first time well over ten years later.see brand,at holding that disallowing collateral challenges in dppa prosecutions does not implicate due process concerns.
even if were to apply in this case,it would not help kerley.in united states johnson,a defendant charged with failing to pay a support obligation attempted to rely on to collaterally challenge a support order.at.the fourth circuit stated that without deciding that it applied only provides a narrow means for challenging,on due process grounds,the constitutional validity of the predicate order in issue.id.emphasis added.in this case,kerley is not challenging the support order on constitutional grounds.while personal jurisdiction is of course a required component of due process,ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d,the subject matter jurisdiction of the hearing examiner is wholly an issue of state statutory law.the state subject matter jurisdiction rules raises no constitutional issues,due process or otherwise.see united states ex rel.roche scully,cir holding that a violation of new york allocation of subject matter jurisdiction does not create a federal constitutional issue united states ex rel.herringt
