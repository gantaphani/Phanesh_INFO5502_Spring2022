facts and procedural background 
jessica mother has two children,born and born.father is alejandro alejandro and father is guillermo guillermo.due to guillermo violent behavior towards her,mother emigrated from mexico in with both children.
in may,the los angeles county department of children and family services department received a report that mother was yelling at and beating the children.when talking to department investigators,mother admitted that she would discipline her children by making them do chores,by scolding them verbally,by denying them privileges such as watching television,and by threatening to spank them.on the rare occasions when these techniques did not work,she would spank the children on the buttocks with her bare hand or with a sandal.the children confirmed that mother would occasionally spank them.the spankings were not hard enough to leave marks or bruises the department investigators observed no marks,bruises,welts or scars,and no one the investigator spoke with from the boys primary doctor,to their maternal grandmother,babysitter,and school teacher had ever observed any marks or bruises.consistent with these reports,reported that a spanking did not hurt too much.
in june,as the department was still conducting its investigation,guillermo offered to babysit the children and mother gave him her address.one evening,guillermo arrived early so mother could go to her second job and saw a male visitor in the house.guillermo returned later that evening,enraged,and assaulted and raped mother while the children were present in the home.
the department thereafter filed a petition asking the juvenile court to assert dependency jurisdiction over and pursuant to section,subdivisions a,b,and j,on two grounds guillermo physically and sexually assaulted mother in the presence of the children and mother failed to protect the children from seeing the violence guillermo perpetrated upon her and mother had intentionally inflicted serious physical harm on by spanking him and thereby put at substantial risk of similar abuse.
at the jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court dismissed the allegation that mother failed to protect the children from witnessing her own victimization,but otherwise concluded that jurisdiction was appropriate.the court sustained the allegation involving guillermo assault and rape of mother.the court also sustained the allegation based on mother discipline,finding that mother had spanked the children on repeat occasions and reasoning that hitting children with shoes is not a proper form of discipline,and it physical abuse.as pertinent to this appeal,the court dispositional order required mother to attend a support group for victims of domestic violence,to attend parenting classes,and to attend individual counseling.
mother timely appeals.guillermo did not appeal,and alejandro has not been involved in these proceedings.
discussion 
mother argues that the juvenile court finding against her is not supported by substantial evidence.
the department first asserts that we need not reach the merits of mother challenge.dependency jurisdiction attaches to a child,not to his or her parent.in re alysha th.because jurisdiction over and is justified based solely on the unchallenged finding against guillermo,the department argues that the juvenile court jurisdictional findings regarding mother do not affect the court jurisdiction and should not be reviewed on appeal.in re th,as long as there is one unassailable jurisdictional finding,it is immaterial that another might be inappropriate,quoting in re ashley th.
notwithstanding this general principle,we have discretion to reach the merits of a challenge to any jurisdictional finding when that finding may be prejudicial to the appellant,supra,th at,such as when that finding serves as the basis for dispositional orders that are also challenged on appeal or when that finding could potentially impact current or future dependency proceedings in re drake th.in this case,the juvenile court finding that mother intentionally inflicted serious physical harm upon is prejudicial to mother for two reasons.first,a finding that a parent intentionally hurt her son has the potential to impact future dependency proceedings,at.second,the finding against mother in this case is the basis for two of the three requirements the court imposed upon her as part of its dispositional order.although a dispositional order may reach both parents,including a nonoffending parent,the order must nevertheless be reasonable and designed to eliminate the conditions that led to the court still valid jurisdictional finding,subd.d in re nolan cal th.as applied here,the court order requiring mother to participate in support counseling for victims of domestic violence is tied to the jurisdictional finding regarding guillermo infliction of that violence.however,the court order requiring mother to attend parental education and individual counseling are unrelated to her status as the victim of guillermo domestic violence and accordingly hinge on the validity of the jurisdictional finding against her.
we will therefore exercise our discretion to reach the merits of mother challenge.
ii.assertion of dependency jurisdiction 
the juvenile court jurisdictional finding against mother rests upon three statutory grounds that t he child as alleged,has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the child by the child parent or guardian,under section,subdivision a that t he child as alleged,has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the child,under section,subdivision b and that t he child sibling as alleged,has been abused or neglected,as defined in subdivisions a or b and there is a substantial risk that the child as alleged,older brother,will be abused or neglected,as defined in those subdivisions,under section,subdivision j,subds.a,b j,italics added.as the italicized language indicates,jurisdiction under these provisions can not be sustained without a showing that a child either suffered serious physical harm or was at serious risk of so suffering.
the question presented in this case is whether a parent spanking of her children on the buttocks with her bare hand and with a sandal categorically constitutes serious physical harm sufficient to invoke dependency jurisdiction under section,subdivisions a,b and j,irrespective of whether the spankings qualify as reasonable parental discipline.as explained below,we conclude that the answer to this question is no.
in reaching this conclusion,we independently interpret section lee california capital ins.th,but review the juvenile court factual findings for substantial evidence in re john th.in conducting substantial evidence review,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the juvenile court findings,and draw all inferences and resolve all evidentiary doubts in favor of those findings.ibid.
as a legal matter,the text of section,subdivision a,specifically and expressly provides that serious physical harm does not include reasonable and spanking to the buttocks where there is no evidence of serious physical injury,subd.a.although this proviso limits itself to the purposes of subdivision a,the exception to dependency jurisdiction for reasonable discipline applies across the board to all of section jurisdictional grounds for two reasons.first,the legislature chose to use the term serious physical harm throughout section.when a word or phrase is repeated in a statute,it is normally presumed to have the same meaning throughout.people briceno cal th.second,the legislature provided,in the paragraph of section following the enumeration of the last statutory basis for dependency jurisdiction,that i t is the intent of the legislature that nothing in this section prohibit the use of reasonable methods of parental discipline,or prescribe a particular method of parenting,italics added.
what is more,these legislative declarations in section are consistent with the longstanding principle of california law that a parent has a right to reasonably discipline his or her child and may administer reasonable punishment citation.gonzalez santa clara county of social services th,gonzalez collecting cases whitehurst,supra,th.a parent acting within the boundaries of this right can not be found liable for a tort gonzalez,at guilty of a crime whitehurst,at battery,inflicting corporal punishment on a child under penal code section,subdivision a or subject to registration as a child abuser gonzalez,at.
whether a parent use of discipline on a particular occasion falls within or instead exceeds the scope of this parental right to discipline turns on three considerations whether the parent conduct is genuinely disciplinary whether the punishment is necess ary that is,whether the discipline was warranted by the circumstances and whether the amount of punishment was reasonable or excessive.whitehurst,supra,th at people clark th,accord,gonzalez,supra,th at a successful assertion of the parental disciplinary privilege requires three elements a genuine disciplinary motive a reasonable occasion for discipline and a disciplinary measure reasonable in kind and degree emery emery cal d,parent wide discretion in the performance of parental functions does not reach beyond the limits of reasonable parental discipline.
where parental discipline exceeds these limits,juvenile courts have not hesitated to uphold the assertion of dependency jurisdiction.thus,dependency jurisdiction has been sustained when a parent hit her on the stomach with a belt,causing deep,purple bruises after he refused to write a letter of the alphabet and sprayed perfume in his eyes in re mariah th,when a parent hit her son with a belt and an electric cord times because he was misbehaving,causing bruises and leaving read marks,welts,and broken skin in re david th,when a parent struck his daughter,dislocating her shoulder in re th,when a parent struck her son with hard objects,violently enough to leave black and blue bruises for unexplained disciplinary reasons in re th,when a parent had physically punished his daughter by hitting her with an iron pipe on the leg hard enough to cause marks,with a broom on the stomach hard enough to cause marks,kicking her,hitting her on the hand hard enough to cause bleeding,slapping her in the face,and driving a car away while her upper torso was leaning into the car in re th,and when a parent,to control his daughters behavior,repeatedly sprayed them with cold water from a hose,pulled their hair,used ice packs,and also indicated a plan to use harsher disciplinary techniques with his son in re cole th.conversely,where parental discipline is reasonable if viewed through the prism of the standard,courts have declined to exercise dependency jurisdiction,such as a when a relative slapped a child on the buttocks with an open hand see in re joel th,or when a parent struggled with her daughter and unintentionally caused fingernail injuries to her face and earlobe in re isabella th,isabella.
the juvenile court asserted dependency jurisdiction in this case on the ground that hitting children with shoes on repeat occasions is not a proper form of discipline,and it physical abuse.because the court did not consider the genuineness,necessity or reasonableness of mother use of spanking as a disciplinary measure,the juvenile court seemingly blanket rule is inconsistent with the law described above.it also treats the implement of punishment a sandal rather than a hand as dispositive,which is also not consistent with the law.accord.it is not unlawful for a parent to spank a child for disciplinary purposes with an object other than the hand gonzalez,supra,th at we can not say that the use of a wooden spoon to administer a spanking necessarily exceeds the bounds of reasonable parental discipline.
the department defends the juvenile court categorical ruling.the department first contends that some of the authority we cite involved the parental right to physically discipline children in the context of child abuse registration as gonzalez does or criminal law as the attorney general opinion does,and thereby suggests that this right does not apply in the context of juvenile dependency proceedings.but,as we explained above,the text of section explicitly preserves the right of parents to administer reasonable and reasonable and discipline.what is more,we adopt for section the same definition of reasonable parental discipline that courts have been consistently applying for decades in every other context in which it arises.dependency law undoubtedly rests on a unique cluster of policy concerns,but the policy that prompts courts to balance a parent right in deciding how to raise his or her child against the child right not to be subjected to unreasonable discipline is not unique to the dependency system.
relatedly,the department notes that dependency courts need not wait until a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction,supra,th at,and reasons that the juvenile courts should be empowered to exercise dependency jurisdiction,even when parental discipline is reasonable,because it might later become unreasonable.however,because this reasoning would apply in every case of parental discipline,reasonable or not,it would effectively write the language preserving the right to engage in reasonable discipline right out of section.rewriting statutes is beyond our purview.state of public health superior court cal th,noting how courts may not rewrite statutes.
where,as here,the juvenile court applies the incorrect legal standard,we may decline to engage in substantial evidence review and instead remand to allow the juvenile court to apply the correct legal standard.such a remand is appropriate in this case,where the parties did not adduce and the juvenile court did not consider evidence relevant to the genuineness of mother disciplinary motive,the necessity of her punishment or the reasonableness of its severity.these issues likely turn on questions of credibility of both mother and guillermo and competency to testify as to the children,and these are questions the juvenile court is in a far better position to assess in the first instance.
disposition 
we reverse the jurisdictional finding as to mother only,and remand for further proceedings examining whether mother conduct falls within her right to reasonably discipline her children.the judgment is otherwise affirmed.
the majority frames the issue on appeal as a challenge to the limits of parental use of corporal punishment rather than whether or not substantial evidence supports the juvenile court jurisdictional finding the majority further concludes the juvenile court ruling relied on its categorical view that hitting children with shoes is physical abuse and not a proper form of discipline.it is my assessment that there was sufficient substantial evidence before the court below to support the finding of jurisdiction and rather than improperly relying on its categorical view the juvenile court instead merely made an observation concerning the evidence upon which it relied
