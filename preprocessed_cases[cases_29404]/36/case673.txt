discussion 
mother contends the dependency court jurisdictional findings are not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
i.the law and standard of review 
as relevant to mother current appeal,section,subdivision b,authorizes the dependency court to assert jurisdiction over a child in a number of circumstances a child has suffered serious physical harm as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the child,or there is a substantial risk the child will suffer serious physical harm as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the child,or the child has suffered serious physical harm or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer serious physical harm by the inability of the parent to provide regular care for the child due to the parent substance abuse.
in short,there are three elements for jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,namely,neglectful conduct or substance abuse by a parent in one of the specified forms causation and serious physical harm to the child,or a substantial risk of such harm.see in re john th,in re th.in mother and rebecca current case,the focus is on whether there is maternal substance abuse,and whether such substance abuse has caused harm or poses a substantial risk of causing harm to her child.
