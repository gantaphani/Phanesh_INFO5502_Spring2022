factual and procedural background 
allison was born in november.in august,the san francisco human services agency agency filed a section petition alleging mother mental health and substance abuse problems prevented her from caring for allison.the petition also alleged father was a registered sex offender who had a criminal record and who could not protect allison from mother,subds.b,g.in an amended petition filed in september,the agency alleged mother and father engaged in domestic violence in violation of a restraining order requiring father to stay away from mother.the court detained allison.
in its disposition report,the agency reported that father was a registered sex offender due to fondling a minor who was mentally delayed when father lived in florida.according to the report,father had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance for sale in health,and second degree robbery in and again in.the report indicated that father admitted he used methamphetamine until the lord jesus saved him but denie d all of the allegations.the agency noted father was living in a homeless shelter and was on parole until october for robbery.one restriction of father parole prohibited him from having contact with any minors except supervised contact with allison.
in an addendum report,the agency recommended that the court bypass reunification services for father pursuant to section b because of father robbery convictions and because of his extensive criminal history dating back to,when he was required to register as a sex offender.the addendum report noted father had various misdemeanor convictions for cruelty to animals,burglary,and forgery,and attached proof of father prior convictions.
the court held a contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing on february.the court determined allison came within the provisions of section.during the disposition portion of the hearing,allison social worker,larissa,testified she recommended the court not provide reunification services for father because the agency was concerned about his violent pattern with his criminal behavior,and also about the history of domestic violence between mother and father.when discussed her concerns with father,he was evasive and said,i already dealt with that with my attorney and all of that is not true.father also blamed his roommate for the death of the cat that led to his animal cruelty conviction.
explained that she was concerned about allison safety if father does not get treatment and does not acknowledge that he had a dv situation t he mother reported to me that when she was pregnant the father pushed her down and she fell over on the floor.also,she reported that after she had the baby,she and father lived together for some time,and she was asking him for money for provisions for the baby and he became so frustrated and upset that he grabbed a piece of paper and pushed it down her mouth to quiet her down.so my concern is lack of accepting,taking responsibility for his behavior.stated father admitted he regularly violated the restraining order prohibiting him from contacting mother but failed to acknowledge it was a problem that he assaulted a developmentally delayed child in florida.
according to,allison would not do well without appropriate parenting because she has special needs and is developmentally delayed.finally,testified that father was loving toward allison,appeared concerned about her welfare during supervised visits,and had been attending parenting classes and family therapy.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the commissioner followed the agency recommendation and declined to provide reunification services for father pursuant to section b.the commissioner found clear and convincing evidence there was a substantial danger to allison safety and if she were returned home.the commissioner explained she was concerned about the seriousness of father convictions,about father lack of insight regarding the convictions,and about his unwillingness to even discuss his part in those convictions.the commissioner commended father for having good visits with his daughter,but noted that having good visits and being a good parent are far different.
father filed an application for rehearing.the presiding judge denied the application,explaining that the agency had established beyond a reasonable doubt that father had committed a violent felony within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision c.the judge rejected father argument that there ought to be a nexus between the crime and the care of the child and concluded the commissioner did not abuse her discretion by determining father did not establish that reunification services would be in allison best interests.

section b allows the court to bypass reunification services where the parent or guardian has been convicted of a violent felony within the meaning of penal code section,subdivision c.see in re james th,denial of reunification services pursuant to section b proper where father was convicted of two violent felonies,including robbery with firearm use seiser kumli cal.juvenile courts b xii.here,father was convicted of second degree robbery and again in.robbery is a violent felony pursuant to penal code section,subdivision c.
