background 
in,alice king petitioned for the dissolution of her marriage to samuel king.the muller law firm represented samuel.in march,muller sought to withdraw as counsel.that motion was granted in july and samuel acted pro se thereafter.muller filed a petition for fees against samuel.on january,the dissolution action came before the circuit court for final hearing.although the record does not contain any transcript of that hearing,the court entered two orders.one order disposed of all remaining issues in the kings dissolution proceeding and denied alice petition for contribution to her attorney fees.no finding was made as to contribution on behalf of samuel.in a separate order entered following a hearing on muller petition for fees,the court awarded muller a judgment against samuel in the amount of.the court made a finding pursuant to supreme court rule a a and specified that the amount of the judgment shall be paid directly to the muller firm,from one of king bank accounts currently restrained.the final judgment of dissolution of marriage was entered on february.that judgment awarded the marital home in chicago to samuel.the judgment also denied the requests of samuel and alice for contribution from the other for attorney fees.the judgment further contained the following provision the court entered a judgment against samuel king and in favor of the muller firm on january,in the amount of.said sum shall be paid out of the accounts listed in section a,out of samuel king assets.section a of the february,judgment listed the assets awarded to samuel,which included two bank accounts.the record shows that counsel for alice informed the court on that date that samuel had advised counsel of his withdrawal of funds from the accounts.as a result,the court ordered the balances on all of samuel accounts to be paid over to alice.
muller began proceedings to collect on its judgment.on february,muller filed citations to discover assets directed to three different banks.the citations were based upon the january,judgment for attorney fees.it appears that muller received partial satisfaction of its judgment through these efforts.in march,muller filed a citation to discover assets against samuel,indicating that plus costs of remained unsatisfied.muller filed a memorandum of judgment with the county recorder office based upon the january,judgment for attorney fees.on april,the county sheriff issued a levy on samuel residential real estate.the property had been previously appraised at.a sale of the property was conducted on september.muller placed the highest bid at.appellant kenneth swiatek placed the next highest bid at.the sheriff accepted swiatek bid and a certificate of sale was issued on september,to swiatek and jim finnegan.the certificate was assigned on december,to swiatek,finnegan,and francisco javier iniguez,who are the appellants in this case referred to hereafter,collectively,as swiatek.on march,a sheriff deed was issued to the purchasers following expiration of the statutory redemption period.
samuel retained an attorney,who filed a petition to vacate the sale.the trial court denied that petition.on september,samuel was adjudicated a disabled adult and appellee,patrick murphy,cook county public guardian guardian,was appointed temporary guardian of samuel estate and person.the guardian filed a motion for reconsideration of samuel petition to vacate the sale.that motion alleged that samuel suffered from various physical and mental infirmities that rendered him incapable of understanding the nature,significance,or legal effect of the proceedings for the execution sale of his home.the motion also identified several alleged irregularities in the sale,including that the january,attorney fees order,pursuant to which the sale was made,limited collection of the judgment to certain of samuel accounts and did not authorize a levy on real estate the notice of the sale was not posted in three public places as required by section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west the report of commissioners was not signed under oath pursuant to sections and of the code ilcs,west the certificate of sale was not sold to the highest bidder the sale was not approved by the court pursuant to section of the code ilcs west samuel was not served with the levy the levy reflects inconsistent dates and there are two inconsistent receipts of sale,both of which are unsigned and undated and do not include the bid amount or the resulting surplus to which samuel would be entitled.following arguments of counsel,the trial court entered an order granting the motion for reconsideration.the court subsequently denied swiatek motion for reconsideration of that order.the appellate court affirmed the trial court,holding that the january,attorney fee order was interlocutory in nature and not final or appealable until the judgment of dissolution of marriage was entered.the court noted that the trial court made specific reference to the january order in the february,dissolution judgment and it modified the former order by deleting the restriction on collecting the attorney fee award from samuel restrained bank accounts and allowing collection from any of samuel assets.thus,according to the appellate court,the february,judgment superceded the january,order.the appellate court noted that the lien on samuel real estate had been recorded based upon the january,order.it concluded that a valid lien was not created.d.
ii.analysis 
motion to strike portions of the guardian brief 
prior to addressing the merits of this appeal,we consider swiatek motion,ordered taken with the case,seeking to strike portions of the guardian brief for violation of supreme court rule.swiatek first argues that the guardian brief violates rule a a,which states that footnotes,if any,shall be used sparingly.swiatek contends that the guardian brief contains footnotes,most of which contain argument that should be properly incorporated into the brief.a review of the footnotes shows that many of them do in fact contain argument and citation of authority.this material properly belongs in the body of the guardian brief.the inclusion of footnotes,particularly where many of them contain argument and citation of authority,is a serious violation of rule a.accordingly,we grant this portion of swiatek motion and strike the footnotes from the guardian brief.
swiatek next argues that the introduction section of the guardian brief violates rule e e,which requires the inclusion of an introductory paragraph stating the nature of the action and of the judgment appealed from,whether the judgment is based on a jury verdict,and whether any question is raised on the pleadings.swiatek notes that the guardian introduction consists of a page and a half of material,much of which is argumentative.although we agree that this section of the guardian brief goes beyond the introductory paragraph envisioned by rule e,we do not find this violation to be so serious as to warrant striking this section of the brief.we,therefore,deny this portion of swiatek motion to strike.
next,swiatek seeks to strike the portion of the guardian brief that sets forth the issues presented for review in this appeal as a violation of rule e e.the rule contemplates that issues will be stated concisely and without citation of authority.the rule gives examples of appropriate statements of an issue.the guardian brief contains two numbered issues.however,within the first issue,he identifies seven separate issues regarding alleged irregularities in the sale of samuel home.we do not find this violation to be so serious as to warrant the striking of the statement of issues and we deny this portion of swiatek motion.
swiatek also argues that the guardian has violated rule e e,which requires the statement of facts to contain the facts necessary to an understanding of the case,stated accurately and fairly without argument or comment.swiatek contends that the guardian has included in his statement of facts matters not necessary for the disposition of this appeal,namely,the proceeding in which samuel was declared a disabled adult.however,we note that the parties disagreed in the appellate court as to the grounds upon which the trial court rested its decision granting the guardian motion for reconsideration.the guardian inclusion of the disputed matters in his statement of facts comports with his view of the proceedings in the trial court.to the extent that the statement of facts contains any irrelevant matters,we have disregarded them.we,therefore,deny this portion of swiatek motion to strike.
we now address the merits of this appeal.
standard of review 
resolution of this case turns on interpretation of section c of the marriage and dissolution of marriage act act ilcs c west.the cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the court must ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.paris feder.when construing a statute,the court should look first to the language of the statute,giving the terms their plain and ordinary meaning.paris,at.where the language is clear and unambiguous,we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction.davis toshiba machine,america.if the statutory language is ambiguous,however,we may look to other sources to ascertain the legislature intent.people ross.the construction of a statute is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.
finality of the january,order 
swiatek argues that the appellate court erred in holding that the january,order was not a final order and that it would not,therefore,support a lien on samuel real estate.swiatek relies on section c of the act,which was substantially amended in.in particular,he relies on language in section c that a petition for setting final attorney fees constitutes a distinct cause of action.ilcs c west.
the amendments to section c must be understood in the context in which they were made.prior to those amendments,contribution of one spouse to the other spouse attorney fees and determination of a client liability to his or her own attorney for fees were decided at the same hearing.section a provided in pertinent part 
the court from time to time,after due notice and hearing,and after considering the financial resources of the parties,may order any party to pay a reasonable amount for his own costs and attorney fees and for the costs and attorney fees necessarily incurred by the opposing party.ilcs a west.
section a now provides that a t the conclusion of the case,contribution to attorney fees and costs may be awarded from the opposing party in accordance with subsection j of section.fees and costs may be awarded to counsel from a former client in accordance with subsection c of section.ilcs a west.
pursuant to section j of the act,the question of contribution to attorney fees is to be determined only after proofs have closed on all other issues between the parties and before judgment is entered.ilcs j west.prior to obtaining a judgment for fees under section c,judgment in any contribution hearing on behalf of the client must have been entered or the right to a contribution hearing waived and counsel must have withdrawn as counsel of record.ilcs c iii,c iv west.an attorney fee proceeding under section c is initiated by filing a petition for setting final fees and costs.that section further states 
irrespective of a petition for setting final fees and costs being heard in conjunction with an original proceeding under this act,the relief requested under a petition for setting final fees and costs constitutes a distinct cause of action.a pending but undetermined petition for setting final fees and costs shall not affect appealability of any judgment or other adjudication in the original proceeding.ilcs c west.
in,this court held that a dissolution judgment was not final and appealable unless all issues had been determined.in in re marriage of leopando,we considered whether a custody order was appealable where other issues in the dissolution action had been reserved.we stated that a petition for dissolution of marriage advances a single claim and questions regarding custody,property division,and support are ancillary to the cause of action.until all of the issues are resolved,the petition for dissolution is not fully adjudicated and no appeal may be taken.leopando,at.
in in re marriage of derning,d,the trial court had entered a dissolution judgment that resolved all issues except apportionment of liability between the parties for attorney fees,which the court indicated would be determined at a later time.respondent appealed that judgment and petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.citing leopando,the appellate court held that the question of liability for attorney fees was integral to the judgment dissolving the parties marriage and that the judgment was not final until that liability was finally determined.derning,d at.in in re marriage of kerman,d,however,the trial court had apportioned liability for attorney fees prior to entry of the judgment of dissolution of marriage.subsequent thereto,the trial court permitted respondent counsel to withdraw and to file a petition for fees against respondent.the appellate court held that the pendency of counsel petition did not render respondent appeal of the judgment of dissolution premature.as liability for fees had previously been apportioned between the parties,the determination of the reasonableness of the fees charged to respondent by his own counsel did not affect the issues resolved by the judgment of dissolution.kerman,d at.the amendments to section c codified this holding.see kaufman,litwin feinstein edgar,d.
swiatek argues that the amendments conferred finality on judgments for attorney fees entered pursuant to section c,so that such judgments are themselves final orders that are then enforceable against the client,independent of and prior to entry of a final judgment of dissolution of marriage.he relies on the fact that section c states that a petition for setting final fees constitutes a distinct cause of action.however,in ascertaining the meaning of a statute,a court should not read language in isolation,but must consider it in the context of the entire statute.people trainor.accordingly,the phrase distinct cause of action must be read together with the sentence immediately following,which states that a pending,but undetermined,petition for fees shall not affect the appealability of any judgment or other adjudication in the dissolution proceeding.by use of this language,section c contemplates that a petition for setting final fees may still be pending at the time a final judgment of dissolution of marriage is entered.in fact,the section recognizes that in some cases,a petition for fees will not even be filed until after a judgment of dissolution has been entered.section c provides that a petition,or a praecipe for fee hearing without the petition,must be filed no later than the expiration of the period in which it is permissible to file a postjudgment motion under section of the code ilcs west.ilcs c west.accordingly,given the separation of final fee petitions from other issues in the dissolution proceeding under the new procedures,there is no reason to defer finality and appealability of dissolution judgments until fee petitions are resolved.in such cases,the concerns we expressed in leopando about the appealability of orders on interrelated issues in a dissolution case do not apply.it is in this context that the phrase distinct cause of action in section c must be understood.the use of that phrase is simply a recognition that the issue of fees owed by a client to his or her attorney is not interrelated with other issues,such as child support,property division,and maintenance.as such,once these other interrelated issues are finally determined,the judgment of dissolution is final and appealable,despite the continued pendency of the issue of a
