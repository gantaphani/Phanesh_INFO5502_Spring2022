factual and procedural background 
mother and father were living together but not married when was born in august.according to the paternity questionnaire completed by mother in these dependency proceedings,father provided financial support and maintained a relationship with half sibling,was born in november.at all relevant times,and collectively,the children lived with mother in the maternal grandparents home.other maternal family members lived in the same apartment complex.
from until,the children were the subject of six referrals,all of which dcfs concluded as unfounded or inconclusive.in a march interview,then year old told a social worker that mother hit her occasionally,but she could not recall any resulting marks or bruises mother called fat and told her she would not get married or have babies mother also called names,told mother never liked her and that father left them because was horrible mother had threatened suicide mother slept a lot when she took her medication but mother believed she did not need medication because there was nothing wrong with her.told the social worker that she saw father on weekends and things were better there,but she did not want to live with him.mother and the maternal grandparents denied that mother had any mental health issues.
absence from school for days prompted another referral in may,which resulted in mother agreeing to a voluntary maintenance plan in july.continued to have regular contact with father and his wife stepmother,including frequent telephone calls and unmonitored overnight visits for thanksgiving and christmas,which said she enjoyed.therapist encouraged these contacts.
on january,mother was arrested following an incident in which she pushed maternal grandmother to the ground causing her to lose consciousness mother next threw a vase at a cousin the vase hit that cousin mother maternal aunt causing injuries which required surgery to repair severed tendons.dcfs did not learn about the incident until two weeks later,after a family maintenance worker was unable to make contact with mother.when asked about what happened,maternal grandmother was evasive.various family members gave different versions of what occurred.denied she was present during the altercation.
dcfs filed a petition which alleged the children were persons described by section,subdivisions a and b as the result of the january altercation which witnessed paragraphs a and b.there were no allegations against father.following a team decision meeting on january,it was agreed that the children would be detained from mother who was still incarcerated and temporarily placed with maternal grandparents,notwithstanding dcfs concerns that the maternal grandparents were in denial about mother problems 
according to the detention report,a told the social worker that she was not home when the altercation occurred,but was home by the time mother was being taken to jail.said,now that she in jail,hopefully she can get the help she needs.i do know how to explain this.but my mom can get very nervous.sometimes she pull out her hair.there a bunch of hair in a shoe box under her bed.or when she takes me and to the mall,she start picking her face when told of the altercation,father said i knew something like this would happen.that why when i go over there to pick up,i do want any dealing with mother.she needs a lot of help.i wanted custody of for a long time.father said he and stepmother were also willing to have live with them.father had noticed a recent negative change in attitude,which he attributed to the influence of the maternal relatives.
father appeared at the detention hearing on february,and requested that be released to him.wanted to continue living with maternal grandparents,but was not opposed to overnight visits with father.dcfs opposed releasing to father.observing that dcfs report focused on mother,the juvenile court concluded that it did not have enough information about father to give him custody of.it vested temporary custody and placement of the children in dcfs,pending further orders.father was given reasonable unmonitored visits with and dcfs was given discretion to allow father overnight visits with consent.the matter was continued to march,for adjudication and disposition.
on march,the children counsel filed a walk on request seeking an order that not be released to father without court hearing with full report from dcfs and notice to parties in advance.the request states that is terrified of being released to her father nonoffending under the petition.informed the court at the detention hearing on,that her father missed years of her life.there is no order for csw discretion to release,but csw is to evaluate placement with father.the juvenile granted the request and ordered is not to be released to father without prior court order,and a full report is to be filed to the court in advance.
according to the report,the maternal grandparents continued to deny that mother pushed maternal grandmother on january.they did not acknowledge their daughter has mental health issues and how they impact the children well being.the social worker had been unable to make contact with father.wanted unmonitored weekend visits with father,but did not want to live with him i do want to live at a new home,i have never lived with him before and i do want to change schools.i have only lived here with maternal grandparents and my grandma has always taken good care of me.noting that both fathers were nonoffending,the report states t the fact remains there have been issues of domestic violence in the past between mother and each father.father has been reported to be an alcoholic and in fact has been arrested on occasions for inflicting corporal injury on spouse.furthermore,while the father has an odd work schedule and travels for days at a time,if was released to him,she would hardly spend time with him.the report concludes releasing the children to their respective fathers would create more emotional harm to the children and the siblings would be separated.furthermore,the children have never lived in a different home and have been raised primarily by the maternal grandparents.therefore,it is respectfully recommended that the children remain placed with the maternal grandparents since it is not in their best interest to be released to their respective fathers.it is recommended the fathers have unmonitored overnight visits with their children and that a visitation schedule be made in order not to interfere with the children school and weekend activities.
at the march,hearing,father submitted on the petition,which included no allegations against him.the children counsel stated the children indicate in the jurisdiction report that they denied ever seeing their mother use drugs,act bizarre,and they do not know about the incidents that occurred resulting in the police report that the court has before it of the january altercation.my clients are supportive of the mom,find themselves in a very difficult position today and would prefer that i do not argue anything against the mother.so at this point i am going to submit to the court and ask the court to carefully review all of the evidence the juvenile court sustained the section petition.
following adjudication,the juvenile court proceeded immediately to disposition.remained adamant that she does not wish to reside with her father.she is beyond uncomfortable.even so,father wanted custody of father has attempted throughout life to see her and to be a part of her life but has been prevented from doing so by mother and also by maternal grandmother.father main concern for remain
