facts and procedural history 
on september,the stanislaus county community services agency filed a petition as to the child esmeralda born august,pursuant to section.the child was ordered detained the next day.the petition was soon followed by a first amended petition filed on september,pursuant to section,subdivisions b failure to protect and j abuse of sibling.the first amended petition alleged that mother,cecilia and father had traveled to modesto from watsonville for the child birth in an attempt to conceal the birth from child protective services in santa cruz county.at the time of the child birth,both mother and child tested positive for cocaine.similarly,three of the child siblings,corina born april,stephanie born june and francisco born october,tested positive for cocaine at the times of their births in santa cruz county.in addition,the siblings were the subject of juvenile dependency proceedings in santa cruz county that resulted in the termination of the parental rights of both mother and father.mother parental rights to an older,james,were also terminated.
the stanislaus county social worker report detailed the history of the previous dependency proceedings involving mother and father.in april,the child sibling,corina,was detained because she tested positive for cocaine at birth,and she was subsequently adjudicated a dependent of the court.the dependency proceeding was eventually dismissed at the month review on june.however,mother soon gave birth to stephanie,who tested positive for cocaine,and dependency petitions were filed in july as to the three children,james,corina,and stephanie.the petitions were based on allegations of mother substantial history of drug abuse and father history of domestic violence and substance abuse.father was identified as the alleged father of stephanie,and he had been adjudged the biological father of corina father appeared and was represented by counsel during the dependency proceedings involving corina and stephanie,but father and mother parental rights were eventually terminated by the juvenile court in december.
in october,mother gave birth to another child,francisco,who also tested positive for cocaine at birth.a dependency petition was filed in november,alleging mother extensive substance abuse,father alcohol abuse,father history of domestic violence,father denial of mother drug problem,and alleging the prior termination of parental rights as to the older siblings and.father was identified as the alleged father of francisco and was represented by counsel during the dependency proceedings.francisco was found to be a dependent of the court,reunification services were ordered bypassed,and the parental rights of mother and father were eventually terminated in june.
the social worker also reported that mother gave birth to the child esmeralda in august and that mother and child tested positive for cocaine.mother told the social worker that she intended to deliver the child in mexico in order to avoid child protective services,but she went into labor earlier than expected so she and father came to modesto for the delivery.at the hospital,mother used a different name in an attempt to conceal her identity.both mother and father signed a declaration of paternity at the time of esmeralda birth.mother told the social worker that she did not believe she had a problem with drugs because she did not use every day and that she just had bad luck.father had been arrested twice for abuse of mother,and mother reported that their arguments were primarily verbal.mother also stated that she no longer wanted to live with father,but he did not want her to leave.
in addition,father had a history of alcohol problems,and he admitted that alcohol was a factor in his arrest for domestic violence against mother.there were no indications that father successfully completed any programs related to the abuse.father also reported to the social worker investigating francisco dependency proceeding in that he drank about four beers a day and more on the weekends however,mother now reported that father no longer drinks and that there have been no further episodes of domestic violence since he stopped drinking.mother and father have been in a relationship for about six years,but father apparently spent some of the time in los angeles,where he has a wife.
the social worker also reported that there was no indication that the parents had subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of the siblings.mother was clearly not interested in pursuing treatment and was only willing to do so if she could have custody of the child.father alcohol and domestic violence issues had not been adequately addressed,and he did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of mother continued substance abuse.father reported that he attended meetings for domestic violence after his arrest in and that he received a letter of completion to take to court to have his case dropped.father also admitted that drinking was involved in the domestic violence,and he reported that he attended some alcoholics anonymous aa meetings.however,there was no indication that he participated in any services during the previous dependency proceedings.
the social worker recommended that the child be made a dependent of the court with placement and that the parents not be offered reunification services.the social worker also recommended that the matter be transferred to santa cruz county since the parents were residents of santa cruz county,had lived in the same residence there for two years,and had purposefully traveled to stanislaus county for the birth of the child in order to evade santa cruz county authorities.on november,the juvenile court in stanislaus county found that the allegations of the first amended petition were true and that the child came within the provisions of section,subdivisions b and j.the court also transferred the case to santa cruz county for disposition.
after the case was transferred to santa cruz county,the human resources agency of santa cruz county the agency submitted a dispositional report,prepared on january,expressing its agreement with the dispositional recommendation of the stanislaus county social worker that reunification services be denied to both parents.after several settlement conferences and continuances,the juvenile court in santa cruz county conducted the contested dispositional hearing on april.
at the contested dispositional hearing,the social worker testified that the child would be in substantial danger in the care of the parents.the social worker had been the social worker for the child siblings and had worked with the parents in the past.according to the social worker,the parents had recurring problems that led to a fourth child being born.both mother and father continued to believe that mother did not have a drug problem,and father did not believe that he had an alcohol problem.the social worker also believed that father knew mother was using drugs since he had been through the hearings in the earlier dependency proceedings involving the child siblings.in addition,father left santa cruz county with mother for the birth of the child in order to avoid the child being removed by child protective services.
the social worker also testified that there was some indication father had attended some domestic violence counseling after his second domestic violence arrest,but she had not seen any proof of completion,and that she had no knowledge of father completing any kind of drug or alcohol rehabilitation program.the social worker also expressed concern about father continuing his relationship with mother and concern that his home life seemed to be unsettled since he was married to a woman in southern california and visited her periodically.
the social worker also testified that mother and father had been living together with father relatives,but mother told the social worker on the day of the contested hearing that she was no longer seeing father.the social worker most current information regarding father alcohol usage was his admission in to consuming four beers per day and more on the weekends.the social worker still believed that father had an alcohol problem because she had no evidence that anything was different with the family.mother had told the social worker in the past that father had been physically violent with her,and mother told another social worker that she and father had a physical altercation in the street after father went through the domestic violence diversion program,resulting in their arrest.
the social worker believed that it was in the best interest of the child to be placed in a stable,loving home instead of with father because the parents have had a conflicted relationship and each repeatedly denies the other has a problem.
father also testified at the contested hearing.father explained that he was working a seasonal job as a lettuce picker when mother was pregnant with corina and stephanie.he would work locally from april to october and then he would go to los angeles to work in a factory.father stated that he was not aware that mother was using cocaine during any of the four pregnancies because he was working and was not taking care of her.after the first three babies were born testing positive for cocaine,father suspected that she was doing something.father also testified that before esmeralda birth,mother told him that she was not using anymore.he never saw her doing drugs,but she sometimes looked suspicious.however,he never confronted her about it.father now believes that mother has a drug problem,and he is not seeing her anymore.he also had no intention of continuing the relationship in the future because their children had been taken from them.
father also testified that he was charged with domestic violence,but the case was dismissed after he completed a domestic violence program and went to aa.he stopped drinking around july and was currently attending aa meetings almost every day,but he was unable to explain the steps of the program.at the behest of his attorney,father also began attending weekly classes at fenix services,and he had attended approximately eight or nine classes at the time of the hearing.
father also explained that he and mother went to stanislaus county to visit family,but she started having pains early.he denied leaving santa cruz county in an attempt to avoid child protective services.he was also unaware that mother was using cocaine just before the child was born.he also stated that mother did not have any drugs after they left santa cruz since they were with family and he was with her every moment.
according to father,he decided approximately two weeks before the hearing that he no longer wanted to be with mother,and he did not plan to raise the child with her.father stated that his sister,who lived with him,and their grandmother would help him raise the child.although father did not know how to tell if mother was using drugs,he believed that mother was safe to be around the child without supervision.father also testified that he would be able to abide by an order not allowing mother unsupervised visits with the child,but he did not understand why the court might want to make such an order.
at the conclusion of the contested dispositional hearing,the juvenile court declared the child a dependent of the court and ordered placement.the juvenile court also ordered a bypass of reunification services as to both mother and father.the juvenile court noted that father had a long history with mother and had lost three children already due to mother substance abuse and father failure to recognize that her drug problem also seriously affected his life as well.the juvenile court also noted that father lived with mother and yet was unable to recognize that mother substance abuse was a problem after losing three children.the juvenile court also believed that this was an aggravated case in light of this being the fourth child the couple was losing because of these problems.although the juvenile court commended father for commencing efforts to attend fenix services and aa,the juvenile court did not believe that father had made reasonable efforts to treat the problems within the family unit.the juvenile court set a section hearing for august.
discussion 
bypass of reunification services after prior termination of an alleged or biological father parental rights section,subdivision b b 
father contends that the bypass provision of section,subdivision b b does not apply to him because he was not a presumed father and thus was not a parent in the previous dependency proceedings.the agency argues that father was a parent under the law at the time his parental rights were terminated in the siblings dependency proceedings since alleged and biological fathers have rights protected by law that simply differ in degree,not in kind,from those of presumed fathers.
the record indicates and the parties do not dispute that father is the presumed father of the child esmeralda but was never more than the biological or alleged father of the child siblings corina,stephanie,and francisco.since father argument is premised on his status as a biological or alleged father during the previous dependency proceedings,we first note some of the relevant distinctions between presumed,biological,and alleged fathers.
in order to become a presumed father,a man must fall within one of several categories enumerated in family code section.under family code section,a man who has neither legally married nor attempted to legally marry the child natural mother can not become a presumed father unless he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,or both he and the natural mother execute a voluntary declaration of paternity.see family code,adoption of michael cal th,d,in re liam th,d.a presumed father is entitled to custody and reunification services.in re zacharia cal th,d.
in contrast,a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status as defined in family code section.a biological father paternal rights may ultimately be terminated in the dependency process.such termination is almost inevitable if a father is not involved in the dependency process prior to the section hearing.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
an alleged father refers to a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d.an alleged father in dependency or permanency proceedings does not have a known current interest because his paternity has not yet been established.in re emily th,d.an alleged fath
