in cases brought by the government for termination of parental rights,section of the texas family code prescribes shortened deadlines and special procedures to discourage frivolous appeals and expedite finality,minimizing the time a child must spend in temporary care.section i limits an appeal to the issues included in a statement filed in the trial court within fifteen days after the judgment is signed.but if an indigent parent who has requested appointed counsel fails to timely file the required statement,the statutory limitation can not,consistent with due process,preclude an appeal complaining of ineffective assistance.so we held in in re for essentially the same reasons,we now hold that due does not allow the lack of the required statement to be the basis for denying the parent an appellate record.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of and remand the case to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
section a provides that an appeal from a judgment in a parental rights termination case brought by the government is accelerated under the texas rules of appellate procedure section b requires that a motion for new trial be filed within fifteen days from the date the judgment is signed,instead of the usual thirty and requires that within the same period a statement of the point or points on which the party intends to appeal must be filed the statute does not provide for an extension of the deadline.the statement of appellate points is crucial.section i states 
the appellate court may not consider any issue that was not specifically presented to the trial court in a timely filed statement of the points on which the party intends to appeal or in a statement combined with a motion for new trial.for purposes of this subsection,a claim that a judicial decision is contrary to the evidence or that the evidence is factually or legally insufficient is not sufficiently specific to preserve an issue for appeal.
notice of appeal and an appellant affidavit of indigence must be filed within twenty days after the judgment is signed a party indigent status in the trial court does not establish indigence on appeal this deadline is not extended by the filing of motions or requests for findings and conclusions but the appellate court can grant a extension within thirty days after the judgment is signed,section d requires the trial court to hold a hearing to determine whether a new trial should be granted,whether any claim of indigence should be sustained,and whether the appeal is frivolous a parent whose claim of indigence is not denied within days after the judgment is signed is considered to be indigent 
ordinarily in an accelerated appeal,the record is due ten days after the notice of appeal but in a parental rights termination case,preparation of the record for an indigent appeal can not even begin until the trial court has determined at the hearing required by section d that an appeal will not be frivolous and section f allows the appellate record to be filed up to sixty days after the judgment is signed thus,an indigent parent must move for new trial,file a statement of appellate points,and convince the trial court that appeal is not frivolous,all without a reporter record.
an indigent parent is entitled to appointed counsel in parental rights termination cases and that statutory right,we have held,embodies the right to effective counsel there are no statutory directives for when or how the appointment is to be made.once appointed,an attorney can not withdraw without good cause and the court permission and withdrawal is subject to ethical restrictions it is not uncommon for appellate counsel to be substituted for trial counsel,but appellate counsel can not be appointed until the appellant has been determined to be indigent on appeal an attorney who was not present at trial often faces significant difficulties in determining what grounds there may be for a motion for new trial or appeal within the prescribed timeframe.
the texas department of family and protective services sued petitioner lester williams in february to terminate his rights in his four children on the ground that he had endangered their from the scant record before us,which does not include a reporter record of the trial,it appears that williams,an inmate,was permitted to discharge his appointed counsel and proceed to trial pro se.the trial court signed a judgment terminating williams parental rights on july.the docket sheet reflects that on july the trial court appointed attorney claude welch to represent williams,and we infer from this notation that williams indicated an intention to appeal and requested appointment of counsel,and that welch was actually appointed.but the record does not contain an order appointing welch or reflect that he took any action on behalf of williams.the record does contain an order dated august appointing attorney brent watkins to represent williams.watkins stated at oral argument that the trial court accommodated welch request to be relieved of the appointment and that welch never actually represented williams,but our record is silent on the subject.
watkins appointment came days after the judgment was signed,and thus after the deadlines for filing a statement of appellate points,a notice of appeal,and an affidavit of indigence.watkins filed williams notice of appeal on august and his affidavit of indigence on august,and was granted extensions for both.watkins filed a statement of appellate points on september,forty days late.the statement set out two points of appeal first,that williams had not been allowed to offer family members testimony about efforts he had made to provide his children physical and emotional care,to refute the charges that he had placed his children,or allowed them to remain,in dangerous conditions and second,that the evidence for termination was not clear and convincing.
the trial court held a hearing on september,days after the judgment was signed.the record does not reflect a reason for the delay.by that time,since the trial court had not denied williams claim of indigence,he was considered to be indigent.the trial court ordered that because williams had not filed a statement of appellate points by the statutory deadline,an appellate record was not needed to decide any issue presented for the appeal,and found that no substantial question for appellate review has been presented the court of appeals affirmed and we granted williams petition for review 
williams contends that by precluding his appeal,section violates due process.we faced a similar contention in in re there,an indigent parent appointed counsel was permitted to withdraw after the trial,and new counsel was appointed,but not until after the statement of appellate points was due on appeal,the parent complained that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.section i foreclosed that complaint because it was not included in a timely filed statement of points,even though the lack of a statement was the basis of the complaint.we held that by precluding the parent from complaining on appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel in those circumstances,section i violated due process we further held,based on a full record,that the parent had been denied effective assistance because his appellate issue,insufficiency of the evidence,would have required reversal had it been included in a timely filed statement of appellate points 
the present case differs from in that it is unclear whether williams was represented by counsel in the fifteen days he had to file a statement of appellate points.attorney welch was appointed two days after the judgment was signed,but the record does not reflect whether he actually undertook to represent williams or,as watkins tells us,was allowed to withdraw.the department insists that we must presume welch represented williams until watkins was appointed,but the issue is immaterial.whether williams failed to file the statement required for appeal because he had no counsel or ineffective counsel,he is entitled under to complain on appeal of ineffective assistance.
