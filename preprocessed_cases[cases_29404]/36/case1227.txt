ronald,the father of a child born out of wedlock,appeals from a judgment declaring his child free from his custody and control.the judgment was entered pursuant to recently enacted probate code section,which applies in guardianship proceedings this statute provides for the termination of parental rights without a finding of parental unfitness.we conclude that the statute is not unconstitutional on its face.it does not violate the due process or the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions.we also conclude that,because section permits the termination of parental rights without a finding of parental unfitness,it is unconstitutional to the extent it is applied to unwed fathers who have made a full commitment to their parental responsibilities we reverse and remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether appellant has demonstrated the requisite commitment to his parental responsibilities.
factual and procedural background 
charlotte minor was born in august to unwed and linda mother.since june,mother had been living with minor paternal grandparents,cornelis and brigitte respondents,in their home in camarillo,california.in december,the parents and minor moved to nevada.both parents had problems with alcohol and drugs,and mother physically abused minor.
appellant stated that he went on the run with minor and turned her over to respondents on december,for her safety.since that date,minor has resided with respondents in camarillo.appellant lived with minor and respondents for approximately three years after his release from a nevada jail in late.
on february,respondents filed an action in nevada seeking custody of minor.the verified complaint alleged that appellant and mother have never been married.on march,the district court of clark county,nevada,entered the following order in the custody action appellant has acknowledged paternity and is hereby ordered to be the father of minor 
on march,the district court of clark county,nevada,ordered that respondents be appointed guardians of minor.the order was pursuant to the stipulation of respondents,appellant,and mother.mother was granted visitation with minor.as to appellant,the order of guardianship states the parties acknowledge that appellant currently resides with respondents in camarillo,california.as a result,appellant has continuous and regular contact with minor,and no order of visitation between appellant and respondents is necessary.appellant was ordered to pay respondents monthly child support of.appellant,however,made only one child support payment of.
on august,respondents filed a domestic violence action in the ventura county superior court seeking a restraining order against appellant.cornelis ronald,no.on september,the court ordered appellant to stay at least yards away from respondents and minor.the restraining order expired on january.
on april,appellant filed an application in the domestic violence action for custody of and reasonable visitation with minor.the court issued an order to show cause why the relief sought in the application should not be granted.
on june,the parties stipulated that mother resided in riverside,california.the court found neither the minor nor the minor parents nor any person acting as a parent resides in nevada per family code section b.the court determined that california is now the home state of the minor.a minute order states the parties are advised that for modifications of the nevada order the parties may file their applications in this court for determination.
on july,the superior court ordered that respondents retain sole legal custody of minor.on november,the court approved a written settlement concerning visitation.appellant was permitted to visit minor on alternate saturdays.
on september,respondents filed a request to adopt minor.on january,they filed a petition to declare minor free from the custody and control of her parents pursuant to section 
on may and,a trial was conducted on the section petition.appellant contended that section was unconstitutional,in violation of substantive due process,both on its face and as applied to him.he also contended that the statute perhaps violates equal protection.the court stated,i not going to find the statute unconstitutional,but i have some significant reservations about whether it going to survive.the court found that it would be in minor best interest to be adopted by the guardians and that she would clearly benefit from being adopted by her guardians,and that it is really against her best interest for the father to maintain his parental rights.the court declared minor free from the custody and control of the father as provided in probate code section.rt 
section was enacted in by senate bill hereafter sb.stats.the statute provides 
a a proceeding to have a child declared free from the custody and control of one or both parents may be brought in the guardianship proceeding pursuant to part commencing with section of division of the family code,if all of the following requirements are satisfied one or both parents do not have the legal custody of the child.the child has been in the physical custody of the guardian for a period of not less than two years.the court finds that the child would benefit from being adopted by his or her guardian.in making this determination,the court shall consider all factors relating to the best interest of the child,including but not limited to,the nature and extent of the relationship between all of the following a the child and the birth parent.b the child and the guardian,including family members of the guardian.c the child and any siblings or.
b the court shall appoint a court investigator or other qualified professional to investigate all factors enumerated in subdivision a.the findings of the investigator or professional regarding those issues shall be included in the written report required pursuant to section of the family code.
c the rights of the parent,including the rights to notice and counsel provided in part commencing with section of division of the family code,shall apply to actions brought pursuant to this section.
d this section does not apply to any child who is a dependent of the juvenile court.
in construing section,o ur role is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in re reeves cal th,d.in determining legislative intent,we may consider bill analyses prepared by the staff of legislative committees.people benson cal th,fn,d.
an analysis of sb by the staff of the senate judiciary committee notes that,under existing law,a guardian who wishes to adopt a ward may file a petition in juvenile court,if the ward is a dependent of the court,or file a petition in family court if the child birth parent or parents would voluntarily consent to the adoption by the guardian,or first file a petition in family court to have the child be freed from the custody and control of a birth parent or parents in conjunction with a petition to adopt the child.com.on judiciary,analysis of sb reg.sess.as amended.the analysis observes that,pursuant to family code section et,the last avenue is available to the guardian only under circumstances indicating parental unfitness,at.
the analysis states that sb would create yet another avenue for a guardian where the child has been in the custody of the guardian for a long time and the parent or parents are not likely to reclaim the child but the parent or parents do not fall under one of the categories covered by existing law.the situation that this bill intends to cover,for example is where one parent can not be found,and the other voluntarily gave the child to the guardian in a written guardianship agreement that may or may not have been entered in a formal court proceeding.years later it became apparent that the child has bonded with the guardians as parents,but since the birth parents visited occasionally,abandonment could not be established.another example given by the sponsor is where a drug addicted mother gives the child in guardianship,hoping to get herself rehabilitated but repeatedly failed,creating a situation where the child is in the custody of the guardian for years without being in the foster care system.the sponsor contends that in either case,a guardian should be able to adopt the child without having to obtain consent or prove neglect,abandonment,or the mental disorder or mental illness of the parent who gave them sic guardianship in the first place.com.on judiciary,analysis of sb,supra,at.
in determining legislative intent,we may also consider a senate floor analysis.jevne superior court cal th,d.a senate floor analysis of sb states that section is intended to institute a new procedure for the court to terminate parental rights when a child has been in the custody of a guardian for at least two years but there is no basis for the termination of parental rights except that it would be in the best interest of the child to be adopted by the guardian.there are some constitutional problems with this procedure that may be curable.the author office and acal academy of california adoption lawyers state that this bill is necessary in order to fill a gap in the adoption area,especially with regards to children who are not dependents of the court who have been in the custody of guardians and whose birth parents are not likely to regain custody.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of sb reg.sess.as amended.
the bill analyses show that,to facilitate a guardian adoption of his or her ward,the legislature intended that section permit the termination of parental rights in guardianship proceedings without a finding of unfitness,provided that the termination is in the best interest of the ward,and the guardian has had custody of the ward for at least two years.
parental rights are a fundamental liberty interest protected by substantive due process 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution provides that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law citation.the united states supreme court has long recognized that this provision is not only a guarantee of procedural due process,but also substantively protects certain liberties from state infringement except when justified by the most compelling reasons a substantive due process claim relies upon our line of cases which interprets the fifth and fourteenth amendments guarantee of due process of law to include a substantive component,which forbids the government to infringe certain fundamental liberty interests at all,no matter what process is provided,unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.citation.dawn superior court jerry cal th,d.
parental rights are a fundamental liberty interest citation.cynthia superior court cal th,d.the united states supreme court has long recognized the substantive due process right of parents to raise their children.citation.in re marriage of th,d.in santosky kramer,d,the united states supreme court observed,the fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,custody,and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the state.even when blood relationships are strained,parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life.the supreme court therefore rejected the claim that a parental rights termination proceeding does not interfere with a fundamental liberty interest,at,fn.when the state initiates a parental rights termination proceeding,it seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest,but to end it.if the state prevails,it will have worked a unique kind of deprivation a parent interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is,therefore,a commanding one.citation,at.
a guardianship does not extinguish parents fundamental liberty interest in the care,custody,and management of their children.guardianship of stephen th,d.a guardianship completely suspends it for an indefinite period,subd.a the authority of a parent ceases on t he appointment,by a court,of a guardian of the person of the child,subd.a upon appointment,guardian has the care,custody,and control of,and has charge of the education of,the ward.in the absence of further court intervention,this suspension will continue until the child is no longer subject to parental control.citations.therefore the guardianship will persist,and parental rights will remain suspended,for the remainder of the child minority unless the court acts to terminate it sooner.ibid.however,a guardian is subject to the regulation and control of the court,and t he court has the continuing power to grant visitation rights in a probate guardianship proceeding.citation.guardianship of zachary th,d.upon petition of the guardian,a parent,or the ward,the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is no longer necessary that the ward have a guardian or that it is in the ward best interest to terminate the guardianship.
an unwed father parental rights are entitled to constitutional protection only if he has demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities 
in adoption of kelsey cal th,d,our supreme court considered the showing necessary to terminate parental rights.our supreme court noted that the statutory scheme creates three classifications of parents mothers,biological fathers who are presumed fathers,and biological fathers who are not presumed fathers,natural fathers,at,d.a man achieves presumed father status by falling within one of several categories set forth in family code section,formerly civil code section 
the kelsey court observed that,if a biological father is not a presumed father,he is a natural father,his parental rights may be terminated under civil code section,subdivision d now family code section,subdivision b merely by showing that termination would be in the child best interest.no showing of unfitness is required under the statutes,at,d.on the other hand,a mother or a presumed father must consent to an adoption absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence of that parent unfitness,at,d.parental unfitness is considerably more difficult to show than that the child best interest is served by adoption.in re adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.
the unwed,biological father in kelsey could have achieved presumed status by receiving the child into his home and openly acknowledging his paternity,subd.d,formerly,subd.a.the father had made diligent and legal attempts to obtain custody of his child and to rear it himself adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.because of the mother objections,his attempts had been unsuccessful.pursuant to civil code section,subdivision d now family code section,subdivision b,the lower court had terminated his parental rights based on a finding that the termination was in the child best interest.
the kelsey court opined that the decision of the united states supreme court in quilloin walcott,d,strongly suggests that the parental rights of a father in petitioner position may not properly be terminated absent a showing of his unfitness as a father.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.the kelsey court also opined that,in stanley illinois,d,the united states supreme court seemed to indicate that a father parental rights could not be terminated absent a showing of his unfitness,and that a showing of the child best interest would be an insufficient basis for termination of the father rights the california statutory scheme appears to conflict with the emphasis in stanley on the need for a particularized finding of unfitness,at,d.
after reviewing the relevant united states supreme court decisions,our supreme court in kelsey concluded although the high court decisions do not provide a comprehensive rule for all situations involving unwed fathers,one unifying and transcendent theme emerges.the biological connection between father and child is unique and worthy of constitutional protection if the father grasps the opportunity to develop that biological connection into a full and enduring relationship.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the kelsey court held that civil code section,subdivision a now family code section and the related statutory scheme violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers to the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowing the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child best interest.if an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.absent such a showing,the child is presumptively best served by continuation of the father parental relationship.similarly,when the father has come forward to grasp his parental responsibilities,his parental rights are entitled to equal protection as those of the mother.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,first italics in original,second italics added,fn.omitted.
the kelsey court emphasized that the statutory scheme allowing termination of a natural father parental rights based only on the child best interest is constitutionally invalid only to the extent it is applied to an unwed father who has sufficiently and timely demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities.our statutes are constitutionally sufficient when applied to a father who has failed to make such a showing.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.thus,i f the trial court finds on remand that petitioner failed to demonstrate the required commitment to his parental responsibilities,that will be the end of the matter.he will not have suffered any deprivation of a constitutional right.if,however,the required commitment is found,the result under our constitutional analysis will necessarily be a decision that petitioner rights to equal protection and due process under the federal constitution were violated to the extent that he was deprived of the same statutory protections granted the mother,at,d.
kelsey makes clear that an unwed father parental rights are entitled to constitutional protection only if he demonstrates a full commitment to his parental responsibilities.if he carries his burden of proof,his parental rights may not be terminated absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.on the other hand,if he fails to carry his burden of proof,there is no constitutional impediment to the termination of his parental rights without a showing of unfitness.in adoption of michael cal th,d,our supreme court explained we held in kelsey that an unwed father who has no statutory right to block a third party adoption by withholding consent may nevertheless have a constitutional right to do so under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and thereby to preserve his opportunity to develop a parental relationship with his child.under such circumstances,however,the unwed father constitutional interest is merely inchoate citation and does not ripen into a constitutional right that he can assert to prevent adoption unless he proves that he has promptly come forward and demonstrate d a full commitment to his parental responsibilities citation.this is so because the mere existence of a biological link does not merit constitutional protection citation rather,the federal constitution protects only the parental relationship that the unwed father has actively developed by com ing forward to participate in the rearing of his child citation and act ing as a father citation.
section does not require an adjudication of unfitness 
respondents contend that section requires a guardianship,which in turn requires a finding that parental custody would be detrimental to the child,supported by clear and convincing evidence.respondents consider this finding of detriment to be equivalent to an adjudication of unfitness.
respondents reasoning is flawed.the court may appoint a guardian if it appears necessary or convenient to do so,subd.a.family code section,subdivision a,provides that,if the court grants custody to a nonparent over the objection of a parent,the court shall make a finding that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required to serve the best interest of the child.italics added.no finding of detriment is required where,as here,the parents consent to the guardianship even where a finding of detriment to the child is necessary because a parent objects to the guardianship,the finding does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents,subd.c.
respondents nevertheless maintain that,pursuant to in re cody th,d,a finding of detriment to the child under family code section is the functional equivalent of a finding of unfitness.the cody court declared that,in in re jasmon cal th,d,our supreme court reaffirmed that a finding of detriment to the child is the equivalent of a finding of unfitness with respect to the child involved.citation,at,d.
cody is distinguishable because it involved the termination of parental rights at the selection and implementation hearing in a dependency proceeding.the cody court observed that,b y the time termination is possible under our dependency statutes the danger to the child from parental unfitness is so well established that there is no longer reason to believe that positive,nurturing relationships exist citation,and the parens patriae interest of the state favoring preservation rather than severance of natural familial bonds has been extinguished.citation.in re cody,supra,th at,d,quoting from cynthia superior court cal th,d.
in any event,the amendment of family code section stats,ch,supersedes any suggestion in the cody decision that a finding of detriment under that section is equivalent to a finding of unfitness.the amendment added subdivision c,which,as previously noted,provides that a finding of detriment does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents.
section is not unconstitutional on its face 
appellant contends that section is unconstitutional on its face,in violation of substantive due process,because it allows the termination of parental rights in the absence of a finding of unfitness.appellant also contends that section is facially unconstitutional in violation of equal protection because it discriminates between parents whose children have not been placed in a guardianship and parents whose children have been in the physical custody of a guardian for two years or longer.
a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.citation.p etitioners must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.citations.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.the majority opinion in united states salerno,d explained the standard for reviewing facial constitutional challenges to statutes as follows.a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.city of vacaville pitamber th,d see also reno flores,d,to prevail in a facial challenge to a regulation,respondents must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the regulation would be valid people rodriguez th,d the general rule is that a statute must be incapable of constitutional application in any circumstance in order for it to be found facially invalid.
