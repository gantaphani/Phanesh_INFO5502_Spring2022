at issue here is whether a reviewing court is required to appoint counsel for an indigent parent on an appeal from a judgment freeing from parental custody and control a child who is not a dependent child of the juvenile court.the issue is one that we have previously noted without deciding in re bryce cal th,d,bryce,and on which the courts of appeal have published conflicting decisions compare in re curtis th,d curtis no right to appointed appellate counsel with appellate defenders,cheri th,d appellate defenders expressly disagreeing with curtis.
we conclude that any indigent parent appealing a judgment terminating parental rights in a proceeding to free a child from parental custody and control is entitled to counsel.this court so held in jacqueline,supra,cal d,and a thorough review of the legislative history of the statutory provision that is now family code section reveals no evidence of a legislative intent to restrict or abrogate that holding.although the statute on its face might appear to restrict the right to appointed appellate counsel to parents of juvenile court dependents,enforcement of that apparent limitation would render the statute a nullity because,since january,parental rights in juvenile court dependents are now terminated in juvenile court dependency proceedings under the welfare and institutions code rather than in proceedings under the family code to free a child from parental custody and control.to avoid rendering family code section entirely useless,we construe it as establishing a right to appointed appellate counsel for any indigent parent appealing from a judgment freeing a child from parental custody and control.
factual background 
on january,father,walter,petitioned under family code section for a judgment declaring his minor son,free from the custody and control of the son mother,jacqueline w.the father alleged that the mother had left the child in his custody since february,without supporting or communicating with the child.the superior court appointed counsel to represent the mother in the lawsuit.on december,family court services submitted an investigation report recommending that the superior court grant the petition.the superior court held a contested hearing that ended on april,after which the court announced its decision to declare the child free from the mother custody and control and to terminate her parental rights.on june,the court entered judgment,consistent with its announced decision,terminating the mother parental rights.
the mother appealed and requested appointment of appellate counsel under family code section,which requires a reviewing court to appoint counsel for an indigent parent u pon appeal from a judgment freeing a child who is a dependent child of the juvenile court from parental custody and control.on july,the court of appeal for the fifth appellate district by order appointed appellate counsel for the mother,but six days later the court vacated that order as improvidently granted,stating that because the child was not a juvenile court dependent,the mother did not have an automatic right to appellate counsel.the court allowed the mother to apply for appointed counsel by providing a financial declaration together with a written explanation of why she needed counsel and what issues she expected to raise on appeal.on august,the court denied the mother application for appointed counsel for lack of good cause shown.
the mother petitioned this court for review of the court of appeal order denying appointed counsel to represent her on her appeal from the judgment terminating her parental rights in her son.we granted her petition for review and appointed counsel to represent her in this court.
ii.legal background 
jacqueline 
in jacqueline,supra,cal d,a county adoption agency petitioned under former section of the civil code the predecessor of current section of the family code to terminate a mother parental rights in her daughter.the superior court appointed an attorney to represent the mother,who was indigent.after a contested hearing,the court granted the petition and entered a judgment terminating the mother parental rights.the mother appointed trial attorney helped her file a notice of appeal and then withdrew from the case.jacqueline,supra,at.
when the mother failed to submit an opening brief,the court of appeal dismissed her appeal.the mother then requested that the court of appeal vacate the dismissal and appoint counsel to represent her.after the court of appeal denied her request,this court granted her petition for hearing.jacqueline,supra,cal d at.
in a unanimous opinion,we held that a reviewing court is required to appoint counsel for any indigent parent appealing from an order terminating parental rights pursuant to civil code former section.jacqueline,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted,italics added.we concluded that the right to appellate counsel was implicit in the legislature entire statutory scheme for the removal of children from the custody and control of their parents.id.at.more particularly,we construed former section of the civil code expressly providing for appointment of trial counsel for indigent parents in proceedings to remove children from their custody and control and former section of the civil code describing the effect of a judgment freeing a minor from a parent custody and control as implicitly giving indigent parents a right to appointment of appellate counsel.jacqueline,supra,at.
enactment of former section of the civil code 
in,some six years after this court decision in jacqueline,supra,cal d,the legislature enacted former section of the civil code.stats,ch.it provided upon appeal from a judgment freeing a minor who is a dependent child of the juvenile court from parental custody and control,the appellate court shall appoint counsel for the appellant as provided by this section.upon motion by the appellant and a finding that the appellant is unable to afford counsel,the appellate court shall appoint counsel for the indigent appellant,and appellant counsel shall be provided a free copy of the reporter and clerk transcript.all of those costs shall be a charge against the state.italics added see now,subds.a,b.
modification of procedure for terminating parental rights in dependent children of the juvenile court 
in,as part of a comprehensive revision of laws affecting children,the legislature modified the procedure for terminating parental rights in dependent children of the juvenile court.the legislature eliminated the need to file a separate civil action pursuant to civil code former section to terminate parental rights and provided that all termination proceedings for children who are dependents of the court are to be heard in the juvenile court as part of the regular review process.in re marilyn cal th,d,italics added discussing stats,ch,see welf.the new scheme applies to children adjudged dependent on or after january.in re marilyn,supra,at,d.
enactment of the family code 
in,the legislature enacted the family code,with an effective date of january.stats,ch,et in the process,the legislature repealed the sections of the civil code governing actions to free a child from parental custody and control stats,ch,and reenacted these provisions without substantive change as family code section and following stats,ch.with one minor,nonsubstantive change,the legislature reenacted the text of former section of the civil code,concerning appointment of appellate counsel for an indigent parent in such proceedings,as family code section.the legislature amended this section in stats,ch,and stats,ch,but the amendments are not relevant to the issue we consider here.
in,the court of appeal for the fifth appellate district decided curtis,supra,th,d,in which a child maternal grandparents obtained a judgment under former section of the civil code freeing the child from his father custody and control.on the father appeal from the judgment terminating his parental rights,the court of appeal initially granted his request for appointment of counsel,but later it revoked the appointment,holding that an indigent parent appealing from a judgment freeing a child from the parent custody and control does not have a right to appellate counsel if the child is not a dependent child of the juvenile court.curtis,supra,at,d.the court recognized that in jacqueline,supra,cal d,this court had construed the statutory scheme as implicitly requiring a reviewing court to appoint counsel for any indigent parent appealing from a judgment freeing a child from parental custody and control curtis,supra,at,d,but the court of appeal took the position that the legislature,by its enactment of former section of the civil code later repealed and reenacted without substantive change as family code section,had restrict ed a parent right to appointed appellate counsel to situations in which the child who was freed from parental custody was a dependent child of the juvenile court.curtis,supra,at,d,italics added.the court further held that this restriction did not violate the constitutional equal protection or due process rights of parents of nondependent children.id.at,d.
appellate defenders 
in june,the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district,division one,decided appellate defenders,supra,th,d,in which a father had petitioned under family code section to declare his daughters free from their mother custody and control.his wife separately petitioned under family code section for a stepparent adoption without the mother consent.the indigent mother opposed both petitions,and the superior court appointed an attorney to represent her at the consolidated trial.the superior court denied the father petition,but it granted the stepmother adoption petition,and in that proceeding it terminated the mother parental rights.the mother appealed and requested appointment of appellate counsel.appellate defenders,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal granted the mother request for appointed appellate counsel.in its opinion,the appellate defenders court expressly disagreed with curtis,supra,th,d.examining the legislative history of the enactment of former section of the civil code later repealed and reenacted without substantive change as family code section,the court found no intent by the legislature to abrogate or restrict the right to appellate counsel established by jacqueline,supra,cal d.appellate defenders,supra,th at,d.the analyses prepared for the senate and assembly committees on the judiciary stated that the legislature intended in former section of the civil code to codify the holding of jacqueline,and t he reference to dependent child likely resulted from the legislature concern at that time for the inordinate delay and expense of continuing children in foster care pending finality of their cases.appellate defenders,supra,at,d.the court observed that,since the revision of the juvenile dependency laws,the termination of parental rights of dependent children no longer proceeds under the civil code,but follows the comprehensive dependency scheme under welfare and institutions code section et,while actions to terminate parental rights in nondependent children continue under the family code provisions for freedom from parental custody and control,et and for adoption,et.appellate defenders,supra,at,d.the court concluded that the reasoning expressed in jacqueline continues to apply id.at,and that the right to appointed counsel would be a hollow one if it were limited to trial id.at,d.
in december,this court interpreted family code section in bryce,supra,cal th,d.there,a child stepfather petitioned the superior court under the family code for a judgment freeing the child from his father custody and control.the superior court denied the petition after finding that the father had not abandoned the child.on the stepfather appeal,the court of appeal for the fifth appellate district refused to appoint counsel to represent the indigent father.we granted the father petition for review of this order.
the issue in this court was whether,on appeal from a judgment refusing to free a child from a parent custody and control,an appellate court was required under family code section to appoint appellate counsel for an indigent parent who was a respondent on the appeal.bryce,supra,cal th at,d.this court concluded that family code section requires appellate courts to appoint counsel only for parents appealing a judgment freeing a child from their custody and control,and thus a respondent was not entitled,as of right,to appointed counsel,although an appellate court retained discretion to appoint counsel for a respondent whenever the appearance of counsel may reasonably affect whether parental rights are terminated.bryce,supra,at,d,but see also id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of kennard.
at the outset,this court acknowledged that proceedings under the family code to free a child from parental custody and control are immensely important to the parent because a judgment granting a petition terminates all parental rights in the child.bryce,supra,cal th at,d.this court also acknowledged that in jacqueline,supra,cal d,it had construed the statutory scheme as impliedly requiring a reviewing court to appoint counsel for any indigent parent appealing from an order terminating parental rights bryce,supra,at,d.
noting that the legislature enacted civil code former section,later reenacted as family code section,a few years after our decision in jacqueline,supra,cal d,this court in bryce reviewed legislative history materials relating to that provision.we then concluded that t he legislative language and history both demonstrate an intent to require counsel for appellants,but not necessarily for respondents.bryce,supra,cal th at,d.this court added substantial reasons explain and justify a statute granting counsel to all appellants whose parental rights have been terminated but not to all respondents whose rights have not been terminated.an appellant whose rights have been terminated has the burden to perfect the appeal,and to identify and argue points of error to try to overturn a presumptively valid judgment.citation.the rationale of jacqueline,supra,cal d at page,was that indigent parents should have the right to an effective appeal,not just any appeal,which requires an attorney.italics in original.the quoted language was also quoted in the bill analyses of both the senate and assembly committees on the judiciary.although counsel is certainly useful,and sometimes vital,to a respondent,this argument has less force when the parent is defending a favorable judgment,and the presumptions favor the respondent.ibid.having concluded that the father was not entitled to appellate counsel as of right because he was the respondent on the appeal,this court in bryce expressly declined to decide whether the child must be a dependent child of the court for counsel to be required.id.at,d.the matter was remanded so the court of appeal could exercise its discretion and determine whether to appoint counsel to represent the father under the standards articulated.
iii.discussion 
our task is to interpret family code section to determine whether it requires reviewing courts to appoint appellate counsel for an indigent parent appealing from a judgment freeing a child from parental custody and control and terminating parental rights when the child is not a juvenile court dependent.our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.hunt superior court cal th,d,accord,people gardeley cal th,d.we consider first the words of the statute becau
