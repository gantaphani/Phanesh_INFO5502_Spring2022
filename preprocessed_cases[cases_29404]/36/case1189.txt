do the statutory provisions broadly empowering the juvenile court to make any reasonable order for the care and supervision of a dependent child include the authority to order a child who acknowledges a prior problem to submit to a drug test if the staff of the group home in which she resides believes she is under the influence of drugs if the juvenile court is statutorily authorized to order a dependent child to submit to drug testing,is that authority consistent with the child fundamental right of privacy protected by article,section of the california constitution we conclude the answer to both questions is yes and accordingly deny carmen petition for a writ of mandate directing respondent los angeles superior court to vacate its order requiring her to submit to drug testing upon request by the staff of the david margaret home.
factual and procedural background 
carmen original contact with the department of children and family services and the voluntary services agreements 
carmen,the mother of carmen,entered into a voluntary family maintenance agreement under welfare institutions code section with the los angeles county department of children and family services department in april after the department learned that carmen had physically abused carmen by using an extension cord to discipline her.the department investigation also revealed carmen had been suspended from school on repeated occasions for smoking marijuana on school property,was failing all of her classes and was drinking alcohol and expressing suicidal ideations.carmen stated she was overwhelmed by carmen behavior and requested assistance.
on april,an counselor helped carmen enroll in an program.on june,carmen tested positive for methamphetamines and marijuana.the department recommended carmen be placed in a residential treatment facility,but carmen failed to cooperate with that plan.on july,the family preservation program cancelled its services to carmen and carmen because of carmen continued drug use and suicidal ideation and carmen inability to meet her daughter needs,on the same date carmen and the department agreed to a voluntary family reunification plan that included carmen placement at the david margaret home for girls.
carmen left the group home without permission on august,returning two days later under the influence of drugs.after that incident,however,carmen behavior improved dramatically.carmen was placed in the home recovery program turner cottage,which included random drug testing.carmen had no positive drug tests while in turner cottage and no serious behavior problems.indeed,the group home progress report for the period from october to january states carmen performed at the gold level in the home point system,did well in school,held a job and served as a positive role model for her peers.
the section petition and the combined hearing 
after six months of voluntary period specified by section advised the department she was incapable of properly caring for carmen,specifically with regard to her problem.for her part,carmen refused to go home,explaining,i feel that if i go home now,that i will fall back to my old ways and will lose everything i have worked hard for.i would like to continue with school and continue to stay away from drugs.on january,the department filed a petition to declare carmen a dependent child of the court under section,subdivisions a serious physical harm and b failure to protect based on the incident of physical abuse disclosed during the department original investigation of the family in april and the fact that voluntary services provided by the department had been ineffective in resolving the family problems.
at the detention hearing on january,the juvenile court found a prima facie case for detaining carmen had been established and vested temporary placement and custody of carmen with the department pending disposition or further order of the court.the court ordered family reunification services for carmen and allowed unmonitored visitation including overnight and weekend visits.
the juvenile court held a combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing on january.the court sustained the petition and found carmen is an individual described by section,subdivisions a and b the court further found by clear and convincing evidence that substantial danger exists to the physical health of carmen that she is suffering severe emotional damage in the home of her mother and that there is no reasonable means to protect carmen without removal from her mother physical custody,subd.b.accordingly,the court ordered carmen suitably placed.carmen waived family reunification services,subd.b and the court denied reunification services to carmen alleged father pursuant to section,subdivision a.because the court found that carmen is not adoptable and there is no one willing to be her legal guardian,the court did not set a permanency planning hearing under section and instead immediately ordered as carmen permanent plan a planned permanent living arrangement with the david margaret home for girls with a specific goal of emancipation.the court set july,as the likely date by which carmen will achieve her specific goal.
the march,progress hearing and the order 
at the disposition hearing the juvenile court ordered a case management meeting be held within days to discuss carmen placement,education,services and activities.a further court hearing was scheduled for march,to assess carmen progress.the hearing to review carmen permanent plan was scheduled for july.
the case management meeting concerning carmen was held on february.carmen became upset when her behavior was addressed during the meeting and left the room.however,her attorney remained and continued to advocate on her behalf.at the meeting the department social worker,carmen residential life therapist and carmen all agreed it would benefit carmen to continue to undergo random drug tests to help her remain drug free.carmen attorney disagreed as to the need for mandated drug tests.
in connection with the progress hearing on march,the court received a march,letter from carmen case manager at the david margaret home,which noted that carmen had no positive drug screens while in the turner cottage recovery program.the letter also reported that carmen has since moved on to tarr cottage,the emancipation program.nonetheless,the case manager stated that carmen recovery is ongoing and will be something carmen will have to continually work at.it is my opinion that it would be beneficial at this time for carmen to submit to random drug screening on a regular basis.random drug screening will assist carmen in remaining committed and honest with her on going recovery.additional information submitted for the progress hearing indicated carmen was attending individual counseling once a week,group therapy four times a week and an alcoholics anonymous meeting once a week and had completed an independent living course at citrus college.in its interim review report the department also recommended that the court order carmen to submit to random drug tests to ensure and assist in a successful drug recovery.
at the march,hearing itself,in response to the court request for comments on carmen progress,her counsel stated,i am opposed to the drug testing.i could argue,if the court inclined,but i would just note that there no statutory authority.the court replied,i like her to test for the next days just so that i can see she is clean and sober because if she relapses,even though i ca make her test,it just going to ruin her total life.accordingly,the court ordered carmen to submit to an test if they the staff at the group home have reason to believe that she under the influence.so long as you appear clean and sober,they not going to test you.if it appears you impaired,i going to give them permission to test you,okay the court minute order for march,states,minor to test on demand if requeste d.
counsel for carmen objected on the record and asked the court to explain the legal basis for the order.the court indicated it believed it had the authority to enter the order to protect carmen recovery and invited counsel to file a writ petition to challenge the order if she believed that was appropriate.although carmen counsel asked to make a further record of her objections,the court said,you already stated them,and terminated the hearing.the court,however,indicated counsel could remain until the end of the court calendar to pursue the matter,something that apparently was not possible because the attorney had a conflicting engagement.
carmen filed a petition for writ of mandate,prohibition or other appropriate relief on march,requesting that we issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the juvenile court to vacate its order of march,requiring carmen to submit to drug testing and also requesting an immediate stay of the march,order.on april,we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted and stayed the order that carmen submit to drug testing.
contentions 
carmen contends the juvenile court lacked statutory authority to order her to submit to drug testing if the staff at the group home where she resides believes she is under the influence of drugs even if authorized,the order violates her fundamental right to privacy protected by the california constitution and the juvenile court violated her due process rights by curtailing her counsel attempt to make a complete record of her objections to the order.
discussion 
the juvenile court is authorized to order drug testing if reasonably related to protecting a dependent child safety or 
when a child has been declared a dependent of the juvenile court,the court is expressly authorized to make any and all reasonable orders for the care,supervision,custody,conduct,maintenance,and support of the child,including medical treatment,subd.a.in addition,if it is necessary to remove a child from the custody of his or her parent or guardian,the legislature has directed the juvenile court to secure for the child custody,care,and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents,subd.a.these general provisions have been broadly interpreted to authorize a wide variety of remedial orders intended to protect the safety and of dependent children see in re jose d.the juvenile court has broad discretion to determine what would best serve and protect the child interest and to fashion a dispositional order in accordance with this discretion.citations.the court determination in this regard will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion.and would appear sufficiently comprehensive to include an order for continued drug testing of a dependent child who has admitted a problem.see generally in re christopher th,d court did not abuse its discretion by ordering father to submit to drug or alcohol testing.indeed,it is difficult to conjure any reason why an order requiring a dependent child to attend weekly psychotherapy sessions would be authorized by these fairly standard order notwithstanding its potential for intrusion into the child private thoughts and feelings see,melinda superior court th,d dependent child ordered to participate in individual counseling to address and abandonment issues in re th,d discussing individual therapy for the children and an order to drug test would not.certainly safeguarding a dependent child physical health is no less significant a concern for the juvenile court than protecting his or her mental health.
implicitly acknowledging the authority of the juvenile court under section,subdivision a,to enter orders in the best interest of dependent children,including specifically orders necessary to address issues of health,carmen challenge to the statutory basis for the court order is not directed to that provision at all,but rather focuses on section and what carmen insists that section fails to provide.section authorizes the juvenile court to order a minor who appears to be a danger to himself or herself or to others as a result of the use of narcotics or a restricted dangerous drug to be taken to a facility for treatment and evaluation,par.if it is concluded that a the minor is not a danger to himself or herself or to others as a result of the use of drugs,b the minor does not require intensive treatment,or c the minor has been certified for not more than days of intensive treatment and the certification is terminated,then the minor shall be released if the juvenile court proceedings have been dismissed referred for further care and treatment on a voluntary basis,subject to the disposition of the juvenile court proceedings or returned to the juvenile court,in which event the court shall proceed with the case pursuant to this chapter,par.
carmen quite properly asserts section itself does not support the juvenile court order.there was no evidence and no finding carmen is currently a danger to herself or others as a result of drug use.in fact,the record supports the conclusion carmen is no longer using drugs at all.however,carmen further argument that the reference in section to further care and treatment on a voluntary basis italics added demonstrates the legislature intent to preclude the juvenile court from ordering a dependent child to submit to drug treatment or drug testing other than as specifically described in the statute is simply incorrect.at the conclusion of the evaluation and treatment period prescribed by section,whether or not a referral for further,voluntary treatment has been made,the dependant child is returned to the juvenile court unless the dependency proceedings have been dismissed,which is then directed to proceed with the case pursuant to this chapter.thus,whether or not a child has been evaluated under section,the juvenile court at disposition and thereafter retains its its section,subdivision a,to make all orders reasonably necessary for the care of the child.
carmen also notes that section,which specifically authorizes the juvenile court to order certain children within its jurisdiction under the delinquency statutes by virtue of a petition filed under or to submit as a condition of probation to alcohol and drug testing at the request of a peace officer or probation officer,has no counterpart in the dependency provisions of the welfare institutions code in addition,section mandates that the juvenile court require completion of an alcohol or drug education program if the offense upon which a wardship determination was based involved the unlawful possession,use or sale of a controlled substance.carmen argues the lack of parallel provisions in the dependency statutes demonstrates the legislature intent to limit mandatory drug testing to delinquency cases.
carmen position with respect to the legislature purportedly different treatment of drug testing and drug treatment under the dependency and delinquency laws suffers from several flaws.initially,that the legislature required the juvenile court to order participation in and completion of a drug education program for all minors who committed crimes involving the unlawful use or sale of controlled substances provides no guidance as to the court discretion in either dependency or delinquency cases to order drug testing when it determines such testing will protect or promote the safety or of a child properly within its jurisdiction.
in addition,although we need not determine whether the juvenile court would be permitted to impose the specific condition of probation described in section in the absence of express statutory authority that provision is distinguishable from the court order at issue in the case at bar in two fundamental respects.first,section applies only when a child has been found to be a person described in section or and the court does not remove the minor from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.that is,in situations in which the court has not ordered the care,custody and control of the child to be under the supervision of a probation officer for placement in the home of a relative or nonrelative extended family member,community care facility or more restrictive camp or detention setting,the juvenile court is nonetheless authorized to condition the child continued residence with his or her parents on drug testing.in the case at bar,in contrast,carmen has been removed from the custody of her mother for placement by the department and the department and the group home where she resides both endorse continued drug testing.
second,requiring a child under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to submit to drug or alcohol testing at the request of a police officer or probation officer,with the attendant risk of additional delinquency court or penal consequences for a failed test,is far different from drug testing as part of an treatment program.see,in re kacy th,d condition of probation under is designed to detect the presence of substances whose use by minors is unlawful.because the testing condition relates to criminal conduct and is reasonably related to future criminality,its imposition is within the juvenile court discretion.the legislature express authorization for drug testing as part of an program does not indicate its view as to the propriety of a therapeutic requirement or otherwise serve to diminish the juvenile court broad statutory authority to make all orders reasonably needed to protect the health and safety of dependent children within its jurisdiction.see manduley superior court cal th,d,court properly seeks to harmonize general and specific statutes on similar subjects to effectuate the purposes of both provisions garcia mccutchen cal th,d,if we can reasonably harmonize t wo statutes dealing with the same subject,then we must give concurrent effect to both,even though one is specific and the other general.citations.
properly limited drug testing does not violate a dependent child fundamental right of privacy 
drug testing and a minor constitutional right to privacy 
without question,drug testing of dependent children implicates those individuals right to privacy,protected by article i,section of the california constitution hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d,hill plaintiffs correctly assert that the ncaa drug testing program impacts legally protected privacy interests.loder city of glendale cal th,d,city requirement that all job applicants submit to urinalysis drug testing as part of a preemployment medical examination unquestionably implicates privacy interests protected by the state constitution.see american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d,academy of pediatrics t here can be no question but that minors,as well as adults,possess a constitutional right of privacy under the california constitution.see also board of ed.of independent school dist.of pottawatomie cty.earls,d public school district requirement for all students participating in extracurricular activities does not violate fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures or impermissibly invade students federal constitutional right to privacy vernonia school dist.acton,d suspicionless drug testing of public school athletes does not violate federal constitution.
in hill,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered a challenge under the state constitutional right to privacy to the national collegiate athletic association ncaa program for student athletes engaged in intercollegiate competition the ncaa program,which involved observation of urination and disclosure of medical information,implicated both autonomy interest in freedom from observation in performing a function recognized by social norms as private,and informational interest in limiting disclosure of confidential information about bodily condition.id.at,d.nonetheless,the court rejected the proposition that every assertion of a privacy interest under article i,section,must be overcome by a compelling interest and explained,the particular context,the specific kind of privacy interest involved and the nature and seriousness of the invasion and any countervailing interests,remains the critical factor in the analysis.where the case involves an obvious invasion of an interest fundamental to personal autonomy,freedom from involuntary sterilization or the freedom to pursue consensual familial relationships,a compelling interest must be present to overcome the vital privacy interest.if,in contrast,the privacy interest is less central or in bona fide dispute,general balancing tests are employed.id.at,d.with respect to the privacy interests implicated by the program at issue in hill,the supreme court determined that a general balancing test,rather than a compelling interest test,was applicable.id.at,d.similarly,the preemployment urinalysis drug testing at issue in loder city of glendale,supra,cal th at pages,d,was analyzed under a general balancing standard.in marked contrast,in academy of pediatrics,supra,cal th at pages,d,which involved a constitutional challenge to legislation requiring either parental consent or judicial authorization before a pregnant minor could obtain an abortion,the court held the statute was subject to scrutiny under the compelling interest standard because it intruded upon an interest fundamental to personal autonomy.
under the general balancing approach utilized in hill,supra,cal th,d,and loder city of glendale,supra,cal th,d,the identification of the legally recognized privacy interests at stake is the beginning,not the end,of the analysis.hill,at,d,see loder,at,d.the court must weigh the justification for the conduct in question against the intrusion on privacy resulting from the conduct in any case that raises,as does the matter at bar,a genuine,nontrivial invasion of a protected privacy interest central to that evaluation is a recognition of the context in which the allegedly invasive conduct occurs.see hill,at,d,student athletes reasonable expectations of privacy must be viewed within the context of intercollegiate athletic activity and the normal conditions under which it is undertaken see also vernonia school dist.acton,supra,at.the most significant element in this case is the first we discussed that the policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government responsibilities,under a public school system,as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care.board of ed.of independent school dist.of pottawatomie cty.earls,supra,at.the context of the public school environment serves as the backdrop for the analysis of the privacy interest at stake and the reasonableness of the drug testing policy in general.
carmen status as both a minor and a dependent child of the juvenile court is fundamental to our determination whether drug testing violates her right to privacy.although carmen,like all minors,enjoys a right of privacy protected by the california constitution,the scope and application of that constitutional right differs significantly from the rights enjoyed by adults.academy of pediatrics,supra,cal th at,d,planned parenthood of missouri danforth,d the state interest in protecting a young person from harm justifies the imposition of restraints on his or her freedom even though comparable restraints on adults would be constitutionally impermissible.thus,in most instances a parent has the legal right to act on behalf of his or her child,including authorizing a medical procedure or test,to protect the child health and as a general matter,parents during a child minority have the legal right and obligation to act on behalf of their child to protect their child rights and interests,and in most instances this general rule would apply to interests of the minor that are protected by the state constitutional right of privacy as well as to other rights and interests of the minor.thus,for example,although past cases have established that the state constitutional right of privacy generally guarantees an individual right to consent to,or refuse to consent to,medical treatment or medication citations,we believe it is clear that,at least with respect to most medical treatment relating to a minor,the legislature may grant a parent the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of his or her child.no one reasonably could suggest that a serious state constitutional privacy question would be presented,for example,whenever a parent,over a child objection,requires the child to go to the dentist or to take his or her medicine.academy of pediatrics,at,d.
