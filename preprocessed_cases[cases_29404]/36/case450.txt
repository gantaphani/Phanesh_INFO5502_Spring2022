our opinions filed february,are hereby withdrawn,and new lead opinion by judge fernandez,a concurring opinion by judge mckeown,and a dissenting opinion by judge filed simultaneously herewith.
judges fernandez and mckeown voted to otherwise deny the petition for rehearing.judge kleinfeld would grant that petition.the full court was advised of the petition for rehearing en banc.a judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.the matter failed to receive a majority of the votes of the nonrecused active judges in favor of en banc consideration.fed.
the petitions for rehearing and for rehearing en banc are,therefore,denied.
eudene eunique was denied a passport because she was severely in arrears on her child support payments.she brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief on the theory that the statute and regulation authorizing that denial were unconstitutional.see k a.the district granted summary judgment against her,and she appealed.we affirm.
background 
when eunique marriage was dissolved,her husband was awarded custody of the children,and she was ordered to pay child support.she failed to pay the ordered amounts,and by she was in arrears in an amount over.thereafter,the arrearage continued to grow despite the fact that she is unable or unwilling to pay her child support obligations,she desires to travel internationally for both business and pleasure,including visiting a sister in mexico 
eunique applied for a passport,but by that time california had certified to the secretary of health and human services that she owed arrearages of child support in an amount exceeding.k.congress has provided federal funds to help the states collect child support but has required that there be a state plan for child support which must include a procedure for certifying to the secretary determinations that individuals owe arrearages of child support in an amount exceeding.there is no dispute that california has adopted a procedure and that it followed the procedure in this case.
the secretary of health and human services received that certification and was required by law to transmit it to the secretary of state for action.k.that was accomplished here.the law then directed that t he secretary of state shall,upon certification,refuse to issue a passport to the individual in question.k.the regulations adopted by the secretary of state provide that 
a passport,except for direct return to the united states,shall not be issued in any case in which the secretary of state determines or is informed by competent authority that 
the applicant has been certified by the secretary of health and human services as notified by a state agency under k to be in arrears of child support in an amount exceeding.
a.thus,the regulation tracks the statutory language,and really adds nothing to it.
as a result of the statutory and regulatory requirements,eunique was denied a passport.in her view,that denial was unconstitutional,so this action ensued.the district court ruled against her and she appeals.

discussion 
eunique argues that there is an insufficient connection between her breach of the duty to pay for the support of her children,and the government interference with her right to international travel.thus,she argues,her constitutional rights have been violated.we disagree.
eunique asserts that she has a constitutional right to international travel,which is so fundamental that it can be restricted for only the most important reasons,and by a narrowly tailored statute.it is undoubtedly true that there is a constitutional right to international travel.see kent dulles,d.however,as the supreme court has said,the right of international travel has been considered to be no more than an aspect of the liberty protected by the due process clause of the fifth amendment.as such this right,the court has held,can be regulated within the bounds of due process.haig agee,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also zemel rusk,d aptheker sec y of state,d.in that respect,it differs from t he constitutional right of interstate travel which is virtually unqualified.haig,at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the difference means that we do not apply strict scrutiny to restrictions on international travel rights that do not implicate first amendment concerns.
at an early point in the development of supreme court jurisprudence in this area,the court seemed to suggest that restrictions upon travel must be looked upon with a jaded eye.see aptheker,at.at.however,it was then dealing with a law which touched on first amendment concerns because it keyed on mere association.id.at.at.the court has not been as troubled in cases which do not directly involve those concerns.see haig,at.at zemel,at.at.rather,as i see it,the court has suggested that rational basis review should be applied.
when confronted with legislation which denied supplemental security income benefits to people who were outside of the country,the court commented that legislation which was said to infringe the right to international travel was not to be judged by the same standard applied to laws that penalized the right to interstate travel.califano aznavorian,d.it is enough,said the court,if the provision is rationally based.id.at.at.i recognize that because the ssi statute did not directly regulate passports,califano is not directly applicable here,but it indicates that the court does not apply the restrictive form of review advocated by eunique.moreover,the same theme appears in haig,at.at,where,again,the court decided that regulation was appropriate within the bounds of due process.
we have reified those supreme court emanations.in freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir,we held that,g iven the lesser importance of freedom to travel abroad,the government need only advance a rational,or at most an important,reason for imposing the ban.the district of columbia circuit has read the supreme court tea leaves in the same way.as it has noted,international travel is no more than an aspect of liberty that is subject to reasonable government regulation within the bounds of due process,whereas interstate travel is a fundamental right subject to a more exacting standard.hutchins dist.of columbia,because,as i see it,rational basis review is the proper standard,the statute is constitutional if there is a reasonable fit between governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose.reno flores,d.thus,we must presume k to be valid,and we must uphold it if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.rodriguez cook,cir.
the statute easily passes that test.there can be no doubt that the failure of parents to support their children is recognized by our society as a serious offense against morals and welfare.it is in violation of important social duties and is subversive of good order.braunfeld brown,d.it is the very kind of problem that the legislature can address.
moreover,the economic problems caused by parents who fail to provide support for their children are both well known and widespread.they can be exacerbated when the parent is out of the state,as,of course,a parent traveling internationally must be.indeed,even within the united states itself,the problem is serious.that is one reason that we have upheld the constitutionality of the child support recovery act of,which actually criminalizes the failure of an parent to pay child support,once having fallen as far behind as eunique has.see united states mussari,cir we did that,by the way,over objections that commerce was not involved,but that congress was seeking to regulate a fundamental familial relation.id.so serious a problem was it,we were not deterred by the argument that family issues should be left to the states,but,rather,noted that 
respect for the competency of the states in matters of domestic relations is not disparaged but manifested when the states are confronted with interstate impediments to the fulfillment of domestic duties that the courts of the states have imposed,and the states find themselves,if not helpless,at least gravely impaired in pursuing the delinquent debts.
id.at.that is true in this case also international travel by what our society often calls deadbeat parents presents even more difficulties because the united states can not easily reach them once they have left the country.
congress also has financial concerns because unsupported children must often look to the public fisc,including the federal treasury,for financial sustenance.that was an impetus for the enactment with which we now deal it is the reason that the child support enforcement program,was enacted in the first place,and was quite properly upheld by the tenth circuit,despite attacks on various constitutional grounds,not including the ground that we consider here.see kansas united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
all of this not only illustrates the rationality of congress goal,but also demonstrates its rational connection to the passport denial in question.surely it makes sense to assure that those who do not pay their child support obligations remain within the country,where they can be reached by our processes in an at least relatively easy way.notably,even when the court iterated the constitutional right to travel in kent,at.at,it,without disapproval,took notice of a policy of denying passports to those who were trying to escape the toils of the law or engaging in conduct which would violate the laws of the united states.a person who fails to pay child support may well attempt to escape the toils of the law by going abroad,and may even be violating the laws of the united states.see,see also code.
moreover,if a parent,like eunique,truly wishes to partake of the joys and benefits of international travel,k does have the effect of focusing that person mind on a more important need to support one children first.it doubtless encourages parents to do their duty to family.in short,the statute passes rational basis review with flying colors the second circuit,by the way,agrees with our conclusion.weinstein albright,cir.
conclusion 
eunique has failed to live up to a most basic civic and even moral responsibility the provision of support to her own children.yet she has brought this action because she feels that her right to the pleasures and benefits of international travel has been improperly curtailed.unfortunately for her,congress has decreed that her duties to her children must take precedence over her international travel plans.it has ordered her priorities for her.
we hold that,without violating eunique fifth amendment freedom to travel internationally,congress and the state department can refuse to let her have a passport as long as she remains in substantial arrears on her child support obligations she is free to be a worker in the vineyards of the law,or to be a worker in another field,or,if she likes,to be a faniente,but the constitution does not require that she be given a passport at this time 
that the right to travel abroad is an important one is beyond dispute.the supreme court has not,however,declared international travel to be a fundamental right.indeed,the court has never mandated strict scrutiny review,but rather has pointedly distinguished between international travel and interstate travel.califano aznavorian,d holding that interstate travel is virtually unqualified in contrast to international travel which is no more than an aspect of the liberty protected by the due process clause.as a consequence,considering the nature of the right to travel internationally,in my view intermediate scrutiny comes the closest to being the proper standard when first amendment concerns are not implicated.therefore,i concur in the result of judge fernandez opinion because i conclude that the statute passes muster under intermediate scrutiny.
securing the payment of child support for minor children is surely both an important and substantial government interest.considering that enforcement often becomes illusory once the parent leaves the country,the passport restriction makes perfect sense.significantly,the restriction is not absolute.eunique,a lawyer,could simply pay the support.doing so would not implicate any first amendment or other fundamental right.also,the procedure for state certification to the federal government of delinquent child support apparently permits waiver of the restriction for business purposes and family emergencies.eunique has not even attempted to avail herself of the regulatory safe harbor eunique right to international travel,although protected under the due process clause,is not absolute.accordingly,the restriction imposed here was carefully considered and should be upheld.
to understand the development of the jurisprudence in the travel arena,it is instructive to take a short chronological tour of the key supreme court cases and our circuit cases.the seminal case of kent dulles,d,considered regulations relating to the issuance of passports to communists.the court explained that t he right to travel is part of the liberty of which the citizen can not be deprived without the due process of law under the fifth amendment.id.at.it went on to elaborate that t ravel abroad,like travel within the country,may be necessary for a livelihood.it may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats,or wears,or reads.freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values.id.at.in the end,however,the court did not reach the constitutional question instead,it decided the case based on the scope of the secretary of state regulatory authority.id.at.
the court next addressed international travel in a challenge to section of the subversive activities control act,which denied passports to communists.aptheker secretary of state,d.concluding that the act was unconstitutional on its face because it swept too widely and too indiscriminately across the liberty guaranteed in the fifth amendment and was not narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil,id.at,the court pointed out that congress had less drastic measures at its disposal to safeguard national security.id.at.
just one year later,in zemel rusk,d,the court upheld the constitutionality of travel restrictions to cuba because the regulations were supported by the weightiest considerations of national security.significantly,the court distinguished kent because it dealt with passport denial based on political beliefs or associations.id.at.referring to kent,the court observed that the fact that a liberty can not be inhibited without due process of law does not mean that it can under no circumstances be inhibited.id.at.
more than ten years after zemel,in aznavorian,at,the court considered an aspect of a government benefits program that suspended payment to recipients who were absent from the united states for more than thirty days.the court rejected aznavorian argument that the suspension of benefits impermissibly infringed her right to travel internationally and should be subject to heightened scrutiny.id.at.after discussing kent,aptheker,and zemel,the court observed that there were crucial differences between the right to interstate travel,which is virtually unqualified,and international travel,which is no more than an aspect of the liberty protected by the due process clause.id.at.concluding that the right to international travel could be regulated within the bounds of due process,the court held that legislation which is said to infringe on the freedom to travel abroad is not to be judged by the same standard applied to laws that penalize the right of interstate travel.id.at.ultimately,the court upheld the provision,which had an incidental effect on a protected liberty and was rationally based.id.at.
finally,the supreme court had occasion to tie these cases together in haig agee,d,when it held that former cia agent philip agee passport could be revoked because his efforts to expose intelligence agents posed a threat to national security.although agee attempted to invoke the authority of kent,the court distinguished aptheker and kent on the grounds that those cases involved beliefs rather than conduct.id.at.the protection accorded beliefs standing alone is very different from the protection accorded conduct.
as to agee freedom to travel argument,the court acknowledged that a passport revocation undeniably curtail ed travel.id.at.nonetheless,t he freedom to travel abroad is subordinate to national security and foreign policy consideration as such,it is subject to reasonable government regulation.id.the court then quoted aznavorian for the proposition that freedom to travel abroad is not protected to the same extent as freedom to travel within the id.
following the teachings of these cases,we have addressed international travel on two occasions.the issue was raised in causey pan am.world airways,in re aircrash in bali,indonesia on april,cir,in the context of the warsaw convention.the panel held that because the plaintiffs had a statutory remedy available under the tucker act,the case should be heard by the court of claims.id.at.although the panel used the phrase fundamental right in referencing international travel,it stated that r estrictions on international travel must be carefully tailored to serve a substantial and legitimate government interest.id.at.this approach is more appropriately characterized as something less than strict scrutiny and more akin to intermediate scrutiny.see,craig boren,d the restriction must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.
following causey,we decided freedom to travel campaign newcomb,cir.although freedom to travel referenced the supreme court jurisprudence in this area,it did not discuss the causey decision.id.at.commenting on travel restrictions to cuba,we characterized the government goal of restricting hard currency into cuba as important,substantial,and even vital.id.at.freedom to travel equivocates that the proper test is rational basis,or at most intermediate,scrutiny g iven the lesser importance of this freedom to travel abroad,the government need only advance a rational,or at most an important,reason for restricting international travel.id.but in using the terms important and substantial interest,it also mirrors causey language of a substantial reason,thus easily supporting an intermediate scrutiny standard.
given the importance of international in a global economy and an interdependent recognizing the supreme court distinction between international and domestic travel,i conclude that intermediate scrutiny should be the benchmark.in his opinion,judge fernandez concludes that the regulation at issue passed both rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.therefore,i concur in the result.
i respectfully dissent.
judge fernandez opinion would hold that rational basis review is the proper standard for testing restrictions on a person right to leave the united states.the right to leave one country is too important to be subject to abridgment on so permissive a standard.the practical effect of consigning the right to travel to this lowly category of constitutional protection is to grant congress plenary power to restrict it.judge mckeown opinion would hold that intermediate scrutiny should be the benchmark.in my view,we are not at liberty to take either approach.
the supreme court laid down the principles that govern this case before it adopted the three pigeonholes now fashionable rational basis,intermediate,and strict scrutiny.the holdings in the principal right to travel cases use the approach that dominated jurisprudence in the,when pigeonholes and drawing inferences based on the pigeonholes was considered a relic of earlier times.we must take these cases as they are.in this case,unlike those in which the supreme court has upheld restrictions on travel,the government has not offered a foreign policy or national security justification for the restriction,the government has not narrowly tailored the restriction to its purpose,and the apparent purpose of the restriction is to penalize past misconduct rather than to restrict travel as such.thus the travel ban in this case is unconstitutional under controlling supreme court precedent.that court can revise its approach if it so decides,but we ca 
the right to leave is among the most important of all human rights.in the crito,socrates explains his decision to stay in prison and accept the death than accept his friends arrangement of an the social contract formed when,though free to leave athens with his property,he elected to stay and subject himself to its laws 
w e further proclaim to any athenian by the liberty which we allow him,that if he does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the city,and made our acquaintance,he may go where he pleases and take his goods with him but he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and administer the state,and still remains,has entered into an implied contract that he will do as we command him 
magna carta established that subjects had a right to leave the kingdom and return the exceptions to the right to travel abroad in magna carta were for those imprisoned or and for a short period in time of war,a public policy reason relating to national security.
the supreme court held in kent that the right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen can not be deprived without the due process of law under the fifth amendment.the court held that curtailments of that right must be narrowly construed because the right to travel is so deeply engrained in constitutional history judge mckeown opinion dismisses kent,noting that it ultimately held only that the state department ban on passports for communists exceeded its statutory authority not that the ban was unconstitutional.but this ignores why the court resolved the case on statutory grounds,which was to avoid deciding a serious constitutional question where activities or enjoyment,natural and often necessary to the of an american citizen,such as travel,are involved,we will construe narrowly all delegated powers that curtail or dilute them.congress has described the right to emigrate as fun fundamental in the amendment which pressures communist countries to let their people go 
to assure the continued dedication of the united states to fundamental human rights products from any nonmarket economy country shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment during the period beginning with the date on which the president determines that such country denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate 
in europe in the and,for many citizens emigration or not meant life or death.
eunique got caught by part of the deadbeat dads law and can not get a passport,because she has not been paying her the per month per child in child support that she agreed to pay when she divorced him.she was then in law school and had thought that all lawyers earned a lot of money,but things have not turned out as i expected.she has earned negligible net income from her law practice.she says that a peruvian american friend has invited her to go to peru to meet relatives who have a law firm there,and has suggested that her trip could open up opportunities for the law firm to hire me when they need legal work in california.eunique is plainly derelict in her duty to pay child support,and was properly denied a passport,if the statute and regulation are constitutional.
the supreme court has dealt with three kinds of interference with the right to travel abroad bans on travel by specific classes of persons bans on travel to specific countries and residency requirements for government benefits that incidentally burden persons who travel abroad the court has held that incidental burdens on permitted travel need only have a rational basis but has subjected restrictions on travel itself to much greater scrutiny the court has not formal
