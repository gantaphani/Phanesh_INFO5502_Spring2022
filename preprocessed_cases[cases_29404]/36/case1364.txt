this juvenile dependency case involves two appeals.anna anna,the maternal grandmother of jacob jacob,appeals from two juvenile court orders.she challenges the juvenile court order denying her application for de facto parent status on the grounds that the juvenile court improperly applied the relevant criteria by failing to take into account the lengthy period of time that she cared for jacob in the role of his parent.anna also contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing before the department of children and family services the department removed jacob from her care.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm the juvenile court orders.
the department appeals the juvenile court order appointing counsel for jacob birth mother mother at the hearing on anna application for de facto parent status.the department contends that because mother parental rights had been terminated more than two and years before the hearing,there was no statutory basis upon which to appoint counsel.we agree.welfare and institutions code section provides for the appointment of counsel to a parent or guardian.mother parental rights had been terminated and she was not entitled to appointed counsel in the juvenile court or on appeal.moreover,because mother rights had been terminated,the juvenile court order granting mother visitation is void.we therefore reverse the orders appointing counsel and granting mother visitation.
factual and procedural background 
jacob initial detention 
in july,pursuant to a petition the department filed,jacob,then months old,and his brother richard,then,were declared dependents of the juvenile court based on allegations that their mother had been using methamphetamines around them,subd.b inability of parent to supervise,protect,or care for child,and their father whereabouts was unknown,subd.g failure to provide necessities.jacob and richard had previously been ordered detained with anna,their maternal grandmother.
at the dispositional hearing on september,the juvenile court ordered the children to remain with anna and ordered reunification services for mother and father.mother did not avail herself of the services offered,and the court terminated her reunification services on june.although father had since been located and attempted to participate in the reunification services provided,his family reunification services were eventually terminated on march.the court then set the matter for a section permanent placement plan hearing.
parental rights terminated and anna expresses interest in adoption 
at the section hearing on june,the department recommended terminating parental rights based on the parents noncompliance with the case plan and identified adoption as the permanent placement plan.according to the department,anna had indicated as early as april that she wanted to adopt the children.the hearing,however,was continued to permit the department to determine whether anna wanted instead to become the children legal guardian.after the department presented the option of legal guardianship to anna,she again expressed her desire to adopt the children and signed an affidavit to that effect 
on september,the court terminated parental rights.the court ordered the department to provide permanent placement services under the plan of adoption and to proceed with adoptive planning for both jacob and richard.although anna expressed her desire to adopt the children,she would never complete the necessary steps to do so.
jacob placement with anna 
during the first three years that anna cared for jacob and richard,by all accounts she received glowing reports.richard suffers from cerebral palsy and mental retardation,and he is fed through a gastronomy tube.jacob has no health problems.according to the department reports,both children appeared to be happy and well taken care of in anna home.that all changed in the summer of when richard was removed from anna care.
on august,the department informed the court that it had removed richard from anna care because of medical neglect.according to the department report,richard,now,had lost two pounds,and weighed just pounds.his weight loss appeared to be caused by a side effect to new medication that made him vomit.anna let the condition persist for five weeks without notifying richard doctor.richard also had missed medical appointments and had missed days of a total of days of a special preschool that he attended.
richard was hospitalized on august,and never returned to anna care.after he was released from the hospital,richard was placed in a medical care facility.anna visited him there once.richard was then transferred to a different medical facility.anna made no attempt to visit him,or to arrange for jacob to visit him even after the juvenile court indicated that she was required to do so.anna also did not obtain the required additional medical training to care for richard so that he could return to her home.
following richard removal,anna was angry and became uncooperative with the department.anna refused family preservation services.she also denied the department access to jacob,and in august locked herself and jacob in a room to avoid the caseworker.
the department became concerned about anna inability to follow through with jacob care.the department december report states anna is somewhat unorganized and does not follow through well.however,if she is reminded several times,she eventually follows through on whatever she has committed to do.she was out of compliance with regard to jacob yearly medical and dental.she stated to csw that she would take jacob for a medical and dental exam in september.she only recently took jacob for a yearly medical exam on.in addition,anna agreed to enroll jacob in a program several months ago.when csw talked with her about whether she had enrolled jacob,she replied,e sic not school age yet and you ca make me enroll him in school.
in march,a new social worker was assigned to the case.anna continued to be uncooperative and resisted the department involvement in jacob care.moreover,anna did not enroll jacob in preschool.in april,she told the caseworker that she was in the process of enrolling jacob in kindergarten.
in september,the caseworker raised concerns about jacob care.jacob had not seen a dentist,and anna had not scheduled his annual medical exam.in addition,although anna told the caseworker that she had enrolled jacob in school,the caseworker called the school and learned that jacob was not enrolled there.at a progress hearing that same month,jacob attorney represented that she had spoken to anna,and anna had taken jacob to the dentist.she explained that anna had delayed the visit because she did not have jacob card.jacob attorney also represented that anna had enrolled jacob in school.the attorney explained that apparently the caseworker had called the school the day before anna had delivered the paperwork to the school.anna,however,had neither taken jacob to the dentist nor enrolled him in school.
while anna continued to express an interest in adopting jacob and richard,she had not completed the documents so that the department could conduct a home study,nor had she completed the necessary medical training and repairs to her home so that she could adopt richard.with respect to the documents,anna claimed that she had completed them and the department had lost them.she expressed frustration that she had to complete the forms a second time.the juvenile court,however,asked her to complete the documents again,but she never did so.
by march,jacob,now,was still not enrolled in school.the department had also confirmed that jacob had not seen a dentist nor seen his doctor since november.at a progress hearing the following month,jacob attorney again reported that she had spoken with anna and told the juvenile court that anna would take jacob to the dentist and doctor that week,enroll him in school the following week,and take him to visit richard.
two months later,jacob still had not been enrolled in school.he also had not been taken for his annual medical exam nor had he seen the dentist.at a progress hearing,jacob attorney expressed her frustration with anna lack of cooperation i spent an extensive amount of time speaking with anna and,i guess,probably what concerns me the most in seeing jacob does seem seeing the doctor and dentist concerns me,but the school client is six and he has never been enrolled in school.he has a stutter and he just getting further and further behind.i do think just do know if the caretaker is capable of meeting his needs,meeting his basic needs.
although the department was willing to give anna an additional days,jacob attorney stated that she believed the department should detain jacob.the court responded after further discussion,i think he is going to have to be detained,and jacob attorney agreed.at the conclusion of the hearing,the department and the court discussed whether or not the department would file a petition regarding a change in jacob placement.jacob attorney pointed out that the department did not have to file a petition to change jacob placement.the juvenile court then ordered a progress report for may,for a s upplemental on department jacob and his enrollment in school in the new placement.anna was not present at this hearing.
the next day,the department removed jacob from anna care.when jacob was removed from anna care,he told the department that his grandma hits him with a stick in his hand when he is bad and that makes him sad.in addition,according to the department,jacob disclosed my grandma and my grandpa fight and hit each other and i ask them to stop and they keep fighting that makes me sad too.
anna files de facto parent application 
on may,anna applied to become jacob de facto parent.she asserted that she had provided jacob with a loving home for five years,and met his daily needs,including his medical and dental needs.she further contended that she did not get along with the caseworker and blamed her for the delay in the adoption process.in addition,she attached documents to the petition that included a report of health examination for school entry,showing that jacob had seen a doctor in april an appointment card scheduling a dental appointment for jacob on may,and jacob immunization card.anna also submitted documents that she was enrolled in the foster and kinship care education class,and had enrolled in special medical classes to take care of richard.finally,she asserted that her parents were of native american heritage.
the department opposed anna de facto parent application.it argued that it had been trying to work with anna since march,and that she had been uncooperative and extremely resistant.
at the de facto parent status hearing,jacob mother,whose parental rights had been terminated in september,also was present and requested counsel.the department objected to the appointment and argued that there was no statutory basis for appointment of counsel.over the department objection,the court appointed counsel 
the juvenile court denied anna de facto parent application.anna timely appealed.in addition to challenging the denial of her de facto parent application,she challenges the failure of the department to investigate indian child welfare act icwa and the denial of a hearing before jacob was removed from her care.
contentions 
anna raises two errors in her appeal.she contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying her de facto parent status by improperly applying the relevant criteria and,more specifically,by failing to recognize the lengthy period of time that she cared for jacob.anna further contends that the juvenile court abused its discretion by ordering that jacob be removed from her care without affording her a right to a hearing on the removal issue.
the department appeals the juvenile court orders following termination of mother rights that include appointing counsel for mother and granting mother visitation.it contends that the juvenile court had no statutory authority for either order because mother parental rights had been terminated.
discussion 
the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in denying anna de facto parent application standard of review 
a de facto parent is a person who has been found by the court to have assumed,on a basis,the role of parent,fulfilling both the child physical and psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period cal.rules of court,rule a in re leticia th,d.the denial of a petition for de facto parent status is reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re leticia,supra,at,d.in most cases,the lower court does not abuse its discretion if substantial evidence supports its determination to grant or deny de facto parent status.in re michael th,d,citing in re krystle th,d.
b.while jacob was in her care,anna failed to adequately perform the role of a parent 
the decision to grant de facto parent status turns on the facts of each case.although the supreme court has not set forth specific guidelines for a juvenile court to apply in determining de facto parent status,courts have generally considered such factors as whether the child is psychologically bonded to the adult the adult has assumed the role of a parent on a basis for a substantial period of time the adult possesses information about the child unique from other participants in the process the adult has regularly attended juvenile court hearings and a future proceeding may result in an order permanently foreclosing any future contact between the adult and the child.citations.in re patricia th,d.
recognizing that a court can only benefit from having all relevant information on the best interests of the child,appellate courts also have observed that de facto parent status ordinarily should be liberally granted.in re patricia,supra,th at,d.if the information presented by the de facto parent is not helpful,the court need not give it much weight in the decisionmaking process citation.ibid.
the party seeking de facto parent status has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he or she falls within the statutory definition.see in re michael,supra,th at,d.having reviewed the record,we conclude that based on the factors stated above,anna did not meet her burden,and thus,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying anna de facto parent status.
while jacob lived with anna for a long period of time,she did not show that she adequately assumed the role of parent on a basis,fulfilling his physical and psychological needs.rather,though the record shows that jacob and anna had a close and loving relationship,it also shows that anna neglected parental responsibilities,chief among them her failure to enroll jacob in kindergarten,to schedule medical and dental appointments,and to ensure that jacob maintain a relationship with his disabled older brother.after repeated attempts to get anna to comply with juvenile court orders and work with the department,the department and jacob attorney concluded it had no option but to find a more suitable placement for jacob.after jacob was removed from anna care,he revealed she would hit him with a stick,and that he had witnessed domestic violence.under these circumstances,anna acted contrary to the role of a parent.thus,the juvenile court denial of the special status of de facto parent to anna was not arbitrary,capricious,or a patently absurd determination.
citing in re vincent th,d,anna argues that since she did not harm or abuse jacob,and had cared for jacob for an extended period of time,there was no good reason to deny her de facto parent status.in re vincent concluded that the removal of the grandchildren from the paternal grandmother care,and the paternal grandmother admission that she was unable to care for her grandchildren,were insufficient reasons to deny de facto parent status.id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that absent physical or sexual abuse,there ought to be a very good reason for denying de facto parent status to a grandparent or other close relative who has cared for a dependent child for an extended period of time.id.at,d.
while anna did not sexually abuse jacob,the record shows that the juvenile court had good reasons to deny de facto parent status to anna.anna situation is no
