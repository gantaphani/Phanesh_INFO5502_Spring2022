this case arises out of a petition filed by pursuant to section a,florida statutes,to gain access to certain public,but confidential,records maintained by the department of children and families dcf we must decide three issues whether dcf waived its objection to the circuit court personal jurisdiction when it simultaneously moved to transfer venue whether was required to serve dcf with the petition and whether the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the home venue privilege.
the district court did not reach the merits of the service of jurisdiction issue because it held that dcf waived its objection by seeking a transfer of venue.dep t of children families,so d,dca.the court also held that the circuit court did not err in refusing to apply the home venue though none of the recognized exceptions to the privilege were n one of the policies that motivated the adoption of the home venue privilege are present in this case.id.at.
the district court decision expressly and directly conflicts with jacksonville electric authority clay county utility authority,so d dca,which held that trial courts are bound to apply the home venue privilege unless one of the three recognized exceptions is satisfied,regardless of whether application of the privilege in the particular case is supported by the policy reasons that justify the privilege 
in part i of this opinion,we briefly discuss the factual and procedural history of the case.in part ii,we hold that a motion to transfer venue,filed simultaneously with a timely asserted objection to personal jurisdiction,does not waive the jurisdictional objection.with respect to this issue,we disapprove the opinion below and the opinion in hubbard cazares,so d dca.because dcf did not waive its objection to the court personal jurisdiction,we reach the merits of that issue.in part iii,we hold that section a requires formal service of process on dcf.accordingly,the circuit court erred in denying dcf motion to dismiss the petition for insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction.and in part iv,we approve the first district holding in jacksonville electric that a trial court must apply the home venue privilege unless one of the recognized exceptions to the privilege is satisfied.however,we approve the result of the district court below because we now create a fourth exception to the home venue privilege.as we will discuss in greater detail below,this new exception is similar to the joint tortfeasor exception that we created in board of county commissioners grice,so d.because this case falls within this new exception,the circuit court did not err in refusing to apply the home venue privilege.
background 
the state brought criminal child neglect charges against donald and amy hutton.the charges were brought in the palm beach county circuit court.while the criminal case was pending,seeking access to dcf records concerning the huttons and their children,filed a section a petition.section a provides that 
a ny person or organization,including the department of children and family services,may petition the court for an order making public the records of the department of children and family services that pertain to investigations of alleged abuse,neglect,abandonment,or exploitation of a child or a vulnerable adult.the court shall determine if good cause exists for public access to the records sought or a portion thereof.in making this determination,the court shall balance the best interest of the vulnerable adult or child who is the focus of the investigation,and in the case of the child,the interest of that child siblings,together with the privacy right of other persons identified in the reports against the public interest.the public interest in access to such records is reflected in,and includes the need for citizens to know of and adequately evaluate the actions of the department of children and family services and the court system in providing vulnerable adults and children of this state with the protections enumerated in ss.and.
a.stat.filed the petition in the palm beach county circuit court and faxed a copy of the petition to dcf.
dcf moved to dismiss the petition for insufficient service of process,lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction,and failure to state a cause of action.dcf also invoked the home venue privilege and moved to dismiss the petition for improper venue or,in the alternative,to transfer the case to leon county,the county in which dcf maintains its headquarters.the palm beach county circuit court denied dcf motions.the court held that section a does not require formal service of process.the court declined to apply the home venue privilege because the petition was not in the nature of a lawsuit against dcf.
the fourth district court of appeal affirmed.first,the district court held that dcf waived its objection to the circuit court personal jurisdiction by seeking to transfer venue to leon county.dep t of children families,so d at.second,the district court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the home venue privilege.id.at.
dcf argues that the circuit court should have dismissed the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction because did not effect formal service of process.argues that dcf waived its objection to the court personal jurisdiction by seeking a transfer of venue.the district court agreed with and held that dcf waived its objection.we disagree.
in babcock whatmore,so d,we held that a defendant waives a challenge to personal jurisdiction by seeking affirmative requests are logically inconsistent with an initial defense of lack of jurisdiction.the question here is whether dcf motion to transfer venue was a request for affirmative relief.we have not previously addressed this issue and the district courts that have are conflicted.the district court below relied on the second district decision in hubbard cazares,so d dca.hubbard,however,conflicts with the fourth district decision in dimino farina,so d dca with respect to this issue,we disapprove the opinion below and that in hubbard,and we approve the opinion in dimino.
hubbard held that a request for change of venue following a timely asserted challenge to personal jurisdiction is a request for affirmative relief which constitutes a waiver of the jurisdictional challenge.so d at the hubbard court relied on two cases killearn properties,lambright,and sangdahl litton.the court reliance on these two cases is unpersuasive,and we refuse to adopt it.both killearn properties and sangdahl involved requests that preceded objections to personal jurisdiction.here the motion to transfer venue and the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction were made simultaneously.this distinction was recognized by a different district of the indiana court of appeals in state omega painting.
in omega painting,the court expressly disavow ed the hubbard court reliance on killearn properties.at.the court stressed that killearn properties was predicated upon a change of venue request filed prior to the assertion of a lack of personal jurisdiction,rather than a motion filed contemporaneously with the state answer asserting the lack of personal jurisdiction.id.at.the court held that 
once the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction is properly preserved,the defendant may proceed with a defense on the merits without waiving the jurisdictional issue.accordingly,we can not say that such a request for a change of venue,filed contemporaneously with or subsequent to the proper preservation of the jurisdictional question,seeks the affirmative relief of the court and,thereby,acts as a waiver of the jurisdictional claim.
id.citation omitted.
the court disagreed with the hubbard court characterization of a motion,filed subsequent to the preservation of the jurisdictional challenge,as go ing beyond matters of defense and seek ing affirmative relief.id.at quoting hubbard,so d at.in this regard,the court distinguished a defendant filing of a permissive counterclaim,a crossclaim,or a counterpetition in a divorce of which had been held by various courts to be requests for affirmative relief that waive a party jurisdictional a request to change venue,which the court characterized as a legitimate request in the defense of an action.at.
the hubbard court reliance on sangdahl is also unpersuasive.in sangdahl,the united states district court for the southern district of new york held that the defendant had waived his challenge to the court personal jurisdiction.but again,the court focused on the fact that the defendant motion to change venue preceded the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the defendant waived his objection to the court personal jurisdiction by failing to raise the objection,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,prior to or simultaneously with his forum non conveniens motion.see sangdahl,at quoting federal rule of civil procedure g if a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection then available to him which this rule permits to be raised by motion,he shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted.
we believe that the decision in dimino,which conflicts with hubbard is more persuasive.the dimino court relied on florida rules of civil procedure b and h.rule b states that 
e very defense in law or fact to a claim for relief in a pleading shall be asserted in the responsive pleading,if one is required,but the following defenses may be made by motion at the option of the pleader lack of jurisdiction over the person,improper venue,insufficiency of process,insufficiency of service of process a motion making any of these defenses shall be made before pleading if a further pleading is permitted.any ground not stated shall be deemed to be waived except any ground showing that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter may be made at any time.no defense or objection is waived by being joined with other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or motion.
civ.b emphasis added.rule h states that a party waives all defenses and objections that the party does not present either by motion under subdivisions b,e,or f of this rule or,if the party has made no motion,in a responsive pleading.civ.h.as the dimino court stated 
because appellant would otherwise have waived the defense of improper venue,the motion was defensive in nature rather than a request for affirmative relief,and his challenge to the court jurisdiction was not waived by being joined with the motion for change of venue.
so d at.we agree with this reasoning we approve the opinion in dimino on this point,and we disapprove the opinion below and that in hubbard to the extent that they conflict with dimino and our opinion here we hold that a motion to transfer venue,filed simultaneously with a timely asserted objection to personal jurisdiction,does not waive the jurisdictional objection 
iii.service of jurisdiction 
because dcf did not waive its objection to the circuit court personal jurisdiction,we will now address the merits of the objection.argues that it was not required to serve dcf with the petition because section a does not contain an explicit service of process requirement.section b,on the other hand,does contain an explicit service of process requirement 
in cases involving serious bodily injury to a child or a vulnerable adult,the department of children and family services may petition the court for an order for the immediate public release of records of the department which pertain to the protective investigation.the petition must be personally served upon the child or vulnerable adult,the child parents or guardian,the legal guardian of that person,if any,and any person named as an alleged perpetrator in the report of abuse,neglect,abandonment,or exploitation.
b.stat.emphasis added.argues that if the legislature had intended to require that petitions filed under section a be served on the agency,it could have included an express as it did in subsection b.because it did not,argues,formal service of process is not required.
we reject this argument and hold that a section a petitioner must serve dcf with the petition.the florida rules of civil procedure apply to all actions of a civil nature.civ.rule provides that civil actions are commenced when the complaint or petition is filed.rule provides that u pon the commencement of the action,summons or other process authorized by law shall be issued.section a,florida statutes,states that s ervice of original process is made by delivering a copy of it to the person to be served with a copy of the complaint,petition,or other initial pleading.emphasis added.section,florida statutes,provides that p rocess against any public agency,board,commission,or department not a body corporate shall be served on the public officer being sued or the chief executive officer of the agency,board,commission,or department.
we do when we read subsection a together with subsection b,as a legislative intent to forego formal service of process under subsection a.the fact that the legislature explicitly named certain individuals that dcf must serve when it files a petition pursuant to section b does not necessarily control our construction of section a,which contains no such provision.
section b requires dcf to serve those parties whose interests must be balanced by the court when it conducts the analysis.when dcf files such a petition,it is requesting the immediate public release of these records.it seems reasonable to assume that the legislature thought it important,in such situations,to alert those parties whose interests will be affected by such release,allowing them to participate in the proceeding to determine whether good cause to release the records exists.when a private party files a petition pursuant to section a,it is unlikely that the party would know the identities and locations of the interested parties.much of this information will be known only to dcf.to have included an explicit service of process requirement similar to the one contained in subsection b would have been unworkable the petitioner can not serve parties of whom he is unaware and unnecessary when dcf is served,it will then be able to alert the court to the identities of interested persons.it therefore seems more reasonable to conclude that the legislature did not intend to forego formal service of process by failing to include an explicit requirement.
this civil action to make public the records that were otherwise confidential was commenced when filed the section a petition.was then required to comply with the rules regarding service of process.because these records are maintained by dcf,was required to serve dcf with the petition.because it did not,the circuit court erred in denying dcf motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction 
iv.home venue privilege 
we now consider the application of the home venue privilege to this case.the home venue privilege provides that,absent waiver or exception,venue in a suit against the state,or an agency or subdivision of the state,is proper only in the county in which the state,or the agency or subdivision of the state,maintains its principal headquarters.pub.serv.comm triple a,so d,carlile game fresh water fish com n,so d.
the circuit court declined to apply the home venue privilege and the district court affirmed.the district court noted that the records at issue were maintained by dcf in palm beach county.dep t of children families,so d at.furthermore,was not seeking a money judgment against dcf,nor a judgment respecting dcf official,policies.id.the court observed that cases applying the home venue privilege almost universally involve actions seeking judgment directly against the agency for money damages or for declaratory relief binding the agency in regard to some policy or practice of the agency itself.id.this case,on the other hand,merely involved a party seek ing to exercise its right of access to public records maintained within the jurisdiction of the circuit court.id.
the court thought that it would severely burden the right of access to public records to require that all such actions be deemed within the home venue privilege of state government.id.the court also stressed that n one of the polic
