opinion of the court 
tsui tsui appeals the district court grant of the child return petition petition filed by yang yang pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention,tsui claims that the district court erred in its determinations that tsui wrongfully retained raeann tsui raeann or the child and that raeann should be returned to canada despite the wishes of the child exception.we disagree,and for the reasons that follow,will affirm the district court judgment.
although yang and tsui have known each other since they were children in taiwan,our focus is on the events that occurred after they both moved to pittsburgh.tsui attended the university of pittsburgh and earned a in electrical engineering in.yang arrived in pittsburgh in,a few years after tsui.she also attended the university of pittsburgh where she earned a master of science in information science in.
tsui was married and had a child around the time of yang arrival in pittsburgh.however,a romance ensued between him and yang in,and yang became pregnant.tsui and his mother invited yang to move in with their family,which included tsui wife and child.yang accepted the offer and moved in with the family sometime before she gave birth in 
yang gave birth to raeann on june,in pittsburgh yang and raeann lived with tsui and his family until december.at that time,tsui,yang and raeann went to taiwan.tsui only stayed for two weeks,but yang and raeann remained for five or six months.yang and raeann then returned to pittsburgh where they lived with tsui and his mother in august,yang and raeann traveled to taiwan for a funeral and because yang visa was about to expire.although yang did not initially intend to move to taiwan at that time,she and raeann remained there for four years.
yang wanted to maintain the relationship with tsui by telephone and although they spoke once a month,he did not want to continue the relationship.raeann was too young to communicate with tsui by telephone.tsui also traveled to taiwan on several occasions.however,despite knowing where yang and raeann resided,he did not visit them.yang claims that he also provided no financial support for raeann during this time period.however,tsui claims to have given yang approximately while she and raeann were in taiwan.
in,yang decided to immigrate to canada with raeann.yang was unable to return to the united states and she believed that the clean air in canada would help a skin condition that raeann had developed.tsui claims,however,that yang actually was trying to move closer to him.
in july,yang went to canada for several days in order to activate her visa,but then returned to taiwan to prepare for the move.yang and raeann moved to surrey,british columbia.yang was unable to find a job in her field,but she obtained a position at mcdonald.although yang provided primary care for raeann,she had some assistance from friends and neighbors.she enrolled raeann in kindergarten in september.
additionally,at yang request,tsui started providing financial support for raeann.he gave yang approximately,a computer,and other gifts.yang and tsui maintained contact by telephone and email on at least a monthly basis.although tsui and raeann contact remained limited,he gave yang a digital camera to enable her to send him pictures of raeann.
yang became ill in august,and was diagnosed with malignant thymoma in september.the tumor was in her chest and caused yang to suffer from myasthenia gravis,a condition which resulted in muscle weakness in her chest and neck.additionally,the tumor caused her difficulty in speaking and swallowing.yang doctor explained that the tumor had to be removed,which would require major surgery.the doctor anticipated that she would be hospitalized for seven to ten days,and that yang would be unable to work during the two to three month recovery period.
yang turned to tsui for help with raeann during the surgery and recovery period.in an email dated october,yang told tsui i t would be better if you can pick up and take care of raeann.i ca work for at least two and a half months if anything happens to me,at least you can still raise raeann.although at first resistant to have raeann move in with his family tsui finally agreed to come to surrey and bring raeann with him to pittsburgh.as tsui was picking raeann up in,he recommended having her remain in pittsburgh until the end of the school term.yang agreed,but when doing so she did not know that the school term in pittsburgh did not end until late january.
the same day that yang entered the hospital,october,she sent tsui an email.the email explained the she packed up raeann belongings in three bags.the bags included winter clothes,summer clothes,shoes,and toys.she also stated that some of the items may be unnecessary.the email contained the following postscript raeann does like long sleeves.tsui arrived in canada on october,and yang friend who had been watching raeann met him at the airport.the friend took tsui and raeann to see yang at the hospital where she was recovering from her surgery which took place on october,yang gave tsui documentation to enable him to register raeann in school and to travel with him to the united states.tsui maintains that there was no agreement that raeann would stay with him for a set period of time.he claims that there was no limit on how long raeann would remain in pittsburgh,but rather the agreement was that raeann would remain in pittsburgh until yang fully recovered.it is undisputed that the parties agreed that raeann would reside permanently with tsui if yang died tsui and raeann traveled to pittsburgh on october,and tsui gave yang before he left.
after yang was discharged from the hospital on november,she spoke to raeann daily by telephone.however,tsui wife felt that daily telephone calls were burdensome to their family and thus tsui limited the calls to every other night.according to yang,raeann was homesick and wanted to return to canada.yang told tsui to bring raeann back to canada and even offered to come to pittsburgh to get her.she threatened legal action if he refused.tsui claims,however,that yang did not request that he return raeann until april,when he received a letter from yang attorney,andrew sandilands sandilands.
on november,yang intended to travel to pittsburgh to bring raeann back.she was unable to make the trip,however,because she had difficulty breathing and went to the emergency room.apparently,yang medical problems remained and she was admitted to the intensive care unit icu on november.she was in the icu for one week,and remained in the hospital until december.although yang was unable to speak,others contacted tsui on her behalf.a social worker at the hospital spoke to tsui who indicated that he would bring raeann to canada if yang condition worsened.tsui also told yang brother and her friend that he would bring raeann back in december.
on december,yang was able to speak,although with great difficulty.on that day,she spoke with tsui as she was worried that he did not intend to return raeann.tsui assured yang that he would return raeann at the end of january when the school term ended.tsui then took raeann on vacation without informing yang that they were going away,and she was concerned when she could not reach them for several days.however,tsui did send yang pictures of raeann in the middle of december.
on december,the day before the pictures arrived,a package addressed to yang arrived at her friend house.the package contained a complaint for custody,filed in pennsylvania state court on december.it also included an order for generations seminar,which is a service offered by the court of common pleas of allegheny county for parents involved in custody disputes.according to the order,yang was to attend a mandatory seminar in pittsburgh on january,and a mediation session on february.
yang was unable to attend the seminar due to her health.after her release from the hospital,she underwent twenty sessions of radiation therapy.although she contacted the generations office to explain that she would be unable to attend the seminar,neither she nor her attorneys contacted the pennsylvania courts or appeared at the seminar or mediation.according to yang,after she spoke with the generations office,she believed that the proceedings were adjourned.however,the proceedings were not adjourned and tsui received a court order on february,which granted him custody of raeann.the order included a proposed visitation schedule,but yang never agreed to the schedule.
yang hired sandilands upon receipt of the complaint for custody.on january,sandilands sent a letter to tsui demanding raeann immediate return.he also initiated custody proceedings in canada.the canadian proceedings consisted of five hearings and continued from january to march.yang attended every hearing,except for the first one.tsui appeared only through counsel,who represented him at all of the hearings except for the first one.on march,the supreme court of british columbia granted interim custody of raeann to yang.based on the decision,sandilands again sent a letter requesting that tsui return raeann.tsui claimed that this was the first formal request that he received to return raeann to canada.
in may,as raeann was still residing with tsui,sandilands filed an application with the canadian attorney general office seeking to have raeann returned under the hague convention.yang filed a petition under the hague convention in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on october.the district court initially abstained from exercising jurisdiction.the decision was appealed and oral argument was held before this court in philadelphia in september.on appeal,this court reversed the district court judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.yang tsui,cir yang i.yang traveled to the united states for the oral argument,and this was the first time she had seen raeann since october 
yang returned to pittsburgh in november and sought a visitation schedule.as the parties could not reach an agreement,yang filed a motion requesting that the district court help establish a schedule.yang was granted visitation with raeann three times a week for several hours.the visits occurred at the district court chambers during the week and at an alternative location on the weekend.
the district court held a hearing on the merits at which the parties and other witnesses testified.it also conducted an in camera examination of raeann.during the examination,raeann testified that she wanted to remain in pittsburgh.the district court issued a written opinion and order on august,in which it granted yang petition.
in its opinion,the district court began its analysis by determining that november,was the date of retention in this case.this factual determination was based on the parties testimony and tsui admission that yang demanded,in,that tsui return the child.the district court then turned to the issue of the child habitual residence.because raeann was only five years old when she left canada,the district court found that she was too young to possess an intent regarding her habitual residence.therefore,the district court turned its focus to the parents and whether they both intended to make pittsburgh raeann home immediately prior to november.the district court held that the overwhelming evidence in this case demonstrated that the parties only intended for raeann to stay with tsui for two or three months until yang recovered.tsui and yang only intended for pittsburgh to become raeann home if yang passed away because of her illness.based on these facts,the district court determined that canada was raeann habitual residence on november.
the next factor for the district court to consider was yang custody rights at the time of retention.as such a determination is based on the custody laws of the country in which the child resided at the time of removal,both parties called expert witnesses to testify about the custody law of british columbia.the district court held that under british columbia law yang had custody of raeann on november,because raeann usually resided with yang.the district court also found that yang was exercising her custody rights at the time of retention.therefore,the district court held that yang had satisfied her burden under the hague convention of proving that the child was wrongfully retained.
based on its determination,the hague convention required the district court to order that raeann be returned to yang unless an exception applied.as the burden to prove that an exception applies was on tsui,the district court had to determine whether he had met his burden of proving the applicability of the wishes of the child exception it believed that any objection that raeann had to returning to canada was based on tsui wrongful retention.the district court refused to apply the exception because its application in such a situation would frustrate the purpose of the convention.the district court also explained that even if this was an appropriate case for the exception,tsui had not met his burden of proving that raeann was of sufficient age and maturity for her views to be taken into account.further,the court found that raeann views has been formed by outside influence.additionally,her reasons for staying,which included comfortable living conditions and friends,were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements for the exception.therefore,the district court concluded that even if the exception could apply to this case,the requirements for its application were not met.
as tsui did not prove that an exception applied,the district court granted yang petition and ordered that tsui return raeann to yang by september.tsui then filed this timely appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and a.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,but our review of its conclusions of law is plenary.see whiting krassner,cir.we will not reverse the district court factual findings as long as its account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record,even if convinced that we would have weighed the evidence differently.karkkainen kovalchuk,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer,d.
the two main goals of the hague convention are to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting state.hague convention,it is well settled that the convention was not designed to resolve international custody disputes.see,karkkainen,at.rather,the convention was designed to restore the status quo prior to any wrongful removal or retention,and to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases.id.
a person claiming that a child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in the united states can commence judicial proceedings under the convention by filing a petition for the return of a child in a state or federal court which has jurisdiction where the child is located.b.in order for the petition to be granted,the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal or retention was wrongful.article of the convention defines the removal or retention of a child as wrongful when 
it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention.further,a petitioner can not claim that the removal or retention of a child is wrongful under the hague convention unless the child to whom the petition relates is habitually resident in a state signatory to the convention and has been removed to or retained in a different state.karkkainen,at quoting gitter gitter,cir emphasis in karkkainen.
we have laid out four questions that must be answered in a wrongful removal or retention case.id.a court must determine when the removal or retention took place the child habitual residence immediately prior to such removal or retention whether the removal or retention breached the petitioner custody rights under the law of the child habitual residence and whether the petitioner was exercising his or her custody rights at the time of removal or retention.id.
the determination by a court that a child was wrongfully removed or retained does not automatically mean that the child must be returned to his or her habitual residence.rather,once the petitioner has proven his or her case,the burden shifts to the respondent to prove an affirmative defense against the return of the child to the country of habitual residence.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted these affirmative defenses are narrowly construed to effectuate the purposes of the convention,and even where a defense applies,the court has the discretion to order the child return.id.internal citations omitted.
on appeal,tsui claims that the district court erred in its determinations of the last three questions in the wrongful removal or retention analysis specifically,tsui claims that the district court incorrectly found canada to be raeann habitual residence immediately before her retention,that yang had custody rights,and that she was exercising them at the time of the retention.tsui also claims that the district court should not have ordered raeann return to canada as he met his burden for proving the wishes of the child exception,which would enable raeann to remain in the united states even if she was wrongfully retained.
we first need to determine whether the district court was correct in its determination that canada was raeann habitual residence immediately before the retention in this case.if we hold that canada was raeann habitual residence on the date of retention,we must then continue the analysis to determine whether the retention was wrongful.karkkainen,at.but,if we hold that the united states was raeann habitual residence at that time,the analysis is complete as the hague convention would not apply because her retention in the united states would not be wrongful as defined by article.see id.such a determination presents a mixed question of fact and law.id.
as we have said on several occasions,such a determination is and necessarily varies with the circumstances of each case.in re application of ariel adan,cir quoting whiting,at.a case such as this,where the petitioning parent had consented to let the child stay abroad for an undetermined period of time,is especially.mozes mozes,cir.
we have defined habitual residence as the place where the child has been physically present for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and which has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.baxter baxter,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the inquiry focuses on the child,but also must consider the parents present,shared intentions regarding their child presence in a particular location.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted karkkainen,at explaining that courts must consider the parents present shared intentions.
on the date of retention raeann was five years old.the district court found,under the facts of this case,that a is too young to have an intent regarding her habitual residence.although contrary to our finding in whiting,where we held that a child is able to acclimate,it does not change the propriety of the district court finding as other facts make this determination a correct one.
the record indicates that raeann had only been in pittsburgh for a few weeks when the wrongful retention occurred.additionally,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that any special circumstances existed which would enable her to acclimatize quickly.karkkainen,at.in fact,the only evidence in the record is that raeann missed yang,wanted to return to canada,and that she was enrolled in school in pittsburgh.based on this evidence,it can not be said that raeann became firmly rooted in her new surroundings prior to the date of retention.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,neither party argues that raeann had acclimatized to pittsburgh at the time of retention,but rather even tsui agrees that raeann did not possess an intent regarding her habitual residence.as there is no evidence of acclimatization,that raeann abandoned canada as her habitual residence,or that there was a degree of settled purpose from raeann point of view,we find that from raeann perspective pittsburgh did not become her habitual residence prior to the date of retention.see generally karkkainen,at.in other words,the record would not support a finding that raeann had been physically present in the united states for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and which had a degree of settled purpose from her perspective.see feder,at.
as the record does not reflect raeann perspective on her habitual residence,we must focus on the parents present,shared intentions.baxter,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we have said that there can be a change in the habitual residence of a child when the parents have a settled purpose in moving the child even for a limited period of time.see,feder,at.in order for a purpose to be settled there must be a sufficient degree of continuity.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.additionally,a child prior habitual residence must be effectively abandoned by the shared intent of the parents for her to acquire a new habitual residence.see mozes,at whiting,at explaining that acquiring a new habitual residence implicitly requires the abandonment of the prior habitual residence.
the district court found that the agreement between the parties was that raeann would stay with tsui only until yang recovered.it rejected tsui argument that the parties intended the stay to last until yang fully recovered,which may have been an extended period of time.rather,the district court found that they anticipated that yang would recover within two to three months.the district court finding is supported by the record.first of all,yang testified that she expected to recover within two to three months.an email from yang to tsui reflected this anticipation by saying that she would not be able to work for at least two and a half months.even though tsui denied that there was ever a conversation regarding the duration of raeann stay during direct examination,an affidavit he submitted in the canadian custody proceedings indicated that he was aware that yang expected to recover fully in a couple of months therefore,the district court determination is plausible in light of the record.
the district court finding also comports with the case law.even though the period was indefinite,it can not be said that the purpose of raeann traveling to the united states possessed a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled.feder,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted rather,the shared intent was that raeann would remain in the united states only as long as it took yang to recover,which was anticipated to be two to three months.additionally,there is no evidence that yang and tsui intended for raeann to abandon canada as her habitual residence.e ven though the exact length of the stay was left open to negotiation,the court is able to find no settled mutual intent from which such abandonment can be inferred.mozes,at.the evidence simply does not demonstrate a shared mutual intent to change raeann habitual residence.
it is undeniable that canada was raeann habitual residence before she went to stay with tsui in the united states.as there was no shared mutual intent by the parents for raeann to abandon that prior residence,we agree with the district court determination that canada was raeann habitual residence immediately before she was retained by tsui on november.therefore,yang met her burden of proving raeann habitual residence.
tsui arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.first,he claims that the facts do not support the district court finding.his claim is based in part on the fact that yang packed raeann summer clothes for her trip to pittsburgh.as raeann trip to pittsburgh was during the winter,he claims that this indicates that the intent was not limited to merely a two to three month stay.the district court dismissed the argument by noting yang email to tsui explained that raeann did not like to wear long sleeves.on appeal,tsui attacks the district court determination because the summer clothes included shorts.however,tsui ignores the fact that the email also stated that some of the things that she packed were probably unnecessary even if we agreed with tsui that this evidence could support his argument,we will not reverse the district court finding because it is supported by the record.see karkkainen,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
he also points to the fact that yang helped to enroll raeann in a pittsburgh school and that she agreed that even if she recovered sooner raeann should complete the fall school term in pittsburgh.the fall term at the school raeann attended in pittsburgh did not end until january,a fact which yang claims she did not learn until after the agreement was made.even if yang knew that the term went until january,this is still within two to three months of october,when raeann began residing with tsui.therefore,this fact does not actually help tsui as it does not contradict the district court finding.
secondly,tsui attempts to analogize this case to karkkainen.such an analogy is improper because the facts of the two cases are too dissimilar,and as we have said these types of cases are extremely our main focus in karkkainen was on the perspective of the child who we determined had become acclimatized in the united states.at.there is no such evidence in this case.additionally,the shared intent in that case was that the child could determine,after spending the summer in the united states,whether or not to remain permanently in the united states.id.at.such a mutual intent is nothing like an agreement that a child reside in pittsburgh for a couple of months until her mother recovered from surgery.therefore,although the cases share some similar facts,such as the mother assisting with the child being enrolled in school and the packing of items beyond those needed for a short stay,karkkainen does not control the outcome of this case.
as the record and the case law convince us that canada was raeann habitual residence immediately prior to november,the convention is applicable as she was retained in the united states.gitter gitter,cir.however,we must complete the remaining steps of the analysis in order to determine whether the retention was wrongful within the meaning of article.
the next step to consider is whether yang had custody of raeann custody rights,under the hague convention,include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.hague convention,a.to make a custody determination,it is necessary to carefully examine the country of origin custody laws to determine whether the party seeking the child return had custody rights in that country at the time the child was retained.adan,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.when the country in which the child habitually resides has more than one territorial unit,the custody rights laws of the territorial unit apply.feder,at citing hague convention.
under the convention custody rights are different than rights of access.rights of access include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.hague convention,b.rights of access are visitation rights,and the protection afforded for such rights under the convention is less than that afforded for custody rights.adan,at.when custody rights are violated,a court can order that the child be returned to his or her habitual residence,while a court can not order the return of a child when access rights are violated.id.
in this case,as raeann was an habitual resident in canada,but more specifically british columbia,british columbia law governs the determination of custody rights as defined by the convention.see feder,at.both parties offered expert testimony on british columbia custody law,and it is undisputed that its family relations act is applicable.the act states in pertinent part 
persons who may exercise custody 
subject to subsection,the persons who may exercise custody over a child are as follows 
a if the father and mother live together,the father and mother jointly 
b if the father and mother live separate and apart,the parent with whom the child usually resides 
c if custody rights exist under a court order,the person who has those rights 
d if custody rights exist under a written agreement,the person to whom those rights are given.
if persons have conflicting claims to custody under subsection,the following persons may exercise custody to the exclusion of the other persons unless a court otherwise orders 
a the person who has custody rights under a court order 
b if paragraph a does not apply,the person granted custody by an agreement 
c if paragraphs a and b do not apply,the person claiming custody with whom the child usually resides 
yang and tsui both claimed to have custody rights under section.at the hearing before the district court,both experts testified that because both parents claimed to have custody rights section applies therefore,we need to determine which subsection applies.no custody order existed on the date of retention making section a inapplicable.tsui argues that an agreement existed making section b the relevant provision.however,yang argues that section c controls in this case.
we will first address whether there was an agreement between yang and tsui regarding the custody of raeann.it is undisputed that prior to raeann travel to pittsburgh,yang had sole custody of raeann.that is yang and tsui lived separate and apart,and raeann resided with yang.see,b.therefore,we need to determine whether,as tsui claims,there was an agreement between the parties that transferred custody to tsui.
the experts testified that,like the convention,the custody laws of british columbia differentiate between custody rights and visitation rights.according to the experts,a custodial parent is the parent who is entitled to make the major decisions regarding the child and who oversees the care of the child,while a parent has access or visitation rights.however,both experts testified that a child visit with the parent can be for an extended period of time,such as summer vacation.
there was also testimony regarding what constituted a custody agreement under the family relations act.according to the experts,a custody agreement does not need to be filed with a court or even be memorialized in writing.rather,an oral agreement or unsigned documents,such as emails,will suffice.however,the main factor according to both experts is whether the custodial parent intended to transfer custody rights to the parent.tsui expert testified that the determination of whether such an intent existed is a factual determination to be made by a judge.she also explained that factors such as whether the custodial parent authorized the parent to make major decisions,such as where to enroll the child in school or what doctors to use,can demonstrate such an intent.
tsui argues that the evidence in this case demonstrates an agreement to transfer custody of raeann to him.as proof he points to the authorization that yang signed which allowed raeann to travel to pittsburgh with him.that document simply stated i authorize tsui to accompany raeann tsui to travel to the united states.tsui own expert testified that the authorization was ambiguous and did not clearly transfer custody rights.because of that ambiguity,she stated,whether the writer intended to transfer custody was a factual determination to be made by a judge.the district court in this case found that yang did not intend to transfer custody when she prepared and signed the document.based on the record,we agree with that determination.
tsui also claims that the general agreement that raeann stay with him included the transfer of custody rights.such an agreement necessarily constituted a change of custody,he claims,as it required tsui to make major decisions regarding raeann.however,the record does not demonstrate that is true.for example,as tsui vigorously argued in his brief regarding the habitual residence determination,yang participated in the enrollment of raeann in a pittsburgh school.and,although tsui believed that raeann should remain in the school for the entire fall term even if yang recovered before then,he sought yang approval for that decision.there is evidence in the record that tsui took raeann to doctors for a skin condition.however,the record does not indicate that such visits occurred during the relevant time period between october,and november.nor does the record reflect that yang had knowledge of such visits or that she approved.the evidence does not demonstrate that tsui had control over the major decisions regarding raeann.the requisite intent to transfer custody is absent.rather,as the district court determined,raeann trip to the united states was intended by her parents to be an extended visit coextensive with yang convalescence and not a transfer of custody for an indefinite period of time.yang tsui,wl.absent an intent by yang to transfer custody,a requirement that tsui expert testified was necessary and to be determined by a judge,it can not be said that the parties had an agreement as required under section b to create custody rights in tsui.therefore,section b is inapplicable to this case.
we now turn to section c,and we must determine who raeann usually resided with at the date of retention.on appeal,tsui does not contest,nor can he,that raeann usually resided with yang prior to the date of retention.the district court held that raeann usually resided with yang,and it is clear from the record that it was correct.in fact,for most of her life raeann resided solely with her mother.from april until the end of october,yang and raeann resided in british columbia.the time that raeann spent at tsui house in pittsburgh from october,until november,can not be said to constitute her usual residence.based on the facts of this case,yang is clearly the parent with whom raeann usually resided.therefore,under section c,yang had exclusive custody rights within the meaning of the convention.
as we have determined that yang in fact had custody of raeann,we now reach the final question in the wrongful retention analysis whether she was exercising those rights at the time of retention.under this prong,yang burden is easy because the test for finding the of custody rights under the hague convention is stringent.baxter,at internal citation omitted.v ery little is required of the applicant in support of the allegation that custody rights have actually been or would have been exercised.adan,at quoting hague int l child abduction convention text and legal analysis,hereinafter hague convention analysis.the petitioner can show the exercise of custody rights by demonstrating that he or she kept or sought to keep,some sort of regular contact with the child.baxter,at.essentially,nothing short of clear and unequivocal abandonment will prove that the petitioner failed to exercise his or her custodial rights.id.
the evidence in this case clearly meets the standard.yang attempted to speak with raeann whenever possible,even when she was in the hospital.when she was out of the hospital she spoke with raeann every day,until tsui limited the calls to every other day.therefore,she kept or attempted to keep some sort of regular contact with raeann.nothing in the record suggests that yang clearly or unequivocally abandoned raeann.therefore,yang exercised her custody rights.
tsui argues that yang was unable to exercise her custody rights because of her illness.that is,he claims that yang was not able to take care of raeann from the end of october until the date of retention,and even after that period.however,this is not sufficient to refute yang evidence that she exercised her custody rights.as the test for finding the of custody is stringent,yang illness simply does not meet that high bar.
we hold that yang proved by a preponderance of the evidence that tsui wrongfully retained raeann within the meaning of article.as there was a wrongful retention,the convention dictates that raeann must be returned to canada.hague convention,however,the convention also gives the district court the discretion to deny such an order for a variety of reasons.hague convention.the respondent has the burden of proving that the child should not be returned for one of the enumerated exceptions listed in article.karkkainen,at.if the respondent proves one of the affirmative defenses,it is within the discretion of the district court to refuse to order the child be returned to his or her habitual residence.id.
on appeal,tsui maintains that he proved the wishes of the child defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that the district court abused its discretion by entering the order for raeann to be returned to canada despite such proof.although we have not previously considered this defense,we believe that the district court did not err by refusing to apply the defense.therefore,we will affirm the order mandating that raeann be returned to canada despite her desire to remain in the united states.
article includes what has been called the wishes of the child defense or exception.the convention provides 
the judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.
hague convention.as with any of the affirmative defenses under the convention,this defense is to be construed narrowly.see england england,cir.the exceptions are construed narrowly so their application does not undermine the express purposes of the convention.feder,at.additionally,even if the respondent meets his or her burden of proving the affirmative defense,the court retains the discretion to order the return of the child if it would further the aim of the convention which is to provide for the return of a wrongfully removed child.de silva pitts,cir internal citations omitted see also feder,at.
although we have not previously considered this defense,we agree with the analysis used by other courts that have addressed its application.the child wishes can be the sole reason that a court refuses to order the return of the child to his or her habitual residence.see blondin dubois,cir internal citations omitted.however,a court must apply a stricter standard in considering a child wishes when those wishes are the sole reason underlying a repatriation decision and not part of some broader analysis,such as whether the child would suffer a grave risk of harm if returned to his or her habitual residence.de silva,at.
