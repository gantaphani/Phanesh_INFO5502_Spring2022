sagi barzilay appeals from the district court dismissal of his petition under the international child abduction remedies act icara,et,and the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention.the petition claimed that sagi former wife,tamar,had wrongfully retained their three children in missouri,where they had lived since,and sought an order compelling their relocation to israel.we remanded to the district court for its consideration of the merits of the petition in barzilay barzilay,cir.the district court dismissed the petition after determining that the children country of habitual residence within the meaning of the hague convention was the united states and that their retention in missouri was therefore not wrongful.sagi timely appealed,and we affirm.
sagi and tamar,both israeli citizens,were married in israel in the eldest of their three children,born in israel in,is also an israeli citizen.in,sagi and tamar obtained american work visas through their employer and moved with their first child to missouri from the netherlands,where they had resided for approximately two years.the younger two barzilay children were born in missouri,in and.they hold dual israeli and american citizenship.tamar and the children have resided in missouri since.the eldest child has not lived in israel since her early years the younger two have never lived there.
in january a missouri state court dissolved sagi and tamar marriage.the divorce decree awarded them joint physical and legal custody of the children and incorporated a written parenting plan.the parenting plan specified that tamar would have primary parental responsibility and physical custody of the children.it also included the following provision referred to below as the repatriation agreement 
in the event either party leaves missouri to return to the state of israel,and regardless of whether such move is voluntary or involuntary on her or his part,the other party shall forthwith take such steps to move back to israel so that husband and wife and the children shall reside within the same country.
sagi moved back to israel in september and soon began pressuring tamar to comply with the repatriation agreement.tamar resisted committing to a definite timeline,but agreed to take the children to israel for a summer visit in june.she planned to return with them to missouri on july.
while tamar and the children were visiting israel,sagi sought and obtained an ex parte order from the family court in kfar saba prohibiting the removal of the children from the country.he argued that tamar had violated the repatriation agreement by failing to make arrangements to move back to israel with the children and sought to compel her compliance.at or about the same time,he filed a petition in the kfar saba court under the hague convention.tamar retained israeli counsel and,after intensive negotiations,the parties reached an agreement only hours before she and the children were to catch their flight back to missouri.sagi withdrew his pending claims,and the kfar saba court gave the parties agreement referred to here as the consent judgment the status of a verdict.
the consent judgment provided,inter alia,that tamar and the children would repatriate to israel by august,and that failing to do so could be regarded as kidnapping as stated in the hague treaty.it also provided that tamar would not take any further action in the missouri family court and that the sole and only international authority in regards to the minors immigration,repatriation and custody shall be the authority of the court in kfar saba.
tamar now asserts that her assent to the consent judgment was coerced,that she signed it only so she would be allowed to leave israel with the children,and that she never intended to abide by its terms.nor did she.sagi therefore returned to the kfar saba court in december,seeking an order of contempt because tamar had refused to permit the children to visit israel in accordance with the consent judgment.tamar challenged the validity of the judgment,but the kfar saba court held her in contempt and its decision was affirmed on appeal.
meanwhile,tamar petitioned the missouri court to remove the repatriation agreement from the original custody decree and limit sagi visitation rights.sagi challenged the missouri court jurisdiction,but it nevertheless modified the custody decree in tamar favor 
sagi commenced this action by filing an icara petition in the district court in october,claiming that israel was the children state of habitual residence within the meaning of the hague convention and seeking an order compelling them to move there.the district court determined that these claims had been raised in the missouri court and therefore abstained from reaching the merits of the petition.we reversed,concluding that the hague convention issues had not been properly raised or fully addressed in the state court and that abstention was consequently inappropriate.see barzilay,at.we therefore remanded to the district court for consideration of the merits.after an evidentiary hearing and argument on the hague convention issues,the district court determined that the children country of habitual residence was the united states.because retention of a child in the state of its habitual residence is not wrongful under the convention,it dismissed sagi petition.
sagi timely appealed.his primary argument on appeal is that the repatriation agreement in the missouri custody decree and the consent judgment from the kfar saba court conclusively establish that the children state of habitual residence is israel,and that the district court erred in failing to give effect to these agreements.
determination of habitual residence under the hague convention raises mixed questions of law and fact,and we therefore review the district court decision de novo.sorenson sorenson,cir citing silverman silverman,cir en banc.we defer to the district court underlying factual findings,however,unless they are clearly erroneous.id.
the hague convention,to which the united states and israel are both signatories,was adopted to address the problem of child abduction by family members,which not infrequently occurs in connection with transnational custody disputes.the convention purpose is to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,preamble,concluded.the convention seeks to deter abduction by depriv ing the abductor actions of any practical or juridical consequences.elisa,explanatory report,in hague conference on private int l law,acts and documents of the fourteenth session,child abduction,report it accomplishes this goal not by establishing any substantive law of custody,but rather by acting as a forum selection mechanism,operating on the principle that the child country of habitual residence is best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access.villegas duran arribada beaumont,cir quoting report at.the purpose of proceedings under the hague convention is thus not to establish or enforce custody rights,but only to provide for a reasoned determination of where jurisdiction over a custody dispute is properly placed.barzilay,at quoting yang tsui,cir.
in the united states,a person invokes the protections of the convention by filing a petition in state or federal court under icara.a,b.the court then shall decide the case in accordance with the convention.id.d.the petitioner bears the burden of proving that the child has been wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention.id.e a.
the key inquiry under the convention is whether a child has been wrongfully removed from the country of its habitual residence or wrongfully retained in a country other than that of its habitual residence.barzilay,at.according to the convention,
the removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention.
thus,in order to determine whether an icara petition merits relief,a court must determine when the removal or retention took place,what the habitual residence of the child was immediately prior to the removal,whether the removal or retention violated the petitioner custody rights under the law of the habitual residence,and whether the petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of the removal or retention.barzilay,at citing mozes mozes,cir.once it is determined that a child who was habitually residing in a contracting state was wrongfully removed to or retained in another,the convention requires that the country in which the child is located order the return of the child forthwith.id.quoting hague convention.
proceedings under the hague convention and icara do not reach the merits of an underlying custody dispute.see hague convention a decision under this convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.b the convention and this chapter empower courts in the united states to determine only rights under the convention and not the merits of any underlying child custody claims.rather,t he district court is to ascertain only whether the removal or retention of a child was wrongful under the law of the child habitual residence,and if so,to order the return of the child to the place of habitual residence for the court there to decide the merits of the custody dispute.barzilay,at quoting shalit coppe,cir.
as the district court correctly understood,this case turns on the determination of the children habitual residence,for the retention of a child in the state of its habitual residence is not wrongful under the convention.see silverman,at.because the barzilay children had lived in missouri for approximately five years before their alleged wrongful retention commenced,the district court concluded their country of habitual residence was the united states.the court factual findings,which we accept unless clearly erroneous,sorenson,at,unequivocally support that conclusion.the district court therefore did not err in dismissing the petition.
the first step in determining a child habitual residence is to discern when the alleged wrongful removal or retention took place,for the text of the convention directs courts to only one point in time in determining habitual residence the point in time immediately before the removal or retention.silverman,at quoting hague convention.because this case does not present the typical abduction scenario,it is not entirely clear when the alleged wrongful retention commenced based on sagi testimony and a series of emails exchanged between the parties,the district court determined that it began in early spring,by which time sagi had informed tamar that he considered her to be in breach of the repatriation agreement.
we agree with the district court reasoning.the alleged wrongful retention must have begun between september,when sagi moved back to israel,and sagi filing in the kfar saba court,when he first formally asserted his rights under the convention.no more precise answer is necessary,for there was no significant change in the children living arrangements during that period of time.
having concluded that the alleged wrongful retention began in early,the district court proceeded to consider the factors relevant to the determination of habitual residence the settled purpose of the move to the new country from the child perspective,parental intent regarding the move,the change in geography,the passage of time,and the acclimatization of the child to the new country.barzilay,at citing silverman,at.
the settled purpose of a family move to a new country is a central element of the habitual residence inquiry.silverman,at.this settled purpose need not be to stay in a new location forever,but the family must have a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled.additionally,the settled purpose must be from the child perspective,although parental intent is also taken into account.id.quoting feder,cir.because two of the barzilay children had lived their whole lives in missouri,the eldest had lived there for five years,and there was no indication in the record that the children had spent any significant amount of time in another country,the district court concluded that from the children perspective,the settled purpose of the family residence in missouri was to remain there permanently.
as the district court noted,the intent of the parents in this case is less clear.sagi and tamar moved to the united states on temporary work visas,and it is therefore uncertain whether they intended to remain here permanently.nevertheless,because the record did not indicate that the family maintained a home or other property in israel nor did it disclose any other evidence of an intention to return to israel,the district court concluded that sagi and tamar abandoned their prior habitual residences when they moved to missouri and intended to stay there indefinitely.see id.district court should consider the family abandoning its prior residence and selling the house mozes,at if you lived continuously in the same place for several years on end,we would be to conclude that you had not abandoned any prior habitual residence.the district court also considered the repatriation agreement as potential evidence of the parties intent.since the agreement was conditional and gave no indication of actual intent to move back to israel at a particular time,however,the court concluded that it was not an expression of settled intent,but rather a precautionary measure.
finally,the district court considered the change in geography,the passage of time,and the acclimatization of the child ren to the new country.barzilay,at.it concluded that the children were well acclimatized to life in the united states.the eldest child was,after all,the only one who had experienced a significant change in geography,and by she had been in the united states for approximately five of her life.the younger two had lived their entire lives in missouri.in addition,the children of school age had been attending school in the united states none of them had gone to school in israel.
based on the foregoing considerations,we agree with the district court conclusion that the children country of habitual residence under the hague convention was the united states.sagi has pointed to no evidence suggesting the district court factual findings are clearly erroneous or that its analysis is otherwise unsound.indeed,he has offered no evidence that his children have spent any significant amount of time outside the united states since or that they have been given any reason to believe their home is anywhere but missouri.the united states is the country where the barzilay children have spent most or all of their young lives,and there can be little question that it is consequently their habitual residence within the meaning of the hague convention.see sorenson,at child habitual residence was the country where she had spent the overwhelming majority of her life and had the majority of her connections.
indeed,sagi does not seriously challenge the district court habitual residence determination on factual grounds.rather,he argues that he and tamar in the missouri repatriation agreement and in the kfar saba consent the children country of habitual residence was israel,and that the district court erred in failing to give effect to these agreements.sagi offers two distinct theories in support of this argument.first,he claims that the kfar saba consent judgment renders the matter of habitual residence res judicata and was entitled to recognition in the district court.second,he argues that these agreements as to habitual residence should be enforceable in the manner of contracts.
we reject both argument
