in this delinquency case welf,mother of,appeals from the august,order that followed a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on appeal,she challenges only the court appointment of a guardian ad litem gal for her and its failure to hold a hearing regarding replacement of her appointed counsel.
we conclude that the record supports the trial court appointment of a gal for mother and its failure to conduct a full inquiry was not reversible error.accordingly,we affirm.

at the march,trial setting hearing,the juvenile court stated for the record that mother counsel had informed the court that it was necessary to hold a sara hearing regarding appointment of a gal or a marsden hearing or both.the court stated that it had determined that the sara hearing should be first to make sure that the mother is competent to even question the competence of her attorney.the matter was continued until april.
on april,mother counsel informed the court at this point in the procedure the mother and i have run into a conflict,and our understanding of one another.and i do believe that she would benefit from the assistance of a guardian ad litem in terms of making legal decisions and legal strategy.i understand from communications between mother and myself as well as mother and my employer,that she does not want a guardian ad litem and wants another attorney appointed to represent her.so she like to be heard on that.
the court reiterated that the sara hearing would be conducted first.it stated i need to make a determination of your client competency which has a bearing on the second question of whether or not you should continue with your representation.
following a separate,closed hearing with mother and her counsel regarding whether to appoint a gal,the court determined that mother required a gal and appointed a gal.it did not hold a hearing.
the department filed a report,dated february,which reported that was currently residing with father.it recommended that the court sustain the second amended petition and place with father under the department supervision with family maintenance services and order no services for mother because the provision of such services is not in the best interests of the child.
sheri terao october report concerning the psychological evaluation of mother was filed with the report.the report indicated that mother social and emotional functioning was primarily afflicted by the presence of prominent delusions.terao had diagnosed mother with schizophrenia,paranoid type.the report stated for many years,mother has developed a belief system that her husband and another woman are stalking her and have brought harm both physical and emotional to her and her daughter.mother delusions have a bizarre quality to them as many of her beliefs may be regarded as totally implausible.it disclosed that mother is firmly entrenched in her delusional belief system and lacks insight into her mental health condition

discussiona.guardian ad.hearing 
at the april,hearing regarding appointment of a gal,the court explained a gal role and the standards for appointment.it told mother that her counsel believed that she was not able to assist him in the preparation of the case and she did not really understand the nature of the proceedings.mother counsel proceeded to explain his concerns.
counsel indicated that he had met with mother on more than one occasion.he pointed out that a number of the petition allegations concerned mother mental health.counsel indicated that the dispositional recommendations were that the child should be placed with father and any visitation should be supervised and conditioned upon mother regular participation in psychiatric treatment and compliance with medication.mother had disagreed with the allegations and claimed she did not need medication.counsel believed that mother would not be able to competently proceed through these very complex jurisdictional and dispositional issues unless she was taking medication and addressing the mental health concerns.
mother complained to the juvenile court that she had never seen her counsel in his office except on february.she stated that he had sent her an through his cell phone and told her it was better to send him an.the court indicated that the focus at the moment was her mental health.mother stated that she did not believe that she was delusional and she did not believe the petition.
mother counsel referred to the psychological assessment of mother conducted by terao.he stated that terao was very clear that mother has serious mental health needs and without medication she is not able to understand the difference between facts as the majority of people are experiencing them and the way that she is experiencing the world around her.he indicated that it was impossible to have a competent intelligible kind of a legal conversation.counsel believed mother had her daughter best interest at heart but he could not continue to work with mother without a third party who could work with mother and understand what he need ed to do to move forward with this case.
mother stated that her therapist believed that she was not delusional and terao diagnosis was invalid.mother mentioned that counsel had previously not responded to her email about an upcoming hearing,she had sent a second email,and then counsel had answered.mother was unhappy because she felt that her attorney did not understand her email request for extra visits to make up for visits missed due to health problems and he did not speak up for her on this matter on march,mother complained my counsel claims that i disabled mentally.so i supervised with my child if he thinks that i dangerous.and it a supervise sic visitation and makeup visitation very reasonable to lift up a sick mother.i was feeling well,your honor,and i had broken foot.so i was getting any help from my counsel that i was thinking that is not good for our relationship,your honor 
the juvenile court brought up mother allegations over many years that she and her daughter had been raped on a daily basis by people who had broken into mother home.the court asked mother,do you believe people have broken into your home mother initially responded your honor,when my windows i was my landlord is upset because the window cracked and the latch to the other one.and there now,my landlord is upset with me.he says is it was like that,my house and i have the too.so i did do that.i did see anybody in my house,your honor.in the face of meandering,nonresponsive and sometimes unintelligible replies,the court persisted in its questioning.
when the court again asked mother if she believed there are people breaking into her home,mother answered,i have a suspicion,yes.the court asked whether those people were drugging her and mother responded that she did not see it.the court pressed,do you believe that people have been drugging you mother answered,well,my doctor,yes,he said that.the court asked,your family doctor said someone has been drugging you mother replied,he did layout like that,but he talked in a different way.in a different many many years and he also gave some many years to the court.we have these in the records,his letters.
mother admitted that,although she had not seen it,she did believe that people had been breaking into each of her homes over the years and explained,i have many items that are broken in my house and i have lost property when the court asked if the police had ever arrested anybody for breaking into her home,mother answered,i have never seen,but i see the doors are cracked.my properties are ruined.and i have properties are important,your honor.i have lost them.i do have them right now many of them.
even though mother had not seen it and she could not be absolutely sure,mother believed that her current neighbor had broken into her house and drugged her multiple times.mother had reported the neighbor,who had been interviewed by police.
after mother indicated that she was honest,the court asked,what is it that you have been reporting that people do believe mother replied this breaking and entering in such my car has been vandalized even in felony level over damage in my car.and i have the paperwork through the insurance.i also had a hate crime in the internet that a valid hate crime in the internet.the court inquired,what happened mother said,somebody was threatening to kill me clearly.and i print that out and forwarded it to the officers.i have a valid report.the court said,okay.mother then stated,so this thing that i was thinking of my car is being in and inside the engine.and the the inside of the car engine and outside also was damaged,and it continued wherever i moved.i have the reports,your honor.these things regarding what i talking.
at one point,mother indicated that she was still waking up with pain in her vagina.mother later admitted reporting that people had broken into her home and raped her and her daughter.she indicated that she believed it happened at night when she went to sleep.
mother said that she had woken up with her ribs hurting one day and had gone to a hospital emergency room.when later asked whether she believed someone broke in at night and raped her and her daughter during december,mother indicated that her chest and ribs were hurting and a burning sensation was coming over even her mouth when the doctors asked her if she had an injury,she said no.when the juvenile court asked whether she believed somebody came in at night and raped her,mother replied,no,my chest was hurting,somebody hit me.
mother indicated that her counsel had sent her an email asking her to agree to a gal and she felt that counsel had already made up his mind even before he ordered an independent evaluation of her.mother said that her therapist did not agree with her counsel.when the court asked if she agreed with the report assessment,mother replied,the assessor has told me that it was in his report,you know,i not agreeing in short time.he not sure either.and if i am reading it in the medication or not that my understanding out of i reading and he because he said it a short time.
mother indicated that she was able to make her own decisions and her attorney and she were thinking different.she stated,request another different attorney so i that can talk to communicate better.
the juvenile court concluded that a gal was necessary for mother,stating i do believe that we are going to be able to make any progress in this case given mother sort of clutching to this belief of what has happened to her repeatedly and over the course of years when there no evidence of that happening.
the court did not hold a marsden hearing.the court explained that the court did not believe that mother was competent to decide whether she needed a substitute attorney based on its assessment of her mental health throughout our conversation and her ability to be in touch with reality with regard to the specific allegations before the court.
governing law 
in a dependency case,a parent who is mentally incompetent must appear through a guardian ad litem,to whom the parent yields management and control of the litigation.in re daniel th,in re sara th,before appointing a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding,however,the juvenile court must hold an informal hearing at which the purpose and powers of a guardian ad litem and the reasons for believing the parent incompetent are explained to the parent and,if the parent does not consent to the guardian ad litem appointment,the parent is given an opportunity to argue that a guardian ad litem is not required.in re sara,supra,at,in re james cal th.

sufficiency of the evidence to show incompetence as legally defined 
at the hearing on whether to appoint a gal,mother competency only under penal code section was at issue.mother asserts there was not substantial evidence that she was incompetent and the error in appointing a gal was not harmless.mother does not assert that she was deprived of procedural due process with respect to the appointment.
mother insists that the court conversation with her about whether or not she believed someone was breaking into her house was not indicative that she did not understand the nature of the proceedings or would be unable to assist her attorney.she argues that the juvenile court mistook that preliminary finding of mental illness as necessitating a guardian ad litem.she suggests that the department finds her answers unintelligible because turkish is her native language and her english sentence structure is often imperfect.
regardless of the language difficulties,mother unsupported statements regarding people repeatedly entering her residences or car and doing injury to her and her daughter indicated that she was still suffering from a mental disorder involving delusions and paranoid beliefs.as stated in the commentary to standard of the american bar association criminal justice mental health standards,an relationship requires the defendant to have an ability to discuss the facts of a case with counsel without paranoid distrust,a capacity to advise and accept advice from counsel and an ability to consult rationally about a pending case which is something more than a superficial capacity to converse with others.aba crim.justice mental health stds.ed.com.to std,fns.omitted.
based upon its exchange with mother and her counsel at the closed hearing,the juvenile court could reasonably infer from mother remarks that she could not rationally confer with her counsel about the facts or rationally assist him with the case and she could not rationally give and take advice regarding legal strategy.mother responses indicated that she was still delusional and did not appreciate her own mental health problems that had led to the commencement of the dependency proceeding.substantial evidence shows that mother was incompetent as legally defined for purposes of appointing a gal and she needed a gal to protect her interests.
request to substitute counsel 
mother asserts that the court erred in failing to hold a hearing and,therefore,this court should remand the matter for a hearing to determine whether the juvenile court should have appointed new counsel to replace mother appointed counsel.
governing law 
because a basic civil right of the parent is thus at stake in re marilyn cal th,significant due process safeguards have been built into the dependency scheme id.at,including a right to counsel for a parent who can not afford to retain counsel welf.in re james,supra,cal th at.all parties who are represented by counsel at dependency proceedings shall be entitled to competent counsel,subd.a see of court,rule d.
juvenile courts,relying on the marsden model,have permitted the parents,who have a statutory and a due process right to competent counsel,to air their complaints about appointed counsel and request new counsel be appointed.in re james d,fn.in re th,see in re th,marsden principles apply by analogy to dependency proceedings.
in marsden,the california supreme court stated a trial judge is unable to intelligently deal with a defendant request for substitution of attorneys unless he is cognizant of the grounds which prompted the request.the defendant may have knowledge of conduct and events relevant to the diligence and competence of his attorney which are not apparent to the trial judge from observations within the four corners of the courtroom thus,a judge who denies a motion for substitution of attorneys solely on the basis of his courtroom observations,despite a defendant offer to relate specific instances of misconduct,abuses the exercise of his discretion to determine the competency of the attorney.a judicial decision made without giving a party an opportunity to present argument or evidence in support of his contention is lacking in all the attributes of a judicial determination.citation.marsden,supra,cal d at.it concluded because the defendant might have catalogued acts and events beyond the observations of the trial judge to establish the incompetence of his counsel,the trial judge denial of the motion without giving defendant an opportunity to do so denied him a fair trial.we can not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this denial of the effective assistance of counsel did not contribute to the defendant conviction.chapman california,d.id.at.
thus,w hen a criminal defendant seeks new counsel on the basis that his appointed counsel is providing inadequate representation the trial court must permit the defendant to explain the basis of his contention and to relate specific instances of inadequate performance.people smith cal th.a t any time during criminal proceedings,if a defendant requests substitute counsel,the trial court is obligated,pursuant to the holding in marsden,to give the defendant an opportunity to state any grounds for dissatisfaction with the current appointed attorney.marsden,supra,cal d at people sanchez cal th,fn.omitted.a marsden inquiry is in the sense that counsel would be substituted in order to provide effective assistance in the future.people smith cal th.
even where a trial court has suspended criminal proceedings pending a hearing on defendant competency to stand trial see,a trial court may and indeed must promptly consider a motion for substitution of counsel when the right to effective assistance would be substantially impaired if his request were ignored.citation.people stankewitz cal d.in people solorzano th,a trial court refused to immediately hold a marsden hearing when defendant complained about his counsel and indicated that he wanted to fire him during a hearing concerning defendant competency.id.at.on appeal,the reviewing court concluded that the defendant request triggered the court duty to hold a marsden hearing before deciding defendant competency to stand trial.id.at.it reversed the judgment since it could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure to make an immediate marsden inquiry had not contributed to the court determination that defendant was competent to stand trial.id.at.
in people taylor cal th,the california supreme court distinguished solorzano from case before it.the court stated this is not a case like people solorzano th,in which the trial court refused to hold any marsden hearing until after the results of a competency hearing.in solorzano,the defendant complaints about his counsel pertained to counsel deficiencies in handling the competency hearing,at which,over defendant objection,he was adjudged competent.on these facts,the court of appeal concluded it could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the error had not affected the competency hearing outcome.id.at id.at.
the marsden decision was intended to afford protection to the criminal defendant right to counsel as guaranteed by the sixth amendment people martinez cal th,see gideon wainwright.sixth amendment right to counsel applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment.t he sixth amendment does not govern civil cases.turner rogers us.
failure to hold a separate hearing 
we assume for purposes of this appeal that mother had a federal due process right to effective assistance of counsel but see lassiter department of social servs.of durham cty.as evaluated under strickland standards see.in re jackson th,in re th.in this case,however,mother has neither raised an ineffective assistance claim nor claimed she received deficient representation.further,the mere failure to conduct a separate hearing does not demonstrate a constitutional deprivation of effective assistance of counsel under strickland.
strickland washington,supra,which the supreme court handed down after california marsden decision,established that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of both deficient performance and prejudice id.at see mickens taylor.as a general matter,a defendant alleging a sixth amendment violation must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,at.
here,the sole question is whether the juvenile court failure to conduct a separate inquiry in this case was error and requires a remand.although mother clearly indicated that she wanted a substitute attorney,we think it is inappropriate to rigidly and unthinkingly apply marsden and its progeny to dependency proceedings.
under the circumstances of this case,the juvenile court had a good idea of the reasons for mother dissatisfaction with counsel.mother had mentioned her counsel failure to meet with her in his office more than once,his failure to respond to an email,his failure to request makeup visits at a hearing scheduled for trial setting,and his belief that she had a mental disability.mother was unhappy that her counsel had asked for her agreement to appointment of a gal and she felt that counsel had prejudged her.she indicated that they thought differently and she wished to have another attorney with whom she could communicate better.
a defendant may not effectively veto an appointment of counsel by claiming a lack of trust in,or inability to get along with,the appointed attorney.people berryman cal th,moreover,the trial court need not conclude that an irreconcilable conflict exists if the defendant has not tried to work out any disagreements with counsel and has not given counsel a fair opportunity to demonstrate trustworthiness.people barnett cal th,people smith,supra,cal th at.a defendant may not force the substitution of counsel by his own conduct that manufactures a conflict.people smith cal th.ibid.t actical disagreements between a defendant and his attorney or a defendant frustration with counsel are not sufficient cause for substitution of counsel.people jackson cal th,people barnett cal th,people streeter cal th.in addition,the number of times one sees her attorney,and the way in which one relates with her attorney,does not sufficiently establish incompetence.people silva cal d.
none of mother complaints indicated that her counsel was not providing adequate representation or that counsel and she were embroiled in such an irreconcilable conflict that ineffective representation would likely result.in the criminal context,where a court holds a marsden hearing,it does not abuse its discretion in denying the motion unless the defendant has shown that a failure to replace counsel would substantially impair the defendant right to assistance of counsel.citation.people smith,supra,cal th at.
here,the juvenile court could reasonably conclude that appointment of a gal would address mother complaints.even though the court did not hold a separate hearing,reversal under the circumstances of this case would unnecessarily undermine the strong public interest in prompt resolution of dependency cases so that the children may receive loving and secure home environments as soon as reasonably possible.citations.in re james,supra,cal th at.
different interests are at stake in criminal prosecutions and dependency proceedings.the rights and protections afforded parents in a dependency proceeding are not the same as those afforded to the accused in a criminal proceeding.for example,a juvenile court may rely on hearsay contained in a social worker report to support a jurisdictional finding in a dependency case,although such evidence could not be used to establish guilt in a criminal proceeding.see in re malinda cal d,also,unlike a defendant in a criminal proceeding,a parent at a dependency hearing can not assert the fourth amendment exclusionary rule,since the potential harm to children in allowing them to remain in an unhealthy environment outweighs any deterrent effect which would result from suppressing evidence unlawfully seized.in re mary d,in re james,supra,cal th at.
it is well established that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.drope missouri,d pate robinson,d.medina california.unlike criminal prosecutions,dependency proceedings go forward even if a parent is legally incompetent.in fact,as in this case,it may be the parent underlying mental health problems that create the need for exercising dependency jurisdiction in the first place.
dependency proceedings are not designed to prosecute parents.citations.in a dependency proceeding,the state is empowered to intervene because a parent inadequacy puts a child at risk.in re nolan cal th.the state has a legitimate interest in dependency proceedings in providing an expedited proceeding to resolve the child status without further delay.in re malinda cal d.
in this case,we think the court had sufficient information to reasonably believe that any communication problems between attorney and client would be resolved by the appointment of a gal and counsel was providing effective assistance.we believe the juvenile court soundly exercised its discretion in appointing a gal for mother and then concluding that a separate inquiry was no longer necessary.
mother has not provided any authority establishing,and has not asserted,that a federal constitutional procedural due process violation occurs when a juvenile court fails to hold a separate hearing in the present situation.although we assume that mother had a due process right to counsel,it does not appear that the dictates of due process also demanded a inquiry in order to ensure the fundamental fairness of this dependency proceeding.see mathews eldridge.see also lassiter,supra,at.
even if the juvenile court was required to conduct a hearing as a matter of state law,the procedural error did not result in a miscarriage of justice.see cal,art.vi,people watson cal d,in re celine cal th,failure to appoint separate attorneys for children in re kristin th,violation of parent statutory right to effective assistance of counsel.it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to mother would have been reached had the juvenile court conducted a separate hearing in this case.
the record strongly suggests that the mother complaints about counsel were related to her serious mental health issues and appointment of a gal would remedy the situation.impliedly it did,since the record does not show that mother gal requested substitution of counsel or filed a written complaint about him see cal.rules of court,rule e super.santa clara county,local rules,juv.rule d a.in the absence of evidence to the contrary,we presume that mother gal acted zealously to preserve mother interests.see in re james,supra,cal th at denham superior court cal d.as indicated,on appeal,mother has not asserted an ineffective assistance claim or challenged the court august,findings or order.under these circumstances,we find no basis for remanding the matter for a hearing.
