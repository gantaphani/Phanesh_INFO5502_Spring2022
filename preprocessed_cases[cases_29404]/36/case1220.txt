discussion 
the department contends the siskiyou juvenile court erred in transferring this matter to the karuk tribal court,because the tribe did not follow the procedures set forth in the icwa,which ensure that the tribe has the ability to handle child custody cases.for reasons we explain,the procedures of section do not apply to this case.

at the heart of the icwa are its provisions concerning jurisdiction over indian child custody proceedings.section lays out a dual jurisdictional scheme.section a establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal courts for proceedings concerning an indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe,as well as for wards of tribal courts regardless of domicile.mississippi band,supra,at.fn.omitted.
