civil rights 
the panel affirmed the district court denial,on summary judgment,of absolute and qualified immunity to social workers who plaintiff alleged maliciously used perjured testimony and fabricated evidence to secure plaintiff removal from her mother,and that this abuse of state power violated her fourth and fourteenth amendment constitutional rights to her familial relationship with her mother.
the panel held that the social workers were not entitled to absolute immunity from claims that they maliciously used perjured testimony and fabricated evidence to secure plaintiff removal.the panel held that plaintiff complaint targeted conduct well outside of the social workers legitimate role as advocates in presenting the case.
the panel held that defendants case for qualified immunity was not supported by the law or the record.the panel determined that plaintiff produced more than sufficient admissible evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether her removal from her mother custody violated her constitutional rights.the panel further stated that it could not conceive of circumstances in which social workers would not know and understand that they could not use criminal behavior in any court setting to interfere with a person fundamental constitutional liberty interest.

exposition 
pursuant to an order of the superior court of orange county california,arising from acrimonious juvenile dependency proceedings,deanna lost custody of her minor children,preslie and kendall.in this subsequent civil rights action brought under,preslie hardwick sued the county and employees of its social services agency ssa.she contends that the social worker employees acting under color of state law maliciously used perjured testimony and fabricated evidence to secure her removal from her mother,and that this abuse of state power violated her fourth and fourteenth amendment constitutional rights to her familial relationship with her mother.
in a motion for summary judgment,the individual defendants unsuccessfully raised absolute and qualified immunity as shields against this action.they appeal,claiming,among other things,that the law preslie accuses them of violating was not clearly established at the time their allegedly wrongful conduct occurred.harlow fitzgerald.
we have jurisdiction over this timely interlocutory appeal pursuant to,nixon fitzgerald,absolute immunity,and mitchell forsyth,qualified immunity.we affirm.
background 
this lawsuit is not the first stemming from the implosion of preslie family.her mother,deanna,successfully sued some of the social workers in state court for the same conduct and pursuant to the same legal theory,and she recovered a sizable sum in damages plus attorneys fees.see county of orange,no,wl,at cal.app.june,remanding to trial court with directions to strike injunctive relief from the judgment and affirming judgment in all other respects.to quote the california court of appeal,
in this case,the jury specifically concluded that vreeken and dwojak lied,falsified evidence and suppressed exculpatory evidence all of which was material to the dependency court decision to deprive of custody and that they did so with malice.these findings are clearly sufficient to satisfy the supreme court definition of circumstances in which qualified immunity would not be available.
the court of appeal also acknowledged the defendants collective admission on appeal that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the social workers committed egregious acts of misconduct in the dependency case.id.at.the court said,as the county concedes,demonstrated if the testimony is to be believed that in this one instance,social workers lied and fabricated evidence in connection with the dependency proceedings relating to her children.id.at,alteration in original.
scope and standard of review 
this matter comes to us as an interlocutory appeal involving only legal issues regarding the employees claims of an entitlement to immunity from this lawsuit.we do not comment on or express any opinions about the merits of the case.those are ultimately for the district court to resolve.in this context,however,and because they are supported by the record as a whole,we construe the facts preslie offers in support of her allegations in the light most favorable to her.scott harris.accordingly,we proceed to review de novo the legal issues that are before us.white city of sparks,cir.grant of partial summary judgment reviewed de novo.
absolute immunity 
absolute immunity from private lawsuits covers the official activities of social workers only when they perform or functions in juvenile dependency court.miller gammie,cir.en banc.the factor that determines whether absolute immunity covers a social worker activity or function under scrutiny is whether it was investigative or administrative,on one hand,or part and parcel of presenting the state case as a generic advocate on the other.absolute immunity is available only if the function falls into the latter category.see id.at.
here,preslie tells us that the social workers malicious activities about which she complains are as follows 
the allegedly false statements and omissions made in defendants court reports continuously submitted by them from february,through the termination of the dependency proceedings 
the statements made by the defendant social workers during an off the record discussion on february,and during an on the record discussion that same day where the social workers allegedly lied but not while under oath to the commissioner overseeing the dependency proceeding,triggering preslie seizure 
the alleged fabrication of evidence throughout the dependency proceedings and repeated suppression of exculpatory evidence in defendants written court reports and 
defendants corrupt recommendations that preslie continue to be detained even though defendants allegedly knew they were lying to the court about the basis for the initial seizure and subsequent detention.
to be specific,the defendants actions preslie intends to prove as false and fabricated include telling the dependency court on february,that deanna had caused her daughters to skip a mandatory visit with their father,when in fact the problem was caused by a visitation monitor,hector delgadillo advising the court that deanna was responsible for turning her children against the monitor and telling the court that deanna had told her children that their father was trying to take them away from her when in reality it was defendant vreeken who had made inappropriate comments to the children,including the threat that if they did not visit their father,they would be put in a home.
on the basis of this alleged misinformation,the dependency court concluded that deanna was using her children.accordingly,the court immediately removed the girls from her custody and turned them over to the ssa and the defendants.preslie and her sister were sent to the orangewood children home.on february,the court authorized the return of the girls to their mother custody,but the social workers refused and placed them instead in foster care where they remained until may.
preslie complaint targets conduct well outside of the social workers legitimate role as advocates in presenting the case.our opinion in beltran santa clara county,cir.en banc per curiam disposes of this issue.we held in beltran that social workers may well have absolute immunity when discharging functions that are critical to the judicial process itself,b ut they are not entitled to absolute immunity from claims that they fabricated evidence during an investigation or made false statements in a dependency petition affidavit that they signed under penalty of perjury,because such actions are similar to discretionary decisions about whether to prosecute.at quoting miller,at.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial to these defendants of absolute immunity.
qualified estoppel 
preslie claims collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,against these defendants on the ground that qualified immunity was conclusively litigated to a final decision in california courts,in which they did not prevail.however,because we come to the same conclusion as the state courts,we need not decide whether offensive collateral estoppel bars these defendants from raising qualified immunity in their defense.see jordan city of lake oswego,cir.rayner nlrb,cir.
preslie constitutional rights 
parents and children have a constitutional right to live together without governmental interference.that right is an essential liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment guarantee that parents and children will not be separated by the state without due process of law except in an emergency.wallis spencer,cir.citations omitted.
over the years,the supreme court has recognized this fundamental right in many cases.for example,in cleveland bd.of educ.lafleur,the court said,this court has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the court reiterated this theme three years later in moore city of east cleveland,our decisions establish that the constitution protects the sanctity of the family precisely because the institution of the family is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.it is through the family that we inculcate and pass down many of our most cherished values,moral and cultural.
the defendants do not contend nor could they that preslie did not have a constitutional due process right or a fourth amendment right protecting her against deliberate government use of perjured testimony and fabricated evidence in the dependency court proceeding designed to rupture her familial relationship with her mother.this right is beyond debate.what they do claim is that the specific granular right to be free from deliberately fabricated evidence in civil child dependency proceedings where a parent or child protected familial liberty interest is at stake had not yet been clearly established prior to the dependency proceeding at issue.they concede that the rights preslie relies upon had been clearly established in criminal proceedings against parents,but not yet in a civil proceeding context.we disagree.
clearly established 
an official can not be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in his or her shoes would have understood that he or she was violating it.plumhoff rickard.this exacting standard gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments by protect ing all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.city and county of san francisco sheehan,internal quotation marks omitted quoting ashcroft.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful but it is to say that in the light of law,the unlawfulness must be apparent.hope pelzer,quotation marks omitted quoting anderson creighton.furthermore,general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,and in some instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question,even though the very action in question has not previously been held unlawful.id.at quoting united states lanier,quoting anderson,at.thus,the salient question we must answer is whether the state of the law as of february,when the conduct at issue allegedly occurred gave these social workers fair warning that their alleged use of perjured testimony and fabricated evidence in court in order to sever preslie familial bond with her mother was unconstitutional.hope,at.
the supreme court did not confine its inquiry in hope to published judicial opinions.the court also referred to the obvious cruelty inherent in the disputed practice that should have provided respondents with some notice that their alleged conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional protection.hope,at.
to buttress its conclusion that a reasonable person would have known of the unconstitutionality of the disputed practice,the court also relied on a relevant shackling regulation promulgated by the alabama department of corrections adoc,and a united states department of justice report warning the adoc of the unconstitutionality of the disputed practice.id.at.
development 
although it did so in the context of discussing collateral estoppel,the district court correctly identified the legal precedents that inform our analysis,beginning with greene camreta,cir,vacated in part on other grounds by camreta greene.as the district court said,
the plaintiff in greene alleged her children were removed from her custody pursuant to a juvenile court order triggered by an intentional misrepresentation in an affidavit by the defendant social worker.the ninth circuit held that the plaintiff right to be free from deception in the presentation of evidence during a protective custody proceeding was clearly established at the time defendant filed his affidavit in with the juvenile court.
and,as the district court correctly observed,greene reached this conclusion on the basis of previous case law establishing the basic constitutional right to be free from the knowing presentation of false or perjured evidence.id.quoting greene,at.
nevertheless,the defendants contend that greene is irrelevant because the offending affidavit in that case was filed in march of,and we did not publish our opinion until.true,but greene relied in turn on cases dealing with conduct that occurred well before the conduct challenged in this case.for example,the greene panel pointed to devereaux perez,cir,reh g en banc sub nom.devereaux abbey,cir.the targeted conduct in devereaux took place during and.in greene,we said that we held in the context of a child abuse proceeding that the constitutional right to be free from the knowing presentation of false or perjured evidence is clearly established.at citing and quoting devereaux,at.we also said that e ven earlier than devereaux we stated emphatically that if an officer submitted an affidavit that contained statements he knew to be false or would have known were false had he not recklessly disregarded the truth,he can not be said to have acted in an objectively reasonable manner,and the shield of qualified immunity is lost.id.describing and quoting hervey estes,cir.finally,we supported our holding in greene with a section case decided in by the tenth circuit,snell tunnell,cir.we described that civil rights case as holding that social workers who deliberately fabricated evidence of child sexual abuse to secure a removal order were not entitled to qualified immunity.greene,at.
contrary to the defendants assertion at oral argument that snell arose from criminal process,it did not.the alleged offending social workers in snell were employed by the oklahoma department of human services.the disputed court order they secured from a judge was a removal order pertaining only to civil child dependency concerns.snell,at.the child removal order had no connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution.in fact,the district attorney,the local police,and the fbi all declined to initiate criminal process or proceedings.id.at.
no official with an iq greater than room temperature in alaska could claim that he or she did not know that the conduct at the center of this case violated both state and federal law.the social workers in this case are alleged to have knowingly and maliciously violated the law in their attempt to sever preslie protected relationship with her mother.perjury is a crime under both federal and california state law,as is the knowing submission of false evidence to a court.cal.penal code.both crimes make no distinction between criminal and civil proceedings.this malicious criminal behavior is hardly conduct for which qualified immunity is either justified or appropriate.the doctrine exists to protect mistaken but reasonable decisions,not purposeful criminal conduct.as the supreme court repeated in sheehan,officials who knowingly violate the law are not entitled to immunity.at quoting ashcroft.
