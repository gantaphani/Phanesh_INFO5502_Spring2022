a class of custodial parents plaintiffs who receive child support payments collected,distributed,and disbursed by a statewide distribution unit sdu operated by the office of child support enforcement ocse of the state of arkansas the state appeals from a final order entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas granting summary judgment in favor of arkansas officials defendants on plaintiffs claims seeking injunctive and declaratory relief under for alleged violations of title of the social security act,et,and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.for reversal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that they have failed as a matter of law to establish a violation of a federal statutory right that is enforceable under or to establish a violation of a federal constitutional right.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.

the district court held that and do not create an federal right to have child support payments distributed within two business days.id.at citing blessing freestone,d blessing.the district court determined that,consistent with blessing and in view of the absence of any language in those statutory provisions,congress underlying intent was to improve the overall efficiency of the states child support enforcement programs,not to create individual rights.see d at citing,gonzaga university doe,d.the district court similarly concluded that does not create an right to receive prompt,accurate,timely,frequent and meaningful notice of support collected and distributed,as asserted by plaintiffs.id.at.regarding plaintiffs claims that the ocse methods of collecting administrative fees and costs and recouping erroneous overpayments violate an individual right conferred under,the district court noted that plaintiffs have no right to keep funds exceeding amounts collected on their behalf and that specifically provides for the collection of administrative fees and costs.id.at.the district court next addressed plaintiffs procedural due process claims,in which they claimed that a substantial risk of erroneous deprivation of property resulted from mistakes made by the state when recouping overpayments and assessing administrative fees and costs.id.at.the district court reasoned that,because title does not impose an unambiguous,binding obligation on the states to distribute child support and to provide detailed notice in the manner demanded by plaintiffs,they had failed to establish a liberty or property interest protected by the due process clause.id.the district court additionally observed that plaintiffs ha d not demonstrated that the state law remedies are inadequate.id.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs for summary judgment as moot.id.at.plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.the question before the district court,and this court on appeal,is whether the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.where,as in the present case,the unresolved issues are primarily legal rather than factual,summary judgment is particularly appropriate.see crain board of police comm rs,cir.
on appeal,plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred in dismissing their tenth claim for relief.plaintiffs contend that the error results from the district court misunderstanding of their claim.they explain 
the custodial parents never contended they are entitled to payments in excess of the total amount collected pursuant to an order for child support.neither have custodial parents contended they were immune to state law procedures afforded to the state as a creditor for the repayment of overpayments.but section makes no provision for refusing to disburse support collected for the family because the agency prior errors resulted in an alleged earlier overpayment.
the issue is whether the state may unilaterally assert a remedy and elevate itself to a preferred creditor status when there are no federal statutory or regulatory provisions authorizing this action.
brief for appellant at.
in other words,plaintiffs maintain that they are not disputing the state right to recover past overpayments rather,they are disputing the way in which the state exercises that right.more specifically,plaintiffs contend that the state is improperly failing to distribute funds in strict compliance with.they argue distribution in strict compliance with section is a right enforceable by a custodial parent,which the district court wholly failed to recognize.id.at.plaintiffs quote the following language from blessing to suggest that such an federal right has been recognized by the supreme court.
we do not foreclose the possibility that some provisions of title give rise to individual rights.the lower court did not separate out the particular rights it believed arise from the statutory scheme,and we think the complaint is less than clear in this regard.for example,one of the plaintiffs alleged that the state agency managed to collect some support payments from her but failed to pass through the first of each payment,to which she was purportedly entitled under the version of b.although may give her a federal right to receive a specified portion of the money collected on her behalf by the state,she did not explicitly request such relief in the complaint.
at.quoted in brief for appellants at citation omitted.
moreover,in response to the district court observation that they have failed to identify any specific statutory language,and merely rely upon the general introductory paragraph of,plaintiffs argue section comprehensively covers the distribution of child support.it specifically defines the limited circumstances that allow a state to take some of a custodial parent collected child support.brief for appellants at.plaintiffs conclude that the statute as a whole is so comprehensive and specific that it leaves no room for any diversion of support to pay debts to the state other than for the repayment of cash assistance.id.footnote omitted.
we begin by emphasizing that,in blessing,the supreme court wrote 
section imposes liability on anyone who,under color of state law,deprives a person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.we have held that this provision safeguards certain rights conferred by federal statutes.in order to seek redress through,however,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.we have traditionally looked at three factors when determining whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right.first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
even if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right,there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.because our inquiry focuses on congressional intent,dismissal is proper if congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under.congress may do so expressly,by forbidding recourse to in the statute itself,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.
at.citations omitted.
the supreme court also explained that it is the burden of the party asserting the federal right to identify with particularity the right being asserted.the court noted that,o nly when the complaint is broken down into manageable analytic bites can a court ascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various criteria we have set forth for determining whether a federal statute creates rights.id.at.citation omitted.the court thus indicated that the specific right must be drawn from a particular statutory provision.see id.at.noting that i n prior cases,we have been able to determine whether or not a statute created a given right because the plaintiffs articulated,and lower courts evaluated,claims and discussing examples of rights found to be created by particular federal statutory provisions.the supreme court concluded that the plaintiffs in blessing had not shown,under the articulated test,that they had an federal right to the state of arizona substantial compliance with title.id.at.t he requirement that a state operate its child support program in substantial compliance with title was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents,and therefore it does not constitute a federal right.far from creating an individual entitlement to services,the standard is simply a yardstick for the secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a state title program.
as indicated above,however,the supreme court went on to comment that it did not foreclose the possibility that some provisions of title give rise to individual rights,and that,although may give a custodial parent a federal right to receive a specified portion of the money collected on his or her behalf by the state,the plaintiffs in blessing had not explicitly requested such relief in their complaint.id.at.as noted above,plaintiffs in the present case have seized upon those comments to claim that they have an federal right to distribution of child support in strict compliance with.
the only specific statutory provision that plaintiffs have identified as giving rise to the asserted federal right is the introductory paragraph,subsection a,of.subsection a states in relevant part in to subsections not at issue in the present case,an amount collected on behalf of a family as support by a state pursuant to a plan approved under this part shall be distributed as follows.a quoted in brief for appellants at emphasis as added by plaintiffs.consistent with blessing,at,we will not conclude that this particular language creates an federal right unless plaintiffs have established congress intended that the provision benefit them,the right asserted is not so vague and amorphous that enforcing it would strain judicial competence,and the provision unambiguously imposes a binding obligation on the states.id.at.we agree with plaintiffs that a reflects some congressional intent to benefit custodial parents.however,the right plaintiffs right to distribution in strict compliance with section is not unambiguously imposed in a as a binding obligation on the states and,moreover,is too vague and amorphous for judicial enforcement.we therefore hold that a does not create an federal right.
to the extent that plaintiffs alternatively argue that,read as a whole,creates an federal right to strict compliance with its terms because the overall scheme is comprehensive and specific,we again disagree.section contains a series of related provisions focusing on the disbursement of child support payments to custodial parents,largely with the purpose of encouraging and helping parents who are receiving public assistance to return to work.it focuses on the relationships between different federal programs and provides guidelines for state agencies,but is not couched in mandatory terms.we therefore hold that,read as a whole,does not create an individual right to distribution in strict compliance with its terms.see blessing,at.t he provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.in sum,notwithstanding the issues left open by the supreme court in blessing,plaintiffs strict compliance claim in the present case fails for essentially the same reasons that the plaintiffs in blessing failed to establish an right to substantial compliance.although it is possible that an right may be derived from a specific provision of,no such right has been separated out from the statutory scheme in the present case.see blessing,at.the lower court did not separate out the particular rights it believed arise from the statutory scheme,and we think the complaint is less than clear in this regard.
plaintiffs next argue that the district court erred in holding that they failed as a matter of law to establish a constitutional due process violation in their fourth and seventh claims for relief.plaintiffs describe their due process theory as based upon the deprivation of property that occurs whenever a mistake is made by the state resulting in a denial of child support which they are qualified to receive.brief for appellants at.they again argue that the district court misunderstood their claims.they explain 
the district court erroneously identified the deprivation of property as occurring only from recoupment or the imposition of administrative fees.custodial parents did not challenge either recoupment or fees as an unconstitutional taking of their support.however,they did object to a lack of procedural due process available to challenge the state assertion that it was owed a debt which could be satisfied by the taking of their future child support payments.
citing mathews eldridge,d mathews,and cases from other circuits,plaintiffs continue 
a title agency notice of collection and distribution of support must state the information used by the agency to distribute support.the notice must also state how each amount is distributed and provide an explanation if the government has taken some of the support collected or explain why all the support collected has not been sent to the custodial parent.
plaintiffs further contend custodial parents entitled to child support which is processed through the state sdu must have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for the distribution of their support and the right to challenge the state support distributions.id.at quoting goldberg kelly,d welfare recipients are entitled to limited procedural safeguards in that context,due process principles require that a recipient have timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination of benefits,and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.in the present case,plaintiffs conclude,the district court erred in failing to determine whether,under mathews,the state is violating their procedural due process right to notices that would enable t
