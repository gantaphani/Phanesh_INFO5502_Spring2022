appellant david morrison appeals the district court order dismissing his action under the family medical leave act of fmla,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we write to address a single issue when reviewing a defendant motion to dismiss an fmla action on grounds that the plaintiff was not an eligible employee under the act,should the district court review the motion using the standards applicable for rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure or rule the district court in this case used the b standard,which is far less deferential to the plaintiff.we conclude the court should have used rule,and we reverse and remand.
appellant was employed by magic carpet aviation magic carpet as a charter pilot based in orlando,florida,from september through march.magic carpet,which is owned by amway corporation amway,is an air charter service whose clientele includes a number of professional sports franchises.one such franchise is orlando magic,which owns and operates the orlando magic basketball team.one of appellant main job responsibilities at magic carpet was piloting charter flights for the orlando magic.orlando magic,is a unit of rdv sports,rdv.amway and rdv are both owned by richard devos or his family 
appellant alleges that,throughout the duration of his employment with magic carpet,he was suffering from clinical depression.in october,appellant met with harry mitchel,who was magic carpet director of aviation and appellant supervisor,and requested four weeks time off from work in order to treat his illness.he also submitted a written request for time off.despite the requests,mitchel would only agree to allow appellant two weeks off.about a month later,appellant again asked mitchel for time off.this time,mitchel allegedly denied the request altogether.
in march,mitchel confronted appellant in regard to pornographic images found on appellant office computer in violation of magic carpet company policy.appellant indicated he was depressed and asked for time off to deal with his depression.rather than giving appellant time off,magic carpet terminated appellant employment.appellant maintains that magic carpet stated reason for firing pornography on his a pretext for unlawful retaliation for asserting his fmla rights.
on june,appellant filed this action against amway,magic carpet,rdv,and mitchel,claiming unlawful retaliation in violation of the fmla.his complaint asserted that,during the relevant time period,he had been employed by amway,rdv,magic carpet.alternatively,he alleged amway,rdv,and magic carpet were his joint employer his integrated employer.on august,appellees moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the motion argued the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because appellant was not an eligible employee under the fmla.the district court agreed and dismissed the action.appellant then commenced this appeal.
the fmla entitles an eligible employee to take up to weeks of leave in a period for the birth or adoption of a child,or the serious health condition of the employee or the employee child,spouse,or parent.a.to protect this right,the fmla prohibits an employer from interfering with an employee attempt to take leave or retaliating against an employee for opposing practices made unlawful under the fmla.id.the fmla authorizes an aggrieved eligible employee to sue for monetary and equitable relief from an employer who violates.id.a.
which sets forth the scope of coverage for the fmla,generally defines an eligible employee as one who has been employed for at least months by the employer and for at least hours of service with the employer during the previous period.a.excluded from the general definition of eligible employee,however,is any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within miles of that worksite is less than.id.b.this is commonly known as the fmla worksite requirement.
the issue in this case is whether appellant was precluded from being an eligible employee based on his alleged failure to satisfy the worksite requirement.in other words,the parties do not dispute that appellant otherwise satisfied the fmla definition of eligible employee.the only question is whether appellant worked for an employer who employed or more employees within miles of his worksite.that question turns on whether rdv was appellant employer,because neither magic carpet nor its parent corporation amway,individually or collectively,employed or more employees within miles of appellant worksite.rdv,however,did employ at least employees within miles of the worksite.consequently,if rdv were appellant employer,then he would be an eligible employee under the fmla.
in answering appellees motion to dismiss,appellant produced his own deposition and those of both mitchel and lorisse garcia,who was the vice president of human resources for orlando magic.relying mainly on these depositions,appellant noted a number of facts which he contended demonstrated his employment relationship with rdv 
additionally,appellant opposed the motion to dismiss on procedural grounds.he argued that the motion,despite being styled as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,was actually an attack on the merits because it challenged the existence of an underlying element of his fmla cause of action,namely his status as an eligible employee.citing our decision in garcia copenhaver,bell associates,cir,he asserted the motion should be reviewed under the standards appropriate to motions to dismiss brought under rule or rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.under either of those standards,the district court would not be permitted to weigh facts but would instead be required to resolve disputed factual issues in appellant favor.
the district court concluded appellees challenge to appellant status as an eligible employee was properly raised under rule b because it challenged only subject matter jurisdiction and not the merits of appellant underlying fmla claim.as such,the court determined it could properly act as a fact finder,and weigh the evidence submitted by the parties.then,after weighing the evidence before it,the district court found rdv was not appellant employer and thus concluded appellant was not an eligible employee under the fmla.
appellant maintains the district court erred in relying on rule b.he asserts that status under the fmla is an element of the underlying cause of action rather than a purely jurisdictional issue.he therefore argues the district court should have relied on rule b or rule,which govern motions to dismiss challenging the existence of an element of the underlying cause of action.
we begin by observing the district court could not have considered appellees motion under rule b,because in rendering its decision the court relied on extrinsic evidence outside the pleadings.see.b see also trustmark ins.eslu,cir whenever a judge considers matters outside the pleadings in a b motion,that motion is thereby converted into a rule summary judgment motion.the more germane question is whether the district court should have reviewed the motion under rule instead of rule b.as explained below,there are significantly different standards governing each type of motion.
the district court should only grant summary judgment under rule where the record evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in ruling on a rule motion,the district court may not weigh the evidence or find facts.instead,the court role is limited to deciding whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable juror could find for the party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
jurisdictional challenges on the other hand,can be decided without reference to the merits of the underlying claim and lie within the exclusive province of the trial court.consequently,when a defendant properly challenges subject matter jurisdiction under rule b the district court is free to independently weigh facts,and 
may proceed as it never could under rule b or.because at issue in a factual b motion is the trial court very power to hear the is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.in short,no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiff allegations,and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional issue.
lawrence dunbar,cir quotation omitted.
we have cautioned,however,that the district court should only rely on rule b i f the facts necessary to sustain jurisdiction do not implicate the merits of plaintiff cause of action.garcia,at emphasis added.if a jurisdictional challenge does implicate the merits of the underlying claim then 
t he proper course of action for the district court is to find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of the plaintiff case judicial economy is best promoted when the existence of a federal right is directly reached and,where no claim is found to exist,the case is dismissed on the merits.this refusal to treat indirect attacks on the merits as rule b motions provides,moreover,a greater level of protection for the plaintiff who in truth is facing a challenge to the validity of his claim the defendant is forced to proceed under rule b or rule both of which place great restrictions on the district court discretion 
id.quoting williamson tucker,cir.we therefore must determine whether appellees motion to dismiss in this case implicated the merits of appellant fmla action.if it did,the district court should have treated the motion as a motion for summary judgment under rule and refrained from deciding disputed factual issues.
in garcia copenhaver,bell associates,we considered whether a defendant motion challenging its status as an employer under the age discrimination in employment act adea,was purely jurisdictional or whether it also implicated an element of the underlying cause of action.at.copenhaver,bell associates had argued in the district court that it was not an employer within the meaning of the adea because it employed an insufficient number of employees to meet the statutory definition of that term its argument hinged on whether garcia and other emergency room physicians were actually independent contractors rather than copenhaver employees.if the physicians were not employees then copenhaver would have employed fewer than the minimum number of employees to be considered an employer under the statute.after hearing testimony on the issue and weighing the factual record before it,the district court concluded the physicians were independent contractors and dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
on appeal,we held the district court had applied the wrong standard of review in ruling on the motion to dismiss.we recognized that jurisdiction becomes intertwined with the merits of a cause of action when a statute provides the basis for both the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court and the plaintiff substantive claim for relief.id.at quoting sun valley gasoline,ernst,cir quotation omitted.focusing on the language of the adea,we concluded in garcia that the question of employer status intertwined jurisdiction and the merits,and consequently should have been resolved by the jury 
from the plain language of the statute,it appears the elements of an adea claim under a can be summarized as follow,a plaintiff must prove an employer,failed or refused to hire or to discharge,any individual,with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.stated simply,it seems a plaintiff can only recover if he is able to prove an employer discriminated against on the basis of age.in order to determine if a defendant qualifies as an employer and,consequently,whether adea will even apply,we must turn to adea definitions section.
in other words,it seems the section of adea that provides the substantive relief,is intertwined and dependent on the section of adea that defines the scope of the act.
garcia,at second emphasis added.
given that employer status is a substantive element of an adea claim and intertwined with the question of jurisdiction,id.at,we held the district court erred in resolving questions of fact.underlying our holding was the belief that the jury,rather than the judge,should decide the disputed question when the question went to the merits of the underlying claim.id.at.
although garcia arose under the adea,we noted the the adea limitation on actions against employers to another federal statute,title vii of the civil rights act of.see id.at because there is no real difference other than numerical between the definitions in the two statutes,we turn to title vii cases for guidance.title vii,like the adea,makes it unlawful for an employer to engage in unlawful discrimination and restricts the definition of employer based on the number of employees employed.see b presumably,then,a defendant challenge to its status as an employer under title vii would implicate the merits as well as jurisdiction 
garcia was our first decision holding that,in the case of an employment statute,questions of employer status implicate both jurisdiction and the underlying merits.the decision cited other cases from this court,however,where we previously determined that a jurisdictional issue was intertwined with the underlying merits and therefore should have been resolved under rule instead of rule b.see lawrence,at whether federal employee was acting within scope of employment implicated both jurisdiction and merits of federal tort claims act claim williamson,at whether certain joint venture interests were securities under securities act of and securities exchange act of went to both jurisdiction and merits.
we see no reason why these principles should not apply to a defendant challenge to the plaintiff status as an eligible employee under the fmla.like employer status under the adea,status under the fmla is a threshold jurisdictional question,see limiting the scope of the act to eligible employees,that also appears to be a prima facie element for recovery in a civil action,see a any employer who violates section of this title shall be liable to any eligible employee affected emphasis added see also rockwell mack trucks,d,noting status is a prima facie element of an fmla discriminatory discharge claim in short,we view this case as materially indistinguishable from garcia.the question of eligible employee status implicates both jurisdiction and the merits,and is properly reserved for the finder of fact 
the difficulty confronting us in this case is scarfo ginsberg,cir,an opinion we issued two years after garcia.scarfo held that the defendants challenge to their status as an employer under title vii was jurisdictional and could be reviewed under rule b.
in scarfo,several corporate defendants sought dismissal of a plaintiff title vii claim on the grounds that they did not employ the minimum number of employees to qualify as an employer under the statute.the plaintiff had asserted the defendants constituted a single employer that collectively employed enough employees to be subject to suit.after weighing the evidence,the district court concluded the defendants were not a single employer and dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction not surprisingly,the plaintiff relied on garcia in arguing on appeal that the issue went to the merits of her underlying claim and any factual disputes over that issue should have been resolved by the jury.
a majority of the panel on appeal held garcia distinguishable on its facts.the court emphasized that in garcia the district court could only have resolved the issue by first determining whether garcia and individuals were employees under the adea.in contrast,the defendants challenge in scarfo simply presented an issue of whether they were a single employer for counting purposes,which could be decided without refer
