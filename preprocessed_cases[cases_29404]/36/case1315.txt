thomas landon father or tom appeals from an order in favor of julie osgood mother or julie that denied father motion to grant him physical custody of their son,daniel james landon daniel or danny,which was based upon mother proposed relocation from california to tennessee.father argues the court incorrectly applied the changed circumstances rather than the best interest of the child standard to the proposed move,and that the error led to denial of his motion.for the reasons stated below,we shall conclude the trial court properly required father to establish that mother move would cause detriment to daniel father failed to establish such detriment and substantial evidence supports the court order.therefore,we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
father and mother were never married.daniel was born on july.on july,mother filed a petition to establish paternity and named father as respondent.in papers filed the following day,mother submitted a declaration of paternity wherein father admitted he was daniel father.
mother filed a request to enter default on september,and a default judgment was entered thereon on october.the judgment granted mother sole legal and physical custody of daniel,with reasonable visitation to father.
pursuant to a stipulation filed october,the parties agreed that they share joint legal custody of daniel,and father would have visitation on the first and third weekends of every month.the stipulation did not mention any change regarding physical custody of daniel.
on february,father filed a motion to modify visitation and to change custody to him based on mother having made plans to move to tennessee to accept a job offer.according to father declaration,mother had told him that she had heard a song on the radio one evening and it made her think tennessee would be a good place to live.father declared that mother had admitted that she knew no one in tennessee and that she lost her job in california because of her drinking.according to father declaration,julie has gone too far.i want to have this court consider giving me the custody of my son.i have a great house for him where i have lived for years.he will have his own bedroom.my two sons are here a lot,and i have daughters too.i have visitation with all of them.my employment hours are such that i am home in the daytime usually and work evenings and have had the same person provide child care and she is willing to do this now.i will never deprive julie of her visitation with her son because i know a child needs the love of his mother too.
in her responsive declaration,mother declared that she had been recruited by dennis jackson,one of her prior employment supervisors who had moved to tennessee to undertake employment as a and director of procurement for union planters national bank union planters based in memphis.
according to a statement from jackson,prior to commencing employment with union planters,he was the director of purchasing at imperial sugar company imperial.his declaration stated julie worked for me at imperial as a purchasing specialist responsible for the management of our packaging inventory.upon arriving at union planters,i recruited julie to join the team at union planters because of her knowledge and experience.she was one of my key performers that helped the team achieve our objectives.the new opportunity at union planters will allow her to grow with an organization that is profitable and growing.she will be a purchasing analyst,which is a key role in the group.my wife,and children have moved to memphis as well.our family knows julie through the opportunity to work with her at imperial.
according to a letter of recommendation submitted by stanley strickland,the comptroller of the imperial plant in tracy,i have found julie to be an energetic and enthusiastic worker.she is eager to learn and ready to lend support to others where needed.her intelligence and dedication has been amply demonstrated in her accomplishments while working for spreckels.it is with mixed emotions that i write this letter because i value highly julie contribution to our company.i am certain she will be an outstanding addition to any organization.
also attached to mother opposition papers was a letter outlining the results of a chemical dependency screening on mother that had been conducted by leslie,a master addictions counselor with the national board of addiction examiners.concluded that mother was not an alcoholic,that her drinking patterns in the past had resembled those of an adolescent,and that she had stopped drinking.
the court appointed janelle burrill,to conduct an examination of the parties pursuant to family code section burrill report recommended that legal custody remain joint but that father be given primary physical custody of daniel.burrill report noted that daniel was attached to both parents,who had shared parenting time of daniel daniel was distressed and angered by mother move to tennessee father had attempted to maintain contact with minor,while mother relocation without a viable plan for daniel to maintain regular contact with father was not in daniel best interest mother relocation also deprived daniel of access to siblings and relatives in california.
a contested hearing was held at which father,mother,burrill,and testified the change of custody hearing.the reporter transcript is not included with the record on appeal,so we must rely on the court decision to summarize the testimony adduced at the hearing.the decision states in part janelle burrill,testified julie fails to recognize the significance of her move with danny to tennessee,that julie lacks an understanding of child development,that julie has a history of alcohol abuse,and that she failed to promote frequent contact between danny and his father.burrill recommended tom be awarded primary physical custody of danny because he has a strong bond with danny,he is willing to allow frequent visitation to julie,danny is attached to his siblings,and tom will promote danny best interests.
leslie,a counselor with the cameron park counseling center,testified she performed an alcohol and chemical dependency assessment of julie.in opinion,julie has no alcohol dependency or abuse issues and has not consumed alcohol in the last year.
julie testified her former california employer,spreckels sugar company,filed chapter bankruptcy in.because she was concerned about job security and because tom failed to make child support payments in october,november,and december,she decided in january to accept an employment offer in tennessee,working for a former supervisor at spreckels,increasing her salary from per year to plus a bonus.
tom testified he has never tested positive for drugs or alcohol in connection with his employment as a truck driver for pmt trucking.in addition to danny,he has four other children,lisa age,tom and kevin who reside with tom and visit their mother every other weekend,and ashley who resides with her mother and spends every other weekend and one visit with tom.a responsible neighbor watches the children during his evening work hours.tom testified julie would not allow thanksgiving and birthday visits with danny,but if he were awarded primary physical custody,he would allow liberal parenting time by julie.
the court determined that tom had the burden to establish detriment by reason of mother physical custody of daniel,and that he had not demonstrated that mother relocation to tennessee caused any detriment.the court wrote the court finds the default judgment dated october,awarded legal and physical custody of danny to julie.no evidence was presented to indicate the default judgment was considered a temporary order,and no motions to set aside the default and default judgment have been filed.although joint legal custody was awarded to both parents pursuant to a stipulation dated october,the fact remains the award of physical custody to julie has never been modified.as such,tom has the substantial burden of showing julie to tennessee would cause detriment to danny.no such showing has been made.additionally,the court finds julie move to tennessee was neither whimsical nor in bad faith,but in
