we conclude that,under the current law,the trial court is precluded from any direct or indirect consideration of a subsequent spouse or nonmarital partner income in determining or modifying spousal support.the record reveals that the trial court abused its discretion in considering the indirect effects of such income on husband ability to pay and his standard of living.we reverse the court order and remand for a new hearing on husband request for modification.
factual and procedural history 
husband and his wife,linda michele romero,were married for years.early in their marriage,wife worked while husband pursued his teaching credential and masters in school administration.during their marriage,husband and wife enjoyed various luxuries,including long vacations.in july of,upon dissolution of the marriage,the trial court ordered husband to pay per month in spousal support.
after the divorce,husband remarried and enjoyed a higher standard of living with his new spouse,who earned approximately a month.husband new spouse had two children,both of whom were receiving voluntary or support from their biological father.husband and his new spouse lived in her home,which was located on a golf course,and had membership at the country club.on his income and expense declarations,husband reported approximately in expenses,including for the home and for their country club fees and charges.husband and his new spouse used their joint account to pay for their shared expenses.
since the divorce,wife has experienced a lower standard of living.after declaring bankruptcy and losing the family home,she rented a room from her mother.she could no longer afford the same luxuries that she enjoyed during her marriage.
on august,after being diagnosed with parkinson disease and,as a result,taking early retirement,husband filed an order to show cause to reduce his spousal support obligation.husband gross income decreased from over to approximately per month.
on october,at the hearing on husband order to show cause,the trial court found that,while husband reduction in income constituted a material change in circumstances,such change did not require a reduction in spousal support based on the other factors listed in family code section.the court made the following comments i do see any way to avoid considering new spouse income if we going to consider husband income and expense declaration.her income is set forth on the form.her income is by implication at least partially responsible for paying husband monthly debt.there no way he could pay his monthly debt simply on his a month net income.i read the code section referred to by husband counsel that precludes the court from considering her income.i simply without any option.i do see any other way to proceed other than to consider the family husband current total family circumstances because those circumstances are intertwined inextricably with our analysis of section,specifically in the area of standard of living.based on its evaluation of the family code section factors,the court denied defendant request for modification.
discussion 
husband claims the trial court erred in denying his request for modification of the spousal support order by considering his new spouse income in violation of family code section,subdivision b.the question in this case is whether,despite the statute prohibition against the consideration of a subsequent spouse or cohabitant income in determining or modifying spousal support the court may account for the indirect effects of this additional income on other considerations,including the husband ability to pay and his standard of living 
before family code section,subdivision b became effective in,the prevailing approach was that the courts were allowed to consider a subsequent spouse income in determining whether to modify spousal support in gammell gammell after a marriage,the court ordered the husband to pay per month in spousal support.when the husband retired,he sought a modification in the spousal support order.the trial court,after considering the husband and his new wife income and expenses,found that the husband had the financial ability to continue paying under the original support order.
in response to the husband argument that the court erred in considering his second wife income in determining his ability to pay,the appellate court stated the california courts have held that,while a husband remarriage does not alone justify reduction of support payments to his former wife,the remarriage with its additional burdens is a factor to be considered.citations.since a remarriage with its additional burdens is a factor to be considered in modifying support payments,it appears fair and equitable that a remarriage with its additional benefits also ought to be considered.furthermore,spousal support is determined according to the needs of both parties and the respective ability of the parties to meet those needs.citation.although the second wife income in this case is her separate property,as a pragmatic matter this income directly or indirectly reduces the needs of the husband and it directly or indirectly affects the husband ability to meet the needs of his former wife.
the court further noted that the husband additional expenses resulting from his remarriage did not exceed his second wife financial contribution to the marriage in fact,her income substantially compensated for his reduced salary based on the husband and his second wife shared income and expenses,the court found that there was no material change of circumstances justifying the requested modification 
in a case from this court,in re marriage of ramer the parties separated after having four children and being married for years.during the new trial,which was ordered by this court,the trial court awarded the wife in spousal support and in child support for the one remaining minor child.with this sum,wife,who was unemployed,was required to pay over in mortgage payments,property taxes,property insurance premiums,for the minor child special educational needs,and other living expenses for herself and her children.
in finding the spousal support ordered by the trial court to be grossly inadequate to meet the wife necessary expenses,we looked to the net disposable income of both the husband and his new wife.we observed that together they had a monthly net disposable income of about we explained that the new wife income is considered available to defray the shared expenses and,therefore,increases the amount available for support payments based on their net disposable income,the husband and his new wife enjoyed a significantly higher standard of living than his former wife,who experienced a far lower standard of living than she enjoyed during the marriage.based on this disparity,we concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the wife only per month in spousal support 
in in re marriage of tapia the trial court awarded the wife per month in spousal support after the dissolution of a marriage.in arriving at this amount,the trial court did not consider the husband nonmarital cohabitant contributions to their shared expenses.relying on gammell and ramer,the court in tapia held that,regardless of the relationship between the housemates,the fact that they were sharing expenses logically affected each person ability to pay other obligations 
the court reasoned when a court assesses a party ability to pay spousal support,it considers practically everything which has a legitimate bearing upon the present and prospective matters relating to the lives of both parties.it includes the needs of the parties and the ability of the parties to meet such needs citation.citation.such factors may include benefits in the form of gifts,receipts from parents or third parties,and income from earnings,investments,o
