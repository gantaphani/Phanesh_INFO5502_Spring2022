our motive is to put forth a positive image of a stable and loving lesbian relationship through this tv show,we also hope to help other gay people who could benefit from seeing positive role models.we also hope that this program will enlighten hateful people in our society who attack gay people as a group and fail to see that we are individuals with aspirations of building loving relationships and who want to share their love by bringing another being into this world.
the turning point show featured footage of the commitment ceremony,and a discussion of zachary birth and annette adoption of zachary.the program was covered in the national news media,including the new york times,usa today,and other newspapers.
in june,after being artificially inseminated again,sharon gave birth to another son,joshua.sharon and annette signed an adoption agreement for annette to adopt joshua as a second parent.

b.the sharon litigation 
in october,annette filed a motion to adopt joshua as a second parent.she contended that sharon consent to the adoption had become irrevocable and that the adoption was in joshua best interest.sharon responded by moving to withdraw her consent to the adoption and requesting dismissal of annette adoption petition.sharon contended that there was no legal basis for such a adoption,that her consent had been obtained by fraud or duress,and that withdrawal of her consent was in joshua best interest.joshua counsel also moved to dismiss the adoption petition.
the trial court denied the motions to dismiss the adoption petition.sharon filed a petition for writ of mandate,joined by counsel for joshua,challenging the denial of her motion to dismiss.in her petition,sharon also challenged a separate order compelling discovery of her communications with her therapist and imposing sanctions against her and her attorney.numerous organizations filed amicus curiae briefs concerning the validity of adoptions.on october,this court granted sharon writ petition and ruled that,with the exception of stepparent adoptions,there was no statutory basis for an adoption in which a consenting parent does not relinquish all parental rights.the court also found that the discovery issue was moot in light of its determination that annette adoption petition had to be dismissed.sharon superior court th,d,rev cal th,d,this court sharon decision.
this court sharon decision was highly controversial and received widespread coverage in the media and on the internet.some of the articles referred to sharon and annette as a prominent lesbian couple.many in the gay and lesbian community criticized the opinion and expressed fear that it cast doubt on the validity of thousands of adoptions.sharon was widely criticized in the gay and lesbian community for having challenged the validity of adoptions.
two days after the opinion was issued,an article in the san francisco chronicle quoted annette as stating,i do know if i going to see my children ever again.a newly formed nonprofit organization called adoption fund began soliciting contributions for annette to enable her to take her case to the california supreme court.on its web site,the organization characterized the case as a struggle to protect the legal status of thousands of children who have been adopted by adoption procedures over the last years in the state of california,and stated that if annette did not prevail in court,thousands of children in california could find that their legal relationship with their adoptive parent is vulnerable to attack by another parent,an employer,insurer or state or federal agency.interested donors were instructed to send checks directly to annette mailing address.
on january,the supreme court granted annette petition for review of this court sharon decision.the san francisco chronicle ran another article quoting annette description of the case as follows it represents my personal struggle to be recognized as my son parent and a fight for our civil rights.annette was also quoted in a story that was broadcast on national public radio.
in august,the california supreme court reversed this court decision.the supreme court concluded that a birth parent could consent to a adoption without relinquishing all parental rights.the court remanded the matter for further proceedings to address sharon claim that she had consented to the adoption as a result of fraud,undue influence,and duress.sharon,supra,cal th at,d.
in february,this court issued a new opinion on remand.the court noted that both sides had agreed that the issue of whether sharon consent to the adoption was obtained by fraud,undue influence,or duress required further evidentiary proceedings in the trial court.with respect to the discovery issue,the court concluded that sharon had waived the privilege,by raising issues regarding the effect of annette alleged domestic violence against her.however,the court concluded that the trial court discovery order was overbroad,and it directed the trial court to issue a new order limiting the scope of discovery.sharon superior court,wl nonpub.opn.
c.the libel action 
on november,after this court sharon decision had been filed but before it was final,sharon wrote a letter to the board of directors of the center,a gay and lesbian organization in san diego,and sent a copy of the letter to the gay and lesbian times of san diego,which had published a cover story about this court sharon decision that contained extensive quotations from annette attorney.the letter was published in the december,edition of the gay and lesbian times.in the letter,sharon complained that a forum the center had held on this court sharon decision had been.sharon explained why she agreed with this court initial ruling and expressed her support for assembly bill,a domestic partnership bill that provided for adoption rights.in the letter,sharon also stated 
despite what the community seems to have been led to believe,i continue to support,regular contact between the children and annette.sometimes i question whether this is wise.annette,a convicted perpetrator of domestic violence against me,has made repeated false accusations of child abuse and neglect against me while actively litigating for sole custody of both children,ages and.italics added.

the statute was enacted in for the purpose of providing an efficient procedural mechanism for the early and inexpensive dismissal of nonmeritorious claims arising from any act of the defendant in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.in order to achieve this objective,the legislature authorized the filing of a special motion to strike such claims within days after service of the complaint,subds.b,f.
deciding an motion requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.

b.the complaint arises from protected speech activity within the scope of the statute 
annette contends that the trial court erred in ruling that her libel action against sharon is subject to a special motion to strike under the statute.we disagree.
the statute applies only to a cause of action arising from acts in furtherance of the defendant constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b.t he statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,city of cotati.the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.navellier sletten cal th,d.
a defendant may meet her burden of establishing that the complaint arises from protected activity by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e.city of cotati,supra,cal th at,d.section,subdivision e provides 
as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
in determining whether a cause of action falls within the scope of subdivision e,courts must broadly construe the statute,subd.a.construing the statute broadly,we conclude that annette libel claim against sharon arises from acts in furtherance of sharon constitutional right of free speech,subd.b.specifically,the libel action falls within the scope of subdivision e,and.
sharon statements were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body 
the libel action is based on allegations made by sharon in connection with an issue under consideration by a judicial body,subd.e.in her letter published in the gay and lesbian times,sharon expressed her views on this court controversial sharon decision.annette adoption petition was pending in the superior court at the time,and the writ proceedings concerning the validity of adoptions were pending in the appellate courts.sharon allegations of domestic violence against annette were directly at issue in the underlying adoption proceedings because sharon claimed that her consent to joshua adoption had been obtained by fraud or undue influence arising from annette acts of domestic violence against her.annette allegations of abuse and neglect were also relevant to the parties competing claims as to joshua best interests.further,sharon also raised a discovery issue relating to her allegation of domestic violence against annette.
because annette alleged domestic violence against sharon and the allegations of abuse and neglect by sharon were at issue in the pending adoption and writ proceedings,sharon statements in the gay and lesbian times were made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.e see braun chronicle publishing th,d newspaper articles reporting on investigative audit were made in connection with issue under consideration in official proceeding lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d newspaper articles describing official hearings and court proceedings were made in connection with issue under consideration by judicial body.
sharon statements were made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest 
sharon statements were also made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,subd.e.this court has concluded that a news publication is a public forum within the meaning of the statute if it is a vehicle for discussion of public issues and it is distributed to a large and interested community.damon ocean hills journalism club th,d finding homeowners association newsletter to be a public forum.by this definition,the gay and lesbian times clearly qualifies as a public forum.but see weinberg feisel th,fn,d declining to follow damon,applying the first amendment definition of public forum used in connection with speech on public property,and concluding that most newspapers are not public forums.further,sharon letter was written in connection with an issue of public interest that potentially affected a large number of children and adoptive parents beyond the direct participants.
sharon statements constitute conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public interest 
annette complaint arises from conduct by sharon in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.the sharon litigation received widespread public attention because of its potential impact on those who had adopted children through adoptions,particularly in the gay and lesbian community.commenting on a matter of public concern is a classic form of speech that lies at the heart of the first amendment.schenck network,d.sharon had a constitutional right to speak out about the issues in the sharon litigation,and in doing so,to explain the reasons for her decision to withdraw her consent to the adoption and to challenge its validity.thus,sharon statements in the gay and lesbian times were acts in furtherance of her constitutional right of free speech in connection with an issue of public interest.we conclude that annette complaint is within the scope of the statute.
annette failed to establish a probability of prevailing on her libel claim 
because annette libel action is within the scope of the statute,she bears the burden of demonstrating a probability that she will prevail on the claim in order to defeat sharon special motion to strike,subd.b.in applying this prong of the statute to libel claims,courts must take into account whether the plaintiff is a public figure who must prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.walker kiousis th,d.
we conclude that annette is a limited purpose public figure who must prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence in order to prevail on her libel claim.annette has failed to establish a probability of meeting this burden with respect to sharon statement that annette was a convicted perpetrator of domestic violence.further,annette has failed to establish a probability of proving the falsehood of sharon statement that annette made repeated false accusations of child abuse and neglect against her.thus,we conclude that the trial court erred in denying the special motion to strike the complaint.
annette is a limited purpose public figure 
in new york times sullivan,d,the united states supreme court held that public officials may not prevail in an action for libel relating to their official conduct without proof that the allegedly false statement was made with actual malice.three years later,the court held that the same rule applies to private plaintiffs who are public figures.curtis publishing butts,d.
in gertz robert welch,d gertz,the court recognized two different categories of public figures.the first is the all purpose public figure who has achiev ed such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts.the second is the limited purpose or vortex public figure who voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.id.at.unlike the all purpose public figure,the limited purpose public figure loses certain protection for his reputation only to the extent that the allegedly defamatory communication relates to his role in a public controversy.reader digest superior court cal d,reader digest.
annette clearly has not achieved such pervasive fame or notoriety as to be considered an all purpose public figure.gertz,supra,at.we must therefore decide whether annette is a limited purpose public figure,and if so,for what limited purposes.s uch a determination is often a close question which can only be resolved by considering the totality of the circumstances which comprise each individual controversy.reader digest,supra,cal d at,see generally,who is public figure for purposes of defamation action,wl.
to characterize a plaintiff as a limited purpose public figure,the courts must first find that there was a public controversy.copp paxton th,d.not every private conflict that attracts widespread interest in the general public is considered to be a public controversy for this purpose.time,firestone,d.in firestone,for example,the supreme court found that the of the scion of one of america wealthier industrial families id.at.was not a limited purpose public figure,even though her divorce case was highly publicized and she held press conferences during the course of the divorce proceedings.id.at,fn.the court reasoned dissolution of a marriage through judicial proceedings is not the sort of public controversy referred to in gertz,even though the marital difficulties of extremely wealthy individuals may be of interest to some portion of the reading public.id.at.
the united states supreme court has not specifically defined the meaning of a public controversy.however,the court of appeals for the district of columbia has defined the term to mean a dispute that in fact has received public attention because its ramifications will be felt by persons who are not direct participants.waldbaum fairchild publications,waldbaum.if the issue was being debated publicly and if it had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants,it was a public controversy.id.at.the waldbaum formulation of a public controversy has been followed in california.copp paxton,supra,th at,d.by this definition,this court sharon decision regarding the validity of adoptions was clearly a matter of public controversy at the time sharon made her allegedly defamatory statements.
a limited purpose public figure must ordinarily have undertaken some voluntary act through which he seeks to influence the resolution of the public issues involved.reader digest,supra,cal d at.public figures generally invite attention and comment.gertz,supra,at.although gertz suggested that it is theoretically possible to become a public figure by being drawn into a particular public controversy without purposeful action id.at,such a characterization is reserved for an individual who,despite never having voluntarily engaged the public attention in an attempt to influence the outcome of a public controversy,nonetheless has acquired such public prominence in relation to the controversy as to permit media access sufficient to effectively counter defamatory statements.khawar globe,cal th,d.
we conclude that annette is a limited purpose public figure who has voluntarily invited attention and comment with respect to the issues involved in the sharon litigation.sharon and annette deliberately solicited public attention and media coverage of their commitment ceremony in.they set up a web site to publicize the ceremony and to provide information to others about gay marriage and adoptions.sharon and annette willingly participated in a nationally televised show on gay marriage in,in which they discussed annette efforts to establish a formal legal relationship with zachary as an adoptive parent.according to annette,she and sharon participated in the show because they wanted to put forth a positive image of a stable and loving lesbian relationship and to provide positive role models for other gay people.the show received extensive coverage in the national press.annette viewed herself and sharon as advocates for the civil rights of gay and lesbian people and as public figures.she considered their book to be at the forefront of rights in the workplace.
annette involvement in the sharon litigation brought her further recognition as a prominent lesbian whose case was portrayed by many as a battle for the legal rights of gay and lesbian parents.in the immediate aftermath of this court initial decision,the case received a blizzard of attention in the media and widespread criticism in the gay and lesbian community.annette and her attorneys were quoted in the press.annette took advantage of the media attention by soliciting donations through a newly formed organization to enable her to pursue the litigation.this organization also raised money for education,research,and analysis pertaining to adoptions 
annette purposeful activities in drawing public attention to her relationship with sharon in order to promote gay marriage and adoptions,and portraying the sharon litigation as a battle to protect the rights of gay and lesbian parents and their children,made her a limited purpose public figure on the subject matter of the litigation.curtis publishing,supra,at.individual who engaged in political activities in opposition to forced school desegregation became a public figure by thrusting his personality into the vortex of an important public controversy lohrenz donnelly,female navy pilot injected herself into public controversy over women in combat and became a limited purpose public figure by choosing to fly combat aircraft league of superior court th,d activists in middle east south african causes were limited purpose public figures copp paxton,supra,th at,d earthquake safety expert who participated in public debate on earthquake disaster mitigation was a limited purpose public figure nadel regents of university of california th,d individuals who protested volleyball courts in people park and expressed their views in public and in the press were limited purpose public figures rudnick mcmillan th,d individual who sought publication of two articles about a nature preserve made himself a limited purpose public figure denney lawrence th,d individual who gave press interviews about controversy surrounding his brother arrest,conviction,and sentencing for killing wife was a limited purpose public figure.
annette argues that even if she is a limited purpose public figure,she need not prove actual malice because sharon allegedly defamatory statements did not relate to annette role in the public controversy over adoptions.reader digest,supra,cal d at.we disagree.as we have noted,annette alleged domestic violence against sharon was at issue in both the adoption proceedings and the writ litigation.sharon alleged that her consent to the adoption was procured by fraud and duress as a result of annette domestic violence.the allegations of domestic violence and abuse were also relevant to the parties claims as to joshua best interests.thus,the allegedly defamatory statements related directly to annette role as a limited purpose public figure in the controversy over adoptions.as a result,in order to prevail on her libel claim,she would have the burden of proving actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.
with respect to sharon statement that annette was a convicted perpetrator of domestic violence,annette failed to show a probability of establishing actual malice by clear and convincing evidence 
annette complaint alleged that sharon defamed her by stating that annette was a convicted perpetrator of domestic violence against sharon,because annette has never been convicted of any crime.with respect to this claim,we conclude that annette has failed to show a probability of proving by clear and convincing evidence that sharon made the statement with actual malice within the meaning of new york times sullivan,supra,at pages.
in order to establish a probability of prevailing in the context of an motion,the plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.
courts must take into consideration the applicable burden of proof in determining whether the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing.rosenaur scherer th,d.a public figure suing for libel must therefore establish a probability that she will be able to produce clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.colt freedom communications,th,d conroy spitzer th,d beilenson superior court th,d.the clear and convincing standard requires that the evidence be such as to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.citation.beilenson superior court,supra,th at,d.
the actual malice standard of new york times sullivan,supra,d,requires a showing that the allegedly false statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.id.at.the reckless disregard standard requires a high degree of awareness of probable falsity garrison louisiana,d.there must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.amant thompson,d.gross or even extreme negligence will not suffice to establish actual malice the defendant must have made the statement with knowledge that the statement was false or with actual doubt concerning the truth of the publication.reader digest,supra,cal d at,fn.
the existence of actual malice turns on the defendant subjective belief as to the truthfulness of the allegedly false statement.reader digest,supra,cal d at.actual malice may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.factors such as failure to investigate,anger and hostility,and reliance on sources known to be unreliable or biased may in an appropriate case,indicate that the publisher himself had serious doubts regarding the truth of his publication.id.at.however,any one of these factors,standing alone,may be insufficient to prove actual malice or even raise a triable issue of fact.id.at.
sharon statement that annette was a convicted perpetrator of domestic violence could be interpreted to imply that annette had been convicted of a crime.boyich howell d.circular alleging that councilman had been convicted,fined and barred from holding a union office for five years for ballot box stuffing could be viewed as asserting conviction of crime when viewed in context of other statements in the circular.however,the dictionary meaning of the word convict does not necessarily connote a finding of guilt of a crime it can also mean to show or prove to be guilty of something blamable as wrong or error.webster new internat.dict.
even assuming that sharon statement could be construed as being false,however,this does not establish that she acted with actual malice.the actual malice standard of new york times sullivan is
