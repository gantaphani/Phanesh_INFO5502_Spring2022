appellant,the mother of,and the minors,appeals from the orders of the juvenile court adjudging the minors dependent children she contends that the notice provisions of the indian child welfare act icwa were not complied with,that the court failed to determine whether the other provisions of the icwa applied,and that there was insufficient evidence presented to support jurisdiction.we disagree with each of these contentions and shall affirm the orders.in so doing we hold that when a vague indian tribal designation such as cherokee is the only information the sacramento county department of health and human services department and the juvenile court have a minor indian ancestry,the notice provisions of the icwa are complied with by sending notice to the bureau of indian affairs bia.once the notice provisions of the icwa were complied with,neither the department nor the court had reason to know that the minors were indian children as defined by the icwa,and the court had no basis for applying the icwa other provisions.finally,we hold that the statements of the minors,evidence of physical injuries to them,and accounts of appellant inability to control her anger constitute substantial evidence supporting jurisdiction.
facts and procedural history 
in august,dependency petitions were filed concerning three and twins se.se.and sh.sh.and based on allegations that appellant burned se.with a cigarette lighter,burned sh.on his nose on two occasions,and slapped him across the face.according to the petitions,four marks were observed on se.back,one of which was red and blistering.

the daycare teacher reported that,approximately four months earlier,sh.had a scab on his nose and,when asked how he hurt himself,he stated appellant burned him because he said a bad word.on another occasion,appellant slapped sh.after she was told by daycare staff that sh.had been acting out in class.according to the detention report,appellant slapped sh.with full force.sh.teacher reported appellant also began verbally attacking sh.and cursing at him

the minors father resided in the home of a pastor of the gospel christian fellowship.the pastor told the social worker that appellant had arrived unannounced at his residence on two occasions and created disturbances requiring him to call the police.the minors father reported that,on these occasions,appellant was irate and out of control.

discussion 
appellant contends that the notice provisions of the icwa were not complied with and that the court failed to determine whether the other provisions of the icwa applied.we disagree.
according to the detention report,appellant claimed to be of cherokee descent.at the detention hearing,the juvenile court directed that notice be provided pursuant to the icwa.the jurisdictional report indicated that notice had been sent to the bia by certified mail,return receipt requested.
in,congress passed the icwa,which is designed to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of indian children from their families among the procedural safeguards included in the icwa is the provision for notice,which states in part in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or indian custodian and the tribe an indian child is defined by the icwa as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.indian tribe is defined by the icwa as any indian tribe,band,nation,or other organized group or community of indians recognized as eligible for the services provided to indians by the secretary of the interior because of their status as indians,including any alaska native village 
appellant contends notice was deficient under the icwa because t he department failed to provide notice to the cherokee tribe.in her reply brief she belatedly contends that the department should have also sent notice to the blackfoot tribe based on a notation in the court minutes from the detention hearing that appellant has been identified as being of native american heritage blackfoot except for this one unsupported notation,all other references in the record state that the appellant indian heritage was cherokee.the single notation in the court minutes appears to be a typographical error and in any event,appellant can not raise this new contention for the first time in her reply brief 
appellant reported she is of cherokee descent but provided no information as to the name or location of the cherokee tribe from which her ancestors may have descended.since there are several federally registered tribes that are associated with the term cherokee,appellant vague reference to her ancestry did not present the court with a basis for determining the identity or location of the tribe from which the minors are descended under such circumstances,the icwa does not require the department or the court to cull from the federal register the names and locations of all tribes that may be associated with a vague term such as cherokee and then give each notice of the proceedings.rather,the statute provides,under these circumstances,that such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior,which is satisfied by notice to the
