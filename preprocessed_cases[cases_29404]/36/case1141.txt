michele civil code section domestic violence claim was timely filed 
spouses are permitted to pursue appropriate civil remedies against each other,including lawsuits asserting the tort of domestic violence,see in re marriage of mcneill d.sosnick sosnick th,d.
civil code section,subdivision a provides a person is liable for the tort of domestic violence if the plaintiff proves both of the following elements the infliction of injury upon the plaintiff resulting from abuse,as defined in subdivision a of section of the penal code.the abuse was committed by the defendant,a person having a relationship with the plaintiff as defined in subdivision b of section of the penal code.
the time for commencement of an action under civil code section is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides a in any civil action for recovery of damages suffered as a result of domestic violence,the time for commencement of the action shall be the later of the following 
within three years from the date of the last act of domestic violence by the defendant against the plaintiff.
within three years from the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that an injury or illness resulted from an act of domestic violence by the defendant against the plaintiff.
b as used in this section,domestic violence has the same meaning as defined in section of the family code.
family code section defines domestic violence as abuse perpetrated against a spouse or former spouse,subd.a.
abuse is defined as any of the following a intentionally or recklessly to cause or attempt to cause bodily injury.b sexual assault.c to place a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to another.d to engage in any behavior that has been or could be enjoined pursuant to section.
the rights and remedies provided in civil code section are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law,subd.d.thus,spouses and are entitled to allege,as did michele,causes of action for assault,battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress when such counts are alleged,we look to the limitations period applicable to each of these causes of action to determine if they are barred by the statute of limitations.causes of action for assault,battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress are governed by the statute of limitations set forth in code of civil procedure section code civ.michele alleges the last physical act of abuse occurred in april.thus,her assault and battery causes of action are barred by code of civil procedure section.as for michele intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,she alleges the last act of emotional abuse occurred in april,less than two years prior to the filing of the complaint.thus,her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was timely filed pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
although the assault and battery causes of action are barred by the applicable statute of limitations,the complaint,taken as a whole,alleges a violation of civil code section.michele claims that during the period june to april,dante shoved,pushed,kicked,hit,slapped,shook,choked and sexually abused her.she also alleges he pulled her hair,pinched and twisted her flesh,threatened to kill her,threatened her with bodily harm,confined her in the family car while driving erratically and drunkenly and infected her with sexually transmitted diseases.clearly,michele has alleged that dante intentionally or recklessly caused or attempted to cause her bodily injury,sexually assaulted her,placed her in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury and engaged in behavior that could have been enjoined pursuant to family code section.we therefore conclude michele has set forth a cognizable claim for domestic violence.accordingly,the limitations period set forth in section applies code civ.
because michele alleges the last physical act of abuse occurred in april and the last act of emotional abuse occurred in april,and because the complaint was filed within three years of these dates,michelle civil code section domestic violence claim was timely filed.
d.the plain language of code of civil procedure section entitles michele to seek damages for acts of domestic abuse occurring prior to april 
michele contends she is entitled to seek damages for acts of domestic abuse occurring beyond the limitations period set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.we agree.
the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.people pieters cal d.to determine the intent,the court turns first to the words,attempting to give effect to the usual,ordinary import of the language and to avoid making any language mere surplusage.regents of university of california public employment relations bd.cal d,brewer patel th,d.in the absence of a compelling reason for doing otherwise,a statute of limitation is to be construed in accordance with its plain language.samuels mix cal th,d.
code of civil procedure section,the statute setting forth the limitations period for assault and battery between nondomestic partners,views each incident of abuse separately and the limitations period commences at the time the incident occurs.code civ,sonbergh macquarrie d.by contrast,section provides that domestic violence lawsuits must be commenced within three years from the date of the last act of domestic violence code civ,subd.a,italics added.the words last act are superfluous if they have no meaning.by adding these words,we believe the legislature adopted by statute the continuing tort theory,thus allowing domestic violence victims to recover damages for all acts of domestic violence occurring during the marriage,provided the victim proves a continuing course of abusive conduct and files suit within three years of the last act
