introduction 
in,the trial court entered an order directing hari wilburn to pay cathy tate per month in child support for their child,a.b.after not having paid any of the ordered support nor having sought to set aside the order,in february than years moved to set aside the order on the ground that the trial court had not made a finding that he was father prior to entering the child support order.the trial court denied the motion.in october,wilburn filed a renewed motion pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b to set aside the child support order.in his renewed motion,wilburn claimed that recent genetic testing demonstrated that he is not father,and that the test results constituted new evidence pursuant to section,subdivision b.the trial court denied the renewed motion.
wilburn appeals from the trial court order denying his renewed motion.on appeal,wilburn argues that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the child support order because he was never properly served with tate underlying order to show cause,the record contains no finding that he is father,and genetic testing performed in august purportedly demonstrates that he is not father.in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b is not appealable.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we construe wilburn appeal as seeking a petition for writ of mandate,and reject each of his contentions on the merits.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the child support order 
on september,tate filed an application for an order to show cause and for a temporary restraining order.in her application,tate requested that wilburn be ordered not to have any contact with tate,and that tate be granted temporary custody of.a judge of the superior court signed the temporary restraining order that day.
in a declaration attached to her application,tate stated that she and wilburn had been separated for the last four months.tate also stated that wilburn had punched her in the face,and had threatened to kill her.tate indicated that she and wilburn had a five child,and requested that wilburn be ordered to pay child support.tate listed wilburn home address in her declaration,and indicated that both she and wilburn worked at.
on september,after a hearing that tate attended and wilburn did not,the trial court found that wilburn had been properly served with tate application and order to show cause.the court entered a restraining order against wilburn,awarded tate custody of,and continued the hearing on tate request for child support.
on october,wilburn filed an application for an order to show cause,seeking to modify the restraining order.on october,the trial court held a hearing on tate request for child support.tate personally attended the hearing.wilburn was not present.that same day,the trial court entered an order directing wilburn to pay tate per month in child support.on october,the court took wilburn order to show cause off calendar when neither party appeared at a scheduled hearing on the matter.
wilburn february order to show cause to set aside the child support order 
in february,wilburn filed an application for an order to show cause seeking to set aside the child support order.in a brief in support of his order to show cause,wilburn counsel argued that the trial court should set aside the child support order because the record was devoid of a prima facie finding of paternity.counsel also stated that the record did not contain proof of service of tate order to show cause upon wilburn.
tate filed a brief and a responsive declaration in opposition to wilburn order to show cause.in her declaration,tate stated that she had personally attended a hearing on october,at which the trial court considered her order to show cause seeking child support.tate stated in her declaration that,at that hearing,the judge called the case,and indicated on the record that wilburn was properly noticed of the hearing,but failed to answer or appear.tate also stated that at the october hearing,the trial court took testimony regarding whether wilburn was the biological father of,and that the court made a finding of paternity.tate also claimed in her declaration that wilburn knew about the support order and admitted he knew about it more than fourteen years ago because he received collection correspondence from government agencies and admitted to me that he lost his driver license for failure to pay support.
on july,the trial court held a hearing at which it heard oral argument from counsel from both parties.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court denied wilburn request to set aside the child support order.on august,the trial court entered a written order denying the motion to set aside.
wilburn renewed motion to set aside the child support order 
on october,wilburn filed a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b,in which he again requested that the court set aside the child support order.in the motion,wilburn claimed that there is new evidence now available that was not available at the time of the hearing on july.with his motion,wilburn filed his own declaration detailing the procedural history of the case.in the declaration,wilburn stated 
prior to the filing of this motion,my sister tracked down in an attempt to see if she was willing to help me in this matter at that time would not get involved nor would she undergo paternity testing then.however,after the court ruling in this matter,agreed that she would undergo paternity testing with me.on august,i received the results of the paternity testing and i was excluded a s the father of.a copy of the testing result is attached hereto and marked as exhibit based on this new fact which was not previously available to me as previously would not undergo testing earlier this year she is currently years old and not residing in california i once again ask this court to set aside the child support order as a i have been excluded as the father of.
wilburn included a one page dna test report,from an entity called dna diagnostics center,with his declaration.the report describes the results of genetic testing purportedly performed in august on wilburn and,and states that wilburn is excluded as the biological father of the tested child.
wilburn also offered a declaration from.in her declaration,stated,wilburn never lived with us as a family during my childhood and has never acted like a father to me.also stated,my mother has lied to me all of my life saying that wilburn was my father.i now know that he is not,and still do not know who my father is.i am years old.i feel it is very unfair and wrong that my mother is trying to make wilburn responsible for my support.he is not my father and never assumed responsibility as my father.
on december,wilburn counsel appeared in court and informed the court that tate counsel was in trial in los angeles.wilburn counsel informed the court that tate counsel requested that the matter be continued.the trial court responded by stating that it was going to issue a tentative ruling denying the motion,and that tate need not file a response.the court stated that that it would permit wilburn counsel to present oral argument in support of the renewed motion.after hearing argument from wilburn counsel,the court indicated that it would deny wilburn motion.
on february,wilburn filed a notice of appeal from the trial court denial of his october renewed motion to set aside.on february,the trial court entered a written order denying the renewed motion.in its order,the trial court stated in relevant part 
the court finds that wilburn could have requested a dna test under family code section formerly evidence code section at or before the paternity order was made,but failed to do so.
the court finds that wilburn has waited too long to challenge the court prima facie finding of paternity in.
the court finds that the combination of presuming the court did do its job and made a prima facie finding of paternity and tate declaration who was there and who put in a declaration that the court made the finding before issuing the order involving child support is enough from the court perspective for the order to stand as is.
the court finds that the judge presiding over the matter in made a specific finding that wilburn had been validly served,so he had notice and opportunity to participate,but chose not to do so.
while this appeal was pending,tate obtained a writ of execution against wilburn in the trial court in the amount of for unpaid child support.wilburn subsequently filed a petition for writ of supersedeas in this court,requesting that this court stay the trial court proceedings.
on december,this court stayed enforcement of the writ of execution.on december,this court granted wilburn petition for writ of supersedeas.
discussiona.the trial court order denying wilburn renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b is not appealable 
wilburn seeks to appeal from an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b.this court has previously held that an order denying a motion for reconsideration pursuant to section,subdivision a is not appealable.annette sharon th,annette.in this case,we hold that an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b also is not appealable,and reject wilburn alternative arguments in support of his claim that the trial court order denying his renewed motion is appealable.
wilburn motion in the trial court is properly characterized as a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b 
in wilburn motion and brief in the trial court,he referred to his motion as a motion for reconsideration,which is provided for in section,subdivision a.however,wilburn motion cited section,subdivision b,which is more properly referred to as a renewed motion.california correctional peace officers ass virga th,fn.
after wilburn filed his notice of appeal,this annette that wilburn file a letter brief explaining why the court should not dismiss his appeal on the ground that the appeal was taken from a nonappealable order.in his letter brief,wilburn claimed that his motion in the trial court was not actually a motion for reconsideration,but a motion for renewal.in his opening brief on appeal,wilburn argues that an order denying a renewed motion is appealable.in her respondent brief,tate claims that wilburn appeal should be dismissed as stemming from a nonappealable order denying a motion for reconsideration pursuant to section,subdivision a 
in light of wilburn citation of section,subdivision b in the trial court,we conclude that his motion is properly characterized as a renewed motion under section,subdivision b.see california correctional peace officers ass virga,supra,th at,fn.stating that although the trial court order referred to the motion as a motion to reconsider instead of using a more precise term such as renewed motion,the motion was properly characterized as a renewed motion under section,subdivision b.

an order denying a motion for reconsideration pursuant to section,subdivision a is not appealable 
in annette,after noting the existence of a split of authority on the issue,this court held that an order denying a motion for reconsideration,subd.a is not appealable.this court reasoned 
although there appears to be a split of authority regarding the appealability of orders denying motions for reconsideration citation,we are persuaded by the reasoning of the majority of recent cases that have concluded orders denying motions for reconsideration are not appealable.most of the recent cases consider a motion for reconsideration never appealable.citations.citation.in rojes riverside general hospital d,rojes overruled on another ground in passavanti williams d,the court stated the same policy reasons for determining that denials of motions to vacate judgments and motions for new trial are not appealable are applicable to denials of motions for reconsideration namely,to eliminate the possibilities that a nonappealable order or judgment would be made appealable,a party would have two appeals from the same decision,and a party would obtain an unwarranted extension of time to appeal.citations.rojes,supra,at.
subsequent courts have agreed with rojes reasoning and conclusion that orders denying motions for reconsideration are not appealable.citations.annette,supra,th at.
the contrary line of authority holds that an order denying a motion for reconsideration is appealable where the order on the original motion was appealable and the party motion for reconsideration was based on facts that are new or different from those contained in the original motion.see,blue mountain development carville d,blue mountain,accord santee santa clara county office of education d,an order denying a motion for reconsideration thereof which raises new facts is also appealable.in rojes,the court that issued blue mountain changed its position,holding,we have now determined that the better ruling is that a denial of a motion for reconsideration is a order.rojes,supra,d at.
an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b is not appealable 
neither party has cited any case law addressing whether an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b is appealable and our independent research has not uncovered any such authority.however,as noted above,there is an extensive body of case law concerning the appealability of an order denying a motion for reconsideration under section,subdivision a.as indicated by the text of section,motions for reconsideration under section,subdivision a,and renewed motions under section,subdivision b are closely related.see kerns cse ins.group th,although the two subdivisions differ in certain minor details,each sets out the same essential requirements.a party filing either a motion under section,subdivision a or b is seeking a new result in the trial court based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,subds.a,b.
most importantly for purposes of this case,the reasons that this court identified in annette,supra,th at pages through,as supporting the conclusion that an order denying a motion for reconsideration under section,subdivision a is not,to eliminate the possibilities that a nonappealable order or judgment would be made appealable,a party would have two appeals from the same decision,and a party would obtain an unwarranted extension of time to with equal force to an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b.indeed,the possibility that a party may obtain an unwarranted extension of time to appeal is actually more of a concern with respect to a renewed motion under section,subdivision b,in light of the fact that such a motion may be brought at any time,while a motion for reconsideration must be brought within days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the underlying order,subd.a while wilburn notes that a motion to renew a prior motion differs from a motion for reconsideration in that the former seeks to renew a motion not reconsider an order,has no time limit,and may be heard by a new judge,he fails to make any argument as to how any of these differences render the reasons for concluding that an order denying a motion for reconsideration is not appealable outlined by this court in annette inapplicable.
accordingly,we conclude that an order denying a renewed motion pursuant to section,subdivision b is not appealable 
wilburn alternative arguments in favor of appealability are not persuasive 
we reject wilburn argument that the trial court february order is appealable because the trial court invited an appeal pursuant to section.section provides 
upon the written request of any party or his or her counsel,or at the judge discretion,a judge may indicate in any interlocutory order a belief that there is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.neither the denial of a request for,nor the objection of another party or counsel to,such a commentary in the interlocutory order,may be grounds for a writ or appeal.
wilburn argument fails for two reasons.first,the record does not contain an interlocutory order pursuant to section.the trial court oral comments at the hearing on wilburn renewed motion regarding the possibility of an appeal can not reasonably be construed as an order pursuant to section further,even assuming that the trial court had issued such an order,wilburn cites no authority,and we are aware of none,that would support the conclusion that such an order would create appellate jurisdiction in the court of appeal.compare with lauermann superior court th,the intent of section is evidently to encourage the appellate court to review the issue on the merits if the losing party files a petition for extraordinary relief,italics added.
we also reject wilburn argument that because the trial court considered his renewed motion on the merits,t his created an appealable order in and of itself,regardless of whether an order on a motion to renew is appealable.the fact that the trial court considered the matter on the merits does not establish that this court has appellate jurisdiction over wilburn appeal.
wilburn has not demonstrated that the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the child support order 
although we conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider wilburn appeal,we construe his appeal as also seeking a petition for writ of mandate,and address the merits of his contentions.see jennifer superior court th,fn.construing appeal from nonappealable order as petition for writ of mandate.
the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the child support order on the ground that wilburn was never properly served with the underlying order to show cause 
wilburn argues that the child support order was void because he was never properly served with tate underlying application and order to show cause.the record from the proceedings contains an express finding that wilburn was properly served.specifically,the trial court september,order states,tate was personally present and proof of service of the order to show cause was provided.the trial court thus did not err in refusing to set aside the child support order on the ground that wilburn had not been personally served.
the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the child support order on the ground that the record contains no finding that wilburn is father 
wilburn contends that the october,child support order must be set aside because the record contains no finding of paternity.we assume for the sake of this opinion that the trial court was obligated to make a finding of paternity prior to issuing a child support order in this domestic violence proceeding.but gonzalez munoz th,family code section,subdivision b,provides a child support order issued in a domestic violence prevention act proceeding is made without prejudice to any future paternity action.
in the trial court,tate offered a declaration in which she stated that,at the october,hearing,the trial court took testimony from me about whether wilburn was the father of,and made a finding of paternity.it is undisputed that wilburn was not present at the hearing.there is no transcript of the proceeding at which the trial court made the support order in the record on appeal 
the general rule is that,faced with a silent record,an appellate court will presume that the trial court performed its duty.people allegheny cas.cal th,any court of this state is presumed to have acted in the lawful exercise of its jurisdiction.this presumption applies only when the act of the court or judge is under collateral attack.in the absence of a transcript,we must therefore presume that the trial court performed its duty to make any necessary finding of paternity prior to awarding child support.see people allegheny cas,supra,at because nothing in the record suggests the trial judge failed to declare a forfeiture of bail in open court,and because we do not presume a court would fail to perform that statutorily mandated duty,we conclude the trial court properly refused to discharge the forfeiture of the bail bond.accordingly,we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the child support order on the ground that the record does not contain a finding of paternity.
the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the child support order on the ground that a genetic test performed in august purportedly demonstrates that wilburn is not father 
wilburn contends that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the child support order because a genetic test performed in august demonstrates that he is not father.wilburn argues that he is entitled to such relief pursuant to county of los angeles navarro th navarro.in navarro,the court of appeal concluded that a trial court erred in refusing to grant the appellant july motion to set aside a default judgment establishing his paternity of two boys and ordering him to pay child support because a recent genetic blood test indisputably proved he was not the boys father.id.at.the navarro court acknowledged that the appellant had filed his motion to set aside long after the maximum period normally allowed for setting aside a default judgment and that,therefore,b y strict application of the law,appellant should be denied relief.id.at,citing.the navarro court nevertheless concluded that equitable principles entitled the appellant to relief.navarro,supra,th at we will not sully our hands by participating in an unjust,and factually unfounded,result.
shortly after navarro was decided,the legislature enacted a specific procedure for setting aside or vacating a judgment establishing paternity county of fresno sanchez th,sanchez.the sanchez court summarized those procedures as follows 
essentially,within a period commencing with the established father knowledge of the judgment,the child birth if
