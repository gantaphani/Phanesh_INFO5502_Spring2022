introduction 
kathi weaver wife appeals a portion of a judgment of dissolution entered on july,awarding john weaver husband reimbursement of the downpayment he paid on husband and wife residence located on scandia drive in running springs scandia residence.wife also appeals the judgment finding that she was not entitled to any interest in the residence located on thule lane in running springs thule residence.
wife contends that since she and husband purchased the scandia residence as joint tenants prior to their marriage,husband is not entitled to reimbursement of the downpayment,which he paid with his separate property.wife further contends she had an ownership interest in the thule residence as a joint tenant and therefore the trial court erred in finding she had no interest in the property.
we conclude there was substantial evidence establishing that husband and wife original separate property interest in the scandia residence,as joint tenants,became community property.as a consequence,the court appropriately reimbursed husband for the downpayment.
as to the thule residence,the judgment is reversed.at the time wife filed for dissolution,wife,husband,and husband mother,henrietta weaver mother held title in the property as joint tenants.it is thus presumed under family code section that husband and wife interest in the property was community property.however,husband contributed his separate property interest in the thule residence to the couple acquisition of their community property,joint tenancy interest.thus under section husband is entitled to reimbursement for the equity value of his separate property contribution.husband and wife are each entitled to of the value of the remaining community property interest in the thule residence.
facts and procedural background 
husband and wife married on september.after years of marriage,husband and wife separated on december.on january,wife petitioned for marital dissolution.the trial court entered judgment of marital dissolution on january.
scandia residence 
in september,shortly before husband and wife married,they purchased a home on scandia drive,in running springs.husband and wife held title to the property in joint tenancy,as unmarried individuals.husband supplied from his separate property for the downpayment and additional closing costs.husband and wife funded the remainder of the home purchase through a mortgage.the deed for the scandia residence was recorded on september,two days before husband and wife marriage.
in november,husband and wife moved into the scandia residence and began remodeling it.they made about in special improvements,and obtained a second mortgage of on the scandia residence in august.the loan was used to pay for the special improvements,which included adding a garage,bedroom,and fireplace.
when husband and wife refinanced their home in november,they borrowed against their home.the mortgage at the time of the dissolution trial was.husband and wife resided at the scandia residence until they separated.

following a trial on the division of property,the trial court awarded husband a credit for the downpayment on the scandia residence as a section reimbursement.the trial court stated in its written findings and orders the following the court finds this to be community property and awards it to husband,subject to the encumbrance thereon.the court finds the gross value of the property to be with a balance owing of.however,husband is entitled to reimbursement for his separate property down payment in the amount of which is calculated by taking the purchase price of and subtracting the amount of the loan of.exhibit a he is not entitled to credit for payment of closing costs.the court declines to use wife analysis.as such,the net community interest is found to be.the evidence is insufficient to trace the in improvements to husband separate property rather than the monies received from the refinance.as such,his request for reimbursement is denied.
thule residence 
husband and wife testified at trial that,at the time wife filed for divorce on january,husband,wife,and mother held title in mother home,the thule residence,as joint tenants.
mother and her husband father purchased the thule residence in,using their earnings and proceeds from the sale of their desert home in.title was held by mother,father and husband as joint tenants.wife waived any interest in the home.husband and wife did not contribute anything to the purchase of the home.after father died in,mother changed title on her thule home and moved in with husband and wife at the scandia residence.wife was included as a joint tenant along with mother and husband.
mother testified at trial that,because she did not trust wife,she did not want her on title to the thule residence and was unaware that wife was on the title.mother claimed she never intended that wife be on the title.
wife testified that,after father death,mother had told her she intended to give husband and wife her property.wife believes that she,husband,and mother own the thule residence as joint tenants.
husband acknowledged that wife name was on the title to the thule residence as a joint tenant.husband testified that when father died,mother had a real estate agent prepare a quitclaim deed.mother said she did not want wife name on the thule title.nevertheless,the deed named mother,husband,and wife as joint tenants.husband claimed he signed the deed without reading it and did not notice wife was named as a joint tenant.he claims it was a mistake.at trial,he conceded wife held joint tenancy title we do contest that at all.the deed was recorded in.
husband acknowledged he attempted to change wife interest in the thule residence in or,after wife had filed for divorce in january,but before he was served with the divorce papers.husband went to a real estate attorney,who changed title of the thule residence to mother and husband,as joint tenants,and wife as a owner.this change prevented wife from acquiring a half interest in the property as a joint tenant in the event mother died.both husband and mother signed the deed.
following the trial,the court took the matter under submission and found that wife had no interest in the thule residence.the court stated in its written findings and orders the court finds that this residence is the property of husband his mother and there is no community interest.although there is a presumption that the title controls,wife concedes that no community monies were ever invested in this house and there is no evidence from any of the witnesses that husband mother gifted this property to both her son and his wife.see in re marriage of camire d.
wife interest in the thule residence 
wife contends the trial court erred in assigning husband her ownership interest in the thule property.she also claims husband violated the restraining order,which prohibited husband from executing the deed severing the joint tenancy and changing wife interest to tenancy in common ownership.
with regard to the latter contention,the record is insufficient to address this complaint.the record does not contain the alleged deed changing wife title to a tenancy in common interest,and the evidence indicates wife never consented to such a change.the record is also insufficient to determine whether the deed was executed prior to service of the marital dissolution petition,summons,and temporary restraining order enjoining transfer of any interest in real property.there being insufficient evidence that the alleged deed changing wife joint tenancy interest to tenancy in common was valid and enforceable,we conclude husband did not sufficiently establish such a change in title.we thus begin with the premise that at the time of trial,husband,wife,and mother held title to the thule residence in joint tenancy.
generally,property acquired during marriage by either spouse,other than by gift or inheritance,is community property.in re marriage of haines th,d.this is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof hence it can be overcome by the party contesting community property status.haines,supra,th at,d.property owned by either spouse before marriage,or acquired by gift or inheritance during marriage,is that spouse separate property.
in the instant case,husband received a joint tenancy interest in his parents home,as a gift,which constituted separate property.wife waived any interest in the property.after father died,husband and mother held joint tenancy title to the property until title was changed to reflect father death.title was changed to include wife as a joint tenant.
under section,all property held in joint title by spouses during marriage is presumed to be community property upon dissolution,rebuttable only by written evidence to the contrary,in re marriage of perkal d.such evidence must consist of either a clear statement in the deed or other documentary evidence of title by which the property is acquired that the property is separate property and not community property,or by p roof that the parties have made a written agreement that the property is separate property.thus,under section spouses can not hold property in joint title while preserving the property separate property characterization through oral or implied agreements.
but even if property held in joint tenancy loses its separate property characterization under section,section provides a right to reimbursement upon dissolution for the spouse who contributed separate property to the acquisition of property held in joint title,absent a written waiver of the right to reimbursement.we note sections and were formerly codified as civil code sections and respectively but remain for all relevant purposes the same in content as the former statutes.civil code sections and were enacted in and took effect in january.
in determining whether the trial court erred in finding wife had no interest in the thule residence,we begin by determining the character of the thule residence property,that is,whether it is community or separate property.the evidence is undisputed title was changed from joint tenancy held by mother and husband to joint tenancy held by husband,wife,and mother.
the confusion arises here as a consequence of mother arranging to change the title to reflect her husband death in.in the process of doing so,wife was added as a joint tenant,along with husband and mother.mother and husband claimed at trial they did not intend to add wife to the title.mother testified she was unaware wife was added as a joint tenant and husband claimed it was an oversight a mistake.he testified that although he and mother signed the deed,they did not realize wife was added to the title.
under section,joint tenancy title held by husband and wife in the thule residence is presumed to be community property upon dissolution.this presumption is rebuttable only by written evidence to the contrary.here,there is no written evidence refuting this presumption.the trial court reliance on in re marriage of camire d,in finding wife had no community property interest is misplaced since camire predates enactment of section later,which provides that the community property presumption can be rebutted only by written agreement or statement.prior to section,the community property presumption could be rebutted by an oral agreement.in camire,husband joint tenancy title held by the husband was voided by testimony that the wife brother orally agreed to transfer title solely to the wife.under section,such evidence would not rebut the community property presumption.
here,since wife acquired joint tenancy title to the thule residence during the marriage,under section it is presumed husband and wife joint tenancy interest in the property is community property,and this presumption was not rebutted by a writing preserving husband separate property interest in the thule residence in the event of marital dissolution.as a consequence,at the time of dissolution,husband and wife held a community property,joint tenancy interest in the thule residence.the trial court erred in finding wife had no community property interest in the property.
but under section,husband is entitled to reimbursement for his separate property contribution to husband and wife joint tenancy interest in the thule residence.generally,a spouse who converts his or her own separate property to community property is entitled to reimbursement for the separate property contribution in the event of marital dissolution,unless the right is waived in writing.the law revision commission comment to section explains under section,in case of dissolution of the marriage,a party making a separate property contribution to the acquisition of the property is not presumed to have made a gift unless it is shown that the parties agreed in writing that it was a gift,but is entitled to reimbursement for the separate property contribution at dissolution of marriage.the separate property contribution is measured by the value of the contribution at the time the contribution is made.under this rule,if the property has since appreciated in value,the community is entitled to the appreciation.if the property has since depreciated in value,reimbursement may not exceed the value of the property cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll.
in in re marriage of anderson d,and in re marriage of neal d,the court awarded reimbursement for a spouse separate property interest in real property in which title was changed during the marriage to joint tenancy.in anderson,the trial court determined that a home the husband had purchased before marriage was community property as a result of the husband deeding the property to his wife and him as joint tenants in order to obtain a home equity loan.
the anderson court concluded the husband was entitled to reimbursement under civil code section for his separate property and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to determine the value of the husband separate property contributions under civil code section.the anderson court noted that civil code section seeks to avoid the inequity which often required the equal division of property taken in joint tenancy form despite a showing that one spouse had contributed a substantial portion of his or her separate property.
in anderson,the wife argued that the grant deed itself constituted a written waiver of reimbursement rights under civil code section when a spouse transmutes his or her separate property into community property.the wife asserted that an award of reimbursement under these circumstances would render the grant deed illusory and violate a spouse right to enter into an engagement or transaction with another.
the anderson court rejected this argument,explaining that there was no finding that the husband transmuted his home into community property,and the wife erroneously assumed her husband had given his separate property to the community as a gift.the court stated there is no evidence here that husband intended to give wife a share of the hayward home,and under section,we may not presume such an intention.anderson,supra,d at.
the anderson court also rejected the wife contention that the husband conveyance of his hayward home was not a separate property contribution under civil code section because that section exclusively defines a contribution to the acquisition of the property to include downpayments,payments for improvements,and payments that reduce the principal of a loan used to finance the purchase or improvement of the property the court explained that t he term includes is ordinarily a word of enlargement and not of limitation.citation.the statutory definition of a thing as including certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.citations.we are therefore not limited to the forms of contributions enumerated in the new section.anderson,supra,d at.
the anderson court further explained that section seeks to avoid the
