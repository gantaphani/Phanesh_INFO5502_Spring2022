bill and kimberly,the parents of the minor nicholas,appeal from the jurisdictional and dispositional orders of the juvenile court adjudging the minor a dependent child pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b removing the child from their custody and ordering family reunification services.under subdivision b of section,it must be proved that there is a substantial risk the child will suffer serious physical harm as a result of his parents inability to supervise or protect him.the parents contend that the allegations contained in the petition failed to state a basis for jurisdiction under section,subdivision b and that there was insufficient evidence for the court to assume jurisdiction over the minor.in addition,they challenge the dispositional order and the suspension of visitation.we agree that the allegations in the petition failed to state a basis for jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,in that they do not allege a current substantial risk that the child will suffer serious physical harm as a result of his parents inability to supervise or protect him.we thus reverse the jurisdictional and dispositional orders.
background 
nicholas was born in september.his biological mother tiffany was a friend of bill adult son,bruce.when nicholas was six years old,tiffany decided to place him and his younger sister priscilla for adoption,and at the recommendation of bruce,the two children were adopted by kimberly and bill b.when nicholas was in the fifth grade,the adopted two more girls,and nicholas later reported feeling that bill loved the girls more than he loved him 
in,when nicholas was nine years old,his parents placed him in therapy with bret johnson,because of behavioral problems.in,nicholas was seen by therapist neil brown.according to kimberly,nicholas had become an angry,oppositional child.he tried to set a fire in a school bathroom he had disciplinary problems at school he began stealing things and hoarding food.the parents were taught two techniques for dealing with nicholas uncontrollable rages.future families,the adoption agency the family worked with,recommended putting nicholas in a cold shower,fully clothed,until his raging stopped.therapist brown showed the parents how to physically restrain nicholas after he went into a rage at a family counseling session and tried to smash a computer.
in early,nicholas was referred to the children health council in palo alto for an evaluation,but the parents reported receiving no written results nor any helpful information or tools.nicholas was diagnosed with a conduct disorder,possible mood disorder,mistrust of adults and feelings of not being cared for.nicholas then began seeing therapist jon girvetz and the parents began working with future families parent support groups.
the triggering incident occurred on september,when nicholas then years old was struck in the face by kimberly after a dispute over spilled potato chips,sibling squabbles and nicholas use of offensive language the next day,nicholas therapist jon girvetz saw injuries bruises and swelling to nicholas face and reported them to the santa cruz county human resources agency agency.kimberly admitted to girvetz and to the agency that she had slapped nicholas in the face,but by other accounts,she pinned him to the ground and punched him in the face with her fist the investigating social worker described the injuries as very severe.in the course of the investigation,reports were received from nicholas sisters that bill physically abused nicholas.at first bill denied these reports,then he called the investigating social worker and admitted he had lied and that he had hit nicholas in the past.
as a result of the investigation,the family agreed to voluntarily place nicholas in foster care and to participate in a voluntary reunification plan.by doing so,they hoped to gain clarity and perspective on the problems and to get services to help them meet nicholas needs.although nicholas seemed to adjust well to his first foster home,there were difficulties with visitation and counseling.the foster family allowed no access to nicholas for the first six weeks and no visits took place for three months.in october and november nicholas did not want to visit his parents and the agency did not enforce the visits.
the agency then asked pauline fillion,a licensed marriage and family counselor who was experienced in adoption issues,to assess the family and its problems and to develop a plan for reunification.over the next few months,she had several visits with nicholas and the family,although she spent a limited amount of time with nicholas alone.the family informed her that nicholas had been in numerous they estimated as many as different placements prior to the age of five.based in part on this unconfirmed information as well as on her interviews with nicholas and the family,she made a diagnostic assessment of nicholas as having reactive attachment and stress disorders.based on the severe needs of a child with attachment disorder,fillion recommended intense counseling for both nicholas and his family,as well as a psychiatric assessment and medication evaluation for nicholas she was critical of the initial delay in visitation and counseling,as it thwarted reunification prospects at an important time.the diagnosis of attachment disorder made sense to the parents,as it helped to explain nicholas behavior.
at christmas,nicholas reportedly looked forward to seeing his family and in february,he was making plans to come home and to redecorate his room.the family had nine visits between december and march the foster family would not allow more.then after a visit with his adult stepbrother bruce in march,nicholas refused to see his family and did not want to return home,but hoped to move in with bruce.
on march,the agency,represented by a new social worker,filed a petition pursuant to section,subdivision b failure to protect,alleging that after six months of services,the parents were not able to alleviate the concerns which brought nicholas to the attention of the agency and were not prepared to accept nicholas back into their home 
on march,a hearing was held on visitation with the parents.the court heard testimony and met with nicholas alone in chambers,in an unreported conversation.the court then suspended visits between nicholas and his parents and authorized supervised visits between nicholas and his stepbrother bruce,on condition bruce not discuss the case.the court ordered family therapy to continue.however,nicholas refused to attend family therapy and the agency so informed the court on april.
on may,the contested jurisdiction hearing began.after hearing testimony from eight witnesses,the juvenile court found that the agency had met its burden of proof on three of the four allegations in the petition and found that nicholas was a child described by section,subdivision b.witnesses included kimberly,pauline fillion,bruce the adult son of bill and the current and former social workers.bruce testified that he and his two brothers were estranged from their father because of his intimidating personality.he said his father had a volatile temper and that nicholas and his sister had told him of mistreatment by bill.he testified he had seen bill hit nicholas two or three times.the current social worker mae conroy testified that the parents were receiving support and intervention prior to the voluntary plan and had made little progress during nicholas voluntary placement.she noted that the parents minimized the physical abuse and did not take full responsibility nor did they attempt to have nicholas returned to their home she also testified that bill had not attended counseling for anger management and that nicholas did not want to go home.the agency report prepared for the hearing stated that nicholas was doing well in his foster home,although his parents attributed that to a lack of structure in the foster home.
on july,a disposition hearing was held.the report prepared for the hearing recommended continued placement with reunification services,and parental visits to resume when the therapist expressed support for such visits.at the hearing,it was noted that nicholas was in a different foster home as the two or three prior placements had ultimately not worked out because nicholas behavior had deteriorated.however,according to the current social worker trevor davis,nicholas still did not want to visit his parents and had no desire to return home.bret johnson,nicholas therapist,testified that he had first seen nicholas in therapy in for times and had now seen him times in.he diagnosed him as having an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,being inattentive,dythmic,and oppositional defiant with conduct disorder.he opined that it would be very detrimental for nicholas to return to bill and kimberly as the bond had been broken.johnson reported that nicholas told him that he did not want to see his parents because of poor communication and his fear of ongoing abuse.johnson concluded that forcing nick into a situation of communication that he verbalizes he does not want would further the problems of trust in the system and his ability to get his needs met.
the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that nicholas could not be safely returned to bill and kimberly and ordered continued foster care placement for the boy with reunification services for the family.
discussion 
the parents first contend that the petition fails to allege facts showing risk to the minor at the time of the hearing and thus the trial court erred in finding the allegations of the petition supported a finding of jurisdiction under section,subdivision b as in the case of in re alysha th,d,the agency here erroneously assumes this is essentially a substantial evidence claim t his is not a no substantial evidence claim it is a claim of failure to state a cause of action.original italics.
the parents raise a facial challenge to the petition and thus we apply the rules akin to a demurrer.in re alysha,supra,th at,d.we construe the facts in favor of the petition in order to determine whether the agency pleaded that the parents failed to supervise or protect the minor within the meaning of section,subdivision b.
the sustained petition alleged the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or legal guardian to supervise or protect the child adequately.on or about september,a referral was received that the minor was observed to have a bruise on his face inflicted by his mother.the agency investigated the referral,sustained the physical abuse allegation,and offered six months of voluntary services,including out of home foster placement with individual and family counseling.six months of reunification services will have been provided by march.the voluntary services have not led to reunification of the minor with his parents.the minor continues to display behavior that his parents do not accept,such as skateboarding while holding on to the back of a car,listening to the musical group,nirvana,and disruptive school behavior.the therapist that has worked with the family for the period states that the minor and parents are not yet ready for reunification.on or about march,a psychological evaluation was completed by john renter.the minor was diagnosed with a conduct disorder,psychosocial and environmental stressors current family difficulties,and multiple conflicts and changes before adoption.the juvenile court did not sustain allegation on or about april,a psychiatric medication evaluation was completed by kiki chang.the minor was diagnosed with a possible mood disorder,mistrust of adults and feelings of not being cared for.
trial counsel had objected that even if the supporting allegations were found to be true,they would not support the finding required for jurisdiction under subdivision b of section.this same point is now asserted on appeal.
we begin by noting that the petition must contain a concise statement of facts,separately stated,to support the conclusion that the child upon whose behalf the petition is being brought is a person within the definition of each of the sections and subdivisions under which the proceedings are being instituted,subd.f.a cause of action in dependency under section,subdivision b requires proof that t he minor has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the minor will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to adequately supervise or protect the minor.further,t he minor shall continue to be a dependent child pursuant to this subdivision only so long as is necessary to protect the minor from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness,subd.b,italics added.in re alysha,supra,th at,d.we also note that the circumstances under which the juvenile court is authorized to take jurisdiction of a child are narrowly defined.see in re alexander th,d.
the basic question under section is whether circumstances at the time of the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.in re rocco th,d.in determining what constitutes a substantial risk of serious physical harm,some general guidance may be drawn from subdivision a of section,which uses the same language to authorize jurisdiction where t he minor has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the minor will suffer,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the minor by the minor parent or guardian.for purposes of that subdivision,a court may find there is a substantial risk of serious future injury based on the manner in which a less serious injury was inflicted,a history of repeated inflictions of injuries on the minor or the minor siblings,or a combination of these and other actions by the parent or guardian which indicate the child is at risk of serious physical harm,subd.a.in re rocco,supra,th at,d.while evidence of past conduct may be probative of current conditions,the past infliction of physical harm by a caretaker,standing alone,does not establish a substantial risk of physical harm t here must be some reason to believe the acts may continue in the future.citations.id.at,d.
in carefully reviewing the petition,we consider each of the three sustained allegations in the relatively spare petition.allegation concerned one triggering incident of physical abuse by the mother.this is an incident the mother admitted and regretted.there are no further allegations nor supporting facts to suggest the serious physical harm inflicted by the mother will occur again as to the father,even though a great deal of testimony was devoted to the physically intimidating,even abusive personality of the father and his physical acts against the minor,he is not mentioned in any of the petition factual allegations.although it is true that a finding against one parent is a finding against both in terms of the child being adjudged a dependent see in re alysha,supra,th at,d,the incident of the mother striking the minor was purported to be an isolated one while the father allegedly inappropriate physicality was ongoing yet was not alleged in the petition.if the incident was not likely to recur,then the petition failed to allege facts to demonstrate present or future risk of physical harm.section,subdivision a current danger is not alleged.
as to allegation,concerning the parents objections to the minor behaviors,the fact of after six months of voluntary services,and the therapist recommendation against reunification,these allegations have a tenuous connection to the failure to protect arising out of past infliction of physical harm.by statute,voluntary services leave physical custody rights and placement decisions legally with the parents,yet here,the agency contract with the parents required them not to interfere with or object to the placement.further,the social worker cited as a reason the family did not reunify that the parents did not specifically ask that the child be returned home,when the parents testified that they believed they were not allowed to make such a request.in addition,the voluntary plan called for individual and family counseling and visits,but when the minor objected to visits and family counseling,the foster famil
