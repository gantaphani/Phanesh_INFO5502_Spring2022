background 
on july,respondent paramour,heather miller,gave birth to their son,donald.the record demonstrates that at the time of donald birth,respondent was in custody pending trial for the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child.respondent was alleged to have committed an act of sexual penetration against,who was five years old at the time the act was committed.respondent was ultimately convicted and sentenced to years imprisonment.
on january,the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship alleging that donald was neglected because miller was not providing adequate food.the record reveals that donald was hospitalized on december,for dehydration because he was not being fed.on january,a caseworker went to visit miller and donald to check on donald.the caseworker found donald lying in a playpen,looking ill,and suffering from symptoms.donald had come off,and it was wrapped around his neck.his mother was asleep,and when awakened,revealed that she had not fed donald for hours.the caseworker arranged for donald to be taken into protective custody.donald was placed in foster care and adjudication proceedings were initiated.notably,the record reveals that donald foster parents previously served as foster parents to donald older brother,also the child of respondent and miller.the foster parents subsequently adopted donald older brother and intend to adopt donald.
donald was adjudicated neglected,and after a period of several months,petitions to terminate both respondent and miller parental rights were filed.miller parental rights were ultimately terminated,and she did not contest the termination.
the petition filed against respondent alleged that he was unfit because he failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern and responsibility toward donald ilcs d b west he is depraved due to a felony conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child ilcs d i west and he is incarcerated,provided little or no support for donald prior to incarceration,and his incarceration will prevent him from parenting for more than two years ilcs d r west.respondent was found unfit under sections d i and d r of the adoption act.both findings of unfitness were reversed by the appellate court.the state,however,only contests the appellate court finding with respect to the allegation of depravity.accordingly,the facts set forth primarily relate to that allegation.
at the fitness hearing,caseworker jacqui walters from the department of children and family services dcfs testified that respondent never contacted dcfs to arrange visitation with donald and never attempted to contact donald through cards,letters,or gifts.she added that she sent respondent a copy of the dcfs service plan,which included recommendations for services such as parenting classes and sex offender treatment,but respondent never made contact with her to discuss the plan or inquire about contacting his son.respondent testified that he has been incarcerated since may,and at the time of his testimony,he was housed in the danville correctional center.a certified copy of his conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child was admitted into evidence.respondent stated that he was appealing his criminal conviction and hoped to get out of prison,obtain employment and a place to live,and raise donald.he added that he was enrolled in ged classes at danville,but was not participating in parenting classes because none were offered.there was no indication that he had initiated sex offender treatment.respondent maintained that he did not commit the crime for which he was convicted and asserted that he did not have any other felony convictions.
judge dearmond,who presided over the fitness hearing,had also presided over respondent criminal trial.defense counsel reminded the judge that respondent maintained that he did not commit the offense throughout the criminal trial and that the victim recanted.the trial judge stated i heard the case a nd i know what the testimony was.defense counsel then asked the judge to judicially notice the previous proceedings,since we fortunate enough to be in front of the judge that heard that.the court responded 
i take judicial notice that gaylord denied committing the offense that it was a fairly unique fact situation in that the minor reported the allegations,subsequently recanted the allegations,and that there were issues with regard to whether there was pressure applied to the minor to get them to recant but the testimony of gaylord was that it did not happen.
in closing arguments,the state argued that respondent should be found depraved as a result of his conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child.the following colloquy ensued as a result of that argument 
the court how does that qualify the statute says aggravated criminal sexual assault.
riggs assistant state attorney i do have the adoption code with me.i thought it was just any sexual conviction.but i could be wrong.
the court i could be wrong,too.it lists a number of offenses for which a person can be found depraved.and on the next page,the very last offense,is aggravated criminal sexual assault.i mean,i may be there some language in there that says any sexual offense.and if so,i take that into consideration.it just it kind of looks like there two classes.there those which for which a person can be found depraved,period.and then there another group for which there a rebuttable presumption that they depraved.
respondent counsel also addressed this issue in closing argument,stating 
t o the extent that we dealing with some sort of essentially a conclusive presumption,that the conviction ipso facto makes him depraved,or whether it somehow a rebuttable presumption,but we would suggest that gaylord at least ought to have an opportunity to contest whether he is depraved and,as best he can,has done so by offering testimony today and by the court judicially noticing his previous testimony that essentially he did not participate on any assaultive behavior on the victim.
in rendering its judgment,the trial court did not consider the presumption.instead,the court considered whether a single conviction could support a finding of depravity as defined by this court d epravity is an inherent deficiency of moral sense and rectitude.in re abdullah,quoting stalder stone.the trial court also looked to this court analysis in abdullah,along with the appellate court holdings in in re,d,and in re,d,and concluded that the case law does not prohibit a finding of depravity based on a single criminal conviction.the court added a nd when you consider the nature of the criminal conviction in relation to the nature of the case we here on,i think it does constitute a sufficient basis for a finding of depravity under subsection d i.and i find that there is clear and convincing evidence based upon the felony conviction.
respondent appealed the trial court judgment,and the appellate court reversed,with one justice dissenting.the appellate court found that the trial court needed something more than the mere fact of respondent conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child to support a finding of depravity.d at.the appellate court concluded that the trial court only took judicial notice of respondent denials and the victim recantation,but did not consider the underlying facts of the criminal case.d at.additionally,the appellate court recognized that section d i of the adoption act had been amended to include specific offenses which triggered a presumption of depravity.d at.the appellate court noted that predatory criminal sexual assault of a child was not enumerated in the statute,and thus declined to assume that the legislature intended to include predatory criminal sexual assault of a child but simply neglected to do so.d at.the appellate court ultimately concluded that the burden was squarely on the state to provide evidence of respondent depravity beyond the mere fact of his conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child,and its failure to do so rendered the trial court finding of depravity against the manifest weight of the evidence.d at.we granted the state petition for leave to appeal.a.
notably,since the filing of the state petition,the appellate court has filed a rule order in respondent criminal appeal,people gaylord,january,unpublished order under supreme court rule.at oral argument,respondent requested that this court take judicial notice of the rule order and the facts contained therein the state does not object,as it was the state position that the trial court took judicial notice of the underlying facts of respondent criminal conviction during the fitness hearing.accordingly,we take judicial notice of the rule order.
according to the rule order,the evidence presented at respondent criminal trial demonstrated that dcfs was called to investigate a charge of environmental neglect against jason and tabitha traylor.the dcfs investigator interviewed,tabitha daughter.was asked if she was afraid of anyone,and she responded that she was afraid of respondent.she stated that respondent private part had touched her private part.added that she was afraid she would get in trouble for telling because it was a secret.
a second dcfs investigator interviewed later that day.described the incident,stating that respondent put his private part inside her private part after giving her a bath.she stated that it hurt,but she did not cry.described the way respondent private part looked and where it was located.she also stated that respondent placed his finger and a spoon in her vagina.when asked what she thought should happen to respondent,she replied that he should go to jail.
recanted her statements when testifying at trial.she averred that the dcfs investigator told her what to say and that respondent never touched her.the traylors also testified,on respondent behalf,that recanted her statements to them.they added that they had more than adults talk to about her accusations against respondent,and she recanted to those adults as well.additionally,they indicated that they considered respondent a very good friend.
respondent testified at the trial.he denied committing the crime for which he was charged.however,in contrast to his testimony at the fitness hearing,he admitted that he had previously been convicted of criminal sexual assault,was placed on probation,and ordered to register as a sex offender for years.he averred that he was years old when he committed that offense and the victim was years old.
the trial court concluded that statements to the dcfs investigators were credible and further found that recantation was the result of pressure from her parents,who were very supportive of respondent.the trial court further found that it was obvious that parents had put substantial pressure on this victim.the court thus found respondent guilty of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child.the appellate court affirmed.people gaylord,january,unpublished order under supreme court rule.respondent has since filed a petition for leave to appeal to this court on the criminal matter.people gaylord,pet.for leave to appeal pending.
with these background facts,we now consider whether the appellate court properly reversed the trial court finding of unfitness and its ultimate termination of respondent parental rights.
under the juvenile court act of,the involuntary termination of parental rights involves a process.first,there must be a showing,based on clear and convincing evidence,that the parent is unfit,as that term is defined in section d of the adoption act ilcs d west.if the court makes a finding of unfitness,the court then considers whether it is in the best interests of the child that parental rights be terminated.see ilcs west in re.although section d of the adoption act sets forth numerous grounds under which a parent may be deemed unfit,any one ground,properly proven,is sufficient to enter a finding of unfitness.see ilcs d west in re.
in this case,as previously stated,the trial court found respondent unfit on the ground of depravity.the trial court did not make this finding in reliance on a presumption of depravity.rather,the trial court concluded,based on the evidence of respondent criminal conviction,that the state met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that respondent was depraved,in that he had an inherent deficiency of moral sense and rectitude.see in re abdullah,at.the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment,finding that respondent conviction for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child was insufficient,by itself,to support a finding of depravity.the state asserts that the appellate court erred in concluding that the state failed to meet its burden.according to the state,the fact that respondent was convicted of the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child triggers a rebuttable presumption of depravity which can only be overcome if respondent shows,by clear and convincing evidence,that he is not depraved.
respondent asserts that the plain language of section d i demonstrates that the offense of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child does not trigger a rebuttable presumption of depravity.indeed,respondent argues that if the legislature intended for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child to trigger the presumption,it would have listed that offense in the statute.
section d i of the adoption act provides in relevant part 
unfit person means any person whom the court shall find to be unfit to have a child,without regard to the likelihood that the child will be placed for adoption.the grounds of unfitness are any one or more of the following 
i depravity.conviction of any one of the following crimes shall create a presumption that a parent is depraved which can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence first degree murder in violation of paragraph or of subsection a of section of the criminal code of or conviction of second degree murder in violation of subsection a of section of the criminal code of of a parent of the child to be adopted first degree murder or second degree murder of any child in violation of the criminal code of attempt or conspiracy to commit first degree murder or second degree murder of any child in violation of the criminal code of solicitation to commit murder of any child,solicitation to commit murder of any child for hire,or solicitation to commit second degree murder of any child in violation of the criminal code of or aggravated criminal sexual assault in violation of section b of the criminal code of.emphasis added.ilcs d i west.
the issue before us is one of statutory construction.the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.people ward.the best evidence of legislative intent is the language of the statute,and when possible,the court should interpret the language of a statute according to its plain and ordinary meaning.in re.we do not construe words and phrases of a statute in isolation instead,all provisions of a statute are viewed as a whole.in re detention of lieberman.legislative intent can be ascertained from a consideration of the entire act,its nature,its object and the consequences that would result from construing it one way or the other.fumarolo chicago board of education.thus,we are not bound by the literal language of a statute if that language produces absurd or unjust results not contemplated by the legislature,at.issues of statutory construction are questions of law that we review de novo.ward,at.
the state acknowledges that predatory criminal sexual assault of a child is not an offense enumerated in the statute.h
