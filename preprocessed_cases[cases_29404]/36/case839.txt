jennifer appeals orders terminating parental rights under welfare and institutions code section she also appeals an order summarily denying her petition for modification under section.jennifer asserts the court did not comply with the indian child welfare act et icwa or federal act.we affirm.
introduction 
while the standard for icwa notice is low,it is not without reasonable limits.this case raises the issue whether a child specific but attenuated indian heritage invokes icwa notice requirements under section,subdivision b,which describes circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child.we hold the trial court has discretion to consider the totality of the information presented concerning the child family circumstances to determine whether it meets the threshold required for icwa notice the court knows or has reason to know the child is an indian child.we further hold icwa notice is not required unless the totality of the family circumstances indicate there is a low but reasonable probability the child is an indian child.here,we conclude the case need not be remanded for icwa notice because the family specific but attenuated indian heritage does not provide reason to know the child is an indian child.
we further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the parent did not show a prima facie case of changed circumstances and best interests of the child,and summarily denied her petition for modification under section.in addition,we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the court finding the beneficial relationship exception did not apply.
factual and procedural background 
skyler,now age,is the daughter of jennifer and kenneth together,the parents.when skyler was a baby,kenneth placed her in the care of her paternal grandmother grandmother because jennifer was running the streets with skyler.in april,when skyler was three years old,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a petition alleging a paternal uncle hit skyler and she was exposed to violent confrontations between the paternal uncle and her older half sister,amber,subd.b.amber said jennifer hardly ever visited skyler,perhaps once every two months.
kenneth had a criminal history dating from,primarily for drug violations.he was incarcerated when the proceedings began.
the agency located jennifer in local custody.she was convicted in for threatening to commit a crime resulting in death or great bodily injury.in jennifer was convicted of receiving stolen property.
the court recognized grandmother as skyler de facto parent and placed skyler in her home.
in august the court ordered a plan of reunification services for jennifer.within a short time,jennifer was noncompliant with her substance abuse treatment program.by december she had not participated in services,visited skyler or contacted the social worker in more than two months.
in february jennifer was remanded to the custody of the california department of corrections cdc for two years for violating the terms of her probation.
grandmother did not believe either parent would stay out of jail long enough to provide a home for skyler.in july,at the status review hearing,the court identified a permanent plan of legal guardianship for skyler with grandmother.in january the court appointed grandmother guardian and terminated jurisdiction.
in october the agency filed a petition alleging grandmother had left skyler with kenneth and allowed her to reside in filthy conditions.skyler was begging the neighbors for food and money,and she was dirty and unkempt.kenneth was using methamphetamine.he assaulted his girlfriend and held a shotgun to her head in front of skyler and his baby daughter.after skyler was detained,she was diagnosed with a kidney infection.
jennifer was in local custody.she had been arrested in april and was convicted on charges of possession of narcotics,reckless driving and possession of a hypodermic.she admitted she had used methamphetamine since she was years old.jennifer last saw skyler in january,when she had skyler in her care for a week.jennifer told the social worker she wanted to stop using drugs and have skyler back in her life.in september jennifer entered the pregnant and parenting inmates program,which provided substance abuse treatment and health education for pregnant,postpartum or parenting women.
kenneth was arrested in october for smuggling mexican nationals into the united states.he was incarcerated until february.
at a special hearing,the social reported that the maternal grandmother,stated her was a cherokee who had lived in arkansas.did not know the specific tribe.she believed he had signed the family rights away to get any benefits from the tribe.each year,attended an intertribal on father day,and participated in one of the dances.however,neither she nor any other family member was enrolled in any tribe,had lived on an indian reservation or in an indian community,or had received any services or benefits available to indians.the court found that skyler was not an indian child within the meaning of icwa.
in december the court terminated grandmother guardianship and selected a permanent plan of foster care for skyler.the court granted the parents reasonable supervised visitation.skyler baby half sister was also placed with the same family.
in may,at the agency request,the court referred the matter for a section hearing.skyler foster parents were interested in adopting her.
several days before the scheduled hearing,jennifer filed a section petition asking the court to place skyler with her or,alternatively,allow her to have an opportunity to reunify with skyler.jennifer averred she had completed a drug treatment program,an anger management program and two parenting classes.she was discharged from parole in june,and had remained drug free.jennifer shared a residence with a female roommate.she consistently visited skyler,who seemed happy to see her.
the section hearing was held on november.the court summarily denied jennifer section petition.
the social worker reported that skyler,who was almost years old,was a joy of a child.she was resilient,engaging,polite and sweet.skyler was focused on school and her friends,and did not act out.the social worker testified she had talked to skyler about adoption.skyler did not want to live under guardianship because it had not worked for her in the past.she was a very bright child and understood her parents would not have any legal rights to her.skyler had a good understanding of adoption and wanted to be adopted by her foster care parents.she was happy where she was living.the social worker believed she loved her foster parents and family.
skyler visited jennifer and kenneth separately.she was affectionate with each parent.jennifer praised and complimented skyler,and treated her lovingly.at one visit,skyler asked jennifer to pick her up and carry her for a few minutes,which jennifer did.at times skyler was animated and stayed close to jennifer.at other visits,she was reserved and less responsive.skyler was cheerful after visiting kenneth.skyler liked visiting her parents.she said she would be sad but it would be ok if she could not visit them.the social worker believed it would be good if skyler could occasionally visit jennifer.
the court found that there was strong evidence there would be no barriers to skyler adoption by her foster care parents.the court said skyler knew her parents and loved them,as did most abused children.however,skyler longed for stability,and adoption would meet her needs.the court terminated jennifer and kenneth parental rights.
discussion 
jennifer raises three claims of error on appeal.she contends the trial court erred when it concluded skyler was not an indian child and the matter should be remanded to the trial court with directions to comply with icwa notice requirements.jennifer argues she established a prima facie case of changed circumstances and best interests to merit a hearing on her section petition,and requests this court reverse the order terminating parental rights and remand for a hearing under section.jennifer also asserts reversal of the order terminating parental rights is required because the court finding the beneficial relationship exception did not apply is not supported by substantial evidence.
kenneth did not file a notice of appeal,but joins with jennifer brief.he contends if this court reverses the order terminating jennifer parental rights,his parental rights must also be reinstated.
skyler was cherokee and her maternal grandmother,participated in an annual indian.jennifer argues these facts give the court reason to know the child is an indian child,requiring notice under sections and,subdivision d.we do not agree.we conclude the family circumstances do not provide sufficient reason to know skyler is a member of,or is eligible for membership in,an indian tribe,as defined in united states code section and applicable case law.the trial court did not err when it found that icwa did not apply.
in this part,we discuss the goals of icwa and its implementation in section et state icwa act or state act.we examine section,subdivision b,which is the threshold statute for icwa notice under state law,and compare its terms to the recommendations found in section,determination that child is an indian,of the bureau of indian affairs bia guidelines for state courts clarifying this court decision in damian th,damian.we discuss the definition of an indian child and the meaning of reason to know.after reviewing prior case law addressing icwa notice requirements,we evaluate the facts of this case in view of our conclusion that while the standard for icwa notice is low,notice is not required unless there is a reasonable probability the child is an indian child.finally,within the context of the dependency system,we consider the needs of a dependent child,whether indian or,for a safe,permanent home.we are mindful of the appropriate use of judicial resources,including the resources of the social service agency in its capacity as an arm of the court.

the united states congress enacted icwa to respond to a crisis occurring in indian tribes in which large numbers of indian children were removed from their families for placement in homes.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,holyfield.icwa was intended to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by establishing minimum standards for removal of indian children from their families and placement of indian children in foster or adoptive homes reflecting the values of indian culture.in re jeremiah th,in re kahlen d,kahlen.icwa applies when the state knows or has reason to know an indian child is involved,and seeks to place the child in foster care or terminate parental rights in an involuntary proceeding.a.
effective january,the california legislature codified icwa notice requirements in a comprehensive reorganization of statutes related to the application of icwa in section et state icwa act or state act.damian,supra,th at.adopting language from united states code section a,the state icwa notice provisions direct the to provide notice to the parent or indian custodian,and the tribe,of an indian child,if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved in the proceedings,subd.a,subd.d see in re shane th,shane.notice requirements are intended to ensure the child indian tribe will have the opportunity to intervene and assert its rights in the proceedings.kahlen,supra,d at.
the decision whether a child is a member of,or eligible for membership in,the tribe is the sole province of the tribe,subd.c.however,as we will discuss,before the tribe makes that decision,the trial court must determine whether it has reason to know the child is an indian child,requiring notice to the tribe.under section,subdivision b,that determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.
this court has stated the legislature,in enacting the state icwa act,intended the state notice provisions to be more expansive than icwa and to standardize the interpretation of icwa provisions and inquiry and noticing practice throughout the state.damian,supra,th at.however,damian did not discuss the variance in the notice requirements between the state icwa act and the bia guidelines,subd.b guidelines,supra,c.
state law must be liberally construed in favor of indian interests.holyfield,supra,at,fn.in determining legislative intent,we first look to the best indicator of legislative statutory language itself.mejia reed cal th,adoption of kelsey cal th.the words must be construed with reference to the entire system of law of which it is a part.moore panish cal d.thus,section,subdivision b,is viewed in the context of icwa,the state act and the dependency system.keeping in mind the primacy of indian interests in icwa notice,we ascertain the legislature intent by looking to the words of the statute and giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.hunt,supra,cal th at,quoting dafonte,cal th.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
while the state notice provisions are broader than the applicable federal statute damian,supra,th at,the statutory language in section,subdivision b,which establishes the threshold requirements for notice,is not as expansive as the bia recommendations of the criteria to determine whether the child is an indian child.a guidelines,supra.the plain language of section,subdivision b,permits the conclusion the legislature intended the threshold for state icwa notice to be more restrictive than the threshold recommended by the guidelines,subds.b,d.
the differences between the statutory language in state icwa notice requirements and section of the guidelines are instructive.first,the guidelines recommend the state court provide icwa notice when it has reason to believe the child is an indian child.guidelines,supra.as we have discussed,the legislature has adopted the more restrictive reason to know language from the federal statute,subd.d a.second,the guidelines list a number of circumstances under which a state court has reason to believe a child involved in an involuntary child custody proceeding is an indian child guidelines,c.if one or more of these circumstances exist,the guidelines state the court shall seek verification of the child status from either the bia or the child tribe,a.thus,if a state follows the guidelines,it must take further action if one or more of the family circumstances are described in section c of the guidelines.
the legislature,in enacting section,subdivision b,did not adopt the mandatory language recommended by the guidelines.we presume the legislature was aware of the guidelines when it enacted the state act.people roberts,supra,th at,people strohl,supra,d at.rather,section,subdivision b,describes circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child,subd.b see also rule a.these circumstances include,but are not limited to,the following 
a person having an interest in the child,including the child,an officer of the court,a tribe,an indian organization,a public or private agency,or a member of the child extended family provides information suggesting the child is a member of a tribe or eligible for membership in a tribe or one or more of the child biological parents,grandparents,or are or were a member of a tribe.
the residence or domicile of the child,the child parents,or indian custodian is in a predominantly indian community.
the child or the child family has received services or benefits from a tribe or services that are available to indians from tribes or the federal government,such as the indian health service,subd.b.

the meaning of the terms indian child and reason to know are central to the court obligation to provide notice.in construing the extent of the court obligation under state law,we look to the words of the statutes to determine legislative intent and to fulfill the purpose of the law.gooch hendrix cal th,in re heraclio th,we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuing the legislative purpose.people canty cal th.
federal law defines an indian child as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of a tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.membership requirements vary from tribe to tribe enrollment is not always required.united states broncheau cir,see in re arianna.section,subdivision a,provides the terms used in the state act,including indian child,are defined as specified in icwa,unless the context in which the term is used requires another definition,subd.a.we can find no reason to depart from the definition of indian child in united states code section,as clarified by applicable case law.see,united states broncheau,supra,at in re,supra,th at in re antoinette,supra,th at in re arianna,supra,at,fns.
icwa and the applicable federal regulations do not define reason to know.in re,supra,th at.this permits the reasonable inference the phrase is to be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning.reason to know is broadly defined as information from which a person of ordinary intelligence would infer that the fact in question exists or that there is a substantial enough chance of its existence that,if the person exercises reasonable care,the person can assume the fact exists.black law dict.ed.under section,subdivision b,the fact at issue is the child status as an indian child.in this context,chance is defined as the degree of likelihood of such an outcome.new collegiate,supra,at.construing reason to know in favor of indian interests,we hold the family circumstances should indicate there is a substantial enough chance,or low but reasonable probability,the child is a member of,or eligible for membership in,an indian tribe,subd.a.
reviewing courts,including this court,have recognized there must be sufficient indication the child is an indian child within the meaning of icwa to invoke notice requirements.in re jeremiah,supra,th at shane,supra,th at in re th,see in re christopher th.thus,a mere hint or suggestion of indian ancestry is no longer sufficient to require notice under state law.contra,in re robert th,in re nikki,supra,th at in re antoinette,supra,th at dwayne superior court th.b oth the federal regulations and the california welfare institutions code require more than a bare suggestion that a child might be an indian child.in re jeremiah,supra,at.
the opinions of the supreme courts of wisconsin and colorado concerning this issue are relevant here.the wisconsin supreme court stated the term indian child as defined by icwa means something more specific than merely having native american ancestors.in re arianna,supra.at.the colorado supreme court adopted a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether icwa notice is required.it stated p recisely what constitutes reason to know or reason to believe in any particular set of circumstances will necessarily evade meaningful description.as in other contexts,reasonable grounds to believe must depend upon the totality of the circumstances and include consideration of not only the nature and specificity of available information but also the credibility of the source of that information and the basis of the source knowledge.people ex rel.
the indian status of the child does not have to be certain to invoke the notice requirement.dwayne superior court,supra,th in re,supra,th.however,while the threshold of providing notice under state law is low,it is not without reasonable limits.in the interest of iowa app.in view of the totality of the family circumstances,a child specific but attenuated indian heritage may not be sufficient to provide reason to know an indian child is involved.where the totality of the family circumstances does not indicate there is a low but reasonable probability the child is an indian child,the court does not have reason to know an indian child is involved,and notice is not required.people ex rel,supra,at.this is the case here.
provided specific and credible information about the family indian heritage and her own continued participation in an annual intertribal cultural event.while the information provided about skyler grandfather could be broadly construed to suggest skyler was a member of a cherokee tribe,an overbroad construction does not serve icwa goal to promote the security and stability of indian tribes or the child interest in a prompt resolution of his or her custody status.in re th.skyler is five generations removed from the last family member known to be a member of an indian tribe.jennifer stated she had indian heritage but it was too little to know.did not claim she or one of her parents was a tribal member.under the totality of these circumstances,it is not reasonably probable skyler is an indian child.thus,the court did not have reason to know skyler is a member of,or eligible for membership in,an indian tribe,and notice is not required.
icwa and the state act do not contravene the goals of california dependency scheme,which is to reunify the family when safe for the child,and to provide the child with a safe,permanent,stable home within the time limits defined by the legislature,subd.a see.if the dependent child is an indian child,this home must reflect the unique values of the child tribal culture and is best able to assist the child in establishing,developing,and maintaining a political,cultural,and social relationship with the child tribe and tribal community,subd.see.where the child family has not had a relationship with an indian tribe for many generations,as here,notice becomes a formality that does not serve icwa goals or the child best interests.we do not believe the legislature intended the courts to engage in empty formalities that result in waste of scarce judicial resources.in re th,citing in re.th,in re,supra,th at.
interpreting section,subdivision b,to require notice where the family indian heritage is specific but attenuated would delay permanency for a child such as skyler,who was first made a dependent of the juvenile court in,and is only now finding a safe,stable and permanent home.we conclude the circumstances presented here do not provide the court reason to know skyler is an indian child,and reversal for icwa notice is not required.shane,supra,th at.
jennifer contends the trial court erred when it arbitrarily denied an evidentiary hearing on the merits of her section petition.she argues the petition stated a prima facie case of changed circumstances and the child best interests,and thus the court was required by law to hold a hearing.jennifer also argues the court considered the evidence presented in the agency court reports without affording her an opportunity to be heard and to controvert the evidence against her.
under section,a party may petition the court to change,modify or set aside a previous court order.the petitioning party has the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,there is a change of circumstances or new evidence,and the proposed modification is in the child best interests.in re jasmon cal th in re amber th.
