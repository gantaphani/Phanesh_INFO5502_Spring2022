factual and procedural background 
the initial dependency petitions on behalf of tiffany first three children 
on approximately september,tiffany daughter was admitted to the hospital with multiple one to six weeks were consistent with physical abuse and would not ordinarily occur except as a result of neglectful acts or omissions by parents.was in the care of both her father jeremy,and tiffany at the time of the injuries.the los angeles county department of children and family services department filed a petition on september,to declare and her old sibling dependent children of the court under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a,b,e,i and j alleging serious physical harm,failure to protect,severe physical abuse of a child under five,cruelty and abuse of a sibling,who was born with a neurological condition,was initially put on hospital hold and then placed in a foster home licensed to care for medically fragile children was detained and placed with paternal grandmother karen see in re th,d.at a jurisdiction and disposition hearing on march,the juvenile court sustained the petition and ordered and suitably placed.see id.at,d.
in september tiffany son was born with cerebral palsy and a neurological condition similar to.was detained days after his birth based on the department assessment he would be at risk if released to tiffany.on december,the juvenile court ordered suitably placed.
at a permanency planning hearing on july,the juvenile court granted legal guardianship of,and to karen tiffany was permitted visitation at the legal guardian discretion.unmonitored visitation was allowed in karen home visitation was to be monitored outside her home.however,the case social worker advised karen,that in her professional opinion,she should never allow tiffany to have unmonitored contact with the children.
the death of,the removal of and from karen custody and the discovery of tiffany fourth child 
on monday morning,august,karen and tiffany brought to the hospital because he had droopy eyes and a faint pulse and blood and fluids he had been drinking were coming out of his nose.died at the hospital later that day and was found to have severe bleeding in the brain,possibly due to blunt force trauma hemorrhaging bruising of the eyes and cardiovascular and respiratory failure 
and were immediately removed from karen custody and placed in shelter care karen was arrested and charged with murder.in connection with the investigation of death,the department learned tiffany had given birth to a fourth child,in january.was removed from tiffany care and custody on august.on september,the department filed supplemental petitions on behalf of and and a section petition as to 
the birth of baby boy and the section petition on his behalf 
in early march tiffany gave birth to baby boy at a hospital in lancaster.tiffany was released from the hospital two days later.according to her testimony,tiffany left the hospital and met baby boy biological father,identified by tiffany as james smith,at the lancaster train station where she gave the child to him.
on march,during tiffany monitored visitation with,and,a social worker noticed tiffany no longer appeared to be pregnant and asked if she had given birth.tiffany refused to answer.believing the baby was at risk of harm,the social worker,accompanied by police officers,visited tiffany home on march,but tiffany sister denied them entry.the following day a social worker confirmed with the department of health services newborn screening program that tiffany had given birth.
on april,the department filed a section petition on behalf of baby boy,alleging he was at risk of harm based on the severe injuries suffered by and the death of.at the initial detention hearing,which tiffany did not attend,the juvenile court ordered baby boy detained and issued a protective custody warrant for him.the court then continued the detention hearing and ordered the department to submit proof of a live birth.
at tiffany monitored visitation on april,the social worker gave her a copy of the section petition filed april,the detention report dated april,and a citation to appear at the continued detention hearing scheduled for april.tiffany denied giving birth and told the social worker she would not appear.tiffany was informed the department had evidence of baby boy birth and warned an arrest warrant might be issued if she failed to appear.
tiffany failed to appear at the continued detention hearing on april.after the department provided the juvenile court with hospital records relating to baby boy birth,the court issued a bench warrant for tiffany and a search warrant for tiffany home and ordered the protective custody warrant for baby boy issued on april,to remain in full force and effect.the matter was continued for a pretrial resolution conference.
the contempt proceedings to ascertain the whereabouts of baby boy 
tiffany was apprehended and brought before the juvenile court on april.beginning on april,and continuing through april,a series of contempt proceedings before patricia spear were held to ascertain the location of baby boy tiffany remained in custody throughout this period.
on april,tiffany testified she had checked into a hospital in lancaster on an evening in early march,gave birth to baby boy and was released from the hospital two days later.her sister kalisha,who lived in lancaster,took her from the hospital to the train station so she could give baby boy to smith,who had said he was going to take the baby to atlanta,where smith lived.tiffany claimed she did not know,nor did she want to know,smith telephone number,address or anything about him other than he lived in atlanta.tiffany explained she had met smith on the streets near her home in long beach and began a sexual relationship with him about three months before she got pregnant the relationship ended as soon as she got pregnant.smith,however,called tiffany approximately once a week to see how she was doing.a few months before baby boy was born,she and smith agreed he would take the baby because tiffany did not want my son in foster care.
the court initially disbelieved tiffany testimony she did not know how to contact smith or where baby boy was located.however,after several additional hearings with testimony from tiffany sister and mother,as well as further testimony by tiffany,on april,the court concluded it was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt tiffany had more information than she had already divulged.the court indicated it was beginning to think she really did set it up so that she could say she does know where they are consequently,the court purged the contempt proceedings and released tiffany from custody.
the jurisdiction and disposition hearings 
on june,the juvenile court stanley genser held a jurisdiction hearing for,and baby boy tiffany moved to dismiss baby boy petition because he was not in her custody and there was no evidence baby boy was at risk.the court denied the motion,finding that tiffany had concealed her pregnancy,gone to lancaster from her home in long beach to give birth to baby boy and had constructive custody of the baby when he was released to her by the hospital.tiffany submitted all remaining issues to the court based on the department reports.after determining tiffany understood and voluntarily waived her trial rights,the court sustained the petitions as amended as to all four children 
proceeding immediately to disposition,the juvenile court declared and baby boy dependent children of the court on the ground they were individuals described in section,subdivisions a,f,and j and denied tiffany family reunification services as to all four children pursuant to section,subdivision b and,finding that she had caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect and that she had already failed to reunify with and and had not addressed the issues that led to their removal.the court set a permanency planning hearing for october,for,and no permanency planning hearing was scheduled for baby boy m.the court identified foster care as baby boy permanent plan and ordered he would receive permanent placement services if he were located.the court again ordered the previously issued protective custody warrant as to baby boy to remain in full force and effect.
contentions 
tiffany contends the juvenile court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for dependency proceedings as to baby boy under the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,et and,even if it had jurisdiction,the court should have deferred conducting the jurisdiction and disposition hearings until baby boy is located.the department and appellate counsel for baby boy contend tiffany appeal should be dismissed under the disentitlement doctrine because of her deliberate acts to obstruct the department efforts to bring baby boy under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
discussion 
the disentitlement doctrine does not apply under the circumstances presented here 
under the disentitlement doctrine a reviewing court applying equitable principles may exercise its inherent power to dismiss an appeal by a party who has refused to comply with trial court orders.in re claudia th,d.the disentitlement doctrine is based on the equitable notion that a party to an action can not seek the assistance of a court while the party stands in an attitude of contempt to legal orders and processes of the courts of this state.citations.citation.a formal judgment of contempt,however,is not a prerequisite to exercising our power to dismiss rather,we may dismiss an appeal where there has been willful disobedience or obstructive tactics.ibid.
the department and appellate counsel for baby boy argue tiffany appeal should be dismissed under the disentitlement doctrine,which has been applied in dependency proceedings.see in re kamelia th,d father who absconded with child in violation of court orders not permitted to appeal from order placing child in foster care in re th,d mother who refused to undergo psychological evaluation and otherwise interfered with assessment of her ability to care for the child not permitted to appeal order denying reunification services.although acknowledging that tiffany was not held in contempt after several evidentiary hearings and,in fact,has not violated any juvenile court orders relating to baby boy,the department and baby boy assert application of the disentitlement doctrine is justified under the circumstances of this case tiffany,while under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court because of the dependency proceedings involving her other children,willfully impeded the ability of the court and the department to protect baby boy by delivering the child to his biological father to take to an unknown location,recognizing that,if she kept the baby,the department would immediately take custody of him.as a result,they argue,it would be appropriate to dismiss tiffany appeal,even though such an action would represent an expansion of the disentitlement doctrine.
we certainly do not condone tiffany efforts to mislead the department about baby boy birth and share the department and juvenile court concern that,in giving her child to a man she barely knew albeit baby boy biological father to live in conditions and circumstances about which she did not inquire,tiffany has failed to arrange adequately for the care of her child,subd.g in re monica th,d.nonetheless,all of tiffany obstructive conduct occurred prior to the filing of the dependency petition on april,tiffany had no legal obligation to discuss her pregnancy or the birth of baby boy with the department.although she may have impeded the department efforts to help her family and frustrated the underlying purpose of the dependency law,she does not stand in an attitude of contempt to legal orders and processes of the courts of this state.in re claudia,supra,th at,d.under the circumstances we decline to expand the disentitlement doctrine to preclude the appeal of a recalcitrant parent,who,despite her initial lack of cooperation,has violated no court order and who presents a threshold question concerning the subject matter jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
the record fails to clearly demonstrate jurisdiction to make nonemergency custody orders under the uccjea 
the uccjea provides the exclusive method of determining subject matter jurisdiction in custody cases in california.in re stephanie cal th,d,subd.b subdivision a of is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.the uccjea applies to dependency proceedings.in re claudia,supra,th at,d see in re stephanie,at,d.
family code section provides for temporary emergency jurisdiction over a child present in this state who has been abandoned or if it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child from mistreatment or abuse or threatened mistreatment or abuse.see in re nada th,d.although she testified she gave baby boy to his biological father to take out of state specifically to georgia shortly after the child birth,which if true would mean the child was not in california when the dependency petition was filed,tiffany does not contest the juvenile court jurisdiction to enter the initial detention orders made in april.however,she does argue the court lacked jurisdiction under family code section,subdivision a to make additional orders regarding the custody of baby boy,including the jurisdiction and disposition orders challenged by her appeal 
specifically,tiffany asserts there is insufficient evidence in the record that california was baby boy home state at the time the proceeding commenced,subd.a because,although the child was born in california,tiffany gave him to smith,who told her he was going to raise the child in atlanta.although there is no evidence corroborating tiffany testimony and also no evidence that,even if she gave baby boy to smith,smith in fact took the child,there is similarly no evidence establishing baby boy lived in california from the day he was born until the initial detention hearing on april,required for california to be the child home state,subd.g in the case of a child less than six months of age,the term home state means the state in which the child lived from birth with a parent or a person acting as a parent.tiffany also contends there are insufficient facts in the record to establish any of the other grounds identified in family code section for california to exert jurisdiction over the absent baby boy 
implicit in tiffany argument is the assertion the department,which initiated the dependency proceedings,bears the burden of establishing the court jurisdiction.we agree see in re marriage of hopson d.subject matter jurisdiction under uccja requires findings that statutory criteria have been met in re th,d unsubstantiated allegations insufficient to invoke emergency jurisdiction under uccjea and further agree the record does not contain sufficient facts to establish whether california has subject matter jurisdiction.first,as discussed,tiffany testified she gave baby boy to smith for him to take the child.if smith did so,california could not be baby boy home state because the child absence from the state would not be temporary see,subd.g a period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period for determining the child home state and he would not have lived
