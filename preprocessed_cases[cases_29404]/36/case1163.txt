the parties were married in.eight years later they separated,and wife filed her first petition for dissolution of the marriage.during the separation,they sold their house and the escrow instructions provided,proceeds to be split.prior to the close of escrow,however,the parties reconciled and dismissed the petition.nevertheless,the escrow instructions were never amended,and therefore the sales proceeds were disbursed following their reconciliation in equal shares to each of them.

the trial court ruled that wife did not have a fiduciary duty to sell the house to husband in even though she was willing to sell it to a third party.the court also ruled that the notation in the escrow instructions to split the proceeds of the sale did not constitute a valid written transmutation of community property to husband separate property.because he spent community funds to satisfy his personal obligation to care for his mother,the court ordered husband to make an equalizing payment to wife of.husband appeals.
discussion 
no one disputes that in managing community property,spouses have fiduciary duties to each other,in re marriage of hokanson th,d.family code section,subdivision b provides,in pertinent part,that a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other.this confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners,as provided in sections,and of the corporations code 
husband asserts the notion that the incorporation of these sections of the corporations code imposes on a spouse all the duties and obligations of an officer or director of a corporation.husband conceded at trial that he had no cases to support his novel construction of the statute.the court rejected his expansive definition of a fiduciary duty to compel a spouse,after separation and in the absence of a contract,to give the other spouse a right to first refusal on the sale of a community asset.
although husband precise legal theory is hard to identify,we reject an expansion of a spouse fiduciary duties beyond the family code and,in particular,to encompass the entire corporations code.neither the statute nor the case upon which husband now relies supports an right of first refusal to a community asset.
husband fails to notice the express language of family code section,subdivision b,wherein the legislature explicitly defines the rights and duties of spouses that are analogous to those of nonmarital business partners.each subsection parallels the section of the corporations code with a comparable duty.for example,family code section,subdivision b requires each spouse to provide access at all times to any books kept regarding a transaction for the purposes of inspection and copying just as corporations code section gives a partner the right to have access to,inspect,and copy books of the account.similarly,family code section,subdivision b provides that each spouse must render,upon request,true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property in the same way corporations code section,subdivision c confers the right of disclosure,on demand,of information regarding the partnership business.and finally,family code section,subdivision b mimics corporations code section by requiring an a ccounting to the spouse,and holding as a trustee,any benefit or profit derived from any transaction by one spouse without the consent of the other spouse which concerns the community property.similarly,corporations code section requires accounting for the benefits or profits derived from a partnership or benefits derived by a partner use of partnership property.thus,the reference to these discrete sections in the corporations code by no means broadens a spouse duties and obligations to include those of officers and directors of a corporation beyond providing access,information,and an accounting.
husband does not accuse wife of failing to provide him access to any books and records,to provide him information upon request,or to provide him an accounting.since wife never sold the house,there simply was nothing to account.but extrapolating far beyond the words of the statute,husband insists that once wife evidenced a willingness to sell the house in to a third party,she had a fiduciary obligation under the corporations code to sell it to him for the same price.as the court pointed out,however,he failed to assert his claim in any family law proceeding at the time and waited until to argue that he was entitled to the house at the price wife had been willing to sell it in before he refused to complete the sale.
husband argues that he did not forfeit his right to the house by failing to assert it more forcefully.his behavior,one way or the other,begs the threshold question whether wife had a fiduciary duty to give husband a right of first refusal on the house in the absence of a contract to do so.although husband conceded at trial the parties had not entered into a contract according him any right of first refusal,he argues on appeal that the trial court precluded him from putting on evidence to demonstrate that wife had breached a fiduciary duty.it is not clear that he was precluded from introducing evidence during the trial.in any event,the evidence is irrelevant because,as he seems to appreciate,the existence of the kind of fiduciary duty he proposes is a question of law.he had ample opportunity to make an offer of proof,and based on that offer,the court properly ruled wife had no fiduciary duty as a matter of law.we review the court ruling de novo.husband obstacle is not the scope of appellate review or the quality or quantum of evidence,but the absence of legal grounds to support his contention.
relying on in re marriage of duffy th,d duffy,husband claims,family law proceedings look to california corporate law for the substantive rules of fiduciary duties.id.at,d.with corporate law as his platform,he leaps to the conclusion that the sale of the house constituted a corporate opportunity,and pursuant to the corporate opportunity doctrine,wife was obligated to give him the right of first refusal on the house.wife points out that even if the corporate opportunity doctrine applied,her duty would have been to the corporation or,by analogy,to the community and not to husband personally.since she retained the house,she did nothing in derogation of the rights of the community.rather,as wife argues,she merely preserved it for the benefit of the community.
duffy,supra,th,d,does not stand for the wholesale proposition suggested by husband that the fiduciary duties of spouses are defined in the corporations code the court in duffy discussed the sections of the corporations code expressly identified in family code section,subdivision b.we reject husband attempt to read far more into the case and the statute than either the court
