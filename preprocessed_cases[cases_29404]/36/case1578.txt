this family law case raises the question of whether a parent who fails to make support payments can successfully invoke the fifth amendment privilege against in response to questions about personal income at a judgment debtor examination.
we conclude that,in the circumstances of this case,the father can not rely on his failure to pay support as a justification for his subsequent refusal to provide financial information that could be utilized to collect his arrearages.to hold otherwise would allow him to take advantage of his own wrong.
background 
in november,gail and jeffrey sachs were married.they had three children.on april,the marriage was dissolved by way of findings and judgment entered in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of westchester 
jeffrey was ordered to pay gail spousal support of per month and child support of per month for each child.upon the sale of the family residence,the child support payments increased to per month for each child.jeffrey was also responsible for paying the educational expenses of each child up to the age of,including private elementary and secondary schools,undergraduate college,graduate school,and professional school.in addition,jeffrey was to pay all medical and dental costs of the children until they became emancipated.
on june,the findings and judgment were modified by a stipulation between the parties entered in the superior court of the state of connecticut for the judicial district of.the stipulation reflected that,as of june,jeffrey was in arrears on child support,spousal support,and the childrens educational and medical expenses.the stipulation required jeffrey to extinguish the arrearages over time,to make payments for certain educational expenses,and,except as otherwise provided,to continue making payments in accordance with the findings and judgment of the new york court.
at some point,jeffrey moved to california.on april,gail served jeffrey in california with an order to show cause and declaration for contempt.apparently,she did not pursue the matter.
on january,gail registered the modified findings and judgment in the state of california,filing a statement for registration of foreign support order in the trial court.the statement indicated that the amount of unpaid support,as of december,was,consisting of in principal and in interest.the statement further disclosed that jeffrey was a resident of california and gail resided in new york 
meanwhile,on may,jeffrey married his second wife,sally.they had two children.their marriage was dissolved by way of a judgment entered on june,in the superior court of the state of connecticut for the judicial district of.the judgment mandated child and spousal support.as of december,unpaid support totaled,plus interest.on january,sally registered the judgment in california sachs sachs,no.at the time,sally lived in canada and jeffrey lived in california.
in,jeffrey married his third wife,karen.five years later,they separated.eventually,their marriage was dissolved.
in,after filing the statement of registration of foreign support order in california,gail garnished jeffrey wages.in july,she obtained a writ of execution and levied on jeffrey bank account.in august,she levied on karen bank accounts.
on august,gail filed and subsequently served karen with an application and order for appearance and examination and a subpoena duces tecum,setting the examination for october.karen appeared for the examination,answered the questions put to her,and produced the documents in her possession.she testified that,in,after marrying jeffrey,he gifted two companies to her.the companies operated out of the same office,which jeffrey and karen both occupied.while karen owned the companies,she employed jeffrey as an independent contractor and paid him per week,making checks payable to his corporation,sachs enterprises.in,the year that jeffrey and karen separated,she transferred the companies back to him,for which he paid.
on august,gail obtained and thereafter served jeffrey with an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination.she also served him with a subpoena duces tecum.on october,jeffrey appeared for the examination but refused to answer the very first question and did not produce any documents,invoking the fifth amendment privilege against.jeffrey claimed that the disclosure of information about his financial status might tend to incriminate him if gail or sally ever initiated contempt proceedings against him for failing to pay support.
upon jeffrey refusal to answer questions,the parties sought a ruling from the trial court,which established a briefing schedule and set the matter for hearing.the parties filed points and authorities.on november,the trial court heard argument and ruled that,although the fifth amendment applies to judgment debtor examinations,jeffrey could not assert a blanket objection to the examination but had to assert the privilege on a basis.the trial court continued the examination to february.gail subsequently took it off calendar 
on may,gail obtained and thereafter served jeffrey with a second order to appear at a judgment debtor examination.she also served him with a subpoena duces tecum the examination took place on two days,july and july.gail counsel asked a lengthy series of questions,and jeffrey invoked the fifth amendment as to each question he thought objectionable.he also refused to produce any documents.
on august,gail filed a motion to compel jeffrey to answer questions and produce documents at the judgment debtor examination.gail agreed not to pursue contempt charges if the trial court overruled jeffrey fifth amendment objections and compelled him to provide information.
jeffrey filed opposition to the motion.at the trial court request,the parties filed supplemental papers on the question of whether jeffrey was subject to contempt proceedings in new york,connecticut,and california.by order dated november,the trial court denied gail motion to compel and sustained jeffrey objections.gail filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
in this case,we must balance competing interests jeffrey interest in avoiding and gail interest in the disclosure of information that could enable her to collect the support that jeffrey owes her and the children.we begin our analysis with a general discussion about the privilege against.we then discuss the application of the privilege in the context of contempt proceedings.finally,we balance the parties respective interests.
a.the privilege against 
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution states that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself the same right is guaranteed under the california constitution cal,art.i,and by state statute.
the privilege against applies in judgment debtor proceedings.troy superior court d.but this protection must be confined to instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer to sustain the privilege,it need only be evident from the implications of the question,in the setting in which it is asked,that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it can not be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.hoffman united states.accord,blackburn superior court th,d.
the trial judge in appraising the claim of privilege must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence.hoffman united states,supra,at.on appeal,we review the trial court ruling for an abuse of discretion.troy superior court,supra,d at.
to invoke the privilege,a witness need not be guilty of any offense rather,the privilege is properly invoked whenever the witness answers would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the witness for a criminal offense a trial court may compel the witness to answer only if it clearly appears to the court that the proposed testimony can not possibly have a tendency to incriminate the person claiming the privilege.people cudjo cal th,d.the privilege can be asserted in any proceeding,civil or criminal,administrative or judicial,investigatory or adjudicatory segretti state bar cal d.
a party is not entitled to decide for himself whether he is protected by the fifth amendment privilege t his question is for the court to decide after conducting a particularized inquiry,deciding,in connection with each specific area that the questioning party seeks to explore,whether or not the privilege is.
a blanket refusal to testify is unacceptable a person claiming the fifth amendment privilege must do so with specific reference to particular questions asked or other evidence sought o nce this is done,the trial court must undertake a particularized inquiry with respect to each specific claim of privilege to determine whether the claimant has establish ed that the testimony or other evidence sought might tend to incriminate him.warford medeiros d,citations and italics omitted accord,fisher gibson th,d.t he burden is on the party or witness invoking the privilege to show that the testimony or other evidence could tend to incriminate him or her.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,accord,warford medeiros,supra,d at.
contempt for failure to pay support 
jeffrey argues that the testimony and documents sought at the judgment debtor examination could provide evidence tending to incriminate him on contempt charges arising out of his alleged failure to comply with the support orders entered in new york,connecticut,and california.jeffrey believes that he may remain silent about his financial affairs so as to avoid a finding of contempt.yet,in contempt proceedings,jeffrey would be found guilty if he remained silent.that is the law in all three states.
as a preliminary matter,we do not know the exact amount of jeffrey arrearages.after gail filed the january,statement for registration of foreign support indicated arrearages of levied on the bank accounts of jeffrey and karen and garnished jeffrey wages,receiving amounts that have not been identified.in her motion to compel,gail stated that the arrearages exceeded.
nor do we know the breakdown of the arrearages by category,namely,child support,spousal support,educational expenses,and medical costs,respectively.while the parties stipulation used those four categories to describe jeffrey arrearages,the present proceedings are based on an undifferentiated sum.for purposes of discussion,we will assume that the arrearages include both child and spousal support.
contempt under california law 
in moss superior court cal th,d,moss,our supreme court held that the a bility to comply with a support order is not an element of the contempt which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the petitioner.inability to comply is an affirmative defense which must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence by the alleged contemner.id.at,d.a bility to pay has traditionally been considered an affirmative defense in contempt proceedings.id.at,d.t he elements of contempt are only a valid court order,the alleged contemner knowledge of the order,and noncompliance.if the petitioner proves those elements beyond a reasonable doubt the violation is established.he or she need go no farther.to prevail on the affirmative defense of inability to comply with the support order,the contemner must prove such inability by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at,d.
this is so for two reasons,as explained in moss,supra,cal th,d.first,t he ability of the parent to pay the amount of support ordered has already been determined by the court that made the order.id.at,d.
second,like the rule of convenience applicable to many defenses,t he contemner is the person in the best position to know whether inability to pay is even a consideration in the proceeding and also has the best access to evidence on the issue,particularly in cases of.considerations of policy and convenience have led courts to sanction placement of the burden of establishing a defense on defendants under similar circumstances moss,supra,cal th at,d.common sense dictates that the contemner raise inability to pay.in re feiock d,overruled on another point in moss,supra,cal th at,d.
with regard to child support in california,section of the code of civil procedure provides when a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order compelling a parent to furnish support or necessary food,clothing,shelter,medical attendance,or other remedial care for his or her child,proof that the order was made,filed,and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced and proof that the parent did not comply with the order is prima facie evidence of a contempt of court.hereafter section.
section,as construed by the courts,means p roof of the existence of the support order,knowledge of it,and noncompliance shall be prima facie evidence of a contempt of court.in other words,proof of these basic facts proves the entire contempt.once the contempt is proved any excuse or justification,such as ability to pay,is a matter of defense moss,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
although section governs child support orders,california law with respect to spousal support is the same.over years ago,in in re mccarty cal,mccarty,the supreme court stated it is not necessary for a wife on the hearing of a contempt proceeding for nonpayment of alimony to prove anything more than the making of the order and disobedience of it by her husband in refusing to pay the amounts which the court found he had the ability to do when it made the order.she makes a prima facie case at the hearing by producing the original order,and by proof of the refusal of her husband to make payment according to its terms i f the husband excuse is that since the making of the original order he has become unable to pay the alimony required by it,it is incumbent upon him to prove that fact.id.at.
just two years ago,in moss,supra,cal th,d,the high court cited mccarty with approval for the proposition that f or many years in california ability to pay has been considered,without much analysis,to be a matter of defense in contempt proceedings this approach is consistent with the legislative intent of section,constitutional law,and common sense moss,supra,cal th at,d.
and as more recently stated by division five of this court it may be argued that section expressly refers only to child support orders and therefore ability to pay must be an element of other similar family law orders.we are not persuaded by this argument nothing suggests that the intent of the legislature in enacting section was to abrogate the general case authority holding that ability to pay is not an element of contempt of family law orders in which ability to pay has already been determined t he holding of mccarty was supported by the broad language of moss,supra,cal th,d,relegating inability to pay in family law contempt proceedings to an affirmative defense.in re ivey th,d,fn.omitted.
finally,we note that a spouse who is experiencing financial difficulty in making support payments can avoid the possibility of contempt by filing an application to reduce support and demonstrating a material change in circumstances.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group to,to,to,to,to,to.
contempt under new york law 
in new york,a prima facie case of willful violation of a support order is established by the proof that the father ha s not paid court ordered child support at that point,the burden of proving inability to pay shift s to the father ahrem cattell accord,fallon fallon see fam.act a.similarly,a failure to pay spousal support requires the supporting spouse to prove inability to pay.rosenberg rosenberg see jud.law mckinney.
under new york law,a respondent is prima facie presumed to have sufficient means to support his or her spouse and children under the age of m oreover,failure to pay support as ordered itself constitutes prima facie evidence of a willful violation thus,proof that respondent has failed to pay support as ordered alone establishes petitioner direct case of willful violation,shifting to respondent the burden of going forward powers powers.
contempt under connecticut law 
the same rules apply in connecticut.t he inability to comply with a support order is a good defense to a claim of contempt the contemnor must establish that he can not comply,or was unable to do so.bunche bunche,citation omitted.once the existence of a payment order and the absence of payments has been proved,the lack of any basis or explanation for nonpayment reasonably allows the conclusion that the contemnor has the ability to comply with the order.however,once with an existing order has been proved,the burden shifts to the responding party to prove that his or her was not willful.rutkin et.practice series family law and practice ed,fn.omitted accord,eldridge eldridge,bryant bryant.
in sum,at a contempt proceeding in new york,connecticut,or california,jeffrey silence about his income would be his undoing.
c.the parties conflicting interests 
a civil defendant does not have the absolute right to invoke the privilege against a party or witness in a civil proceeding may be required either to waive the privilege or accept the civil consequences of silence if he or she does exercise it courts recognize the dilemma faced by a defendant who must choose between defending the civil litigation by providing testimony that may be incriminating on the one hand,and losing the case by asserting the constitutional right and remaining silent,on the other hand 
at the same time,courts must also consider the interests of the plaintiff in civil litigation where the defendant is exposed to parallel criminal prosecution t he fact that a man is indicted can not give him a blank check to block all civil litigation on the same or related underlying subject matter.justice is meted out in both civil and criminal litigation 
added to the mix,of course,is the interest of the courts in fairly and expeditiously disposing of civil cases,and in efficiently utilizing judicial resources c ourts are guided by the strong principle that any elapsed time other than that reasonably required for pleadings and discovery is unacceptable and should be eliminated.courts must control the pace of litigation,reduce delay,and maintain a current docket so as to enable the just,expeditious,and efficient resolution of cases 
courts that are confronted with a civil defendant who is exposed to criminal prosecution arising from the same facts weigh the parties competing interests with a view toward accommodating the interests of both parties,if possible.courts have broad discretion in controlling the course of discovery hence,in a discovery dispute involving the privilege against,the trial court must exercise its discretion in assessing and balancing the nature and substantiality of the injustices claimed on all sides.fuller superior court th,d,citations omitted.
whenever the court is confronted with the question of a compelled disclosure that has an incriminating potential,the judicial scrutiny is invariably a close one.tension between the state demand for disclosures and the protection of the right against is likely to give rise to serious questions.inevitably these must be resolved in terms of balancing the public need on the one hand,and the individual claim to constitutional protections on the other neither interest can be treated lightly.california byers,d plur.opn.of burger,accord,people coleman cal d.
a party may claim the fifth amendment privilege against where to disclose financial information might lead to prosecution under certain statutes.this issue frequently arises in divorce cases,either in the context of initial financial determinations incident to the divorce or in subsequent proceedings such as proceedings to modify alimony or child support orders.
the successful invocation of the privilege against by a party,however,may present insurmountable obstacles to litigation of matrimonial disputes.that is,if a party asserts the privilege and succeeds in excluding tax returns and other financial information,the court ability to assess the relative financial positions of the parties and make appropriate property and support provisions in a marital dispute may be severely undermined.
thus,courts have struggled to find ways to preserve both the claimant constitutional privilege and the integrity of the trial process.feldman reed,silences in the storm testimonial privileges in matrimonial disputes fam,fn.omitted.
for example,in a new york case involving spousal support,the trial court ordered the husband to answer questions about information contained in his tax return.in response,he invoked the fifth amendment.the trial court described the parties competing interests,explaining 
in the judicial determination of whether silence is indeed justified,each case must be controlled by its own facts 
in this,as in all difficult matrimonial disputes,the wife has a right to inquire into the financial status of her husband.while it is quite true that the husband has an absolute constitutional right to assert the privilege against,his declaration of said assertion does not preclude any further inquiry.the difficulties that arise in these touchy matters are obvious that is,if further inquiry were permitted to be pursued,the very matter that the constitution seeks to protect would be divulged.conversely,if the bald assertion of the privilege were accepted at face value,the substantive rights of the wife in this instance could be severely prejudiced.on balance,it would appear that the interests of justice would best be served if this examination were permitted to continue under the close scrutiny and supervision of this court,toward the full protection of both the substantive rights of the wife and the constitutional privileges of the husband.slater slater misc d,citation omitted.
we,too,acknowledge the importance of both the fifth amendment and the obligation of a former spouse to make support payments.
the fifth amendment is fundamental to our system of criminal justice.it is a right that was by our forefathers.the reasons for its inclusion in the the necessities for its to be found in the lessons of history.as early as,remembrance of the horror of star chamber proceedings a decade before had firmly established the privilege in the common law of england.transplanted to this country as part of our legal heritage,it soon made its way into various state constitutions and ultimately in into the federal bill of rights.the privilege,this court has stated,was generally regarded then,as now,as a privilege of great value,a safeguard against heedless,unfounded,or tyrannical prosecutions.quinn united states,fn.omitted.
t he american system of criminal prosecution is accusatorial,not inquisitorial,and the fifth amendment privilege is its essential mainstay governments,state and federal,are thus constitutionally compelled to establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured,and may not by coercion prove a charge against an accused out of his own mouth.malloy hogan,d,citation omitted.
at the same time,the importance of child support can not be overstated.children are dependent on their parents for the necessities of life and it is essential to the public welfare that parents provide support with which to care for their needs.moss,supra,cal th at,d.
as the statewide uniform guideline for determining child support indicates a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children t he guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority c hildren should share in the standard of living of both parents and c hild support orders must ensure that children actually receive fair,timely,and sufficient support reflecting the state high standard of living and high costs of raising children compared to other states,subds.a,b,e,f l all further statutory references are to the family code unless designated otherwise.
in balancing the parties interests,we can not help but point out that jeffrey argument is as counterintuitive as they come.under his theory,a spouse ordered to pay child support could refuse to comply with the order at the outset.having defied the order,the spouse could then invoke the
