in february,three police officers from the stayton city police department the stayton officers,acting at the direction of officials from the oregon department of human services dhs,entered the home of stephen sjurset and assisted in removing his two young children from the residence without a court order.sjurset subsequently filed an action on behalf of himself and his children against the stayton officers,four dhs officials,and the city of stayton pursuant to.he alleged that dhs and the stayton officers took custody of his children without reasonable cause to believe that the children were in imminent danger of serious bodily injury,thus violating his fourteenth amendment right to familial association and the children fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure.
at the stage of the case,the district court dismissed sjurset claims against the city of stayton and the two dhs officials who were not involved in the decision to remove the children.it rejected claims by the stayton officers and the two remaining dhs officials that they were entitled to qualified immunity.only the stayton officers appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the decision of the district court with regard to the stayton officers and remand the case to the district court for entry of judgment in their favor.
background 
factual background 
on february,officials at dhs received a phone call from a medical doctor office reporting that jessica borchers the significant other of stephen sjurset had tested positive that day for methamphetamine,amphetamines,and marijuana.borchers,who was pregnant at the time,lived in stayton,oregon with sjurset and her two and children,and sjurset is father and legal guardian.
the incident was not the first of its kind.in,borchers also tested positive for using methamphetamine while pregnant with her second child.as a result of that prior incident,both borchers and sjurset were convicted of endangering the welfare of a minor under.was placed in temporary foster care until borchers successfully completed a program.
acting on the newly registered complaint,dhs immediately initiated an investigation.dhs case worker caryn moller mata attempted to meet with borchers and sjurset to verify the health and safety of the two children.she first contacted borchers on friday,february.borchers said that she was out of town and that sjurset was taking care of the children.moller mata then made several attempts to contact sjurset,but received no response.at the end of the day,when she was unable to locate or meet with either parent,moller mata called the stayton city police department and requested that it dispatch officers to sjurset house over the weekend to conduct an welfare check on and 
at approximately on saturday,february,officers button,meeks,and mumey arrived outside sjurset house.officer button requested to speak with borchers and to see the children,but sjurset refused to let the officers inside the house without a warrant.when borchers appeared at the door,however,she said that the officers could view the children through the front window.
unsure of what to do next,the stayton officers contacted dhs for further guidance.dhs dispatched an social worker,mary anne miller,to the scene.on the way to sjurset house,miller phoned moller mata and the two discussed sjurset and borchers prior convictions and their refusals to cooperate with the ongoing dhs investigation.importantly,because these events transpired on a saturday evening,dhs officials could not obtain a court order authorizing the children removal until the following monday morning,which was at least hours away.miller then contacted her supervisor,dyan bradley,to evaluate the situation.they discussed borchers recent positive drug test,sjurset and borchers refusal to cooperate,their prior convictions,and the risk of leaving the children in the care of the couple for another hours.in light of these concerns,miller and bradley made an decision to take the children into protective custody without a court order.
all the parties are in agreement that the stayton officers did not participate in the decision by miller and bradley to take protective custody of the children.the parties further agree that miller and bradley made the determination prior to the stayton officers entry into the house.finally,the record indicates that the stayton officers did not make their own independent judgments as to whether there was probable cause to enter the home and remove the children without a warrant.
in accordance with dhs determination,the stayton officers entered the house alongside miller and removed and.the district court opinion notes that dhs concede d that there was no visual evidence of drug use in the area of the house that the officials occupied while the children were removed.no other part of the house was searched.and were placed into temporary foster care and,following a shelter hearing two days later,dhs obtained custody.
procedural background 
sjurset brought an action on behalf of himself and his children against the city of stayton,the dhs officials,and the stayton officers under,alleging that the parties had violated his fourteenth amendment right to familial association and violated the children fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure by removing the children in the absence of a court order or evidence of imminent danger of serious bodily harm.he also alleged that dhs officials moller mata and maria randall had presented false information at the shelter hearing,in violation of his substantive and rights.id.
all the defendants moved for summary judgment on sjurset claims,arguing that their actions did not violate sjurset or his children constitutional rights.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both the city of stayton and the two dhs officials who testified at the shelter hearing.but it denied qualified immunity to miller,bradley,and the stayton officers.relevant to this appeal,the court rejected the stayton officers argument for the following reasons 
once the stayton defendants entered the home,they apparently saw no physical evidence suggesting that the children were in imminent danger.further,no defendant suggests that borchers was in any way under the influence of substances,or that there was evidence of the existence of drug paraphernalia.although the stayton defendants argue that they did not take action until miller arrived on the scene and announced she had taken custody of the children,the court is not convinced that reliance on miller was reasonable as a matter of law,give sic the apparent absence of exigent circumstances or visible signs of imminent danger to ns and tb.thus,plaintiffs have successfully raised a question of fact as to whether the stayton defendants violated the plaintiffs clearly established rights by removing the children from the home,and summary judgment in favor of the officers is therefore inappropriate.
the stayton officers timely filed this appeal.they argue that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity because the officers violated no clearly established right of the plaintiffs when they carried out dhs instructions to enter the home and remove the children police officers are entitled to act in good faith on the instructions of other officers,including officials,even if the basis for those instructions is mistaken or erroneous and the stayton officers were not incompetent in believing that they were legally authorized to act in reliance on dhs determination.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.albino baca,cir en banc quoting.a,cert.denied sub nom.scott albino.in applying this standard,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.burke cnty.of alameda,cir.a district court decision denying summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity is reviewed de novo.hopkins bonvicino,cir.we thus review the evidence presented in the light most favorable to sjurset,the nonmoving party,to determine whether the district court erred in denying qualified immunity to the stayton officers.
b.the law of qualified immunity 
qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.mueller auker mueller ii,cir quoting messerschmidt millender,d internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.ashcroft,d quoting malley briggs,d.it makes allowance for some constitutional mistakes,mueller ii,at,such as when an officer reasonably believes that his or her conduct complies with the law,pearson callahan,d.
a analysis requires us to ascertain whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,and whether the law clearly established that the officer conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.saucier katz,d,overruled in part by pearson,d holding that saucier sequence is not mandatory.
in pearson,the supreme court warned against beginning with the first prong of the analysis when it would unnecessarily wade into difficult questions of constitutional interpretation that have no effect on the outcome of the case.at see also.at.the court further emphasized that lower courts have discretion to decide which of the two prongs to address first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.pearson,at.when qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage,for example,the answer to whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.id.at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore have discretion to apply the second prong of the saucier test at the outset in order to determine whether the law governing the stayton officers conduct was clearly established.if indeed the stayton officers did not violate clearly established law,then we can determine that qualified immunity is appropriate and may thus dispose of the case without undertaking an analysis of whether a constitutional violation occurred in the first instance.
in sum,we will heed the supreme court admonition against prematurely attempting to define the particular constitutional violation in question in this case.this is especially appropriate here because the district court has already determined that a number of factual issues remain unresolved regarding the circumstances under which the dhs officials made their decision.recognizing the general rule of constitutional avoidance,id.at,we now turn to the second prong of the saucier test.
in determining whether a government official conduct violates clearly established law,the test is whether,at the time of the challenged conduct,the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.we do not require a case directly on point,but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.al kidd.at quoting anderson creighton,d brackets,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has repeatedly told courts and the ninth circuit in particular not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.id.at citation omitted.the inquiry must be undertaken in the light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.mueller ii,at quoting brosseau haugen,d internal quotation marks omitted.
nor does our analysis end there.e ven if the violated right was clearly established,the supreme court recognized that it may be difficult for a police officer fully to appreciate how the legal constraints apply to the specific situation he or she faces.under such a circumstance,if the officer mistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.blankenhorn city of orange,cir alteration in original quoting motley parks,cir en banc,overruled in part on other grounds by united states king,cir en banc brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
factual issues do not preclude us from hearing the stayton officers appeal 
in denying summary judgment for the stayton officers,the district court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute as to whether reasonable officers could have believed that sjurset children were in imminent danger of serious bodily injury at the time of removal.given this conclusion,sjurset contends that we should refrain from deciding the reasonableness of the stayton officers belief that the children were in such imminent danger that their removal was justified.he cites in support the case of johnson jones,d,in which the supreme court held that a defendant,entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense,may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.id.at.
as we held in ram rubin,
we reiterate that we do not have jurisdiction to determine the factual issue whether a reasonable officer could have believed that,based on the information known to the officer,seizing ram children was lawful.the district court denied the officer summary judgment because the pretrial record indicated that genuine issues of material fact existed.this ends our inquiry with regard to the officer appeal.
sjurset thus makes a compelling argument that would preclude our ability to consider the factual issues regarding whether seizing sjurset children was lawful.as applied to the appeal before us,however,sjurset argument is without merit.to start with,the supreme court cabined the holding of johnson in a subsequent case.it clarified that even if issues remain regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,summary judgment determinations are appealable when they resolve a dispute concerning an abstract issue of law relating to qualified immunity,such as whether the federal right allegedly infringed was clearly established.behrens pelletier,d quoting johnson,at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
we have held that the behrens rule applies in cases where the appeal focuses on whether the defendants violated a clearly established law given the undisputed facts.knox sw.airlines,cir.this is particularly important in the context because i mmunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.hunter bryant,d.
sjurset correctly points out that johnson would preclude us from determining the reasonableness of the dhs officials actions based on the facts that remain in dispute.but johnson is inapplicable here because this appeal is based on undisputed facts as they relate to a purely abstract issue of law that is,whether the stayton officers violated clearly established law when they acted in reliance on the dhs officials determination.the district court explicitly acknowledged that the facts concerning the stayton officers actions are not in dispute.
what the district court did find in dispute namely,the number of calls that moller mata made to sjurset and borchers on the day before the welfare check,the nature of borchers drug abuse,and whether viewing the children through a window could reasonably give rise to a showing of imminent danger do not form the basis of the stayton officers appeal.these disputed facts might well apply to the reasonableness of the dhs officials determination,but they do not apply to whether the stayton officers violated clearly established rights of the plaintiffs by relying on the dhs officials determination.
in addition,the district court noted that the parties all agreed that dhs,and not the stayton officers,made the decision to take protective custody of the children.there is no dispute that the stayton officers entered sjurset residence and assisted in the children removal in reliance on that decision.finally,no one disputes that,under oregon law,dhs has the statutory authority to take protective custody w hen a child condition or surroundings reasonably appear to be such as to jeopardize the child welfare.a.these undisputed facts provide a sufficient basis to determine whether the stayton officers reliance on dhs determination violated any clearly established right of the plaintiffs.an analysis based on these facts is therefore appropriate.see knox,at.
d.the stayton officers did not violate clearly established law 
under the framework set forth above,we now focus on whether,on february,the law clearly established that the stayton officers could not act pursuant to dhs determination in entering sjurset house and removing the children without a court order.sjurset contends that his fourteenth amendment right to familial association is clearly established,pointing to our holding in wallis spencer that 
o fficials may remove a child from the custody of its parent without prior judicial authorization only if the information they possess at the time of the seizure is such as provides reasonable cause to believe that the child is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury and that the scope of the intrusion is reasonably necessary to avert that specific injury.
furthermore,as to the fourth amendment claim,sjurset argues that the stayton officers should have known that clearly established law permits a warrantless entry into a home only if an exception to the warrant requirement applies,such as emergency,exigency,or consent.see espinosa city cnty.of san francisco,cir.sjurset contends that,under the facts alleged,the dhs officials could not have reasonably concluded that the children were in imminent danger during the hours that would have passed before the courts reopened monday morning.by extension,he argues,the stayton officers actions based on this determination violated his and his children constitutional rights.
sjurset points to our decision in wallis to argue that clearly established law prohibited the officers from removing the children unless they were in imminent danger.see at.in wallis we denied summary judgment to the city of escondido when its police officers entered a family house at midnight,interviewed the family children,and took custody of the children based on a purported pickup order from the state agency.id.at.in actuality,however,no order ever existed and the agency had not yet even reached a decision about whether to seek protective custody of the children.id.at.
the police officers actions in wallis are therefore readily distinguishable from the case at hand in two important ways.first,wallis involved a factual dispute whether the officials had actually issued an order to take protective custody.id.at.second,the police in wallis acted independently without verifying the existence of the purported order.id.they therefore acted not in reliance on the agency,but instead in the absence of the agency direction.
in the present case,the exact opposite is true the stayton officers acted not independently of,but pursuant to,the determination by dhs.the stayton officers traveled to sjurset residence to conduct a welfare check at the behest of dhs.when sjurset denied their entry,the stayton officers did not take matters into their own hands or make their own independent judgments,as the wallis officers had instead,they called dhs for additional guidance,and miller was dispatched to the scene.thus,unlike the wallis officers,the stayton officers were careful not to take any action that was not first authorized by dhs.in addition,and unlike in wallis,miller and bradley made their determination in the midst of the ongoing welfare check,when the stayton officers were physically present,and the stayton officers accompanied miller as she explained to sjurset and borchers the rationale for the determination.the authenticity of the determination was therefore readily verifiable.
in light of these obvious distinctions,wallis falls short of clearly establishing that reasonable officers in the stayton officers situation would have understood that they had a constitutional responsibility to dhs determination.such would have required the officers either to disrupt or to refuse to take part in the entry and removal of sjurset children.to be sure,if the stayton officers had participated in the decision to take protective custody of sjurset children,then our precedent in wallis and similar cases would clearly establish that the officers could not do so without a reasonable basis for believing that the children were in imminent danger.see,mabe san bernardino,dep t of pub.soc,cir holding that the exception applies to police officers and social workers who make decisions.but here the police officers did not participate in such a decision they instead relied on dhs determination.
sjurset further contends that the stayton officers role as integral participants in the entry and removal is enough to trigger their liability for any violations of sjurset constitutional rights.to support this theory,sjurset relies on boyd benton county,cir.in boyd,we held that officers who provided backup during a search in which one officer threw a lethal device into a dark room were integral participant s for the purpose of the plaintiff claim.id.at.we noted that the supporting officers did not physically throw the device,but concluded that the plaintiff had nevertheless satisfied the first prong of the saucier test because the officers stood armed behind the acting officer,were aware of the decision to use the device,and did not object to it.id.
but sjurset reliance on boyd is misplaced both factually and legally.as a factual matter,the officers in boyd acted as a collective team and were carrying out a preplanned search operation.id.at.before the search,the officers gathered for a briefing and discussed various circumstances surrounding the operation.id.only after this collective discussion did the supervising sergeant make the ultimate decision to use a device.id.in contrast,no facts in this case suggest that the stayton officers were privy to any discussions,briefings,or collective decisions made by dhs in its determination.
moreover,even after the sergeant in boyd made his decision,the officers collectively discussed the manner of deploying the,taking into account the fact that several people might be sleeping in the apartment.id.boyd thus involved a collective decisionmaking process among the officers,with the result that all of them could be considered integral participants in the execution of the plan.id.it does not squarely address the case at hand,wherein an entirely separate agency dhs made a determination over which the stayton officers had no input.
and even if we were to assume that the stayton officers were integral participants in the execution of the determination,boyd would not help sjurset argument.this is because in boyd we ultimately concluded that despite the existence of a constitutional violation the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law specifically precluded the use of a device in the context of a search.id.at holding that a reasonable officer faced with these facts,and without guidance from the courts,was not on notice that the use of a was unconstitutional.boyd thus supports the notion that even officers who are integral participants in an unconstitutional search are immune from liability if the unlawfulness of the conduct is not clearly established.
in sum,neither wallis nor boyd clearly establishes that the stayton officers violated sjurset constitutional rights when they acted in reliance on dhs determination.we must therefore look elsewhere to decide whether the officers were on notice that their conduct violated clearly established law.neither statute nor precedent,however,squarely addresses the circumstances of this particular case.
first,under the existing regulatory framework,oregon statute gives dhs authority over investigation and enforcement of child protection services in the state.the statute further empowers dhs employees and peace officers alike to take protective custody of a child w hen the child condition or surroundings reasonably appear to be such as to jeopardi
