introduction 
terry goddard the husband and michael york the husband attorney appeal from a judgment of dissolution of marriage which incorporates a discovery monetary sanctions order.prior to trial,in full compliance with code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the husband counsel was given notice of the trial date.on the trial date,there was no appearance on behalf of the husband.an uncontested trial was held.section,subdivision b requires that the notice of trial be introduced in evidence.at the uncontested trial,the notice of the trial date served on york,the husband counsel,was not introduced in evidence.on appeal,the husband argues that the failure to have introduced the notice of trial into evidence was a jurisdictional error.the husband argues that the failure to have introduced the notice of trial into evidence is not subject to harmless error analysis under article vi,section of the california constitution as interpreted in people watson cal d,and its progeny.in the published portion of the opinion,we explain why we disagree and find that the failure to have introduced the notice of trial into evidence was in fact harmless error.
ii.discussion 
neither the husband nor york appeared for trial.the superior court file contains a notice of ruling on the wife discovery motion that sets forth the trial date.the notice of ruling,filed on august,stated in part,the court set this matter for trial on october,for purposes of our discussion,we refer to the august,document as the notice of trial.attached to the notice of trial was a proof of service which stated it was served by mail on york on august.the written notice of trial was not admitted into evidence at the uncontested trial.in fact,no mention of the written notice to york and the husband of the trial date was made during the trial or in the judgment subsequently entered.
the husband contends the judgment must be reversed because the notice of trial was not introduced as evidence as required by section,subdivision b.section,subdivision a provides in superior and municipal courts either party may bring an issue to trial or to a hearing,and,in the absence of the adverse party,unless the court,for good cause,otherwise directs,may proceed with the case and take a dismissal of the action,or a verdict,or judgment,as the case may require provided,however,if the issue to be tried is an issue of fact,proof shall first be made to the satisfaction of the court that the adverse party has had days notice of such trial as specified in subdivision b.if the adverse party has served notice of trial upon the party seeking the dismissal,verdict,or judgment at least five days prior to the trial,the adverse party shall be deemed to have had notice.italics added.the proof shall first be made portion of section,subdivision a was added to the statute in substantially similar language in.stats,ch.
section,subdivision b,which is the provision of law at issue in this case,states the notice to the adverse party required by subdivision a shall be served by mail on all the parties by the clerk of the court not less than days prior to the date set for trial if notice is not served by the clerk as required by this subdivision,it may be served by mail by any party on the adverse party not less than days prior to the date set for trial if notice is served by the clerk,proof thereof may be made by introduction into evidence of the clerk certificate pursuant to subdivision of section or other competent evidence.if notice is served by a party,proof may be made by introduction into evidence of an affidavit or certificate pursuant to subdivision or of section or other competent evidence.the provisions of this subdivision are exclusive.italics added.section,subdivision b was added in.stats,ch.the or other competent evidence language was added in.stats,ch.
the purpose of section is to prevent the possibility of a default or judgment being taken against a party who,because of no or insufficient notice of the date set for trial,is unable to appear.barton cal th,d,sheldon landwehr cal,d,trial.as the supreme court explained in estate of dean cal,section was designed to prevent the manifest injustice of dismissing a party action,or trying it in his absence,because of his failure to appear at a time at which he could not be held to have had notice that the trial would be had,or that any proceeding would be taken against him.
the clear language of section is consistent with this statutory purpose.section,subdivision a mandates that,when an issue of fact is to be tried,and the adverse party is absent,proof,as specified in section,subdivision b,must be made to the satisfaction of the trial court that the absent adverse party received days notice of the trial date.as noted previously,section,subdivision b specifies that when notice of the trial date is served by a party,the requisite proof of notice may be made by introduction into evidence of an affidavit or certificate pursuant to subdivision or of section or other competent evidence,subd.b.moreover,section,subdivision b states,the provisions of this subdivision are exclusive.section,subdivisions and,which are referred to in section,subdivision b,provide that proof of service by mail may be made by affidavit or certificate setting forth specified information.
the courts of appeal have held that the notice requirement of section,subdivision a,is mandatory and jurisdictional.urethane foam experts,latimer th,d martin k k properties,d.minkin levander d.campanella takaoka d,disapproved on another point in salas sears,roebuck cal d,bird mcguire d.isherwood hyrosen properties,d supp.moreover,a judgment entered absent compliance with the day notice requirement in section,subdivision a is void.urethane foam experts,latimer,supra,th at,d irvine national bank han d.
but this case does not involve section,subdivision a.rather,it involves the failure to have introduced the notice of trial into evidence as required by section,subdivision b.the california appellate courts have disagreed as to whether the failure to comply with section,subdivision b is a jurisdictional error.we set forth the conflict in the decisional authority in some detail.with respect to the requirements of section,subdivision b,division two of the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district held years ago that absent actual evidence in the record made before the trial court that the required days notice was given,a court is without jurisdiction to proceed in the adverse party absence.irvine national bank han,supra,d at.the record in han included a notice of trial accompanied by a proof of service by mail more than days prior to the trial date.however,the notice of trial and proof of service were not placed in evidence,nor was the superior court asked to take judicial notice of the file.id.at.no mention of notice to the absent defendant was made at trial and the judgment did not reveal whether the trial court had considered the issue of notice.id.at.the court of appeal held it is essential to the jurisdiction of the trial court in proceeding in the absence of defendant that proof must first be made that defendant had been given statutory notice.starkweather minarets mining d,stubblefield long.a judgment entered after a trial held without the notice prescribed by section is not merely error,but is an act in excess of the court jurisdiction.wilson goldman d.irvine national bank han,supra,d at,original italics.the court concluded there was absolutely no competent evidence introduced into evidence at the trial to show that defendant had been served with notice of trial.although the notice of trial and the attached proof of service were apparently in the superior court file at the time of the trial,those documents were not introduced into evidence as required by section,subdivision b which also provides that the provisions of this subdivision are exclusive.there was no testimony that the required notice was given,nor is there any suggestion in the judgment that the court even considered the matter.in the absence of any actual evidence in the record made before the trial court that notice was given,the court was witho
