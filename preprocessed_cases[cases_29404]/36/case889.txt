angelina appeals an order detaining her daughter anna under welfare and institutions code section.we dismiss the appeal as moot.
introduction 
the appellant parent appeals from a detention order that was made after this court filed an opinion reversing an order placing the child with the parent but before the remittitur issued.the parent contends the trial court improperly relied on the nonfinal to detain the child.at issue is whether a trial court may rely on a nonfinal appellate opinion to shape the outcome of ongoing dependency proceedings in the same case.
as we discuss,post,we are concerned about the use,in whole or in part,of a nonfinal opinion,based on a record,to influence the outcome of a matter that should have been decided on evidence of the family current circumstances and child needs at the appropriately noticed hearing.although the issues concerning the validity of the detention order have been rendered moot by the issuance of the remittitur in this court earlier unpublished opinion in re anna,anna,in view of the importance and ongoing nature of dependency proceedings and the likelihood this issue may again arise in this or other cases,we exercise our discretion to review this issue.
during the pendency of an appeal from an order that awards,changes or otherwise affects the custody of a dependent child,the trial court retains jurisdiction to make subsequent findings and orders in the dependency proceedings.after the appellate opinion is filed,the parties may seek rehearing or file a petition for review,and appellate jurisdiction remains intact.the appellate order,which is contained in its disposition,does not become effective until the remittitur issues.when the remittitur issues,appellate court jurisdiction terminates and the trial court then proceeds as directed by the appellate order,guided by the views expressed in the opinion.
in view of these principles,we conclude the trial court erred to the extent it used a nonfinal opinion of this court to alter its procedures and influence the outcome of the matter before it.the trial court should have proceeded solely on the basis of its continuing jurisdiction,which authorizes it to continue to decide issues concerning the child placement and during the pendency of an appeal,based on evidence presented by the parties,under the appropriate statutory provision.
factual and procedural background 
anna is the youngest child of angelina and tobias together,parents.anna is now five years old.in january,when anna was months old,she and her brothers were adjudicated dependents of the juvenile court and removed from parental custody.tobias was diagnosed with a serious mental health disorder and angelina had recently threatened to harm herself and anna.the parents had a history of domestic violence and involvement with child protective services.
the factual and procedural background of the case from november,to september,is detailed in anna because the questions raised in this appeal involve procedural and substantive issues that occurred after this court filed anna,our recitation of the early factual and procedural background of anna dependency proceedings is brief.
anna was in placement from november to march,when she and her brothers were returned to their parents care.the san diego county health and human services agency agency removed the children again in june because of angelina unwillingness and inability to protect them from tobias volatile behaviors.anna remained in foster care placement until september,the date of the scheduled section hearing,when the court granted angelina section petition to return anna to her physical custody placement order.minor counsel appealed.
angelina and anna lived in a transitional shelter home.in december,without informing the agency,angelina traveled across country with anna in the rented car of a man named darryl.when they reached north carolina,darryl left angelina and anna on the side of the road without money,food or transportation.angelina contacted north carolina social services for assistance and that agency provided angelina and anna with temporary food and shelter and contacted the san diego agency.with the assistance of both agencies,angelina and anna flew back to san diego.
the agency convinced kathy gorzon,the director of the shelter home,to allow angelina and anna to return to the shelter.gorzon stated that after angelina met darryl,a former resident,angelina spent time with him and started breaking shelter rules.the agency also reported that angelina had texted tobias to ask for information about bus tickets from nashville,tennessee to san diego,and angelina and tobias were in the same place at a visit on january.the social worker believed that these contacts violated a juvenile court order directing each parent not to have direct or indirect contact with the other parent.
in january minor counsel filed a section petition minor petition seeking anna removal from angelina care for placement in foster care.
the agency did not agree with minor counsel request to remove anna from angelina care.although angelina demonstrated poor judgment,the agency believed the family circumstances would stabilize with continued services.
at a special hearing on february,the agency argued minor petition did not state a prima facie case of changed circumstances and removal from angelina was not in anna best interest.after reviewing the record and reading the agency report,the court stated the report supported minor petition and expressed surprise at the agency position.the court set an evidentiary hearing on minor petition for march.the court stated angelina had the opportunity in that time to show whether she could maintain good judgment in parenting anna.the court denied minor counsel request to detain anna.
in a report prepared on march,for the hearing on the minor petition,the agency recommended the court continue anna placement with angelina.the agency reported that anna was a happy,energetic child.she had social skills and normal peer interactions.anna looked to her mother for comfort.on occasion anna wore dirty clothes to day care.the agency remained concerned about angelina judgment because of her trip to north carolina and violations of the order,as documented in previous reports.angelina viewed the order as arbitrary and did not believe her contact with tobias during a supervised visit was improper.the agency referred angelina to the intensive family preservation program.
anna was filed on march.this court held that the trial court erroneously granted angelina september petition to place anna in her care because there was not substantial evidence to support a finding of changed circumstances and best interests.this court reasoned the placement order perpetuated the instability and risk to anna that had been evident throughout the extended dependency proceedings.the disposition stated,the order granting angelina section petition is reversed.anna,supra,nonpub.opn,at ll.
at the scheduled hearing on minor petition march proceedings,the trial court held a reported chambers conference to determine the parties positions on the procedures to follow in view of this court disposition in anna s.the trial court noted anna was not yet final and the remittitur would not issue until may.the trial court stated it could not ignore this court opinion in determining the merits of minor petition and had contacted the clerk of this court for assistance.the clerk of court advised that without a stipulation by all appellate counsel,the remittitur would not issue immediately.
in open court,minor counsel requested a continuance of the hearing on her petition until the remittitur issued in anna and asked the trial court to detain anna in protective custody under section.the agency supported minor counsel request and asked the court to detain anna based on the agency addendum reports of february and march,and treat the request as akin to a detention hearing under section.angelina objected to detention on procedural and substantive grounds.
the trial court stated it had read and considered volume ii of anna dependency case record and this court opinion in anna s.the tria
