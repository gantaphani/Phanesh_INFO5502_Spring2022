a dependency petition was filed on august,claiming that lance came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under subdivision b of section.in particular the petition alleged that father knew that mother was drinking but allowed lance to visit mother and thereby failed to protect lance from the conduct of his mother.
a report prepared for the disposition hearing cited father statement that lance outbursts of temper seemed to escalate shortly after visits with mother.in addition,father noted that lance becomes more aggressive,defiant,and angry after the visits.lance told the case manager that he would prefer to not have visits with mother because he does not like some of the homes she takes him to during the visits.lance stated he would like to decide whether or not and when he would visit mother.lance teacher mentioned to father that lance behavior became more manageable by the end of the week,lance having visited with mother on the weekend.
the social worker recommended that no reunification services be provided to mother,in part because she was not being considered for placement or custody.in addition,the department recommended that visits with mother be reasonable,unforced,and supervised.

mikel,a case manager,interjected at this point and stated he was the case manager in march of and was present for mediation on the exit order he represented to the court that father had made an effort to protect lance from mother alcohol abuse,but it seems like every time she is out with the child,something happens where he gets picked up again.mother counsel disputed this i do know of that being accurate and.she was interrupted by mikel who stated that the current dependency proceeding was filed to ensure that father followed up on counseling for the minor.mikel reported that lance was in a difficult situation,having to tell his mother he does not want to visit on a particular day,while he may wish to visit on other occasions.mikel suggested that a social worker act as an intermediary in communicating lance desire not to visit on a particular day,should that be the case.

father then stated that lance psychologist recommended that lance not be forced to visit and that lance told him he was tired of seeing mom arrested.counsel for the department stated that there were ongoing problems with visitation and that a schedule needed to be set up.

counsel for the minor interjected that lance refused visits and clearly did not want to visit her.mother attempted to dispute this when the court interceded and stated that it could believe the minor attorney and did not need to talk with the minor to have him tell the court what he desired.mother again stated that lance had never said he did not want visitation counsel for the minor again stated that was not the case.mother replied,that is not true.
