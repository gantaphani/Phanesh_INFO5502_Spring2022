facts and procedural history 
the minor,randalynne,was born in february.the baby and her mother tested positive for methamphetamine at birth,and a petition was promptly filed to declare the baby a ward of the juvenile court.specifically,the petition alleged a failure to protect under section,subdivision b,in that the mother had abused a controlled substance,the baby had tested positive for a controlled substance at birth,the mother had endangered the baby by the baby,and the father also had a history of controlled substance abuse.
the baby was detained and placed with the father on certain conditions,and the mother was allowed to live in the home on certain conditions.however,mother was arrested on march,for possession of marijuana and transferred to los angeles county on five outstanding warrants.
a jurisdictional hearing was held on april.the mother,who was out of jail,was ordered not to reside with the baby until she enrolled in a drug treatment program and had two clean drug tests.
a disposition hearing on may,resulted in the baby being declared a dependent child of the court.the mother was allowed to reside in the home if she completed a clean drug test.reunification plans were adopted for both parents.
on july,the father was arrested in los angeles county for grand theft and other alleged crimes.on july,the riverside county department of public social services department filed a supplemental petition under section.the baby was then ordered placed in a foster home.however,the mother absconded with the child and a warrant was issued.the mother was subsequently contacted but refused to surrender the baby to the social worker the baby was eventually located on august,and placed in foster care.the mother was arrested.the mother had left the baby with a babysitter for a day but had failed to return.at that time,the father was in wasco state prison.
a review hearing was held on november.the first allegation in the supplemental petition,that the father was incarcerated,was found to be true,and the minor was ordered detained pursuant to section.
a contested review hearing was held on february.the court terminated reunification services to the father because he was serving a prison sentence.however,it ordered services to continue for the mother for an additional six months,retroactive to november.the department was also ordered to facilitate visitation between both parents and the baby.
a further review hearing was held on may.after hearing testimony from the mother and the social worker,the court terminated reunification services to the mother and set the case for a section hearing.
the section hearing was held on september.the department found that the child was not adoptable and recommended a plan of foster care with the current caretaker the juvenile court agreed and ordered a permanent plan of foster care.
a review hearing was held on november.by this time,the father was out of jail and had restarted his automobile repossession business.the parents were visiting the child monthly under supervision,and they were insistently seeking increased visitation and return of the child to their custody.the court ordered increased visitation of twice a month and set a section hearing to consider a change in the permanent plan to legal guardianship.the social worker reported a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome,although the mother denied that she used alcohol during her pregnancy.
on december,the father filed a petition under section requesting that the court order resumption of reunification services to him.as discussed below,the petition was summarily denied.
the mother then filed her own section petition on december.she also requested resumption of reunification services.as discussed below,the petition was summarily denied.
in a report filed january,the department recommended that the current caretaker be appointed as legal guardian of the child.the social worker noted a very close attachment between the child and the caretaker.
the second section hearing was held on march.at the beginning of the hearing,the mother expressed dissatisfaction with her attorney and a marsden hearing was held.the court denied the mother marsden motion and the mother challenges that decision on appeal.
the mother read a statement to the court,and the court noted that the parents were attempting to get their life together,and that the child had gotten outstanding treatment and care from the foster mother.as the basis for its findings,the court said w hen i try to balance everything,which is always difficult for the court,especially when the court sees that the parents are making real positive changes or trying to make positive changes in their lives,but by the same token,the time just keeps running on for the child while everybody is waiting for the parents to,hopefully,finally get everything turned around.
the court then noted that over two years had elapsed since the original detention.it appointed the caretaker as legal guardian but found that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child because t he child is living with a foster parent who is unable or unwilling to adopt because of exceptional circumstances,but is willing and able to provide the child with a stable and permanent home,and removal would be detrimental to the child.the parents challenge a further provision of the order which states that visitation shall be as directed by the legal guardian s.
a postpermanent plan review hearing was held on may.according to the social worker report,there had been no change in circumstances and the only controversy was over visitation.the guardian would prefer no visits with the parents and the parents desired unlimited access to the child in the guardian home.accordingly,the court set the matter for a contested hearing on visitation for july.
the hearing on visitation issues was held on july.the court noted that it had previously ordered that visitation be as directed by the legal guardian.the department was assisting by providing supervised visitation at the department once every two or three weeks.the parents sought greater,and unsupervised,visitation of four to six hours a week.the mother counsel argued that she was entitled to reasonable visitation because the permanent plan of guardianship had been selected.the court refused to change the visitation order.the mother appeals.
iv.the visitation orders during the guardianship 
the march,hearing.
the second section hearing was held on march.in a report prepared for that hearing,and filed in january,the social worker said given the history,the prospective guardian is not anxious to have to deal with the parents.she is not opposed to visitation but would ask the department to continue the visitation arrangements to transport the child to the visits and supervise the visits.the social worker recommended guardianship as the appropriate permanent plan but stated it is conceivable that the plan of legal guardianship might be upgraded to adoption once the child medical situation is sorted out.
the juvenile court selected guardianship as the appropriate permanent plan.it also ordered that the dependency remain open,subd.a.when a guardianship is established,the juvenile court must make a visitation order the court shall also make an order for visitation with the parents unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child,subd.c.
no such finding of detriment was made here.instead,the court said visitation between the child and mother and father shall be as directed by the legal guardian in this case.
the parents attack this order.father contends the trial court improperly delegated its power to determine if visitation occurred to the guardian.secondly,he argues that the guardian was not interested in facilitating visitation because she did not want to have to deal with the parents.mother also argues that a specific visitation order was required.
a court may not delegate its discretion to determine whether any visitation will occur,but it may delegate decisions such as the time,place and manner of visitation.for example,in the leading case of in re danielle d,the juvenile court ordered that all visitation would be at the social worker discretion and the children discretion.id.at.the appellate court found that the order did not delegate all control over visitation,but rather ordered visitation under specific conditions.the appellate court found that the department could properly act as an arm of the court in implementing the visitation order it was within the department role as a representative of the state and as an arm of the court,as empowered by the legislature,to exercise limited discretion in the administration of the juvenile court visitation order.id.at.
the appellate court also rejected the argument that the order violated the separation of powers doctrine,and that it was an improper delegation of judicial power.in re danielle,supra,d.there was no improper delegation to the children because they were only allowed to express their views regarding visitation.the order was also interpreted as authorizing the department to administer the details of visitation although the order grants the department some discretion to determine whether a specific proposed visit would be in the best interests of the child,the dominant factor in the exercise of that discretion is the desire of the child to visit the mother.id.at.
as so interpreted,the order was valid because the department role was limited and subject to supervision.however,the court noted that a visitation order granting the department complete and total discretion to determine whether or not visitation occurs would be invalid the juvenile court must first determine whether or not visitation should occur,as was done here,and then provide the department with guidelines as to the prerequisites of visitation or any limitations or required circumstances.in re danielle,supra,d,fn.omitted.with regard to due process concerns,the court said as administrator of the court order,the parole officer or department is subject to the supervision of the juvenile court which provides the parent with the required due process.id.at.
other cases emphasize the distinction between a proper delegation to a social worker of the administration of a visitation order and an improper delegation to a social worker to determine whether or not visitation occurs.for example,in in re kristin d,the court did not make any orders regarding visitation and declined to consider the issue.the court held that t he absence of an order concerning visitation is akin to an order granting total discretion.id.at.the case was remanded for reconsideration of the visitation issue.
the rule was restated in in re moriah th,d,as follows t he juvenile court may delegate to the probation officer or social worker the responsibility to manage the details of visitation,including time,place and manner thereof.citations.as stated in jennifer d,the ministerial tasks of overseeing visitation as defined by the juvenile court can,and should,be delegated to the entity best able to perform them,here the department of social services.citation.such matters as time,place and manner of visitation do not affect the defined right of a parent to see his or her child and thus do not infringe upon the judicial function.citation.only when a visitation order delegates to the probation officer or county welfare department the absolute discretion to determine whether any visitation occurs does the order violate the statutory scheme and separation of powers doctrine.citations.id.at,d.in moriah,the appellate court approved an order which ordered regular visitation and delegated to the department the responsibility to arrange for and monitor visitation.the appellate court held that the order did not have to specify the frequency and length of visits.
in in re julie th,d,the appellate court invalidated an order which gave the children absolute discretion to decide if the mother could visit them.id.at,d.the court found the order essentially delegated judicial power to the abdication of governmental responsibility id.at,d.
the department contends that the order here was proper because the juvenile court defined the parents right to visit,and only ordered the guardian to direct visitation.
we disagree.the juvenile court order was improper because it left the entire issue of visitation in the hands of the guardian.it did so even though it had before it the social worker report,which states that the guardian did not want to be involved in visitation and the guardian was requesting that the department continue to administer visitation.in light of this fact,it would be disingenuous to claim that the guardian was merely administering visitation.
the essence of the judicial function is to define the rights of the parents in the light of the circumstances t he court must define the rights of the parties to visitation.the definition of such a right necessarily involves a balancing of the interests of the parent in visitation with the best interests of the child.in balancing these interests,the court in the exercise of judicial discretion should determine whether there should be any right to visitation and,if so,the frequency and length of visitation.the court may,of course,impose any other conditions or requirements to further define the right to visitation in light of the particular circumstances of the case before it.in re jennifer,supra,d.the court here did not define the rights of the parents to visitation.
since the juvenile court did not make any order that the parents were entitled to visitation at the march section hearing,its order can not be justified under the cases that allow the department to supervise visitation if the court has determined that the parents have a right to visitation.secondly,the delegation here was to a private party,not the department.the parties have not cited any cases that allow a guardian to control visitation,and our research has not found any such cases.
even if the juvenile court had determined the parents had a right to reasonable visitation,delegations to private persons to control visitations have not generally been upheld because such persons are not as accountable to the court as a child protective services agency.this is primarily because the delegation to a private person does not contain any of the government imprimatur that tends to validate administration of a visitation order by the department.in re danielle,supra,d.
in in re donnovan th,d,the court held that delegation to a therapist to determine when vis
