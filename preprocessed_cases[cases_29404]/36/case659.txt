respondent joseph sweeney issued a subpoena for bank records in the course of divorce proceedings with his wife,keri evilsizor.the subpoena sought records from his wife accounts,but these records included financial information about her father.the father,appellant john evilsizor moved to quash the subpoena,and sweeney responded by agreeing to amend the subpoena to exclude information about john account activities.john thereafter withdrew his motion to quash.but he did so belatedly,and the trial court sanctioned him by ordering him to pay a portion of the attorney fees sweeney incurred in responding to the motion.on appeal,john argues that the court lacked a legal or factual basis for the award.we affirm and hold that a trial court may impose sanctions under code of civil procedure section against a litigant for pursuing a motion to quash that,even though legitimately filed,was rendered unnecessary by a subsequent amendment or withdrawal of the subpoena.
factual and proceduralbackground 
the proceedings to dissolve sweeney and keri marriage began in april judging by the register of actions,the litigation has been contentious,with disputes arising over child custody and spousal support,and the trial court deeming it to be a high conflict case 
during discovery,keri produced documents showing she had a bank account with,and a credit card issued by,jp morgan chase bank.on august,sweeney issued a subpoena to chase seeking records of those two accounts.unbeknownst to sweeney,john had an interest in the accounts,and some of his financial information was contained in the records.john claimed to have learned of the subpoena three days before chase was to produce the requested records,although how he learned of it is unclear.
according to sweeney,john made no attempt to meet and confer to explore limiting the scope of the subpoena.instead,john filed a motion to quash on september arguing he had been given insufficient notice of the subpoena.a hearing date of october was set.
sweeney attorney apparently did not receive the motion to quash until september.the next day,the attorney wrote to john counsel stating the subpoena would be amended to exclude john private information.the letter demanded john to drop his motion immediately and warned that if the motion was not withdrawn by september,sweeney would seek attorney fees and sanctions for the unnecessary time spent in resolving this dispute without court intervention.
an amended subpoena was issued to chase on september.it sought records related to the same accounts as the first subpoena,except it requested chase to exclude any deposits for sums payable or disbursements john evilsizor on the bank account and to exclude any charges made by john evilsizor on the account.john attorney was served by mail with the amended subpoena on september.john attorney wrote to sweeney attorney that same day.although a copy of the letter is not in the appellate record,a response from sweeney attorney dated september is.the response states sweeney would seek sanctions for unnecessarily having to respond to the motion if john motion to quash was not dropped forthwith.it also states please be advised that the original subpoena has been withdrawn.a one minute phone call from your secretary to my legal assistant would have informed you of that event and saved your client the cost of the two page letter of september.enclosed is our amended subpoena deuces tecum.
the parties characterize the timing of the correspondence up to this point differently.sweeney points to the letter his attorney wrote on september as showing he promptly tried to address the concerns raised in john motion to quash.john points to the september letter as showing this was the earliest notice he had that the first subpoena had been withdrawn.
in any event,sweeney attested below that john attorney wrote to sweeney attorney on september.according to sweeney declaration,in that letter john attorney acknowledged receipt of the amended subpoena but refused to drop john motion unless the amended subpoena was withdrawn.original italics.again,however,no such letter appears in the record.sweeney attorney wrote to john attorney on september in response to a letter sent earlier that same day,not on september.this letter warned that if john did not articulate a legal basis to proceed with a motion to quash after i have withdrawn the original subpoena and am proceeding under the amended subpoena,i will file a response and seek attorney fees and sanctions per the code.sweeney attorney asked for a response before the end of business since my response is due tomorrow,on september.
on september,sweeney filed a response to the motion to quash.in doing so,he focused solely on his demand for attorney fees incurred in responding to john motion,without citing a statutory basis for such an award.he sought for hours of legal work,and his attorney submitted a declaration setting forth his hourly rate and listing the tasks he performed responding to the motion to quash.sweeney also filed a declaration describing the communication between the parties.
the law office representing john contacted the trial court on friday,september,stating john withdrew his motion to quash.sweeney counsel wrote to the trial court that same day requesting that the scheduled hearing set for the following wednesday,october,go forward to decide whether john should pay attorney fees under section.john attorney then wrote another letter that same day asking the trial court to take the motion off calendar because the original subpoena had been withdrawn,and john would likely need to address the amended subpoena in a separate motion to quash.
the october hearing was not taken off calendar.at the hearing,the parties focused solely on whether sweeney was entitled to attorney fees.his attorney argued that sweeney was entitled to fees as the prevailing party as required by the code.john attorney argued that although section permits an award of attorney fees in responding to a motion to quash where such a motion is made in bad faith or without justification,that was not the case here because john sought in good faith to protect the disclosure of his private financial records.the attorney also explained that it took awhile to confirm with chase that the bank would not produce the requested records because counsel was unfamiliar with the process,but he pointed out that john withdrew the motion to quash as soon as he confirmed the bank would not produce records.
the trial court agreed with john that the actual initial motion to quash does not seem to have been in bad faith.the court was concerned,however,that there were some issues regarding the absolute need to even get to the point where further attorneys fees were incurred for something that it just simply did not have to happen.john attorney argued that an award of attorney fees under section is discretionary and that the original motion to quash was justified.he explained he did not receive confirmation that chase would not produce john financial information until after sweeney filed his response to the motion to quash.and he stated the parties likely could resolve issues related to the amended subpoena without the necessity of another motion to quash now that he knew more about the information sought.
following further argument,the trial court ordered john to pay sweeney in attorney fees,half of what had been requested the court reiterated its belief that john original motion to quash was not filed in bad faith,but it found that sweeney attorney seemed to have gone to great lengths,basically,to try to avoid,number one,having to have this hearing,and number two,trying to address any concerns about the underlying subpoena.the court focused on the timing,noting that john did not withdraw his motion until september after an interchange of correspondence that,i believe,began on september.
the court written order,which was prepared by sweeney attorney,states that john motion to quash was withdrawn and deemed moot,but that john shall pay in attorney fees to sweeney within days.the order does not cite any statutory basis for the award.the order states the order
