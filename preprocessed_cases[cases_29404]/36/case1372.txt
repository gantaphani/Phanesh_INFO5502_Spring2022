background 
a.the origin of megan laws 
in,a new jersey girl named megan kanka was abducted,raped and murdered by a neighbor.megan family had not known the neighbor had previously been convicted of sex offenses involving young girls.smith doe,d smith ex rel.new jersey cir.the crime gave impetus to laws for mandatory registration of sex offenders and corresponding community notification.smith,supra,at.
later in,congress enacted the jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration program,which conditioned certain federal law enforcement funding on a state adoption of a megan law for the registration of sex offenders and the notification to the community of sex offenders living in their midst.by,every state,the district of columbia,and the federal government had passed a megan law.smith,supra,at,supra,at.
california megan law 
california enacted its megan law in.stats,ch.in an uncodified preamble to the statute,the legislature made several findings and declarations.the legislature found that sex offenders pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses after release,and that protection of the public from these offenders is a paramount public interest.stats,ch,a.
the legislature further found that the public had a compelling and necessary interest in obtaining information about released sex offenders so they can adequately protect themselves and their children from these persons.stats,ch,b.because of the public interest in public safety,released sex offenders have a reduced expectation of privacy stats,ch,c.
in balancing the offenders due process and other rights against the interests of public security,the legislature finds that releasing information about sex offenders under the circumstances specified in this act will further the primary government interest of protecting vulnerable populations from potential harm.stats,ch,d.the legislature found that the registration of sex offenders,already required by penal code section the public release of specified information about certain sex offenders as contemplated by megan law and the contemplated public notice of the presence of certain sexual offenders in communities will combine to further the governmental interest of public safety.stats,ch,e.
the legislature distinguished between serious and sex offenders.to protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this state,it is necessary to provide for continued registration of sex offenders,for the public release of specified information regarding certain more serious sex offenders,and for community notification regarding sex offenders who are about to be released or who already live in the community.stats,ch,f,italics added.the policy of releasing information to the public about serious and sex offenders is not meant to be punitive but is designed simply to protect the public,italics added.
finally,the legislature addressed the possibility of misuse of megan law information.the legislature declares that in making information available about certain sex offenders to the public,it does not intend that the information be used to inflict retribution or additional punishment on the sex offender.the legislature found that the dangers to the public of nondisclosure far outweigh the risk of possible misuse of the information,and referred to studies in oregon and washington showing that megan laws in those states resulted in little criminal misuse of disclosed information stats,ch,g.

section provides for additional public disclosure in two situations where there is reasonable suspicion that a person is at risk from a sex offender,subd.a and in the case of a sex offender,subd.b.
reasonable suspicion 
when a peace officer reasonably suspects,based on information that has come to his or her attention through information provided by any peace officer or member of the public,that a child or other person may be at risk from a registered sex offender,a law enforcement agency may disclose certain specified information,subd.a.
this information,set forth in section,subdivision a subdivision a,includes the sex offender full name and known aliases gender and race physical description and photograph date of birth crimes resulting in registration and the dates of their commission the type of victim targeted by the offender any relevant parole or probation conditions the date of release from confinement and the offender enrollment,employment or vocational status with any institution of higher learning,subd.a a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,k,l,m,n,o.

sex offender 
section,subdivision b sets forth a detailed definition of a sex offender.in essence,a sex offender is a registered sex offender who has been convicted of multiple violent offenses,including at least one violent sex offense as defined in the statute,subd.b a,b,c see lockyer,report to the california legislature california sex offender information megan law july report.
doj is statutorily obligated to continually search the records of sex offender registrations and identify sex offenders.four times a year doj must send to every police chief and county sheriff,and to other designated law enforcement agencies on request,information identifying sex offenders,subd.b.doj and any law enforcement agency receiving such identifying information may disclose,by whatever means the agency deems necessary to ensure the public safety,information equivalent to the subdivision a information discussed the address of the sex offender,subd.b.
section also provides for criminal penalties for the misuse of disclosed information,subd.e.
the attorney general as head of doj has a key role in administering megan law and has interpreted the law as establishing three classifications of sex offenders,serious,and other.report,supra,at.megan law defines a sex offender but does not define a serious sex the mention of serious sex offenders in the uncodified preamble.but clearly the preamble contemplates that a serious sex offender is of a class less severe than a sex offender,especially given the definition of the latter category involving conviction of multiple crimes of violence.the attorney general has defined a serious sex offender as one convicted of certain offenses,including child molestation,who does not have the aggravated criminal record sufficient to qualify him as a offender.report,supra,at.
according to the attorney general interpretation,megan law permits public disclosure of information regarding only and serious sex those classified as other,whose only convicted sex offense is a relatively minor crime involving,inter alia,pornography,exhibitionism,and misdemeanor sexual battery report,supra,at.
this case raises questions about the permissible disclosure of a sex offender address under megan law.section does not allow the disclosure of the street address,but only the general location of a sex offender residence.megan law only allows the disclosure of the street address of the sex offender in the two limited situations governed by section the case of reasonable suspicion of risk or the case of the offender.thus,if there is no reasonable suspicion that a person is at risk,the street address of a serious sex offender can not be disclosed.
as plaintiff correctly concedes,the facts are for the most part undisputed.
the fremont police department department maintains a worldwide website at.the website contains pin maps labeled megan law sexual offender maps.the maps are street maps,indexed by the neighborhood of the nearest public or private school,community park,or library.a map of a given neighborhood will show all schools,libraries,parks and community centers,as well as the general location of the residence of a registered sex offender in relation to those schools,libraries,and parks.the general location is indicated by a colored dot on the map,red for a offender and purple for a serious offender.the dot is placed on the street where the sex offender lives,in the of his residence.the maps do not contain the name,street address,or other information identifying a particular sex offender 
before it placed the pin maps on its website,the department asked the attorney general if the maps could be placed on the internet without violating megan law limitations on the disclosure of information about sex offenders.in a letter dated june,a deputy attorney general informed the department the pin maps did not violate megan law and could be legally posted on the website because the maps do not contain any identifying information about the offenders including exact addresses.
plaintiff was convicted of penal code section,annoying or molesting a child under the age of,a misdemeanor.he was required to register as a sex offender under penal code section.he lived in the city of fremont from may until april,and registered with the department as a sex offender.
plaintiff was considered a serious sex offender under megan law in light of the attorney general definition of that classification.he was classified as such by the by the department or by defendants.
the department placed a purple dot on the pin map of plaintiff neighborhood,near the intersection of glenmoor and norris.plaintiff lived with his parents on norris street,near the intersection.plaintiff claims that as a result of the placement of the dot on the pin map,his neighbors learned of his presence and subjected him to harassment and verbal abuse,causing him to move out of his parents house on april.but there is no evidence in the record that any person who may have harassed plaintiff logged on to the department website and viewed the pin map of plaintiff neighborhood.no evidence links the website format or information as a source of plaintiff mistreatment.
plaintiff sued the city of fremont,fremont police chief craig steckler,and fremont police detective pat hunt,who was responsible for administering megan law for the department.plaintiff alleged the placing of the purple dot on the department pin map disclosed the location of his place of residence without the reasonable suspicion required by section,subdivision a.he also alleged that the placing of the purple dot on the pin map incorrectly and unlawfully identified him as a serious sex offender.
plaintiff complaint pled causes of action for violation of civil rights under civil code section intentional infliction of emotional distress negligence and negligence per se negligent training and supervision respondeat superior violation of federal civil rights injunctive and declaratory relief and negligent and intentional invasion of privacy.
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing inter alia that the pin maps did not violate megan law because they did not identify a sexual offender or disclose his street his general location within the community.defendants also argued it was proper to classify plaintiff as a serious sex offender.plaintiff opposed the motion,arguing inter alia that the pin maps did more than disclose his general location but disclosed his address,in which he had a constitutionally protected privacy interest.he also argued it was improper to designate him a serious sex offender,in part beca
