father appeals an order placing his son,austin,with him under welfare and institutions code section but not terminating the court jurisdiction.father asserts the court abused its discretion by not giving him full legal and physical custody of austin and terminating jurisdiction absent a finding that it would be detrimental to austin do so.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
in august,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency removed austin from the custody of his mother,mother,and filed a section petition on his behalf.the petition alleged mother used drugs to excess and was diagnosed with polysubstance dependence,rendering her unable to care for the child.
father appeared at the detention hearing and was declared austin presumed father.austin was later detained with him.
in september,the court made a true finding on the petition.two months later,the court declared austin to be a dependent,removed him from mother custody,and ordered the parents to comply with the case plan.the court found father was a nonoffending noncustodial parent who wanted custody,and placed austin with him and his wife,rachel however,despite father request that the court terminate its jurisdiction and order that father be austin sole legal and physical custodian,the court continued its jurisdiction over the child.
discussion 
father asserts that he was presumptively entitled to custody under section,subdivision a,absent a finding of detriment.we presume father means he was entitled to sole legal and physical custody.the agency responds that under section,subdivision a,father was entitled only to have austin placed with him in the absence of a detriment finding.the agency apparently defines such placement as temporary physical custody.we agree with the agency that section,subdivision a requires that the court place the child in the temporary physical custody of the nonoffending noncustodial parent if doing so will not be detrimental to the child,but that the court may not terminate jurisdiction until it analyzes whether ongoing supervision of the child is necessary.
we begin our analysis with a brief overview of the statutory scheme.once a section petition is filed,the court first determines whether a child is a person described by section.if the court finds the child is such a person,it takes jurisdiction over the child.the court then considers whether the child should be declared a dependent,subd.a.if the child is declared a dependent,the court considers whether he or she will be at substantial risk of harm if left in the custody of the parent.if there is a substantial risk of harm,the court removes the child from parental custody,subd.c.
as directed by section,subdivision a the subdivision at issue court then considers whether the child has a nonoffending noncustodial parent who wants custody.that subdivision provides 
when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional wellbeing of the child.italics added.
the meanings of the words custody,place,and placement as used in section,subdivision a are at issue in this appeal.we begin by examining the words of the statute if the statutory language is not ambiguous,then we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.people walker cal th,d.the terms custody,place,and placement are not defined in the welfare and institutions code.however,the ambiguity in the meaning of the words is demonstrated by the arguments presented in this case.father believes that the term custody in section,subdivision a means sole legal and physical custody the agency believes it means temporary physical custody.similarly,father implies that the terms place and placement mean that sole legal and physical custody is to be given to the requesting nonoffending noncustodial parent,while the agency takes the position that the words refer to granting that parent temporary physical custody only.
because the language of the statute is ambiguous,we must determine its meaning and scope.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.in doing so,we may look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved in such situations,we strive to select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes general purposes.we will avoid any interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.people walker,supra,cal th at,d.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.torres parkhouse tire service,supra,cal th at,d.we bear in mind that we should give meaning to every word of the statute if possible and avoid a construction that would render any word surplusage.arnett dal cielo cal th,d.
when different terms are used in parts of the same statutory scheme,they are presumed to have different meanings.smith law group cal th,d.in section,subdivision a,the legislature used the term custody when describing what the nonoffending noncustodial parent seeks,but used the words place and placement when describing what the court should do if it determines there would be no detriment to the child.we presume the legislature intended the word custody to have a different meaning from the words place and placement.
in determining what the legislature meant by custody,placement,and place,we look to the welfare and institutions code,the family code,the california code of regulations,and black law dictionary.the family code does not define custody,but does define joint custody,joint legal custody,joint physical custody,sole legal custody,and sole physical custody.each definition describes the right of a parent to have physical possession of the right to make decisions about the child.implicit in the definitions is that the parent has the right to exclude all others when making decisions pertaining to his or her child.similarly,the california code of regulations states that a custody determination means a judgment,the decree or order of a court providing for the custody of a child,tit.black law dictionary ed page,column defines custody as.the care,control,and maintenance of a child awarded by a court and states custody is also a synonym for legal custody.custody,therefore,connotes that the parent has the right to make decisions pertaining to the child,and has legal possession of the child.accordingly,when section,subdivision a refers to a parent request for custody,it means the parent is asking for the exclusive right to control decisions about the child and to have possession of the,the parent is seeking sole legal and physical custody.
placement is defined in california code of regulations as the placement of a child in care as a result of a child being declared a dependent child of the court under welfare and institutions code section,tit.the welfare and institutions code uses the term placement in the statutes that address where the child shall live during the dependency proceeding.see placement of minor in group home,request for placement with relative,requirements for placing a child in a relative home,placement,evaluation of home for placement with a nonrelative extended family member.thus,the words place and placement in section,subdivision a connote a temporary arrangement that necessarily involves the ongoing supervision of the juvenile court.
our conclusions are bolstered by an examination of the statutory scheme.father interpretation of section,subdivision a would render meaningless section,subdivision b,which
