appellant suedi appeals from a judgment of paternity determining gabriel to be the biological and presumed father of seanna d.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
underlying 
suedi and gabriel first met at an entertainment club when suedi was approximately years old and gabriel was approximately years old gabriel then believed that suedi was at least.both were unwed.
suedi and gabriel began to have sexual relations,and at some point seanna was conceived.during this period,suedi also had sexual relations with anthony,who was then approximately years old and also unwed.suedi led each man to believe that he was seanna father.suedi testified at trial that gabriel seemed reluctant to enter into marriage,and thus she also pursued a relationship with anthony.
seanna was born in late february.just prior to seanna birth,anthony effectively took up residence in the home of suedi mother,where suedi lived.he accompanied suedi to the hospital where seanna was born,identified himself as seanna father,and was present during seanna birth.shortly after the birth,anthony executed a voluntary declaration of paternity.when the hospital lost this document,he executed a second voluntary declaration.
although suedi told gabriel at some point that she was seeing someone else,he was unaware that anthony and suedi had been living together in the home of suedi mother.gabriel knew about suedi due date and phoned her,but received no answer.he and members of his family then went to the hospital.to prevent gabriel from encountering anthony,suedi arranged for others to tell gabriel that suedi did not want to see him and that he would not be allowed to see seanna.
after seanna birth,gabriel was not welcome in the home of suedi mother,where suedi lived with seanna and anthony,and he made no visits there.suedi mother disliked gabriel because he had not married suedi while she was pregnant.suedi occasionally brought seanna to see gabriel,and during these visits,gabriel acknowledged his paternity and held out seanna as his child.when suedi stopped these visits,gabriel was precluded from seeing seanna.
when seanna was about three months old,suedi told gabriel that he was not seanna father,and she had test results to prove it.she asked him not to contact her or seanna any further.he followed her wishes,but repeatedly requested a copy of the test results to achieve closure.
in december,when seanna was months old,paternity testing finally occurred at anthony request.the test indicated that anthony was not seanna father.this was the first point at which he knew this fact.
gabriel s paternity action 
the following month gabriel initiated the underlying paternity action.he requested genetic testing and sought orders regarding child support and attorney fees.
on june,commissioner james endman denied gabriel request for genetic testing.the matter was subsequently transferred to commissioner ann dobbs for trial.on august,commissioner dobbs ordered genetic testing sua sponte.this testing established that the probability that gabriel was seanna biological father was greater than per cent.
suedi and seanna moved into a new residence with anthony in february.suedi and anthony married in june and had a child together.
a bench trial began before commissioner dobbs on june.suedi,gabriel,and anthony testified during the trial.following trial,commissioner dobbs issued a detailed statement of decision.although gabriel did not meet the statutory requirements for presumed father status under the uniform parentage act act,et she concluded that gabriel was eligible for this status,citing adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey.in addition,she set aside anthony voluntary declaration of paternity,declined to determine whether anthony was the presumed father of seanna on any other basis,and ruled that gabriel was seanna biological and presumed father.
commissioner dobbs ordered suedi and gabriel to engage in counseling,as preparation for visitation between gabriel and seanna,and bifurcated the issues of child support and attorney fees.judgment was entered accordingly.
discussion 
suedi contends that the trial court erred in determining that gabriel established that he was seanna presumed father,ordering genetic testing and admitting the test results at trial,and declining to determine whether anthony is seanna presumed father.
standard of review 
on appeal,suedi does not challenge the trial court factual findings.accordingly,her contentions present only questions of law that we resolve de novo.enterprise ins.mulleague d.
governing law 
the act provides the statutory framework by which california courts make paternity determinations.dawn superior court cal th,d,subd.b.it enumerates a number of presumptions that identify circumstances under which a man may be declared a child father.francisco superior court th,d.
in light of this statutory scheme,california law distinguishes alleged,biological,and presumed fathers.francisco superior court,supra,th at,d.a man who may be the father of a child,but whose biological paternity has not been established,or,in the alternative,has not achieved presumed father status,is an alleged father.citation.in re zacharia cal th,fn,d.furthermore,a biological or natural father is one whose biological paternity has been established,but who has not achieved presumed father status,as defined in the act.ibid.generally,to become a presumed father,a man must fall within the categories recognized under the act.id.at,d,francisco superior court,supra,th at,d.
presumed fathers are accorded greater rights than alleged or biological fathers.in re zacharia,supra,at,d,francisco superior court,supra,th at,d.alleged fathers have only limited rights to notice of proceedings bearing on the paternity of a child.see francisco superior court,supra,th at,d.although a biological father parental relationship with a child is not terminated when another man is declared the child presumed father,only the presumed father is entitled to custody of the child.in re jesusa cal th,d.
section sets out a number of ways a father can obtain presumed father status.in re jerry th,d.it establishes several rebuttable presumptions under which a man may achieve this status by marrying or attempting to marry the child mother,or by publicly acknowledging paternity and receiving the child into his home.id.at,d,subds.b,c.
section also recognizes bases for determining paternity that are stated outside the act.these include a completed voluntary declaration of paternity et,and the conclusive presumption of paternity dawn superior court,supra,cal th at,d,which authorizes a determination that a mother husband is her child father,provided the mother and her husband were married and cohabiting when the child was conceived.
as our supreme court explained in in re jesusa,supra,cal th at page,d,a lthough more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity,there can be only one presumed father.citations.the procedure for reconciling competing presumptions is stated in section,which provides a a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.b if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.c the presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.in re jesusa,supra,cal th at,d.
the case before us implicates at least two rebuttable presumptions established by section.under subdivision c the subdivision c presumption,a man is presumed to be the father of a child if he marries the child natural mother after the child is born,and his name is on the child birth certificate.furthermore,under subdivision d the subdivision d presumption,a man is presumed to be the father of a child if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.the record unequivocally discloses that anthony has satisfied the factual predicates underlying these two presumptions.
the case before us also implicates the statutory provisions governing anthony voluntary declaration of paternity.under these provisions,a completed voluntary declaration of paternity ha s the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,and as such,it can be asserted to rebut presumptions arising under section,subd.c.the trial court may set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity when genetic tests show that the declarant is not the father,subd.b.
gabriel s standing to seek presumed father status 
suedi contends that the trial court erred in concluding that gabriel was entitled to establish that he is seanna presumed father,even though gabriel did not meet the factual requirements for presumed father status under section.
the issue presented,precisely stated,concerns gabriel standing to bring his paternity action.as we have explained see pt,ante,anthony meets the criteria for a presumed father through marriage.however,the act restricts standing to challenge a husband status as presumed as this arises from the presumptions involving the child,the child natural mother,and a presumed father through marriage.dawn superior court,supra,cal th at,d,subd.a because gabriel is not a presumed father through marriage under the act,he lacks statutory standing to displace anthony as presumed father,insofar as this status stems from the first presumption.dawn superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
here,the trial court found that gabriel did not satisfy the factual predicates for the status of presumed father.nonetheless,citing kelsey,supra,cal th,d,the trial court concluded that gabriel was entitled to establish his paternity because suedi had precluded him from becoming a presumed father.we agree with the trial court on this matter.
in kelsey,supra,cal th at pages,d,to,a child was born to unwed parents.aware that the mother planned to place the child for adoption,the purported father objected and initiated a paternity action under the act two days after the child was born.id.at,d.the prospective adoptive parents also filed an adoption petition.ibid.the trial court ruled that the purported father was not a presumed father,and thus his objection could not bar the adoption,given that the applicable statutes accorded only presumed fathers the right to impede adoptions by withholding their consent.id.at,d.
the supreme court concluded this was error.cal th at,d.it noted that the mother had prevented the purported father from satisfying the factual predicates needed for presumed father status in particular,although he had publicly acknowledged the child,she had barred him from physically receiv ing the child into his home.id.at,d.the court held that the act and adoption statutes infringed the biological father federal constitutional rights,insofar as these statutes allowed the mother unilaterally to preclude him from becoming the presumed father,and thereby deny him the right to object to the adoption.
the holding in kelsey was applied to a factual situation similar to the instant case in michael giovanna th,d michael.in michael,the plaintiff filed a complaint for a declaration of paternity,alleging the following facts he had cohabited with a woman while both were single,and they became engaged to be married.id.at,d.during their engagement,he learned from her that she had become pregnant.ibid.she then broke off the engagement and married someone else before the child was born.ibid.soon after the child birth,the plaintiff offered to support the child if he was its father,and requested information that could establish his paternity.ibid.the woman and her husband declined this request and denied him contact with the child.ibid.thereafter,the plaintiff promptly filed his paternity action.ibid.
after the trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend,the appellate court reversed.it noted that on the facts alleged,the act accorded the woman husband the status of presumed father,but denied the plaintiff standing to establish his paternity,even though he had taken prompt action to do so.th at,d.citing kelsey,the court reasoned that under the circumstances alleged,the plaintiff had a constitutionally protected interest in the opportunity to develop a relationship with the child,and this interest was not outweighed by the state interest in preserving expressed,for example,in the conclusive presumption of no marriage family had existed when the child was conceived.id.at,d.it thus concluded that the plaintiff must be permitted standing under the act to establish his paternity,and to rebut the husband competing presumption of paternity.id.at,d.
in our view,michael is dispositive on the question before us.the trial court found that gabriel had acted as promptly as was reasonably possible to establish that he is seanna father,and that suedi conduct had unilaterally precluded gabriel from meeting the statutory requirements for the status of presumed father.furthermore,as in michael,anthony married suedi after seanna was conceived.under michael,gabriel has standing under the act to establish his paternity.see also fuss superior court d.a man has standing to establish his paternity of a child conceived born mother marriage to another man.
suedi disagrees,citing dawn superior court,supra,cal th,d.however,this case is distinguishable.in dawn,a married woman separated from her husband and began living with jerry shortly thereafter,she became pregnant.id.at,d.she then returned to her husband and gave birth to the child,who lived with them.ibid.when jerry filed a paternity action and requested genetic testing,the woman sought judgment on the pleadings,contending that jerry had no valid claim to be the child father.ibid.the trial court denied the motion,relying on kelsey and michael ibid.
the supreme court reversed.dawn,supra,cal th at,d.it explained that a man interest in a child displaces the act standing requirements only when that interest,given a careful description in concrete and particularized terms,is constitutionally protected.id.at,d.applying this test,it concluded that jerry asserted,his interest in establishing a relationship with his child born to woman married to another man at the time of the child s conception and birth was not constitutionally protected.id.at,d,italics added.
dawn thus addresses an interest materially different from the interests at stake in michael and the case before us.indeed,the dawn court expressly distinguished kelsey as an adoption case dealing with unwed parents,rather than a child born into a validly existing marital family unit.cal th at,d.while the court mentioned michael in passing,it neither criticized nor discussed it.cal th at,d.michael too,however,like kelsey and the instant case,involved a child conceived when no marriage family existed 
genetic testing 
suedi contends that the trial court erred in ordering genetic testing and admitting the results of these tests to set aside anthony voluntary declaration of paternity.citing section b,she argues that only presumed fathers may request genetic testing in addition,she argues that principles of collateral estoppel barred the trial court from ordering testing and admitting the results after commissioner endman had denied gabriel motion for testing.we disagree.as explained below,the results of genetic testing were relevant to resolve the issues presented by anthony voluntary declaration of paternity thus the trial court was authorized to order the tests on its own motion.
for the reasons indicated above see pt,ante,gabriel is entitled to an opportunity to establish that he is seanna presumed father,notwithstanding the competing presumptions that may support anthony candidacy for this status.gabriel action thus necessarily implicates anthony voluntary declaration of paternity,which functions as a judgment of paternity,subd.c.
section provides that i n a civil action or proceeding in which paternity is a relevant fact,the court may upon its own initiative order the mother,child,and alleged father to submit to genetic tests.here,anthony biological paternity is relevan
