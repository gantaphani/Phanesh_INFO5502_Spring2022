facts and procedural history 
martha and jeffrey married in september and separated in august.as of the orders in issue,they had one minor child,jeffrey jeffrey,who was about to graduate from high school,and two adult children.
in october,jeffrey filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in the superior court of riverside county.the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement drafted by martha attorney and approved in writing by both parties and their counsel.the riverside county superior court entered a judgment of dissolution incorporating that agreement in august.
in the marital settlement agreement,the parties stipulated that jeffrey presently receives non taxable monthly income from a personal injury structured settlement in the form of an insurance annuity which pays him per month for life with years guaranteed the parties agreed jeffrey would receive,as his sole and separate property,the p ersonal injury settlement proceeds to be received after the date of execution based on monthly annuity payments of per month payable to jeffrey for life beginning august,with years guaranteed.under the agreement,jeffrey agreed to pay child support of per month for the oldest child,per month for the next oldest child and per month for the youngest child,a total of per month,until the child reaches,or reaches and is not a high school student residing with a parent.the parties further arranged that c hild support shall be made by assignment of the monthly personal injury settlement being received by jeffrey.the parties consented to share equally any medical,dental,orthodontia or other health care expenses not covered by insurance for the minor children.
the case subsequently was transferred to los angeles county.
in november,the court ordered child support of per month,each for the then remaining minor children,ryan and jeffrey.later,in january,the court found jeffrey was in arrears by and reserved jurisdiction over the issue of medical bills.
in june,jeffrey filed an order to show cause seeking modification of child support,reimbursement of uninsured medical expenses and attorney fees.jeffrey asked that support for ryan be terminated since ryan had reached age,had graduated from high school and was no longer living with his mother.jeffrey also requested a guideline support order for jeffrey,stating he jeffrey was currently unemployed and martha was earning per month.jeffrey stated he had paid uninsured health care expenses for their minor sons.
martha responded and claimed jeffrey was in arrears on his child support and other payments.she contended she had inadvertently agreed to receive child support by assignment of the personal injury settlement and that the personal injury settlement was a community asset to be divided.martha objected to the uninsured health care expenses arguing that cosmetic expenses such as orthodontia were not covered in the settlement.
a hearing of jeffrey order to show cause took place on march.on that date,the court set the matter for trial on may,and drew the attention of both parties and their counsel to a recently decided case,in re marriage of heiner,stating it might have some impact on the issue of the personal injury annuity.see in re marriage of heiner th,d heiner.the court observed heiner held a lump sum personal injury settlement is not considered income for purposes of child support.although the court indicated it was uncertain if heiner applied to an annuity,it informed the parties the court would hear arguments on the issue when the parties returned for trial.
on may,jeffrey submitted a supplemental memorandum of points and authorities asserting on the basis of heiner that his personal injury settlement annuity was not income for purposes of child support and should not be considered in the guideline calculation.jeffrey stated that he suffers from impaired brain function and intense pain in his back and extremities for which he needs physical therapy and medication.he asserted it would be unjust and inappropriate to force him to use the annuity payments for child support when they are needed and intended to pay for his ongoing medical treatment.
trial commenced on may.martha had discharged her attorney in late april,and she appeared in pro.per.at the trial.at the outset,the court indicated it had spent a considerable amount of time going through the files and was therefore familiar with the case.the court inquired of the parties if they were ready to proceed,and both parties answered yes.
jeffrey counsel asked to make an offer of proof,given that martha was now acting in pro,to simplify and shorten the trial.at that point,the court said,let me tell you what my take is first,and then you can tell me what additional issues you think may need to be addressed.
the court stated it found under heiner that personal injury recovery that is undifferentiated and unallocated as to any particular component is not income for the purpose of calculating child support.it further indicated it found,based on the information contained in the court file,any attempt on the part of the court to allocate the personal injury settlement annuity among the various components of most personal injury settlement,pain and suffering,loss of earnings,past and future,and past medical specials,future medical specials,or other compensatory damage,would be pure speculation on the court part,if it tried to break down this personal injury settlement.the court therefore stated it would not consider personal injury annuity as income for the purpose of establishing child support under heiner.
among other things,the court found the parties had expressly agreed in their marital settlement agreement,which had been incorporated into the judgment,that jeffrey would be awarded the personal injury settlement annuity.the court also found that the judgment had expressly ordered both parties to share equally in any uninsured health care expense for the minor children,including dental,medical and orthodontia care.the court had ordered jeffrey to pay in monthly child support,each for two minor children,in november and december.in january,the court had established arrearages of and further reserved jurisdiction over the issue of medical bills.
on the basis of these findings,the trial court ordered that child support for ryan should be terminated as of his reaching and graduating from high school,the end of june,and,based on prior court findings,ordered of the per month of the child support payments extinguished as of june.because child support was being regularly withheld from jeffrey personal injury settlement annuity,the court found jeffrey had made a net overpayment of child support of about.the court then charged jeffrey with the previously found to be owing,took interest on that arrearage into account and concluded the parties are even on the child support issue.as to the unreimbursed health care expenses jeffrey claimed he had expended for the children,the court concluded martha owed jeffrey for of the cost,taking offsets into account.as to future child support for jeffrey,the court disregarded jeffrey monthly benefit from the personal injury settlement annuity and found jeffrey had income from unemployment benefits of per month it also determined martha had income of per month and that jeffrey,spent percent of his time with his father.using those figures,the court determined the appropriate guideline amount of child support jeffrey was obligated to pay was per month.jeffrey was ordered to pay that amount in monthly child support commencing june.
the court entered its formal findings and order on june.
martha,now again represented by counsel,filed a motion to vacate the judgment and a motion for new trial.among other things,martha argued jeffrey had not served his supplemental memorandum until one and days before the may trial,had not attached a copy of the heiner case to his supplemental memorandum and had provided only an informal internet citation to the heiner case instead of the official citation.jeffrey opposed the motions,contending they were frivolous,and requested attorney fees as sanctions.in reply,martha asserted jeffrey oppositions were frivolous and sought attorney fees as sanctions in turn.
the trial court heard the posttrial motions on july.the court denied the motion to vacate the judgment,denied the motion for new trial and ordered both sides to bear their own attorney fees.martha timely appealed 
standard of review 
a decision modifying a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found upon examination of the record.in re marriage of drake th,d.the trial court,however,has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion concerning the parent child support obligation.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.in reviewing the exercise of that discretion for abuse,we consider whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.in re marriage of connolly cal d.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,we will not substitute our deductions for those of the trial court.ibid.the burden is on the complaining party to establish abuse of discretion.blank kirwan cal d.the showing on appeal is insufficient if it presents a state of facts that affords only an opportunity for a difference of opinion.in re marriage of varner th,d.
we limit our review of the trial court findings of fact to determining whether they are supported by substantial evidence.heiner,supra,th at,d.on review for substantial evidence,we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and give that party the benefit of every reasonable inference.citation.we accept all evidence favorable to the prevailing party as true and discard contrary evidence.citation.in re marriage of drake,supra,th at,d.an appellant contending some particular finding is not supported must set forth in his or her brief a summary of the material evidence upon that issue,and,if that is not done,the error is waived.in re marriage of fink cal d.it is incumbent upon appellants to state fully,with transcript references,the evidence which is claimed to be insufficient to support the findings.citations.ibid.
a trial court exercise of discretion in refusing to set aside a judgment is also reviewed for abuse of discretion in re marriage of varner,supra,th at,d,and we likewise review the grant or denial of attorney fee awards in marital dissolution cases for abuse of discretion see in re marriage of drake,supra,th at,d.

discussion 
the trial court properly excluded as income the annuity purchased from the undifferentiated and unallocated personal injury settlement in calculating child support 
martha contends the trial court erred in determining the personal injury settlement annuity was not income under family code section 
income is generally defined as the gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,or property citation or from any other investment of capital citation.in re marriage of scheppers th,d scheppers.
section,subdivision a defines annual gross income as income from whatever source derived and includes commissions,salaries,royalties,wages,bonuses,rents,dividends,pensions,interest,trust income,annuities,workers compensation benefits,unemployment insurance benefits,disability insurance benefits,social security benefits,and spousal support actually received from a person not a party to the proceeding to establish a child support order under this article.italics added.although the definition of income in section is broad,it is not limitless.scheppers,supra,th at,d.
to be considered income,the amount at issue both must fall within the terms of section and meet the common law definition of income,the gain or recurrent benefit derived from labor,business,or property.scheppers,supra,th at,d.
section definition of annual gross income is based on the definition of gross income in the internal revenue code.scheppers,supra,th at,d.thus,although federal tax law is not conclusive on the interpretation of section,it is persuasive.in re marriage of loh th,d.
title united states code section a excepts from gross income any damages other than punitive damages received whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.italics added.those damages are not considered income for federal income tax purposes.henninger southern pacific d.a.
damages for personal injuries are excludable from gross income because they make the injured party whole from a previous loss of personal rights,they restore a loss to capital and roughly correspond to return of capital.commissioner glenshaw glass,fn.starrels cir.
in the present case,the parties in the underlying personal injury litigation expressly agreed in the settlement agreement that all sums constitute damages on account of personal injuries or sickness,within the meaning of title united states code section a there is little doubt most,if not all,of the personal injury settlement was on account of a personal injury since the record indicates jeffrey suffered a permanent and serious brain injury that substantially curtails his ability to function and work.
in heiner,the court recognized that past and future loss of earning capacity might well be considered a substitute for wages or earned income,akin to disability or workers compensation benefits which are included in the definition of income.heiner,supra,th at,d.the parties in heiner had not requested a special verdict on damages,and both the jury award and subsequent settlement agreement provided for an unallocated payment.under such circumstances,heiner held that the entire amount of a lump sum,undifferentiated personal injury award or settlement is not income.ibid.
without deciding the issue,heiner made a distinction between such lump sum awards or settlement from annuity payments or structured settlements.heiner,supra,th at,d.we conclude that the personal injury settlement annuity payments here are also not income under the circumstances as presented 
in the present case,the parties agreed in the settlement agreement that all sums to be paid constituted damages on account of personal injuries or sickness.title united states code section a expressly provides that the amount of any damages received,whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments,are not included in gross income.italics added.the internal revenue code therefore makes no distinction between lump sum payments or periodic payments.
further,the internal revenue service held in revenue ruling that the exclusion from gross income provided by title united states code section a applied to the full amount of monthly payments received by a plaintiff from a single premium annuity contract in settlement of a personal injury damage suit.the ruling reasoned such amounts should be excluded because the plaintiff had a right to receive only the monthly payments and did not have the actual or constructive receipt or the economic benefit of the amount that was invested to yield that monthly payment.see.revenue ruling was subsequently codified in title united states code section,sess.reprinted in cong.admin.news,explaining that,stat,codified rul.at a.
title united states code section a provides that a ny amount received for agreeing to a qualified assignment shall not be included in gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed the aggregate cost of any qualified funding assets.the language of the settlement agreement in this case tracks the qualified assignment language of title united states code section c b in providing the
