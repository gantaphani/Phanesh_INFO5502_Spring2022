sonia appeals from a judgment terminating parental rights to her daughter,under welfare and institutions code section she contends the court violated her constitutional right to due process of law when it appointed a guardian ad litem on her behalf without first providing her with notice and an opportunity to be heard.sonia also maintains that neither the court nor the social services agency met its duty to inquire into american indian heritage,and that they did not provide notice to the child prospective tribes and the bureau of indian affairs bia in accordance with the indian child welfare act the icwa et cal.rules of court,rule f 
we hold that the court erred when it appointed a guardian ad litem to act on sonia behalf without first providing her with notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the appointment.we reject respondent argument that evidence of mental illness supports a finding that sonia was incompetent.however,because there is no suggestion in the record that the error affected the dependency proceedings or that sonia counsel and guardian ad litem did not protect her rights,we conclude that the error was harmless beyond reasonable doubt.we also conclude that the icwa notice was deficient.accordingly,we reverse and remand with directions.
factual and procedural background 
on january,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a petition under section,subdivision b,alleging that newborn was at risk of serious physical harm or illness due to her mother inability to provide regular care.mother,sonia,had a history of mental illness and drug abuse and was living in a residential care facility for mentally disabled adults.over the previous years,the agency had removed five other children from her custody.sonia was not aware of her pregnancy until she gave birth to at the care facility.the baby was detained in foster care after her release from the hospital.in march,was placed in the home of a maternal aunt aunt who had been caring for three of siblings for more than years.
in,the agency removed sonia two children from her care and initiated dependency proceedings.at that time,possibly due to methamphetamine use,sonia was experiencing auditory hallucinations that told her to abuse her children.another infant was detained at birth in.after reunification services proved ineffective,the juvenile court placed all three of these children in foster care with aunt in.two other children,born in and,were also the subjects of dependency proceedings.they were later adopted together by a nonrelative family.
the agency was unable to identify father from the limited information sonia provided.
at the detention hearing,the court appointed an attorney from the alternate public defender office to represent sonia,who was not present.the court advised sonia attorney to request a special hearing if,after meeting with sonia,her attorney believed that the appointment of a guardian ad litem on sonia behalf would be appropriate.the court deferred findings on the applicability of the icwa,detained in foster care,and ordered the agency to provide sonia with supervised visitation and appropriate reunification services.
sonia was not present at the february,hearing.the court continued the hearing at the request of sonia attorney,who had not yet met with her.on march,sonia attorney asked the court to appoint a guardian ad litem for sonia.she reported that sonia had made inconsistent statements about how she wished to proceed,and that she was unable to provide the name of her treating physician.sonia attorney did not believe that sonia could assist her in determining how to proceed with the case.pursuant to her attorney request,the court appointed a guardian ad litem for sonia and continued the hearing to april.sonia was not served with the appointment order.
sonia did not appear at the continued hearing.her attorney requested a continuance because neither the attorney nor sonia guardian ad litem had been able to meet with sonia before the hearing.the court denied the motion.based on the evidence submitted in the detention and jurisdiction reports,the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the allegations of the section petition were true.the court continued the disposition hearing to may.
at the disposition hearing,the agency requested that the court bypass reunification services pursuant to section,subdivisions b and b the court took judicial notice of the findings of facts and conclusions of law made in the dependency cases of siblings and found that sonia had not made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of siblings from her care.the court denied sonia reunification services and set a permanency plan hearing under section.
on may,sonia guardian ad litem filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition under rule.the alternate public defender office contracted with outside associate counsel to assist with the writ.on june,associate counsel filed a letter with this court stating that,based on his review of the record,there were no viable issues for an extraordinary writ and that no writ petition would be filed.
on september,the agency requested a continuance of the section hearing to investigate indian heritage and to provide proper notice of the permanency plan hearing to the bureau of indian affairs bia and to any tribes.the court continued the hearing to november.the agency reported that grandfather was a member of the huiechol tribe of mexico.a form attached to the report,judicial council form,stated that the grandmother tribe was located in rio yuma,santa ysabel and that she had attended an indian school in banning,california,in.the agency mailed notice of the november,permanency plan hearing to the bia on november.
on november,on behalf of the agency,county counsel requested a second continuance in order to provide notice to the tribes located in the areas mentioned in the judicial council form.the court denied the motion and went on to find that the icwa did not apply because the only tribe that was specifically identified was located in mexico.on sonia behalf,her attorney requested a trial on the agency recommendation to terminate her parental rights.
in its report prepared for the permanency plan hearing pursuant to section,the agency reported that was in good health,and that she was meeting developmental milestones.she showed signs of bonding with aunt.was attached to her three siblings who also lived with aunt.aunt loved.she wanted to adopt her in the event parental rights were terminated.aunt planned to allow sonia to continue to have supervised visits with and her other children.in addition to being specifically adoptable,the social worker opined that was generally adoptable due to her age,good health and appropriate development.
the social worker believed that sonia was seriously mentally ill and unable to care for sonia had been hospitalized periodically due to her mental health condition.she suffered from extreme mood swings and resisted psychiatric treatment.sonia did not take her medication consistently.she was unable to manage her own affairs and was dependent upon a representative payee to ensure that she had appropriate food,shelter and clothing.
based on sonia past history of services,the social worker concluded that sonia was unable or unwilling to improve her circumstances.sonia loved her children but lacked basic parenting skills.for example,she had to be shown how to give a bottle.on another visit,sonia laid on a couch and then became distracted.the social worker intervened to show sonia how to keep the baby from falling.
sonia did not attend the permanency plan hearing.the parties submitted on the report.counsel did not present any affirmative evidence on sonia behalf.the court made the findings required under section and terminated parental rights.on sonia behalf,the guardian ad litem filed notice of this appeal.
motions on appeal 
on april,sonia filed a motion requesting that this court take judicial notice of the united states department of the interior lists of federally recognized indian tribes and designated tribal agents for service of notice,and an article about the history of federally funded indian schools.on april and may,the agency filed motions to augment the record with a social worker report dated may,and a declaration of a superior court clerk 
making the appellate court the trier of fact is not the solution.in re th,d see in re zeth cal th,d.because we remand for compliance with icwa,the agency motions to augment the record and sonia request for judicial notice are denied as moot.see villacreses molinari th,fn,d.
discussion 
ithe challenge to the appointment of a guardian ad litem is timely 
the agency argues that sonia request for appellate review of the appointment of the guardian ad litem is untimely and that the issue should have been raised in a rule writ petition.the guardian ad litem filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition on may.see rule.however,after reviewing the record,associate counsel did not file a writ petition.the agency contends that the issue is waived on appeal.
the appellate courts have recognized the inherent conflict of interest between a parent who did not consent to the appointment of a guardian ad litem and his or her attorney who recommended the appointment,and have held that a failure to timely file a writ petition challenging the appointment does not preclude later review.in re jessica th,d jessica in re joann th,d joann.this court recently recognized this principle in in re enrique th,d enrique.
in enrique,as here,the parent guardian ad litem filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition challenging the referral order to a section hearing.after review,counsel decided not to proceed with the petition for writ.enrique,supra,th at,d at.relying on jessica,supra,th,d and in re joann,supra,th,d,the enrique court concluded that one could not expect the guardian ad litem to seek review of the order appointing him and,similarly,could not expect counsel to seek review of the very order he requested.enrique,supra,th at,d at.in view of these inherent conflicts of interest,to insist that a parent seek writ review when a guardian ad litem is appointed or lose her right to later complain about a violation of constitutional rights would itself pose constitutional issues.jessica,supra,th at,d.
the agency contention that sonia has waived further review of the appointment of the guardian ad litem is untenable in view of the fact that sonia did not receive notice of a hearing to appoint a guardian ad litem nor of the appointment order itself.in addition,the record shows that sonia did not have adequate notice of the procedures required to challenge the appointment of the guardian ad litem.associate counsel did not represent that he spoke with sonia or with the guardian ad litem before deciding not to pursue the writ.there is no evidence that sonia was informed of her right to object or to seek review of the appointment.see jessica,supra,th at,fn,d even if the parent was adequately advised of the necessity of writ review,the due process exemption applies.this issue is timely raised and sonia has not waived appellate review.
the court erred by appointing a guardian ad litem without first providing sonia with notice and opportunity to be heard 
sonia contends that the appointment of a guardian ad litem without affording her prior notice and an opportunity to be heard violated her constitutional right to due process of law.in re sara th,d sara in re joann,supra,th at,d jessica,supra,th at,d.the agency concedes that the record does not contain any evidence showing either that sonia consented to the appointment of the guardian ad litem or that she was provided notice and an opportunity to be heard.
we review constitutional issues de novo.vo city of garden grove th,d,
in any proceeding in which an incompetent person is a party,that person shall appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action is pending.code civ.in the context of dependency proceedings,the test for incompetence is whether the party has the capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the proceeding and is able to assist counsel in the preparation of the case.in re christina th,d christina jessica,supra,th at,d see.
the effect of the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding is significant because it removes control over litigation from the parent and vests it with the guardian ad litem.christina,supra,th at,d jessica,supra,th at,d in re daniel th,d daniel.a guardian ad litem is given broad powers to control trial tactics and the procedural steps necessary to the conduct of the litigation.sara,supra,th at,d.
courts have recognized that the appointment of a guardian ad litem in a dependency case deprives a parent of the right to control and participate in litigation affecting the fundamental parental interest in the companionship,care,custody and management of one children.sara,supra,th at,d see in re dakota th,d.consequently,unless the parent consents to the appointment,the parent must be afforded due process before the court may appoint a guardian ad litem.jessica,supra,th at,d daniel,supra,th at,d.it is axiomatic that the court may not divest a parent of a fundamental interest without first providing the parent with notice and an opportunity to be heard.superior court d.see,generally,mullane central hanover bank trust.stanley illinois,d santosky kramer,d.
in order to provide the court with the most accurate picture of the circumstances so it can make an informed decision,the parent must be afforded an opportunity to respond.jessica,supra,th at,d,quoting sara,supra,th at,d.a hearing to determine a parent competence need not be formal.daniel,supra,th at,d.however,at the hearing,which may be closed to other parties,the court or counsel must explain to the parent the purpose of appointing a guardian ad litem,the parent loss of authority over the litigation,the guardian ad litem role,and why counsel believes the appointment is necessary.jessica,supra,th at,d.at minimum,the court should make an inquiry sufficient to determine whether the parent understands the nature of the proceedings and can assist the attorney in protecting his or her rights,citing sara,supra,th at,d,italics added.
in this case,the court did not provide sonia with any of the procedural safeguards necessary to protect her due process rights.on march,in sonia absence and without prior notice to her,the court appointed a guardian ad litem on her behalf after the following exchange with her attorney 
the court sonia attorney,anything you want to pass on at this point one of the things you were going to be alert to is whether we needed a guardian ad litem and so forth.
sonia attorney yes,your honor.i spoke with my client on the of february.she made inconsistent statements about how she would like to proceed in this case.she was unable to provide me with the name of doctor that was treating her at the shelter where she resides.i do not feel that i can plan her case with the assistance of my client.i would be requesting the court appoint a guardian ad litem for my client.
the court to the independent contract office ico attorney i s this something you would be willing 
ico attorney you know,your honor,i am kind of curious.cpo is not on the case.
the court they the record for a moment.back on the record.in response to counsel comments i am appointing the ico office,to serve as guardian ad litem for the mother.
in appointing a guardian ad litem for sonia,the court relied on the conclusory statements of her attorney,without determining the factual bases or foundation underlying the statements.the court did not know why or how sonia was unable to assist her attorney in protecting her interests.sara,supra,th at,d.the court was informed that sonia was conflicted regarding the desired outcome of the dependency proceedings,that she disliked court proceedings,and that she was unable to remember a doctor name however,those facts do not go to whether she understood the nature of the proceedings and could assist her attorney in protecting her rights.
there is no evidence that sonia consented to the court appointment of a guardian ad litem.she was not provided with notice of the proceeding,nor was she given an opportunity to respond.her attorney did not represent to the court that she had advised sonia of the purpose for the appointment of a guardian ad litem,the guardian role in controlling litigation or that the appointment would result in the loss of sonia authority to make important decisions affecting her fundamental interest in parenting her child.the court thus had an obligation to ensure that sonia was advised of the consequences of the appointment of a guardian ad litem before making the appointment.the record shows that the court did not make the requisite advisements,and did not inquire as to whether sonia understood the nature of the proceedings and could assist counsel in protecting her rights.jessica,supra,th at,d citing sara,supra,th at,d.
the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem was harmless beyond reasonable doubt 
sonia argues that the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem constitutes structural error requiring automatic reversal of the order appointing the guardian ad litem and all subsequent orders in the dependency case.see arizona fulminante,d judith superior court th,d.she concedes that there is a split of authority in the appellate courts as to whether the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in dependency proceedings constitutes a structural error requiring automatic reversal or whether it is a trial error subject to a harmless error analysis.see chapman california,d chapman in re angela th,d.
this court has determined that it will review the improper appointment of a guardian ad litem to determine whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.enrique,supra,th at,d at daniel,supra,th at,d see also sara,supra,th at,d reversal is not required if the violation of the appellant due process rights was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
citing jessica,sonia argues that the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the court can not know what the parent might have done or suggested to her attorney if the guardian ad litem had been appointed.jessica,supra,th at,d.however,sonia does not support her claim with specific references to the record.without any basis in the record to support a conclusion that the parent might have taken a course of action different from that taken by the guardian ad litem,we would have to conclude that the error was structural in order to reverse 
an example of the application of the chapman harmless error analysis to the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem is found in sara,in which the appellate court concluded that the appointment was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.in sara,prior to the appointment of the guardian ad litem,the parent contested jurisdiction and informed the court that three additional witnesses,including the parent,would testify at the jurisdictional hearing.the court appointed a guardian ad litem before the hearing concluded.after the guardian ad litem was appointed,the parent attorney and the guardian ad litem agreed to submit to the court jurisdiction in exchange for what was essentially nothing more than an agreement to conform the petition to the proof presented at the earlier hearings.sara,supra,th at,d.without speculating on the substance or effect of the omitted testimony,the sara court determined that the testimony might have had an impact on the court decision,and concluded that the error therefore was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.ibid.a similar situation occurred in in re joann,supra,th at page,d,in which the parent intended to call a witness who was not called to testify after a guardian ad litem was appointed.
in contrast to sara and joann,sonia does not specify how or when the proceedings in this case might have been impacted by the appointment of a guardian ad litem.sonia did not appear at any of the hearings in dependency case.she told the social worker,i do want to go to court.i do like court.our review of the record does not reveal any information that would allow us to conclude that anything sonia might have done or suggested to her attorney would have been different if the guardian ad litem had not been appointed.see sara,supra,th at,d.
further,neither sonia counsel nor her guardian ad litem compromised her fundamental rights.daniel,supra,th at,d see christina,supra,th at,d.on the contrary,the record shows that they protected sonia rights at each juncture throughout the proceedings.sonia attorney repeatedly requested continuances because sonia was not present and enlisted aunt help to try to secure sonia appearance at the jurisdiction hearing.sonia attorney vigorously advocated that the court provide sonia the opportunity to undergo a psychological evaluation before the disposition hearing to determine whether she would benefit from services.despite sonia statements suggesting that she was resigned to,and comfortable with,placement in aunt permanent custody,her attorney requested contested hearings at the jurisdiction,disposition and permanency planning stages of the proceedings.in addition,sonia appellate rights were preserved.
there is nothing in the record to show how the erroneous appointment of a guardian ad litem might have affected sonia rights to participate in the proceedings,contest the state position,consult with her attorney,or receive the effective assistance of counsel.we conclude that under the circumstances in this case,the erroneous appointment of the guardian ad litem was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see enrique,supra,th at,d at.
this court will not infer a finding that sonia was incompetent from evidence of mental illness 
the agency contends that sonia mental illness constitutes substantial evidence that she was incompetent.in support of its position,the agency details sonia mental health history as well as anecdotal evidence of her current condition.
we reject the argument that this court can infer from evidence in the record of mental illness that sonia was incompetent at the time the court appointed a guardian ad litem for her.the mere presence of mental illness does not mean that a party is unable to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel in the preparation of the case.see,in re christopher th,d people ramos cal th,d,a defendant must exhibit more than bizarre,paranoid behavior,strange words,or a preexisting psychiatric condition that has little bearing on the question of whether the defendant can assist his defense counsel.see generally people smith th,d.
the record contains little,if any,evidence of sonia mental illness or its effect on her ability to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel.other than sonia statement that in the past her condition had been diagnosed as schizophrenia,bipolar disorder and personality disorder,and third parties anecdotal observations of her odd behaviors and mood swings immediately after birth,the record does not contain any current information from qualified mental health professionals about sonia psychological or psychiatric condition,nor does it contain any evidence to support a conclusion that her mental health rendered her incompetent.under these circumstances,we will not infer from evidence of mental illness in the record that sonia mental health condition prevented her from being able to understand the proceedings and to assist counsel in the preparation of the case.see,in re christopher,supra,th at,d people ramos,supra,cal th at,d.
