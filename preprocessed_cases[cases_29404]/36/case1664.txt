robin wilson,a nurse,and michael shea,a deputy sheriff,had a child,amanda,in.robin,however,did not bring this paternity action until june,and the instant appeal arises from a and child support order signed and filed in december.the order was the result of robin relocation to south carolina to be with her mother.
even though the trial judge granted the order,the dominant theme of the hearing was the systematic poisoning of michael relationship with his daughter by robin.robin would not allow michael to take amanda to see his family,and had even gone so far as to tell amanda when she was not yet five years old that michael wife was a witch.he was not allowed to stay on amanda fifth birthday amanda pleaded,daddy,do go.do go,please.and after that,robin told him,why do you just leave.i do want nothing to do with you.i do want your money.i do want you to have nothing to do with amanda.in the wake of the episode michael did see his daughter for three years.finally,when the case was filed and initially referred to mediation,amanda was petrified of seeing her father after a few visits,however,the counselor noted that michael was great with his daughter and recommended visitation.
during his three years of exclusion from amanda life michael voluntarily paid a month to support amanda.robin nonetheless told amanda that her father had paid any money or anything in three years.michael continued with the payment until the court made a formal child support order at the time robin brought this action a month,based on a dissomaster,family code section guideline calculation.by the next summer,when the case came to trial,robin had decided to relocate to south carolina,though that meant a drop in her nominal income from to about a year.the trial court entered a judgment based on the previous dissomaster calculation a month rather than recalculate the guideline child support under section of the family code 
the court judgment provided for michael to travel to south carolina once about every three months preferably on weekends for day trips to see amanda,plus one week of summer visitation during which amanda would travel to southern california.the trial judge was adamant that the relationship between father and daughter be healed.speaking to robin,the court said,for the benefit of your daughter,whatever we can do to keep shea in her life as her father is going to benefit her later on when she grows up so we have to do that.accordingly,the court ordered that of the was to be deducted from the amount michael was to pay robin,and put into a travel fund controlled by michael.father needs to make some plan to travel back to south carolina about every three months.we going to make an adjustment in the child support to make sure there is enough money that he can.
robin had testified that a ticket to south carolina costs in the ballpark of,round trip,so the provided enough money for three or four visits per year.x,divided by visits per year.the net effect of the order was that michael monthly wages would only be garnished,instead of.
in a motion to vacate the judgment heard before the formal order was signed robin argued,among other things,that the judge had not properly articulated findings in support of to be subtracted from the guideline amount.the judge responded the findings are not obvious mother had basically alienated the relationship between father and daughter.the point of the deduction,the judge explained,was to attempt everything we could to keep father involved in this child life.
robin has now appealed,making these contentions 
the judge was obligated to recalculate child support using the guidelines in practical terms,to rework the dissomaster 
the judge did not properly explain his reasons for deviating from them,as he was otherwise required to do and 
the judge erred by allowing michael to deduct a month from the child support amount for travel.
there is no exit from calculating the guideline amount 
as to the first contention,robin is undoubtedly right.while this court has expressed its sympathy for trial judges who are forced,by the statutory language of sections et of the family code to calculate a guideline amount for child support,the grisly math must still be done.there is simply nothing appellate courts can do to ease the trial courts burden in this regard.in re marriage of hall th,d no trial judge making a child support order can escape making a formula calculation pursuant to section.
in the motion to vacate the judgment,the trial judge gave two reasons for not recalculating the guideline amount.first,there was some uncertainty about exactly how much robin would be making when she arrived in south carolina.while it is true that robin jumped around a bit in her testimony about what she anticipated she would be earning,she nonetheless testified that she had been offered a job for around per year and that she was applying for another job in roughly the same salary range.under such circumstances,the amount of robin income was sufficiently ascertainable to make a guideline recalculation 
the other reason for not recalculating the guideline amount was the difficulty in determining the variable in the formula equation.again,however,the record was sufficient to allow the trial court to make the calculation.the court established in its own visitation order the precise amount of time michael would have with his daughter one week and an additional four weekends per year.assuming weekends,that roughly computes to about three weeks out of the year,or about percent,which is certainly a usable figure.
the failure to make a guideline calculation meant that the requirement of section subdivision a court must state the amount child support would have been under guideline formula was not complied with.therefore the judgment must be reversed.
our decision is without prejudice to either party on two issues likely to arise on remand.the first is whether robin reduced living expenses in the wake of her relocation to a part of the country that is generally acknowledged as much cheaper to live in than southern california,subd.l noting that the purpose of the guidelines is,among other things,to reflect california higher costs of raising children than those found in other states might be a special circumstance justifying reduction in the guideline amount.the second is whether,under subdivision b of section the court may,in its discretion,consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent income,consistent with the best interests of the children,income should be imputed to robin because of the dramatic drop in her nominal income due to her relocation,consistent with amanda best interest.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group the fact that a parent is not working up to his or her earning potential because the parent is the primary caregiver for the children does not automatically create an exemption from fam.b income imputation.because of the nature of the trial court order refusing to recalculate the guideline amount,there was no reason for these issues to be litigated the first time.
however,we can not avoid the substance of robin two other contentions,both of which are fully briefed in this proceeding,because the case must now be sent back for what is,in essence,a new trial.see code civ,if a new trial be granted,the court shall pass upon and determine all the questions of law involved in the case,presented upon such appeal,and necessary to the final determination of the case.
the need to assure frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent may justify reducing the guideline amount to provide for necessary travel expenses 
as to the articulation issue,subdivision a of section requires that the reasons for departing from the guideline be stated on the record subdivision a requires that there also be a justification for the departure based on the best interests of the children.here,the trial judge reasoning for varying the guideline amount is,as the court itself noted,obvious.the relationship was in desperate need of repair,and the only practical tool at hand was to have as much visitation as possible,even though that meant frequent transcontinental travel by parties of limited means.
the legislature has declared that it is the public policy of this state to assure minor children frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents have separated see.further,the california supreme court has noted that the law gives broad discretion to trial courts to modify visitation orders to minimize loss of the noncustodial parent contact with a child in cases,including allocating transportation expenses to the custodial parent.in re marriage of burgess cal th,d.in the light of these policies,it is beyond peradventure that the need to assure the noncustodial parent frequent and continuing contact by varying the guideline amount to provide funds for such visitation and contact satisfies subdivisions a and a of section.
there is language which in in re marriage of gigliotti th,d,might be taken for a hard and fast rule that provision of money for visitation would be insufficient to justify departing from the guidelines the language should not be so taken the gigliotti court limited its comment to the specific case before it.see ibid.we perceive no equity or logic in such a result in this case emphasis added.
justice king has eloquently pointed out how,in many circumstances the inflexibility of the child support statutes is creating havoc and undue hardship.in re marriage of fini th,fn,d.there is nothing we or any other panel of the appellate court can do to relieve the burden those statutes place on family court trial judges to run the dissomaster or some equivalent to calculate a guideline,but we certainly can refrain from enunciating common law rules that make an inflexible system even more inflexible 
with all respect to the gigliotti court,it is perhaps not too much to say that one can indeed perceive times when equity or logic would justify lowering child support so as to facilitate visitation in the wake of a.frequent and continuing contact between a child and the noncustodial parent is good in itself.see.frequent and continuing contact is good because it facilitates overall involvement by the noncustodial parent in a child life and that is good for the child.see adams,child custody and parental relocations loving your children from a distance duq,noting one study that concluded that frequent access to the noncustodial parent gave the children in the study a sense of control and helped to alleviate the negative feelings of helplessness and low from which they suffered after the divorce hereinafter adams,loving your children from a distance.and it is good because both common sense and empirical data would indicate it increases the likelihood of actual payment of the support itself.see pearson thoennes,supporting children after divorce the influence of custody on support levels and payments fam,based upon an assessment of sixty families,wallerstein and huntington concluded that there was a relationship between the frequency,regularity and flexibility of visitation and the payment of child support which emerged at eighteen months following separation and held over the period of their study.
in view of the legislature announced public policy in favor of visitation with the noncustodial parent,the benefits of such contact noted in the social science research,and the detriment to the child personality development that results from its lack see adams,loving your children from a distance,supra,duq.at research shows that benefits to the child are derived from frequent contact with the noncustodial parent,and disadvantages are associated with less frequent contact,we can not agree with any suggestion that might be extracted from gigliotti that visitation can not be a sufficient reason to vary the guideline amount in cases.
here,not only does the sheer distance and daunting logistics of visitation in south carolina justify varying from the guideline amount,but there is the additional factor of active interference by the custodial parent with the noncustodial parent relationship with his child.increased visitation is particularly needed here to repair the damage.the judge reason for varying the guideline turn the heart of an estranged daughter back to her satisfied the articulation requirements of section,subdivisions a through a.
reduction of the guideline amount to create a travel fund within the control of the noncustodial parent is within the discretion of the trial court 
the remaining question,then,is whether the trial judge could provide funds to facilitate visitation by allowing the noncustodial parent to deduct an amount from the guideline and set that amount aside for the exclusive purpose of the concomitant travel.preliminarily,we must note that the case relied on by robin in this regard,in re marriage of chandler th,d unilateral decision to create trust fund for college and other expenses in order to limit custodial parent access to additional support in high income case held abuse of discretion is distinguishable.the main purpose of the trust in chandler was to limit,in an exceptionally high income case the noncustodial parent in the case was a member of the family which has owned the times,the custodial parent access to support funds in excess of what the trial court erroneously considered the child current needs.see id.at,d.this court rejected such micromanagement of support money by the noncustodial parent once the court determines the appropriate amount of child support,the supporting parent has no right to determine whether these funds are used to buy groceries,pay rent or pay for music lessons.id.at,d.moreover,given the excess of support over the child needs in chandler,the trust was largely directed at creating a college fund for the future,after the child became an adult.the chandler court held that the trial court had no authority to do so because it was,in effect,adult child support.see ibid.a court has no authority to order a parent to support an adult child in re marriage of serna th,d relying in part on chandler to strike down spousal support order that was,in effect,adult child support.
here,unlike chandler,the trust is not directed at future needs such as college expenses,but at one very current and pressing need,namely,the restoration of the relationship,a task made all the more difficult because of the order.unlike chandler,the trust here does not allow the noncustodial parent to interfere or otherwise direct the custodial parent use of support money it is earmarked for one very,necessitated by the custodial parent unilateral decision to move out of state.finally,unlike chandler,this is not a very high income case,where the appellate court was concerned that the trial court trust order was a subterfuge to avoid allowing the child to share in the noncustodial parent high standard of living,subd.f.the chandler opinion devoted considerable effort to establishing that the child reasonable needs varied,went up with the noncustodial parent circumstances.see chandler,supra,th at,d.
in the case before us,given the rupture of the relationship and the need to repair it,there certainly is a strong showing of necessity justifying establishment of a trust.chandler,supra,th at,d.chandler hardly constitutes a common law obstacle to the trial judge attempt,in his own words,to do everything we could to keep father involved in this child life.
the other case that robin relies on is gigliotti.there is language in the gigliotti opinion that might be read for the proposition that there is no authority for a trial court to deduct travel expenses from what the payor parent would otherwise owe in guideline child support 
the language is dicta because the gigliotti court was dealing with a case where the custodial parent was forced to incur travel expenses for herself she was obligated to accompany her young son on the plane from massachusetts to california for quarterly visits.gigliotti,supra,th at,d.as between the two parents,the gigliotti court emphasized that it was the custodial parent who incurred the greater amount of travel expenses for visitation.id.at,d,original emphasis.under those circumstances,the case was certainly an appropriate one for i
