christopher weber was appointed by a texas state court as a receiver for the marital estate of tracy kohlrautz and kohlrautz.weber thereafter participated in a nevada state court suit brought by kohlrautz against oilmen participation corporation oilmen.oilmen removed the suit to federal district court,and then filed what it called a complaint against weber alleging abuse of process.weber moved for summary judgment based on official immunity as a receiver.the district court denied weber motion,and weber now appeals.we first hold that state rather than federal official immunity law applies to this case.then,based on nevada rules,we hold that nevada rather than texas law applies.applying nevada law of official immunity for receivers,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment.
background 
the kohlrautzes were married in luxembourg in.four years later,they moved to freeport,grand bahamas.on september,kohlrautz flew to texas.two days after arriving in texas,kohlrautz filed for divorce in that state.the bexar county district court held that and kohlrautz were domiciled in texas for purposes of divorce proceedings in that state.it entered a divorce decree on december.
on november,the texas court appointed a receiver to manage,control,and preserve the property of the marital estate.ten months later,the court replaced the original receiver with weber,the appellant in this case.determining what assets belong to the marital estate has been a hotly contested matter involving extensive litigation in many jurisdictions.
on december,kohlrautz filed suit against oilmen in state court in nevada.her complaint alleges that two pieces of nevada property owned by oilmen are assets of the marital estate.oilmen removed the suit to federal district court based on diversity of citizenship.see.after removal,oilmen filed a counterclaim against kohlrautz,as well as what it called a claim against weber.oilmen central contention against weber was that he engaged in tortious abuse of process in assisting kohlrautz in bringing the nevada suit against oilmen.
weber moved for summary judgment in the federal district court based on a defense of official immunity as a receiver.apparently applying federal law,the district court concluded that weber was protected by absolute immunity for acts within the scope of his authority as receiver.however,the court held that there were triable questions of fact as to whether he committed acts outside his authority.it accordingly denied weber motion.weber has timely appealed.
we have asked for and received supplemental briefing on the issue of what law is applicable to this case.we hold that nevada law of official immunity for receivers applies.based on that law,we affirm the result reached by the district court.
ii.interlocutory review and standard of review 
we do not ordinarily have jurisdiction to review a denial of a motion for summary judgment because such a denial is not a final judgment.however,we do have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in suits brought under,or brought as bivens actions,if the denial of summary judgment is based on a rejection of a defense of official immunity from suit.see,schwenk hartford,cir suit brought under lee gregory,cir suit brought directly under the fourth amendment pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of federal narcotics bureau,d.although neither the supreme court nor this circuit has had occasion to uphold interlocutory appeals in suits where official immunity is asserted as a defense to a cause of action,we believe that the principle allowing interlocutory review in official immunity cases applies more broadly than merely to actions under federal law.see,will hallock,d,stating without qualification that orders rejecting absolute immunity and qualified immunity are immediately appealable.we therefore hold that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
our review is limited to issues of law and does not extend to claims in which the determination of official immunity depends on disputed issues of material fact.bingham city of manhattan beach,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to the degree the facts are in dispute,we assume the facts for which oilmen has provided evidentiary support are correct in determining whether the district court should have denied weber motion for summary judgment.see id.
iii.discussion 
state rather than federal official immunity law 
we must first decide whether federal or state official immunity law applies to this case.there are two possible lines of analysis,both leading to the same conclusion.
the first is an erie analysis under hanna plumer,d.a federal court follows federal procedural law and,where it applies,state substantive law.see gasperini ctr.for humanities,d citing erie tompkins.a defense based on official immunity could conceivably come within the category described in hanna as falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure and rationally capable of classification as either.at.if there is an applicable federal rule of civil procedure,and if that rule is valid under the rules enabling act,that rule should be applied.id.at.
in the case now before us,however,there is no applicable federal rule of civil procedure.absent a valid and applicable federal rule,we fall back on the test first articulated in guaranty trust york,and the test first articulated in byrd blue ridge rural electric cooperative,d.the test instructs federal courts to apply state law when the difference between the state and federal rule would determine the outcome of the litigation.the test instructs federal courts to evaluate and balance the federal and state interests in deciding whether to apply the state or federal rule.the two tests are not mutually exclusive,but rather complementary.see gasperini,at.applying both a york and a byrd analysis.
the application of the test is guided by the twin aims of the erie rule discouragement of and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.id.at.quoting hanna,at.we must ask whether application of the state rule would make so important a difference to the character or result of the litigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum state,and whether application of the rule would have so important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court.hanna,at.see also gasperini,at.quoting from this passage in hanna.
applying this test,we conclude that an official immunity rule is,and that we should therefore apply state rather than federal law.the defense is both an immunity from suit and,in practical effect,an immunity from liability.depending on the scope of the immunity provided,a suit may or may not be allowed to go forward against a defendant claiming this defense.where there is a material difference between the federal and state law for official there is for at least one of the two state laws potentially applicable in this is an obvious incentive to choose either federal or state court if that choice is tantamount to a choice between federal and state law.
the application of the test also leads to the application of state law.weber,the party asserting official immunity,was appointed as a judicial receiver by a texas state court.oilmen alleges that weber has engaged in tortious abuse of judicial process under nevada state law in nevada state courts.oilmen asserts no federal claim.we see no federal interest in applying federal official immunity law against a state officer in a suit brought in state court and based on state law.rather,we believe that a state has a strong interest in applying state official immunity law in such a suit.therefore,we conclude under both the and tests that state rather than federal official immunity law is applicable to this case.
a second analysis would treat official immunity as a substantive rule of law.this analysis is appropriate if official immunity law does not fall within hanna uncertain area between substance and procedure and rationally capable of classification as either,but is,rather,simply a substantive ru
