annare loubser brought this federal civil rights suit under against more than individuals who she alleges conspired to defraud her by corrupting her divorce proceedings those proceedings ended in a judgment that,she claims,deprived her of property to which she was entitled.she brought this suit after the state appellate court had affirmed the judgment in the divorce proceedings.the district court dismissed the suit on the pleadings as barred by two doctrines,which denies the lower federal courts the authority to overturn a state court judgment,and the domestic relations exception,a doctrine that denies to the federal courts jurisdiction over domestic relations matters such as divorce on the theory that the reference to the judicial power in article iii of the constitution was intended to exclude the powers exercised by britain ecclesiastical courts,which,rather than the common law courts at westminster,exercised jurisdiction in such matters.because the judgment in the divorce suit was civil rather than criminal,the doctrine of heck humphrey,d is clearly inapplicable.see,wilkinson dotson,d.
loubser does not have a lawyer.although her complaint is quite well written,it is pages long divided into,and repetitious.worse,it has a paranoid quality,with some of the allegations bordering on,perhaps crossing over into,the fantastic.the complaint charges that over a period beginning in august of,state judges and court reporters,loubser own lawyers,her former husband,building contractors,the owner of a jewelry store,and numerous friends and relatives of the other conspirators,conspired to destroy her financially and drive her out of the country by manipulating the divorce proceedings to deny her due process of law,and that they did all this because they consider her a fucking south african bitch who makes too much fucking money as a physical therapist.one of the defendants,she charges,destroyed title documents essential to her divorce proceedings two of the defendants effaced all records of the existence of a related case her own lawyers,along with court reporters,altered transcripts her lawyers refused to present crucial evidence the judge presiding over the divorce proceeding consorted improperly with loubser and a number of his witnesses,one of whom touched the judge and rubbed his belly at a party,though,not in court.among still other allegations,loubser charges that the judge joked about golf with a witness while he was testifying and the court reporter deliberately deleted the exchange from the transcript,and that loubser said to the judge,goodbye judgee wudgee,i will see you around town.in support of the allegation,loubser has included in the appendix to her opening brief in this court photographs of the incident,but the photographs do not depict anybody belly being rubbed.
it is highly improbable that the suit has any merit,but the allegations are not so fantastic that the suit can be dismissed out of hand,as being obviously frivolous,as in lee clinton,cir.the setting for the alleged conspiracy is white county,indiana,a rural county with a population of only.the county seat,monticello,where the divorce proceedings were held,has a population of only.no doubt there is much less formality than attends litigation in big cities and much more social interaction among the judges,lawyers,and other members of the community.loubser has probably mistaken innocent interactions for a vast conspiracy.but this is not a case on the fantasy level of lee,where the complaint charg ed the united states and china with a conspiracy to and infect and invade various people including lee with a mind reading and mental torture device called matret,to elude which lee claim ed to have developed a variety of space technologies,including an email system and nanny services,that would enable the victims of matret to relocate to planets.the reference to extraterrestrial nanny service was the clincher.
the grounds on which the district court dismissed loubser suit were erroneous.the claim that a defendant in a civil rights suit so far succeeded in corrupting the state judicial process as to obtain a favorable judgment is not barred by the doctrine.nesses shepard,cir.otherwise there would be no federal remedy other than an appeal to the supreme court,and that remedy would be ineffectual because the plaintiff could not present evidence showing that the judicial proceeding had been a farce,moore dempsey.holmes,one can not present evidence to an appellate court.this is in general rather than in every case,and maybe indiana law would have enabled loubser to present evidence in her appeal,but this issue has not been addressed.moreover,the relief she seeks would go far beyond merely modifying the division of property decreed by the divorce court.she wants damages for the harassment to which the defendants allegedly subjected her en route to the judgment,including efforts to destroy her business as a physical therapist and drive her out of the country.
this is not to say that loubser had no possible state remedies,including bringing a postjudgment challenge to the decree as having been procured by fraud and complaining about judicial misconduct to the indiana judicial nominating commission,though the latter course would not have gotten her the monetary damages that she is seeking.but does not impose a duty to exhaust judicial and administrative remedies before pursuing a federal civil rights suit.except in prisoner suits,there is no requirement that a plaintiff in a suit under exhaust state remedies,wilkinson dotson,supra.at patsy board of regents,d.and,as we pointed out,merely modifying the divorce decree would not give loubser all the relief she seeks in this lawsuit.
the exception to federal jurisdiction is not applicable to this case either.a federal court can not grant or annul a divorce,but that is not what loubser is seeking.
of course her claims against the judges are barred she is complaining about their judicial conduct,and they have absolute immunity from such damages claims,john barron,cir washington county,cir.the other official defendants,the court reporters,do not.antoine byers anderson,d mccullough horton,cir per curiam.forte sullivan,cir per curiam,notes a circuit split on this issue,but the split was resolved in the antoine case in favor of liability.
not that court reporters are liable in a section case for innocent errors,even if negligent.section claims can not be founded on negligence.daniels williams,d lewis anderson,cir upsher grosse pointe public school system,cir.but if,as the complaint alleges,the reporters deliberately altered a transcript as part of a conspiracy to defraud a litigant,they can,lacking absolute immunity,be held liable.the defendants do not argue otherwise.
the remaining issue is whether the allegations of conspiracy are sufficiently informative to survive dismissal.the issue is close.although conspiracy is not something that rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure requires be proved with particularity,and so a plain and short statement will do,hoskins poelstra,cir walker benjamin,cir walker thompson,cir see generally swierkiewicz sorema,d leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d,it differs from other claims in having a degree of vagueness that makes a bare claim of conspiracy wholly uninformative to the defendant.federal pleading entitles a defendant to notice of the plaintiff claim so that he can prepare responsive pleadings.a doe smith,cir lotierzo v.a woman world medical center,cir.that is why courts require the plaintiff to allege the parties,the general purpose,and the approximate date of the conspiracy.walker thompson,supra,at ryan mary immaculate queen center,cir.
but this information can be found in the plaintiff complaint,though in disjointed form.the parties to the conspiracy are clearly identified the conspiracy is alleged to have begun in august of and to have continued for at least three years and its deprive the plaintiff of her property and livelihood by corrupting her divorce clearly if repetitiously stated as well.pangburn culbertson,cir.the dates on which particular defendants joined th
