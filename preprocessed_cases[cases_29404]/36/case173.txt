in april,soudabeh white left switzerland for the united states with her minor son,who had previously resided habitually in switzerland.the child father,malcolm white,initiated this action for wrongful removal under the hague convention,seeking the return of his son to switzerland.the district court found that white breached no rights of custody in removing the child and therefore denied white petition for return.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in may,white married white in switzerland.later that year,they had a son in switzerland.in june,white and white separated and white initiated legal proceedings in switzerland pertaining to the separation,including rights to the couple child.in october,the swiss court of first instance of geneva authorized and white legal separation and granted custody of the child to white.the court also granted visitation rights to white two afternoons each weekend,to be expanded to one weekend in two,in agreement with the curator when the time comes.
white only learned of the april,departure of white and the child three days after they had left switzerland.white left him a voicemail message saying that she had taken their son on a holiday in the united states.white subsequently claimed that she came to the united states to visit her sister and seek medical care for her son.doctors in switzerland had diagnosed the child with autism in the united states,doctors later diagnosed him with a feeding disorder for which he has been receiving treatment.since coming to the united states,the child has been present in the country continuously,except for a brief visit to canada 
at the time of the departure of white and the child to the united states,psychologists in switzerland were conducting an analysis of the parties and the child to assess custody arrangements.in july,at which time white and the child had resided in the united states for three months,the psychologists issued their preliminary report.in it,they suggested that white suffered from psychological problems,which affected her ability to properly care for her son,and that the court should transfer custody of the child to white if her condition did not improve within six months.
in september,the court of first instance of geneva issued an emergency ruling prohibiting white from leaving switzerland with the child.however,in december,the same court found that it did not have jurisdiction because switzerland was no longer white and the child usual place of residence.in february,the swiss tutelary court in geneva also found that it lacked jurisdiction but noted that white had sole custody of the child and could therefore remove the child from switzerland without authorization.
on april,upon finding that white and the child were residing in alexandria,virginia,white brought this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.he filed this petition for return under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention or convention,and the international child abduction remedies act,et.the petition alleged one count of wrongful removal.on june,following a bench trial,the district court denied the petition for return.the court found that white did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his son removal breached any rights of custody.white noted a timely appeal of that judgment 
the parties filed their appellate briefs in the fall of and we heard oral argument in the case on march.one day later,white filed with us an order of the court of first instance of geneva dated march.in that order,the court of first instance related that,in september,geneva court of justice,an appellate court,found the geneva courts did have jurisdiction to rule on protective measures for the child of and white.accordingly,although white and the child remained in the united states and did not appear at the hearing before the court of first instance,in its march order the court of first instance purported to adjust its earlier custody arrangements to g rant to malcolm white the custody of and parental authority over the child and g rant to soudabeh white a visitation right of the child.
this case requires us to decide whether the district court erred in finding that white removal of her son from switzerland to the united states breached no rights of custody under the hague convention.in a convention case,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions regarding domestic,foreign,and international law de novo.maxwell maxwell,cir.the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.abbott abbott,internal quotation marks omitted.
the convention states that w here a child has been wrongfully removed or retained the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.hague convention.the removal or retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.id.a.because it is undisputed in this case that switzerland was the child habitual residence before his removal,swiss law determines whether there was a breach of rights.see id.
the convention further specifies that rights of custody shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.id.a.it distinguishes rights of access from rights of custody,explaining that rights of access shall include the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.id.b.
white,as the petitioner,must prove wrongful removal by a preponderance of the evidence.e a.he offers three reasons why the district court erred in refusing to so find and denying his petition for return.first,he contends that white removal of the child breached parental authority rights he retained at the time of removal.second,he argues that,even if white had sole custody of the child at the time of removal,under swiss law,she abused her custody rights.finally,relying on the new march swiss custody determination,white argues that he now has sole custody over the child and thus the child should be returned to switzerland.we consider these contentions in turn.
white first maintains that white removal of the child to the united states inhibited parental authority rights he retained under swiss law and that such rights constitute rights of custody protected under the convention.white responds that,even if white had parental authority rights under swiss law,her removal of the child did not breach any such rights and thus did not violate the convention.
the october separation order explicitly awarded the custody of the child to soudabeh white.it reserved to white only the right to visit the child.this language clearly seems to provide that white had sole custody and white had only a right of access,a right to take the child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child habitual residence.hague convention b.under the convention,breach of a right of access alone does not provide cause for return of a child.see id,jenkins jenkins,cir t he remedy of return is available for a wrongful removal or retention but not for a breach of the right to access.
white contends,however,that the text of the separation order does not tell the full story because there is a background principle in swiss law that parents share parental authority.see code civil cc civil code,sr,rs,during marriage,the parents shall have joint parental authority.such parental authority includes joint responsibility for care,education,religion,and legal representation.see id.although swiss law does specify that,if the spouses separate,the judge may assign parental authority to one of the spouses,id.emphasis added,in this case the october separation order did not specifically assign parental authority to either white or white.
thus the order perhaps leaves room for white retention of parental authority rights.courts have previously deemed certain seemingly analogous rights of other countries to be rights of custody under the convention.see,hanley roy,cir finding grandparents testamentary guardianship under irish law,involving joint authority over the children education,health,and religious life,sufficient for convention right of custody whallon lynn,cir same for mexican patria potestas rights requiring adequate connection between parent and child and,by implication,a meaningful,decisionmaking role in the life and care of the child.
but swiss parental authority rights alone provide no basis for a wrongful removal action under the convention.the swiss supreme court has made clear that subject to an abuse of rights,a parent who holds exclusive custody is entitled to move with the children,and even abroad,without having to obtain for this the judge authorization,or the authorization of the other parent.see tribunal fédéral tf federal supreme court june,atf iii.this is true even when the other parent retains parental authority rights.see id.g ranting sole custody to one of the parents removes from the other the right to decide on the residence of the children this means that the legal situation of the holder of the restricted parental authority does not suffer any prejudice within the meaning of hague convention if the holder of the exclusive right of custody moves the children out of switzerland.in february,the swiss tutelary court applied the swiss supreme court teaching in this very case,explaining that,at the time of removal,soudabeh white was the only one who held custody of her son,and the bearer of sole custody may,breach of law excepted,move with the child,notably to a foreign country.
the cases white cites in which courts found removal wrongful,ostensibly based on breach of parental rights,are distinguishable.in none of those cases were the petitioning parent rights subject to the removing parent sole right to remove under a governing court order,as interpreted by the courts of the country of habitual residence.see hanley,furnes reeves,cir whallon,lieberman tabachnik,d bader kramer,cir in the absence of any order removing bader ability to determine the child residence,he continued to retain joint custody emphasis added shealy shealy,cir finding removal not wrongful when the father custody rights were subject to the mother right to remove under the applicable circumstances of military necessity 
in short,the district court did not err in holding that white had not demonstrated that the removal of their child by white breached any parental authority rights he retained at the time of removal.
white next maintains that white removal secretly and in the midst of a psychological evaluation,was intended to compromise the father relationship with the child and threatened the child,constituting an abuse of rights under swiss law.the swiss supreme court has held that a relocation without reasonable grounds,that is to say only intended to compromise the personal relationships between the child and the other parent,may be an abuse of rights and consequently a breach of rights of custody under the convention.see tribunal fédéral atf iii.further,the spouse who holds the right of custody may be barred from taking the child outside the country provided that the wellbeing of the person concerned is seriously threatened by this relocation.id.however,under swiss law,typical relocation and integration difficulties do not normally constitute a serious threat and so there will rarely be a serious threat to the wellbeing of the child when he is still very young.id.
whether there was an abuse of rights by white therefore hinges on the factual question of why she decided to leave switzerland with the child and whether her decision to do so seriously threatened his wellbeing.white testified at trial in the district court that she brought her son to the united states to see her sister and to seek medical treatment.the district court explicitly found white explanation credible.indeed,the record makes clear that,soon after her arrival in the united states,white sought medical treatment for the child and received a diagnosis different from the autism diagnosis with which she had been dissatisfied in switzerland.the child has since continued medical treatment.
white alleges that the timing of his son removal to the united states renders this explanation highly suspect.he points out that the swiss psychological assessment of the family for custody evaluation purposes was ongoing at the time and that assessment was ultimately unfavorable to white.the difficulty with white reliance on these facts is that the psychologists issued their report three months after white had taken the child to the united states.white offered no evidence at trial before the district court that white left the country solely,or even in substantial part,to evade this evaluation and its consequences or that the removal otherwise seriously threatened the child wellbeing.
accordingly,we can not hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that white had legitimate reasons for coming to the united states.we therefore reject white contention that white removal of the child from switzerland constituted an abuse of her rights under swiss law.
finally,white relies on the swiss court of first instance very recent march order purporting to transfer custody of the child from white to white two years after the child removal to the united states.white maintains that the new order dramatically a ffects this case and confirms that the swiss court has always been in accord with his position.
but the only reasonable reading of the convention is that a removal wrongfulness depends on rights of custody at the time of removal.the convention states that removal is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody.hague convention a.removal could not be considered in breach of rights of custody if those rights did not exist at the time of removal.moreover,the convention explicitly provides that removal is only wrongful when at the time of removal custody rights were actually exercised or would have been so exercised but for the removal.id.b emphasis added.
thus,courts have repeatedly assumed rights of custody for purposes of article of the convention means rights of custody at the time of removal.see,hanley,at to establish wrongful removal under the convention,the hanleys must show that they had rights of custody when roy removed the children emphasis added bader,at bader did retain some existing custodial rights over the child at the time of removal.emphasis added shealy,at finding removal not wrongful based on a interim decision although the german courts ha d not yet made a final custody determination because the convention is concerned with custody rights that existed at the time of removal emphasis added whallon,at the pending massachusetts custody proceedings commenced by lynn after her removal of the child are inapplicable to this action because the convention refers specifically to rights of custody at the time of removal.
because we have not previously addressed directly the question of whether a custody determination after removal affects a hague convention case,we look also to the practice of our sister signatories.see abbott.at in interpreting any treaty,the opinions of our sister signatories are entitled to considerable weight.the principle applies with special force here,for congress has directed that uniform international interpretation of the hague convention is part of the convention framework.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.our sister signatories agree that orders claiming to adjust custody arrangements after removal or retention do not typically affect rights under article of the convention.see,thomson thomson,can.there is nothing in the convention requiring the recognition of an ex post facto custody order of foreign jurisdictions.and there are several statements in the supplementary material to support the view that wrongful retention under the hague convention does not contemplate a retention becoming wrongful only after the issuance of a chasing order.re a minor,appeal
