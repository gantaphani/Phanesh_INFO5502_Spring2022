cherry richardson,an investigator with the illinois department of children and family services dcfs,told john terry not to visit his daughter,jaidah,during an investigation into charges that john sexually abused jaidah.john contends that richardson acted without appropriate notice or a hearing and without enough evidence and that these shortcomings violated his and jaidah fourteenth amendment rights to procedural and substantive due process.a jury found for john and jaidah whose claims we can treat as one for purposes of our analysis,and richardson appeals,arguing that the defense of qualified immunity entitles her to judgment as a matter of law.because there was no constitutional violation in the first place,we agree that richardson should prevail and reverse.
background 
john and richelle terry married in and divorced three years later.under their divorce decree,richelle received sole custody of jaidah,the couple only child.john was awarded reasonable visitation,which included his birthday and father day as well as two consecutive days every other week to be determined by his work schedule,ten consecutive days in the summer,and various other occasions including jaidah birthday on which he and richelle alternated visitation.
by,richelle was living with her boyfriend and his three children,and john had moved in with his mother and stepfather while he went to school.at some point richelle noticed that when jaidah returned from visits with john she appeared withdrawn.she also observed that jaidah resisted visiting her father,generally feared adult men including richelle own boyfriend,and had begun wetting her bed.
suspecting that john may have abused jaidah,richelle,on april,asked her daughter whether she had any secrets.according to richelle,jaidah eventually responded that john hurt her,kissed her,forced her to swallow a necklace,tried to make her kiss his noodle,and jammed crayons and a pen into her anus.upon hearing this information,richelle promptly contacted jaidah pediatrician and on the doctor advice called dcfs hotline.
the next morning dcfs assigned richardson to investigate,and she began by informing the state police that to assure jaidah safety,her plan known as a safety plan was to eliminate contact with john during the investigation.richardson then telephoned richelle,who repeated the allegations that she had made the night before and supplied additional details.she explained that according to jaidah her father had threatened to kill her if she revealed the abuse and that jaidah had disclosed the bad secret only because she thought that she would not have to see john again.richelle also relayed that john had admitted to sharing a bed with jaidah at his mother house,that his mother and stepfather recently had been away traveling,and that she believed the abuse occurred at their home.richelle finally told richardson that the following day was jaidah fourth birthday and that she did not want john to see her.
richardson next called john and left a message on his answering machine with her name and telephone number.according to john,she also said,your child has been indicated in an abuse situation.you are to cease all visitation and contact with her.after leaving this message,richardson and another investigator visited richelle home and scheduled a formal interview later in the week with jaidah.richelle at this time stressed that she was concerned about john seeing jaidah for her birthday,to which richardson replied that she should try to defer him.richelle then told john that jaidah was too ill to see him.
the following day,may,john returned richardson call.he asked to know the nature of the charges,and richardson responded that she could not tell him over the telephone.john then explained that he could not meet with richardson for at least a week because he had final exams he also said that he had not seen jaidah very much recently due to his work and school schedule.richardson repeated that he was not to contact jaidah,to which john replied,okay or i understand.according to richardson,she understood from john response that he intended to comply with her safety plan,so she did not pursue other options for preventing contact with jaidah.
later that morning,richardson spoke with jaidah pediatrician,lynn greeley,who had examined jaidah the day before for signs of sexual abuse.greeley said that jaidah genitalia were abnormal,that her anus was lax and easily opened,that her hymen possibly was scarred,and that she complained of pain around her fourchette.greeley findings were corroborated a week later by a second pediatrician,kay saving,who reported that jaidah had a dilated anus and fourchette scarring.because these findings were very compatible with a history of sexual abuse,saving recommended immediate counseling.
richardson,accompanied by another dcfs investigator and a state police investigator,interviewed jaidah on may.in response to richardson john expert characterized at trial as unduly said that her father had made her have bad dreams,choked her,called her stupid,and put beads in her mouth.after the police investigator left the room,telling jaidah on his way out that it was okay to tell,richelle joined the interview and held jaidah on her lap.jaidah replied no when richardson asked if her father rubbed his noodle on her,but when her mother repeated the question,jaidah said yes it hurt.
richardson interviewed john at his attorney office on may weeks after their initial conversation.she identified the allegations against him and provided a dcfs brochure describing the investigation process.john denied inappropriate contact with jaidah and said that richelle had previously made unfounded charges of child abuse against her own father.he also said that richelle was and twice had attempted suicide.
at the end of the interview,richardson again told john not to contact jaidah during the investigation,which she explained could last up to days.neither john nor his attorney asked richardson whether his compliance was required or questioned her authority to interfere with his visitation.according to john,he refrained from contacting jaidah because he had learned from news reports and things that ignoring dcfs instructions could lead to termination of his parental rights or jaidah placement in a foster home.
richardson closed her investigation on june and filed a final report indicating john for sexual penetration,exploitation,and molestation.richardson left a message for john,in which she explained her findings and asked him to call with any questions.according to john,he never received this message and did not learn that the investigation had ended until he received a letter from dcfs telling him that he had days to appeal the indicated finding a process that he began but later abandoned.
on june,the same day that richardson closed her investigation,richelle obtained an ex parte order that prohibited john from taking custody of jaidah.at a hearing held three weeks later,john agreed to the terms of the interim order,and richelle then petitioned to terminate his visitation entirely.the court,after more than a year of proceedings,found that jaidah had been sexually abused,but not by john,and denied the petition.within a week john began seeing jaidah again.
john then brought this action under against richardson and a number of other defendants not relevant to the appeal on behalf of himself and jaidah.after a magistrate judge denied cross motions for summary judgment,the case was tried on john procedural and substantive due process theories.the jury awarded to john and to jaidah,and after denying richardson motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial,the court awarded attorneys fees.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,richardson principal contention is that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because qualified immunity blocks john claims.in evaluating this defense,the first question is whether richardson violated a constitutionally protected right if so,we turn to whether this right was clearly established at the time of the violation.saucier katz,d payne pauley,cir.given the jury verdict,the facts are viewed as favorably as pos
