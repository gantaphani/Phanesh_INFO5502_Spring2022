in juvenile dependency proceedings,mario and kevin each petitioned the juvenile court to be declared the presumptive father of kiana.at the time of disposition,the juvenile court found in kevin favor.mario appeals.we affirm the juvenile court order.
factual and procedural background 
kevin removed the minors kiana and her half sibling,mykea,from their mother home on august,after learning mother had been arrested.the minors came to the attention of the department of children and family services dcfs on september,when it was reported the minors had been the victims of general neglect by mother who sold drugs and permitted strangers to have sex in the home.the minors subsequently were declared wards of the court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section based on a petition which,as sustained,alleged mother inappropriately disciplined the minors,mykea father inappropriately touched kiana,mother has a history of drug abuse and mykea father is currently incarcerated.
a children social worker csw interviewed the minors at kevin home on september.kiana reported she had been living with kevin,whom she referred to as her daddy,and no longer wished to live with mother.dcfs detained the minors from kevin home and placed them in foster care.
kevin indicated he and kiana mother lived together when mother became pregnant with kiana mother told kevin he was the father.however,five months later,they separated and mother began to live with mario soon thereafter,mother denied kevin was kiana father,and mother has made conflicting statements regarding kiana paternity over the years.kevin indicated he has always been a part of kiana life.the csw reported kiana did not acknowledge mario as being her father and does not recall ever seeing mario,whereas kevin has treated kiana as his child and has indicated that,even if genetic testing proved he was not kiana father,he would continue to treat her as his child.
at the detention hearing,counsel for kiana asked the juvenile court to release kiana to kevin kevin testified he had cohabited off and on with mother after kiana was about four years of age and that kiana has stayed at kevin home for two or three months at a time and has a bed in the room shared by his girlfriend two daughters.when mother was arrested,kiana telephoned kevin and said,daddy,come get me.kevin thereafter enrolled the minors in school and transported kiana to and from school every day.when asked if he had ever been convicted of a crime,kevin indicated he had been convicted of grand theft auto in and had not been in trouble since then.
at the conclusion of kevin testimony,the juvenile court ordered kiana released to his custody and denied dcfs request for genetic testing 
the matter was recalled when mother appeared and the juvenile court received the results of a search of kevin criminal history.under by county counsel,kevin admitted he had been imprisoned in after violation of parole upon conviction of burglary and grand theft auto.additionally,kevin had a misdemeanor conviction of brandishing a weapon and had been arrested in after an argument with his girlfriend.the juvenile court found kevin had a much more extensive record than he had admitted,rescinded its earlier placement order and ordered kiana placed in foster care.
prior to disposition,mario sought to be declared kiana presumptive father.mario declared he and mother cohabited at about the time of kiana conception,he is named as kiana father on her birth certificate,he consented to the placement of his name on her birth certificate,he married mother on may,two years after kiana birth,and they divorced on december.at about the time of kiana birth,mario was arrested.he has been continuously incarcerated for the past years and was scheduled to be released on parole in october of.mario told the csw he wanted to do what he could for kiana,including accepting responsibility as her father.mario indicated he has maintained contact with kiana by writing and telephoning her.
kiana filed a declaration in which she averred she has always thought of kevin as her father.he has been around my whole life and has always supported me.when i lived with my mom he would buy me things that i needed.kevin helped kiana enroll in school and met with her teachers.prior to a juvenile court appearance in november of,kiana did not remember ever seeing mario kiana indicated mario has written her that he is her father.however,kiana stated,kevin is my real dad.he has always been there for me.
prior to disposition,the juvenile court denied kevin request for genetic testing.on december,the juvenile court found both kevin and mario qualified as kiana presumed father but concluded kevin presumption prevailed over mario because kiana had acknowledged kevin as her father and kevin had received kiana into his home.
contentions 
mario contends he is kiana presumptive father,kevin does not qualify as a presumptive father and the juvenile court should have ordered genetic testing before it weighed the competing presumptions of paternity.
discussion 
the uniform parentage act.
before addressing mario contentions,we review the relevant law.the uniform parentage act the act,originally adopted as civil code section et and reenacted without substantive change as family code section et,establishes the framework by which california courts make paternity determinations it provides for conclusive and rebuttable presumptions of paternity.
a.the conclusive presumption of section.
the conclusive presumption,found in section,states except as provided in section providing for the use of blood tests,the child of a wife cohabiting with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.under section,requests for blood tests to rebut the conclusive presumption of paternity must be made within two years of the child birth and can only be made by the husband,the child,the mother or a presumed father as defined in sections and.
the conclusive presumption of section is a social policy statement made by the legislature to protect the integrity of the family unit.due process challenges to the conclusive presumption that the husband is the father of a child conceived during the marriage have been rejected by both the california and united states supreme courts.michael gerald,d michelle ronald cal d.thus,a biological father desire to establish a personal relationship with a child,without more,is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the due process clause.michael,supra,at.see also lehr robertson,d.accordingly,the unwed biological father of a child conceived during and born into an existing marriage may be barred by the conclusive presumption from developing a relationship with the child against the married parents wishes.dawn superior court cal th,d,rodney karen th,d miller miller th,d.
however,the resolution of substantive due process attacks upon the conclusive presumption depends on the circumstances prevailing in each particular case.dawn superior court,supra,cal th at,d,in re lisa cal d,fn.where the act unduly impinges a biological father constitutional right to parent a child,we apply traditional substantive due process principles and balance the biological father interest against those of the state.michelle ronald,supra,cal d at,in re lisa,supra,cal d at.thus,a court may refuse to apply the conclusive presumption when its underlying policies are not furthered.in re lisa r,supra,cal d,in re melissa d.county of orange leslie th,d comino kelley th,d.
rebuttable presumptions of section.
in addition to the conclusive presumption,there are several rebuttable presumptions of paternity described in section.as relevant here,these include where a man marries a child mother after the child birth and the man name appears with his consent on the child birth certificate,subd.c,where a man receives a child into his home and acknowledges the child as his natural child,subd.d.a presumption arising under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a.
