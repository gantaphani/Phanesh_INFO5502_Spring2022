discussion 
guardian ad litema.due process 
mother contends the juvenile court violated her due process rights by appointing her a guardian ad litem.mother argues that her rights were violated because she did not consent to the appointment and the court did not follow the proper procedures for appointing a guardian.the department concedes that the juvenile court violated mother due process rights when appointing a guardian ad litem for mother however,the department argues that the violation was harmless.we agree with both mother and the department that the court violated mother due process rights.we briefly explain the violation.
in a dependency case,a parent who is mentally incompetent must appear by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court.code civ,citation.the test is whether the parent has the capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the proceeding and to assist counsel in preparing the case.citations.the effect of the guardian ad litem appointment is to transfer direction and control of the litigation from the parent to the guardian ad litem,who may waive the parent right to a contested hearing.citations.before appointing a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding,the juvenile court must hold an informal hearing at which the parent has an opportunity to be heard.citation.the court or counsel should explain to the parent the purpose of the guardian ad litem and the grounds for believing that the parent is mentally incompetent.citation.if the parent consents to the appointment,the parent due process rights are satisfied.citation.a parent who does not consent must be given an opportunity to persuade the court that appointment of a guardian ad litem is not required,and the juvenile court should make an inquiry sufficient to satisfy itself that the parent is,or is not,competent.citation.if the court appoints a guardian ad litem without the parent consent,the record must contain substantial evidence of the parent incompetence.citation.in re james cal th,d,james.
at the detention hearing,mother trial attorney requested the court appoint a guardian ad litem for mother,based upon his interview of mother.without any questions or a hearing,the court agreed to appoint a guardian ad litem for mother.nothing in the record reflects that mother consented to the appointment.accordingly,we agree with mother and the department that the court violated mother due process rights when it appointed her a guardian ad litem,because mother did not consent to the appointment and the court did not inquire into whether or not mother was competent.
harmless error 
our supreme court recently determined that a due process violation concerning the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a parent in a dependency proceeding is subject to harmless error analysis.james,supra,cal th at,d.despite this recent decision,two questions are left unanswered.the first question concerns the application of the harmless error analysis.the second question concerns the standard of review in the harmless error analysis.
i application of the harmless error analysis 
in james,our supreme court determined that a juvenile court violation of a parent due process rights in a dependency proceeding may be deemed harmless i f the outcome of a proceeding has not been affected by the violation.james,supra,cal th at,d.it is unclear what is meant by the outcome of a proceeding.in their briefs,both mother and the department argue an error may be deemed harmless if the guardian would have been appointed despite the violation and the termination of parental rights would have occurred despite the violation.as we will explain,we conclude the juvenile court error may be deemed harmless if the outcome of the review hearings and the termination hearing were not affected by the violation.by contrast,we conclude it is not necessary to show that the guardian would have been appointed despite the court violation.
in james,our supreme court concluded the juvenile court error was harmless because t he evidence in the record all points to the conclusion that the father was incompetent and thus in need of a guardian ad litem.james,supra,cal th at,d.this analysis could be interpreted in two ways.first,it could be interpreted as deeming the error harmless because a guardian would have been appointed despite the violation.however,a second way of interpreting the analysis is that the court focus was on the outcomes of the review hearings and the termination hearings,and that by finding the guardian would have been appointed despite the due process violation,the court was finding that the outcomes of the review hearings and the termination hearing were unaffected by the juvenile court violation.
we find support for this second interpretation in a policy analysis in james,where the court stresses the importance of not needlessly reversing dependency judgments.james f,supra,cal th at,d.the court cites the strong public interest in prompt resolution of these cases so that the children may receive loving and secure home environments as soon as reasonably possible.ibid.to that end,it appears as though a juvenile court violation of a parent due process rights should be deemed harmless if the outcome of the review hearings and the termination hearing were not affected,rather than the outcome of the appointment of the guardian.
in sum,it is unclear from the opinion in james which test our supreme court was directing reviewing courts to apply when discussing harmless error,that the error is harmless if the guardian would have been appointed despite the violation or the termination of parental rights would have occurred despite the violation.we conclude that the more efficient and sensible test is whether a review hearing or termination hearing was affected by the violation.the alternative test that an error is harmless if the guardian would have been appointed despite the error could easily lead to needless reversals,because the fact that a guardian might not have been appointed does not mean a different outcome would have occurred in the review and termination hearings.accordingly,in the instant case,we determine whether the court violation of mother due process rights was harmless because mother parental rights would likely have been terminated despite the court violation of her due process rights.
ii standard of review 
the second issue we must address is what standard of harmless error review is applicable to this analysis.
in james,our supreme court declined the request of the california state association of counties,appearing as amicus curiae,to determine whether the appropriate harmless error standard of review in juvenile dependency proceedings for constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt or harmless by clear and convincing evidence.james,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
we will assume,without deciding,that the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard of review is applicable in this case,because it provides a more cautious approach in that if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt it will also be harmless by clear and convincing evidence.
we briefly present the facts that are pertinent to our analysis 
at the detention hearing on august,the court asked mother whether she had american indian ancestry.mother responded that she did,but that she would need to get the details from her grandmother.the court ordered mother,with the assistance of her guardian ad lite
