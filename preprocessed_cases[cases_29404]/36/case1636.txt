the statewide uniform guideline for determining child support permits the court,in lieu of using actual income,to impute income to a parent based on his or her earning capacity.earning capacity,in turn,requires that the parent have both the ability and the opportunity to work.in state of oregon vargas th,d,we held this same earning capacity test applies whether or not the parent is incarcerated,and thus the court may not impute income to an incarcerated parent who has no opportunity to work in prison and no other assets with which to pay support.we declined to create a blanket incarcerated parent exception to the statutory guideline.we are asked here to revisit vargas and create a somewhat more narrow exception that would permit the court to consider,in addition to the parent ability and opportunity to work,the nature of the offense for which he or she is incarcerated.again,we decline.
since these three appeals all raise the same issue,we consider them together for purposes of oral argument and decision.
facts and proceedings 
in re marriage of smith 
michael and debra smith separated in after years of marriage.their two children,twin boys,were years old at the time.michael filed a dissolution petition in november,and the following june he requested a disposition consistent with a marital settlement agreement msa signed by the parties the same time.judgment was entered accordingly on july.
the noted michael had been suspended from his job,and so had no income with which to pay child support.however,he agreed to give debra his interest,in a k retirement plan.this amount was to be credited toward his support obligation at the rate of per month,until exhausted.the figure,in turn,was based on the assumption michael was still working at his job,and that debra was not working.both circumstances would change shortly.
michael had been arrested in may of for sending child pornography over the internet.he pleaded guilty to the charge in december and began serving a term in federal prison in january of.the money from his retirement plan ran out in february.debra had,by then,obtained a license to operate a residential care facility in her home,and had started accepting clients.
in view of these changes,the county of kern filed a motion in january of to modify michael child support obligation michael testified,by telephone,at a hearing in march that he had no job in prison and was unable to pay anything.the county argued his obligation should continue nonetheless because he,rather than his family,should bear the burden of his criminal act.the court,mindful of our recent decision in vargas,concluded michael had zero earning capacity and therefore suspended his support obligation effective march.the county appealed.
county of kern polston 
the county of kern filed a complaint against kevin polston for child support in september of.he and his wife wendy had separated several months earlier.in a default judgment entered in february of the following year,kevin was ordered to pay wendy child support for their two daughters in the total amount of per month.three months later in may,kevin was convicted by plea of molesting the older daughter,and was sentenced to prison.apparently,he made several unsuccessful attempts from prison to file a motion to modify the support order.when it learned of his efforts,the county filed a motion in june of seeking a preemptive determination that kevin incarceration was not a sufficient ground for modification.kevin succeeded in filing his motion the same month,and the two matters were set for a hearing on july.
kevin testified,by telephone,at the hearing that he had no job and no immediate prospect of a job in prison,nor any property or other assets with which to pay child support.nonetheless,the county argued kevin should not be allowed to benefit from his criminal act by being relieved of his duty to support his children while incarcerated.the court,although it expressed some misgivings about the law,concluded it was required to base its determination on kevin present ability to pay.accordingly the court,in effect,granted kevin motion and reduced his support obligation to zero the county appealed.
county of merced bryner 
charles and helen bryner have one child,a daughter born in.it appears helen has at least two other,older children from a previous relationship who also lived with the couple at one time.in,charles was convicted of molesting one of these other children and sent to state prison around this same time,helen began receiving aid to families with dependent children in merced county for their daughter.
in,the county filed a complaint against charles for ongoing child support and reimbursement of the public assistance already paid on the daughter behalf.a default judgment was entered against charles,but the court reserved jurisdiction to determine the amounts.in,the court ordered charles to pay per month in child support and an additional per month toward arrearages then totalling.these amounts were based on the pretense charles had a regular,job in prison paying the minimum wage.
in august of,the county filed an order to show cause for modification of the existing support order.it alleged charles,who was still in prison,was in arrears as of the end of june,and owed an additional in accumulated interest.in a responsive declaration,charles reported he was earning cents an hour in the prison laundry and had a net monthly income of only,less expenses of.charles also filed a motion seeking appointment of counsel.
these matters came to a hearing in november.the county explained its purpose in seeking the support modification was to reduce charles obligation to zero in keeping with our decision in vargas,which had been filed the previous march helen appeared at the hearing to oppose any reduction.charles did not appear,either in person or by telephone.the court stated it was familiar with vargas,but explained it was inclined nonetheless to impute some kind of earning capacity under these circumstances,where the noncustodial parent incarceration was related to an act that was against the child or one of the children living with the parties.it continued the hearing to permit charles to address this particular issue.
the court denied charles request for counsel subject to reconsideration because it found it had no authority to appoint counsel under the circumstances.
the continued hearing was held on january.charles did not appear.he had filed a declaration following the november hearing,but it did not address the specific issue raised by the court according to its subsequent order,the court found an exception to the vargas case in that the crime for which defendant is incarcerated was committed against this family.capitalization omitted.the exception evidently was based on a theory of estoppel.the court therefore refused to reduce charles child support obligation,but rather continued the existing order requiring him to pay per month.it ordered that interest would not accrue on the arrearages,nor would charles be required to pay them,until his release from custody.charles appealed.we subsequently denied his request for appointment of counsel on appeal.
for purposes of the following discussion,we refer to the counties collectively and consider their arguments together.
discussion 
i.our vargas decision 
california has implemented a statewide uniform guideline for determining child support according to a complex algebraic formula based on the parents incomes and custodial time with the child,et see generally hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group et.the formula amount is rebuttably presumed to be correct the court may depart from it only upon a finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that one of five enumerated factors pertains.these factors generally apply in situations where application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case,subd.b,consistent with certain principles set out in section.the principles recognize,among other things,that a parent primary obligation is to support his or her minor children,that the interests of children are the state top priority,and that e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.
thus,the court no longer has the broad discretion in ordering child support it had prior to adoption of the support guideline in.in re marriage of carter th,d.the determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion the trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.in re marriage of butler gill th,d see also in re marriage of drake th,d.
among other things,the statute gives the court the discretion,in applying the guideline formula,to impute income to a parent based on his or her earning capacity,in lieu of considering the parent actual income,subd.b.historically,prior to adoption of the guideline,the exercise of this discretion was limited to situations where the parent was found to be deliberately shirking family responsibilities by refusing to seek or accept gainful employment.in re marriage of hinman th,d in re marriage of regnery d.no such limitation exists under the present scheme,however.in re marriage of hinman,supra,th at,d in re marriage of padilla th,d.while deliberate avoidance of family responsibilities is a significant factor in the decision to consider earning capacity citation,the statute explicitly authorizes consideration of earning capacity in all cases,consistent with the child best interests.in re marriage of ilas th,d see also moss superior court cal th,d.
although the guideline expanded the circumstances under which the court may consider a parent earning capacity,it did not change the accepted meaning of the term.
earning capacity is composed of the ability to work,including such factors as age,occupation,skills,education,health,background,work experience and qualifications the willingness to work exemplified through good faith efforts,due diligence and meaningful attempts to secure employment and an opportunity to work which means an employer who is willing to hire.citations.when the ability to work or the opportunity to work is lacking,earning capacity is absent and application of the standard is inappropriate.when the payor is unwilling to pay and the other two factors are present,the court may apply the earnings capacity standard to deter the shirking of one family obligations.in re marriage of regnery,supra,d at.
thus,the only limitations against imputing income to an unemployed or underemployed parent is where the parent in fact has no earning capacity or relying on earning capacity would not be consistent with the children best interests.in re marriage of hinman,supra,th at,d.
the opportunity to work exists when there is substantial evidence of a reasonable likelihood that a party could,with reasonable effort,apply his or her education,skills and training to produce income.in re marriage of cohn th,d.f igures for earning capacity can not be drawn from thin air they must have some tangible evidentiary foundation.id.at,d.to calculate support based on the hypothetical procurement of a job which the evidence showed was not available to the parent would effectively write the opportunity element of earning capacity out of existence.id.at,d.
in consideration of these principles,we held in vargas that a court may not impute income to an incarcerated parent in the absence of evidence he or she has both the ability and the opportunity to work in prison.
in our opinion,regnery and its progeny dictate that both elements of the earning capacity standard must be satisfied regardless of the situation in which it is applied.if either element is not established,earning capacity can not be substituted for actual income.thus,if appellant does not have an opportunity to work,whether in prison or not,the earning capacity test is not satisfied and can not be used to determine his child support payments.in so holding,we are not unmindful of the policy arguments that can be made to support an opposite result for incarcerated parents.nor are we unaware of jurisdictions that have found parents liable for child support despite their lack of earning capacity during incarceration.but unlike most courts,we are here confronted with a threshold test that clearly must be satisfied before earning capacity can be used furthermore,we emphasize that our holding today in no way suggests that incarcerated parents are exempt from child support.rather,we simply decline to carve an exception to the rule that before earning capacity can be applied,its definition must first be satisfied.as with any other parent,the court must determine whether an incarcerated parent has the ability and the opportunity to work before using earning capacity to assess child support payments.state of oregon vargas,supra,th at,d.
further,the determination must be based on the parent current circumstances.it is not enough that the parent had a job prior to incarceration,or is likely to return to work upon release.ibid.accordingly,we remanded the matter to the trial court to determine whether the parent had assets,income,or employment opportunities in prison with which to meet his support obligation.
in the three cases now before us we are asked to create a public policy exception to the rule we stated in vargas.this exception would allow the trial court to do what we plainly said in vargas it could not do hold an incarcerated parent liable for ongoing child support even though he or she lacks the capacity to earn money in prison and has no other financial assets.the court presumably could invoke the exception whenever it found the parent offense was such that he or she was not deserving of relief from an existing,preincarceration support order.the counties argue the exception should have been applied in the present cases because the victim was a child for whom support was owed polston,the victim was an unrelated child living in the same household bryner,or the crime was particularly heinous smith.
this an incarcerated parent should not benefit from his criminal conduct at his child a shorthand statement of the rationale that has been adopted by the courts of some other states in holding that incarceration is not a sufficient justification for modifying an existing support order the no justification rule they analogize incarceration to voluntary unemployment.one court has stated the rule more fully as follows.a parent can not,by intentional conduct or mere irresponsibility,seek relief from this duty of support.defendant,who by his own wrongful conduct placed himself in a position that he is no longer available for gainful employment,is not entitled to relief from his obligation to support his child.incarceration was a foreseeable result of his criminal conduct and is thus deemed a voluntary act in and of itself.richardson ballard ohio app d,see also mooney brennan,willis willis.
the no justification rule,and the alternative approaches taken by other states,all have been applied to the entire class of incarcerated parents,not only to those who have committed certain types of crimes.for a general review of the different approaches,see halliwell halliwell,matter of marriage of thurmond,loss of income due to incarceration as affecting child support obligation.we acknowledged the existence of the no justification rule in vargas and,for the reasons set out in the passage quoted above,we declined to apply it.to the extent we are now being asked to change our position,we decline once again.
some other states have taken the position incarceration is one of several factors a court may consider in determining a parent support obligation the one factor rule.see,in re marriage of burbridge d,thomasson johnson,in re marriage of hamilton.but no court,at least so far as we have been able to determine,has ever said an incarcerated parent with no assets or earning capacity may nevertheless be denied relief from an existing support order solely because,for example,he committed a crime against his own child.
the counties cite us to two cases where the father was incarcerated for sexually abusing his daughter or stepdaughter.however,in neither case did the nature of the father crime factor into the court decision.in knight kn
