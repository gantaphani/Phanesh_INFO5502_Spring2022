background 
on june,enrique was with athena at a shopping mall.she yelled at him and screamed obscenities,threw food at him,shook him,and hit him in the face.when a witness confronted her,athena said,this is my kid and i can do whatever i want.the police were called and took enrique to polinsky children center polinsky,an emergency shelter operated by the san diego county health and human services agency agency a physical examination of enrique revealed that he had been physically abused.
on june,athena left several telephone messages for the agency social worker assigned to the case,asking when she could pick up enrique.she went to polinsky and made the same inquiry.a staff member at polinsky apparently telephoned the social worker,who spoke with athena.athena seemed not to understand the social worker repeated explanations that the social worker had to discuss the allegations with athena.the social worker suggested that athena visit enrique and that she come to the social worker office the following morning.athena said she would try.the social worker offered to go to athena home,but athena said she had just moved and that she did not know her address.
on june,athena went to the social worker office.she still did not understand why enrique had been taken into custody.athena denied that she had hit enrique,but admitted that she had spanked him on the shoulder and buttock.she characterized her actions as discipline for enrique throwing a fit and having a smart mouth,but acknowledged that enrique could say only mommy,hi,and bye.she said,i am probably going to end up on the mental ward because of this.
on june,the agency filed a dependency petition alleging that athena had shaken enrique and struck him in the face with her hand.athena did not appear at the detention hearing.
at a supervised visit on july,athena initially did not recognize enrique.enrique did not respond to athena at first,but later during the visit,he cried and did not want to let her go.athena stated that enrique was like a ball and chain.she screamed at him and said that his stay in foster care might teach him a lesson.
at a visit on july,athena grabbed enrique and forcefully kissed him.he cried and squirmed out of her grasp.athena said she believed it was acceptable for her to hit enrique if he cried or acted up,and insisted repeatedly that she had done nothing wrong.athena talked about the dependency case in enrique presence,used foul language,and displayed rapid mood swings.
athena appeared in court on july,the date set for the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.the court appointed counsel for her and continued the matter to august.
athena failed to appear for a july visit.afterward,she left a telephone message for the social worker apologizing for having missed the visit and saying that she would call back.
on august,athena appeared in court with her appointed counsel.counsel requested that the court appoint a guardian ad litem for athena,saying that it would assist him in effectively representing her.the court granted the request.the court noted that athena had not been arraigned.counsel responded that he could not effectively arraign her.the court scheduled a settlement conference for september and a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing for september,and ordered athena to return for both hearings.
after the august hearing,athena had no further contact with the agency for more than a year.she did not appear for hearings,visit enrique,or respond to telephone calls,letters,or visits to her last known address.
on september,the court denied athena counsel request for a continuance.it entered a true finding on the petition and removed enrique from athena custody.
on may,enrique maternal grandmother,debrah,telephoned social worker richard estrada.debrah told estrada that athena had asked her to call and inquire whether enrique was going to be adopted.estrada informed debrah of the june review hearing,asked her to inform athena of the date of the hearing,and inquired regarding how athena was doing.debrah said that in february,athena brother had told debrah that athena was dying.debrah said that she picked up athena from athena father home in san diego and took her to rancho springs medical center in riverside.debrah told estrada that athena had tuberculosis,that she was still quarantined in the hospital,and that she probably would not be released any time soon.debrah said she thought athena had been in a rehabilitation program in tijuana before she was hospitalized.on june,estrada attempted to contact athena at the hospital.hospital personnel told him that athena had not been there for a couple of weeks.
at the june review hearing,the court denied athena counsel request for a continuance and set a welfare and institutions code section hearing for october.on june,athena guardian ad litem filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition challenging the june order.in july,athena counsel in the writ proceeding notified this court that there were no viable issues for writ review,and on july,this court dismissed the writ proceeding.
on august,athena was personally served with notice of the october section hearing.she appeared in court on october.her attorney asked that the guardian ad litem be relieved.counsel stated,i took some extra time this morning and spoke with athena about the case history,the consequences in general,and she understands the basics of what is going on.she,of course,has her own view of the evidence and of what she prefers the outcome to be.as far as being a client who can effectively participate with her lawyer,she is fine.
the guardian ad litem agreed that he should be relieved.he said,i have spoken to athena this morning.she quite different than when i last had contact with her,which was really back at the beginning of the case.she is focused.her answers are appropriate.they are relevant.i really do see any reason why she would need a guardian ad litem to assist her in dealing with her attorney at this time.i think she is fully capable of assisting counsel with her case.the guardian ad litem also said that he had asked athena about her tuberculosis,and that she told him she was on medication and being followed by some form of health services.
based on the statements of counsel and the guardian ad litem,the court found that athena no longer required a guardian ad litem.it relieved the guardian ad litem,set a november pretrial conference and a december contested section hearing,and ordered athena to return to court on november.
athena had two supervised visits with enrique in late october.a third visit was scheduled for early november.enrique maternal grandfather called the social worker to ask that the visit be rescheduled.the social worker left two telephone messages for athena,but athena never returned the calls.she did,however,appear in court on november.she had a visit with enrique in early december,and attended the december section hearing.
athena appeal is procedurally proper 
the agency raises three procedural arguments.first,it asserts that athena has abandoned her appeal by failing to raise any contentions concerning the termination of her parental rights.second,it argues that she has forfeited her right to object to the appointment of the guardian ad litem because she did not object below.third,it claims she did not file a timely notice of appeal from the appointment order.the courts in in re joann th,d and in re jessica th,d rejected similar arguments regarding forfeiture and timeliness.
in in re joann,supra,th at pages,d,the court appointed a guardian ad litem for the grandmother,who had been joann guardian ad litem,in march or april,before the jurisdictional hearing had concluded.the appeal was from the december dispositional order.id.at,d.the social services agency argued that the grandmother challenge to the
