in this opinion,we consider the formula for determining when parents should be considered partial dependents of their adult children living at home,for purposes of recovering death benefits.we conclude that the deceased must provide a net financial benefit to the household,deducting first those costs attributable solely to the deceased.
when a worker dies with no dependents,the employer is required by labor code section,subdivision a to pay an equivalent death benefit to the department of industrial relations dir for addition to the subsequent injuries fund sif see subd.c.the amount paid to dir is equal to the death benefit paid when the deceased leaves one person totally dependent and no partial dependents,currently set at by section,subdivision a.
in this case,an unmarried worker living with his parents died from industrial causes.his parents elected not to pursue a claim that they were dependent upon him.however,the employer filed a dependency claim on their behalf.the workers compensation appeals board board agreed with the employer that,by paying lori and lawrence walker per month as rent,joshua walker made them his dependents.the board awarded the walkers a partial dependency award of,four times the annual rent.it then ordered that dir take nothing,permitting the carrier to save.
we conclude that the board analyzed dependency incorrectly and for that reason discounted compelling evidence that the per month rent did not fully reimburse the walkers for joshua food.we annul the board decision.
facts and procedural history 
joshua was when he died from industrial causes.at the time,he was working for contemporary,jrw,a furniture manufacturer.he had always lived at home and when he turned,he began paying per month as rent.he made his own car payments and reimbursed his parents for car insurance because his car was covered by their policy.he was also covered by their health insurance and they paid his for him.were at most per year.after joshua was injured and went into the hospital,the household food bill went down by to per week.
before the walkers purchased their house,they rented it.they took joshua rent into consideration when they decided to purchase the house in and they counted on his payments to help them make the mortgage payments.however,their standard of living did not change financially when they stopped receiving his payments.
although the walkers originally submitted a death benefit claim,they asked the board to dismiss it.jrw objected to dismissal of the walker application and filed its own claim on the walkers behalf.the board allowed the claim to proceed and jrw to make dependency arguments for the walkers.
after hearing,the workers compensation judge wcj found that the walkers were partially dependent upon joshua because his rent helped them purchase their home.pursuant to section,subdivision a,she awarded them,calculated at four times his annual rent.the board denied the dir petition for reconsideration,and this petition followed.we granted writ of review.based upon our review of the record,we annul the board decision.
the dir arguments 
citing several supreme court cases,some recent and some from the,the dir contends that the board applied the wrong standard for dependency when it found the walkers were partial dependents even though joshua made no net financial contribution to their household.dir asserts the wcj and board erroneously took into account the rent paid without deducting the amount devoted to joshua own support.
discussion 
when an injured worker dies,any accrued or unpaid compensation is paid to his or her dependents.if there are no dependents,these funds are distributed with the worker estate.the employer is also liable for reasonable burial expenses,not to exceed,and for a death benefit,to be allowed to the dependents when the employee leaves any person dependent upon him or her for support.section sets the death benefit amount.if the worker left one total dependent and no partial dependents,the death benefit is,subd.a.if the worker left only partial dependents,the amount of the benefit is four times the amount annually devoted to the support of the partial dependents but in no case more than,subd.a.section governs allocation of the death benefit when there are two or more dependents.it provides that in the case of only partial dependents,the amount allowed as a death benefit shall be divided among the persons so partially dependent in proportion to the relative extent of their dependency.
if an employee dies without any surviving dependent,section,subdivision a dictates that the employer shall pay a sum to the department of industrial relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children.that amount is set at by section,subdivision a.the amount is to be deposited in the general fund and credited as a payment into the sif 
none of these code sections defines dependency,but the wording of section,subdivision a suggests its meaning it defines the partial dependency benefit as four times the amount devoted to the support of the partial dependents.
division one of this court has proffered the following definition,taken from the dictionary and from treatises generally speaking,a dependent is one who relies on another for support.citation.webster defines dependent as one who is sustained by another,or who relies on another for support or favor.citations.campbell on workmen compensation ed.section,pages states dependency is a present,existing relation between two persons where the one is sustained by,or relies on,the aid of the other for his means of living.this does not mean absolute dependency for the necessities of life,but rather that the dependent looks to and relies upon the contributions of the injured employee in whole or in part as a means of supporting and maintaining such dependent in accordance with his accustomed mode of life.dependency within the meaning of the act involves the idea of a present,current reliance upon the decedent for support.citations.industrial indem.industrial acc.com.d.
much of the case law on dependency in the workers compensation setting arises under sections and.section provides that a child under or one over that age who is physically or mentally unable to earn shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon a parent with whom he or she was living.section provides that in all other cases questions of entire or partial dependency shall be determined in accordance with the facts as they exist at the time of the injury of the employee.
many of the concepts in the current death benefit statutes were a part of the original workers compensation act,adopted in.originally,the partial disability award was calculated at three times the annual amount devoted by the deceased to the support of the dependents.stats,ch,c.the concepts and much of the wording of this part of the act were continued in its rewrite.stats,ch.the formula then changed from three times to times annual support in stats,ch,and to four times annual support in.stats,ch.
the supreme court addressed the version in spreckles industrial acc.com.cal.that decision demonstrates partial dependency in its simplest form,receiving money and providing nothing in return.the deceased in that case at first provided per month,the sole support for his paralyzed brother and the brother family.by the time of the accident,the decedent brother wife had secured a teaching position,and the decedent reduced his support to per month.the supreme court simply held that the per annum amount used to compute the benefit paid to the brother and his family should be based upon the per month rate at the time of death,not the total amount provided by the decedent during the previous year.the whole theory of the compensation act as to death cases is that the dependents of the employee killed through some hazard of his employment shall be compensated for the loss of the support they were receiving from him at the time of his injury.id.at.
