anthony father appeals from a order terminating his parental rights as to his son.he contends the alameda county social services agency the agency failed to investigate his native american heritage and provide adequate notice to tribes as required by the indian child welfare act.et.icwa.the agency does not dispute that it violated icwa inquiry and notice requirements.instead it raises numerous procedural and equitable arguments against reversal that all turn on father participation and conduct in these proceedings.none of the agency arguments excuses its failure to comply with icwa or allow this court to affirm the termination of father parental rights without icwa compliance.although reversal will further delay and complicate permanent placement with his prospective adoptive family,the agency icwa violations require us to conditionally reverse the order terminating parental rights and direct the juvenile court to ensure compliance with icwa inquiry and notice requirements.
background 
the background of this proceeding from the removal of and his sister from their parents care in through the order terminating both parents reunification services and setting a permanency planning hearing welf,is set forth in our prior opinion denying the parents petitions to vacate that hearing superior court april,nonpub.opn.we incorporate that discussion by reference here.in this appeal,we will restrict our statement of facts to those bearing on the adequacy of the icwa notices.
mother does not claim any indian heritage.but an attachment to the initial dependency petition noted that father had told the agency that and his sister might have indian ancestry.the detention report filed on october,said that father believed he had creek heritage,was gathering more information regarding tribal affiliation,and would inform the agency when he knew more.father signed a parental notification of indian status form stating he was or might be affiliated with the choctaw creek tribe or the choctaw creek tribe of oklahoma.the agency subsequently filed a notice of child custody proceeding for indian child icwa form.the icwa form sent to various creek and choctaw tribes stated father name and birth date and his mother name,address,and telephone number.it provided no information about paternal grandfather,or any other relatives.the notice stated there had been a judicial declaration of parentage and that father acknowledged he was biological father.
in an addendum report filed on january,in connection with the jurisdictional proceedings,the agency stated that letters received from various tribes indicated was not a member of any tribe and that icwa did not apply.the juvenile court sustained the dependency petition and ordered the agency to provide reunification services to both parents.
a hearing on the month and month review began on january,and was conducted over months.the court found the parents were afforded reasonable reunification services,but they had made minimal progress toward alleviating the causes for the children placement.reunification services were terminated and the court set a section hearing for april,with adoption as the permanent plan.on march,the court denied a section modification petition filed by a paternal uncle requesting that sister be placed with him.
both parents petitioned to this court to vacate the order setting the section hearing,and we denied their petitions on the merits.on april,the juvenile court terminated both parents rights as to sister.her foster parents wished to adopt her and were also open to integrating into their family.dependency case was extended for another six months while efforts were made to transition him from his placement at the lincoln children center to his prospective adoptive home.he was placed with the foster parents on may.
section hearing was held on june.the foster parents remained committed to adopting him and his sister.the court found that was likely to be adopted and terminated parental rights.
father filed a notice of appeal the same day,and identified both the june order and the april order that terminated his parental rights as to sister.on july,the family court granted father request to eliminate his child support for,retroactive to june in a prior order,we dismissed as untimely father appeal from the april order terminating his parental rights as to sister.
discussion 
father sole contention is that the order terminating his parental rights as to must be reversed because the agency did not provide notice as required under icwa.although the agency strenuously contested this appeal,it does not dispute that it failed to comply with icwa inquiry and notice requirements.instead,it raises a battery of contentions that arise out of a theory that father has renounced his paternal rights and worked a fraud on the family and juvenile courts.the agency also says the appeal is barred by res judicata and,in any event,that reversal is not required because its icwa violations were not prejudicial.these arguments are long on novelty,but short on merit.we are reluctant to impose further delay before this young child may finally gain permanence and stability in an adoptive family.unfortunately,the agency unexplained failure to follow the law leaves us with no choice.we therefore order a limited reversal and require the agency to fulfill its duties,as it should have done long ago.
i.the notice and inquiry violations 
icwa protects the interests of indian children and promotes the stability and security of indian tribes by establishing minimum standards for,and permitting tribal participation in,dependency actions.et in re holly th.if there is reason to believe a child that is the subject of a dependency proceeding is an indian child,icwa requires that the child indian tribe be notified of the proceeding and its right to intervene.a see also welf,subd.b 
notice is a key component of the congressional goal to protect and preserve indian tribes and indian families.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under the act irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.specifically,the tribe has the right to obtain jurisdiction over the proceedings by transfer to the tribal court or may intervene in the state court proceedings.without notice,these important rights granted by the act would become meaningless.in re kahlen d.
accordingly,federal and state law require that the notice sent to the potentially concerned tribes include available information about the maternal and paternal grandparents and,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates place of birth and death current and former addresses tribal enrollment numbers and other identifying data.in re francisco th,in re mary th.to fulfill its responsibility,the agency has an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire about,and if possible obtain,this information.in re th,subd.a c d rule a.thus,a social worker who knows or has reason to know the child is indian is required to make further inquiry regarding the possible indian status of the child,and to do so as soon as practicable,by interviewing the parents,indian custodian,and extended family members to gather the information required in paragraph of subdivision a of section,subd.c.that information shall include a ll names known of the indian child biological parents,grandparents,and,or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases,as well as their current and former addresses,birthdates,places of birth and death,tribal enrollment numbers,and any other identifying information,if known,subd.a c.because of their critical importance,icwa notice requirements are strictly construed.in re robert th.
here,the icwa notices stated mother name and birth date,father name,former address and birth date,and his mother name and address.no information regarding other relatives was provided.instead,the spaces in the notice form for information about the maternal grandparents,paternal grandfather,paternal and maternal great grandparents,and aunts,uncles,siblings,cousins,stepparents,and other relatives were either marked no inform
