phillip stanley wolfe phillip and joyce davis wolfe joyce separated in may,following an marriage.phillip appeals from the august,judgment of dissolution following trial on the property issues.he argues the court erred in dividing equally the equity line debt reimbursing joyce for separate property payments toward daily living expenses incurred during the first six months of reimbursing joyce for her share of community funds spent on the community property ranch during the marriage and reimbursing joyce for her share of community funds spent on phillip separate parcel during the marriage.we modify the judgment by striking the phillip was ordered to reimburse the community for payment of property taxes on his separate parcel,and affirm the judgment as modified.
factual and procedural background 
evidence at trial revealed that phillip and joyce maintained separate and community property bank accounts during their marriage.the court found it difficult to trace separate property contributions over a period of nearly years.however,it found that at the time of separation,phillip and joyce held as community property a single family residence in newcastle,and a vineyard near fresno which they referred to as the ranch.phillip owned real property adjacent to the vineyard as his separate property.
during the marriage,phillip and joyce established a line of credit secured by a second deed of trust to build a swimming pool at the newcastle residence.in march,they owed more than on the loan.on april,a month before filing for dissolution,joyce paid off the credit line debt with separate property funds from her business savings account.the source of the funds in that account was a gift from her mother.
in june,after filing for dissolution,joyce asked the bank to freeze the line of credit.she was concerned she would be required to pay it off whether she had it or not.the bank refused the request,explaining that the money was available to both parties.at that point,joyce withdrew the entire,and deposited it into her separate savings account.joyce used approximately to repay the separate property funds she used to pay off the line of credit in april.in september,joyce gave phillip of the on stipulation that it be used exclusively to harvest the raisin crop at the fresno ranch.
joyce kept the equity loan maxed out to keep from having it taken while she continued to make payments.the loan balance on the equity line,plus in interest,was repaid in escrow on the sale of the newcastle residence a year before trial.
in the first part of,the community paid in expenses for the fresno ranch.however,phillip kept at least of the harvest income for himself.during the same period,the community paid in taxes and in improvements on the adjoining land phillip held as his separate property.in addition,joyce used of her separate funds to pay community expenses,when the community ran out of money in the first half of.
the court issued a tentative decision on may.it found that,in general,the credibility of joyce was sound,and the credibility of phillip quite suspect in many regards.the court listed the credit line as a community debt to be divided equally between phillip and joyce.it also ordered phillip to reimburse joyce for of the she had advanced him from equity line proceeds to harvest the raisin crop the in separate funds used to pay community expenses the in community funds used to pay ranch expenses and in community funds used to pay for taxes and improvements on phillip separate property.
the court adopted the tentative decision as its statement of decision,and entered judgment on august.phillip moved for new trial,which was denied by operation of law.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
community funds spent on phillip separate property 
phillip contends the court erred in ordering him to reimburse joyce for her share of community funds used to pay taxes and install a drip irrigation system on his separate real property.we agree the court erred in ordering phillip to reimburse the community for funds used to pay his property taxes,but conclude the drip irrigation system was an improvement for which reimbursement was justified.
absent an agreement to the contrary,the use of community funds to improve the separate property of one spouse does not alter the character of the separate property.in re marriage of camire d.camire in re marriage of jafeman d.jafeman.before the series of statutory amendments which began in,husbands had exclusive management and control of community property.former,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,in re marriage of gowdy d,fn.courts presumed that if a husband expended community funds to improve his wife separate property,it was a gift.if,however,a husband used community funds to improve his separate property,the community was entitled to reimbursement.jafeman,supra,at.the courts reasoned that when the husband exercised his power as manager of the community funds to improve his own separate property,recoupment by the community was necessary in order to avoid constructive fraud against the wife.ibid.the camire court explained in that the rule was required to protect the wife from diminution of properties under the control of the husband.camire,supra,at.acknowledging the change in law which gave management and control of community assets to either spouse former,now family code,the court nonetheless preserved the gift presumption,concluding that the traditional rule of law which denies either apportionment or reimbursement for community contribution to a wife separate property had not been overruled.camire,supra,at.
joyce offers two arguments in response to phillip claim the gift presumption applies to the use of community funds to improve his separate property.first,joyce argues the rationale of camire and jafeman is unsound in light of the current state of the law regarding management and control of community assets.she says the same rule of reimbursement should apply whenever community funds are used by one spouse to improve the separate property of the other spouse.joyce asserts that t he outmoded,sexist rationale that women are unable to protect themselves can not,in the century,serve as a basis for allowing one spouse to profit at the expense of the other.
in her second argument,joyce maintains that there is no meaningful difference between community funds used for property improvement such as installation of a drip irrigation system,and community funds used for property acquisition such as mortgage payments.both result in an increase in equity which the community should share.joyce emphasizes that family code section,which authorizes reimbursement for separate property contributions to the acquisition of community property,includes payments for improvements in its definition of c ontributions to the acquisition of the property.
we agree there is no logical basis for denying a spouse reimbursement for a improvement to the other spouse separate property.the rule we is,the presumption of a gift in those also outside the mainstream of community property principles applied in other american jurisdictions.it is a california invention,though not one in which we should take pride,cobbled together from misunderstood doctrine and miscited cases.
as joyce points out,california courts do not presume a gift when community funds are used to contribute to the purchase or reduce an encumbrance on a separate asset.indeed,in such a circumstance,our courts recognize a interest irrespective of the status of title.in re marriage of moore cal d,moore in re marriage of branco th,d branco.there may be principled reasons for distinguishing between improvements and community contributions to equity,but there are no cases explaining why the distinction supports a gift presumption as to improvements.
the most compelling cases concerning the gift presumption are those explaining why a gift should not be presumed when a spouse applies community property to improve his or her own property.however,explaining a rule exceptions provides no support for its general application.other community property jurisdictions do not presume a gift under such circumstances.consistent with spanish law
