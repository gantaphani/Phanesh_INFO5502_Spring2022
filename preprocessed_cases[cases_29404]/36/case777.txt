after placing a dependent child in the home of her grandparents on an emergency basis,the alameda county social services agency agency discovered that the grandfather had a criminal history rendering the home ineligible as a formal relative placement.welf.the agency moved the child from the grandparents home and filed a petition under section,while grandfather sought a criminal history exemption that would have allowed the home to be considered as a placement,subd.d.this exemption request was ultimately denied by the agency.
in an unfortunately protracted and possibly unnecessary proceeding under section,the juvenile court reviewed the propriety of the move from the grandparents home and the agency decision to deny the grandfather criminal records exemption.after a series of hearings over months,the court dismissed the agency section petition and ordered the child placed with her grandparents.the agency appeals,arguing that the placement order was unauthorized in light of the grandfather unexempted criminal history,and that the juvenile court should have granted the section petition.the agency also argues that the court exceeded its authority by ordering reunification services and transportation assistance to facilitate the transition to the grandparents home that it erred when it found reasonable services had not been provided to the child and that it should have identified a permanent plan for the child.
we agree with the agency that the juvenile court erred in dismissing the section petition and ordering the child placed with the grandparents.in light of this conclusion,the order requiring the agency to provide reunification services and transportation assistance must also be set aside.
factual and procedural background 
initial maintenance plan 
was born in july to father and mother,each of whom has a long history of criminal activity and substance abuse.the parents have six other children,all of whom were living outside the home,and some of whom had been the subjects of juvenile dependency proceedings.
the agency filed a dependency petition alleging that both mother and had tested positive for opiates and alcohol at birth that mother had a history of polysubstance abuse and that the parents other children were living outside the home due to the parents drug use,criminal activities and incarcerations.on august,the juvenile court declared a dependent under section,subdivisions b and j,and placed her in the custody of her parents under a family maintenance plan,subd.b.
according to the status report prepared by the agency for the january review hearing,the parents had to leave their home and were looking for other housing while living with relatives when they can.by the time of the july status hearing,the family had moved into the home of paternal grandparents,grandmother and grandfather.in october,the parents agreed to continue drug testing and treatment and to continue residing with the grandparents as a condition of retaining in their care.
section petition removing from the parents custody 
on december,the agency filed a supplemental petition under section,alleging that the parents had not complied with drug treatment and testing requirements that they were no longer living with the paternal grandparents and that father had been incarcerated in san quentin prison for theft and drug possession the detention report filed by the agency advised the court that had been taken from the custody of her parents on december,and was allowed to remain in her grandparents home after social worker eddy herrera approved an emergency relative placement.the report stated that the grandparents home will be assessed for relative approval by herrera,and t here is a relative who is able,approved,and willing to care for the child ren.on december,the grandfather signed a criminal records statement under penalty of perjury in which he denied having been convicted of a crime in california or another jurisdiction.
at the detention hearing on december,the court removed from her parents custody and c ommitted her to the care,custody and control of the agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution.it also adopted certain findings in the detention report,which included the statement,there is a relative who is able,approved,and willing to care for the child ren.
the agency filed a report on the section petition reiterating that had been placed with her grandparents in a relative emergency placement.the report stated that was doing well in her the home of her grandparents,with whom she appeared comfortable and bonded.it characterized the placement as being in the home of an approved relative versus an approved nonrelative extended family member,a licensed foster parent,or a licensed emergency foster parent the other preprinted boxes that could have been checked in that section of the report.
a combined hearing was held on the section petition on january.the court set aside the previous order placing with her parents,denied them reunification services,and the set the case for a section hearing on may,to select a permanent plan.was c omitted to the care,custody and control of the agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution,and the court adopted findings from the agency report that characterized her current placement as being with an approved relative.the order also stated that visitation with the grandparents was appropriate and was to be arranged at the discretion of the agency.
live scan results grandfather criminal history 
as part of the process for approving the grandparents home for placement,the agency conducted a live scan to investigate their criminal history although the grandmother had no criminal history,the grandfather rap sheet revealed the following a conviction for petty theft a conviction for driving at an unsafe speed a conviction for driving with a suspended license a conviction for reckless driving a conviction for malicious a conviction for resisting arrest a conviction for possession of a controlled substance a conviction for possession of a controlled substance and various other arrests,including one for domestic violence in february.under state law,the grandfather convictions disqualified him as a placement for unless he obtained a criminal records exemption from the agency.see,subd.d.
second section petition and removal of from grandparents home 
on march,the agency filed a supplemental section petition alleging that the grandparents were unable to safely care for in that both of them had used drugs while she was living in their home and the grandmother had been diagnosed with a mental health condition that had prevented her from becoming a caretaker for a sibling of who was declared a dependent in contra costa county.the petition further alleged,approximately four months ago,the paternal grandparents were advised that the paternal grandfather must submit to a standard exemption in order for the home to be cleared for placement.for the past four months,the paternal grandfather has not cooperated with the exemption process.
the detention report filed in connection with the section petition indicated that had been taken into protective custody on march,and placed in a licensed foster home.it explained,on,a making meeting was held for the purpose of consideration for a change in placement.the primary concern centered around the placement that could not be approved in the home of the paternal grandparents in that the child was placed only on an emergency basis in december.to explain,initially the child was placed with the parents under the condition that they remain in the home of the paternal grandparents,in addition to other requirements set forth in their case plan.about seventeen months after the order,the child was removed from the care of the parents,yet she was allowed to remain in the home of the paternal grandparents.fast forward to early december to date,the paternal grandfather was informed that he must fulfill the process for a standard exemption based on his criminal record however,he never did.in addition,the agency received information from a worker in contra costa county alleging ongoing substance abuse by the paternal grandparents,as well as mental health issues on behalf of the paternal grandmother.last month,the primary worker,jenaiah jones,witnessed concerns about the grandparents behavior,particularly the paternal grandmother during a recent home visit 
on march,the court found a prima facie case that removal was necessary.on april,the agency filed an amended supplemental section petition deleting the allegations that the grandparents had used drugs.the grandparents,who sought to have returned to their home,were granted de facto parent status in may.
first phase of hearing on section petition 
the first portion of the contested hearing on the amended supplemental section petition was held over several days between june and october,while the hearing under section initially set for may,was continued.the following evidence was presented on the section petition 
social worker eddy herrera 
eddy herrera was the social worker responsible for the placement of with the grandparents after she was detained outside her parents custody in early december.he testified that although grandfather had signed a document on december,indicating that he had no criminal history,grandfather had told herrera that he had some minor indiscretions years ago.on december,herrera did an initial check of the grandparents criminal history using clets california law enforcement telecommunications system and caci child abuse central index,which revealed no hits.based on this information,he approved placement in the grandparents home on an emergency basis.
before herrera could approve the grandparents home for a more permanent placement,a live scan based on their fingerprints was required.the scan revealed that the grandfather had nine criminal convictions between and,and an arrest for spousal abuse in.herrera advised the grandfather that his convictions disqualified him as a placement for unless he obtained a criminal records exemption from the agency.see,subd.d.grandfather hired an attorney to assist in this process,but had difficulty obtaining records from some of the older cases,which dated from the and.herrera believed the grandfather had been cooperative in gathering what information he could,but it was also difficult for the agency to obtain these records,which came from different jurisdictions.the exemption application had not yet been resolved because the agency was still gathering information from other jurisdictions.
social worker rachael sims 
social worker rachael sims testified that could not be returned to the grandparents home because a criminal exemption had not been granted and the home had not,therefore,been approved.in her opinion,the document the grandfather had submitted to explain his criminal history as part of the exemption process did not show insight sims questioned whether the home was safe,given that the grandfather had been arrested in for domestic violence against the grandmother.
sims also had concerns about the grandmother mental health.she had spoken to a social worker in contra costa county who thought the grandmother was delusional.on the day of the detention hearing on the section petition,the grandmother had told sims that she could not recall whether she had been diagnosed with a mental illness or had received mental health treatment.the grandmother also left sims a series of incomplete phone messages about pediatrician that were of concern.sims acknowledged that there were no signs the grandparents had abused,and that hair follicle drug tests had yielded negative results.the grandmother admitted using drugs in the past,but said she had been clean for ten to years.
social worker jenaiah jones 
adoptions worker jenaiah jones had been assigned to case from january to june and had visited the grandparents apartment while was still living there.before one of these visits,the grandmother called her and said they were low on food and diapers,so jones got some gift cards before going over.she called the grandmother when she arrived at the apartment gate and the grandmother said she would come down,but after waiting for about minutes,jones was let inside by another resident and went up to the apartment.the grandmother answered the door wearing sunglasses and said she and had been about to take a nap.
seed social worker benjamin budnitz 
benjamin budnitz was social worker through the agency seed program services to enhance early development and supervised visits between and her grandparents after she was taken from their home.the initial weekly visits were an emotional rollercoaster for,who did not respond well to her grandparents.during later visits,was comforted by having her foster mother in or near the room.
grandmother 
the grandmother testified that had lived with the grandparents for about a year and four months total including the time that the parents were also in the house and that she had no specific concerns about development during that time.she took valium for her nerves in and had received ssi for a nervous condition since,but had never been hospitalized for a psychiatric illness.asked about the incident in which the grandfather had been arrested for domestic violence,the grandmother said that they were having a debate and he had grabbed her arms trying to calm her down.she called the police so they would come out and help them with their debate.
grandfather 
when the grandfather took the stand,he characterized the incident leading to his arrest for domestic violence as a misunderstanding that occurred while he was drinking alcohol and had restrained his wife.he had sought counseling with his pastor and had otherwise been clean and sober for eight to ten years.he had completed a drug program while incarcerated in.the grandfather was willing to adopt the minor if necessary,but did not know what would happen with the parents and thought might return to them if they got themselves straight.
denial of criminal records exemption and separation of grandparents 
in october,while the hearing on the section petition was ongoing,the agency advised the court that grandfather request for a criminal records exemption had been denied.the grandparents sought to challenge this decision as an abuse of discretion,and the court asked the agency to produce the personnel involved in the exemption process at the next hearing.the agency objected to the court review of its denial of the exemption,arguing that the grandparents were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of that decision.the court indicated that it would conduct the review and would not require a section petition to review the agency placement decision.
in december,counsel advised the court that the grandfather had moved out of his home so that the grandmother could obtain custody of counsel stated that grandfather was withdrawing his request for placement,though he would still want custody of if the exemption were ultimately granted.the agency,joined by minor counsel,asked the court to grant the section petition based on grandfather nonexempt criminal history.the court,finding that grandfather had not been dragging his feet at all,stated that the exemption process had been handled extremely poorly.it continued the hearing on the section petition,with the section hearing to trail.
removal of from first foster home 
on december,was removed from the home of her foster mother and moved to the home of nonrelative extended family member the godmother of one of her sisters.the reason for the move was the agency concern that the foster mother had been fabricating the medical symptoms of another child in her care.in a january hearing on the move from the first foster home,the court was highly critical of the agency delay in notifying the court and minor counsel of these concerns,which had arisen before the previous status hearing in case.
further proceedings on section petition 
in a hearing held march,minor counsel advised the court that was doing well in her placement with the second foster mother.minor counsel asked the court to rule on the section petition,indicating that while she did not agree with the agency process,removal from the grandparents home had been the correct result and it was not in best interest to delay the proceedings.the court declined to rule on the section petition,and stated that it would allow additional time for investigation.minor counsel advised the court that if the evidence on the section petition were being reopened,she would want the court to consider whether had received appropriate development care in the grandparents home,given that had later been found eligible for regional center services but had not been evaluated while in the grandparents care.
the continued hearing on the section petition commenced on april,and continued until august.representing the agency,county counsel noted that while the evidence to date had been different than that alleged in the initial petition,the concerns about the grandparents as caretakers was still the same.counsel submitted a memo proposing that the court amend the section petition to conform to proof by alleging that the grandfather had not obtained an exemption for his criminal history and appeared to still live in the home that the grandmother appeared unstable and had panic attacks and that the grandparents had minimized or denied an incident of domestic violence that occurred in february,while was living in the home.minor counsel agreed that the section petition should be sustained,stating that everyone involved in the case had dropped the ball by initially placing with her grandparents.
seed social worker budnitz testified that grandmother had missed several recent visits with for health reasons,had given him medical documentation about her congestive heart failure,and had reported having a panic attack.the grandmother had told budnitz she would like to see go back to her parents,which concerned him because the parents had unresolved substance abuse issues.budnitz noted that had not received regional center services earlier,possibly because the grandparents did not understand her special needs.he did not recommend placement with the grandmother due to her health issues,her failure to demonstrate insight into the domestic violence incident of,her limited understanding of developmental needs,and his suspicion that she was still living with the grandfather,who had an unexempted criminal history.
natalia el sheikh,seed therapist,believed that suffered from an attachment disorder,but was primarily attached to her current foster mother.she thought that if were moved to the grandparents home she might lose the ability to form healthy attachments,though el sheikh could not say with certainty that a change in placement would have a lasting permanent effect.
the grandfather testified that he was living at a home for veterans,not with the grandmother.he had stopped drinking,was working with a psychologist at the veteran administration,and had received counseling from his pastor about the domestic violence incident in.
finally,the court heard the testimony of michelle love,the agency division director who reviewed the grandfather internal appeal from the denial of the criminal records exemption.she had written to grandfather on december,informing him that the appeal was denied because,during our meeting,you continued to minimize your substance abuse history.further,despite having completed a substance abuse program you were unable to discuss the that previously led you to abuse substances and any present coping methods to avoid a recurrence of the same.
love explained that she had looked at the totality of the circumstances when reviewing the grandfather record,including the number of convictions and the inclusion of some acts of violence.she also considered that in his initial application for placement,he claimed not to have had any criminal convictions.in love opinion,the grandfather written explanation of his criminal history did not show insight,and during their interview,he needed to be prompted by the grandmother or his attorney before answering questions.it was difficult for love to get the grandfather to explain the circumstances of his convictions,and he seemed to minimize their seriousness.at this point,the grandfather could request a new hearing on the exemption,but could not seek to further appeal the decision with the agency.
status review hearing no reasonable services to minor 
on june,while the hearing on the section petition was ongoing,the court held a status review hearing and found that the agency had not provided reasonable services to 
juvenile court ruling on second section petition 
on august,the juvenile court dismissed the section petition and ordered placed with the grandparents.it found that was in an existing relative placement with her grandparents when she was moved from their home in march.it stated that the agency characterization of the initial placement with the grandparents as an emergency placement was almost a silly distinction and that the placement had practically morphed into a constructive placement.the court did not find it credible that was at risk in her grandparents home,as evidenced by the fact that the agency did not remove her for two months after learning of grandfather criminal history.it considered the emphasis on the domestic violence arrest to be insulting.
the court stated that it did not matter whether grandfather was still living in the home,because he had cooperated in the exemption process and the agency had shown arrogance in denying the exemption.it found t he whole handling of this case by the agency was a complete abuse of discretion,and t he exemption request contains nothing that should have been exempted.the court ordered the agency to formulate a plan to gradually transition into the grandparents home,and to provide reunification services to the extent they were available.those services were to include providing transportation passes to the grandparents for visits with 
ii.discussion 
was placed with her grandparents on an emergency basis in december,and could not be permanently placed in their home without a criminal records exemption.
before a child is formally placed in a relative home,the social worker must conduct a visit to the home,a criminal records check,and a child abuse index check,subds.a c.the criminal records check must be performed on all persons over years of age who live in the home,and on any other person over the age of years known to the placing agency who may have significant contact with the child,including any person who has a familial or intimate relationship with any person living in the home,subd.b.if the criminal records check indicates that the person has been convicted of a crime that the director of social services may grant an exemption for under section of the health and safety code,the child shall not be placed in the home,unless a criminal records exemption has been granted by the county,based on substantial and convincing evidence to support a reasonable belief that the person with the criminal conviction is of such good character as to justify the placement and not present a risk of harm to the child pursuant to paragraph,subd.d.
grandfather criminal record includes convictions for crimes for which an exemption is required under section,a crimes other than minor traffic violations.los angeles county of children fam.services superior court valerie th,valerie see health,subds.a g.the grandparents contend that no exemption was required in this case,because the minor had been formally placed in their home before grandfather criminal history came to light,and section applies only when an initial placement is being considered.we disagree.
the grandparents rely primarily on los angeles county of children family services superior court cheryl th,cheryl,in which the social services agency filed a section petition to remove three dependent children from a foster care placement with their aunt after the aunt was convicted of criminal offenses.id.at.the agency argued that the children should be detained outside the aunt home while the petition was pending,because section barred their continued placement with a relative who had an unexempted criminal history.id.the juvenile court denied the request,ruling that section did not require the removal of a child in an existing relative placement.id.at.the appellate court agreed with this interpretation of section and concluded the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to detain the children.id.at.
section did not require the removal of the children in cheryl because they had clearly been placed with their aunt under a permanent plan of long term foster care.cheryl,supra,th at,by contrast,was temporarily placed in the grandparents home on an emergency basis after the agency filed the first section petition to remove her from her parents custody.see,subds.b,f temporary detention with relatives.when the court conducted the detention hearing on that first section petition,it did not formally place with her grandparents,but committed her to the care,custody and control of the agency to be placed in a suitable family home or private institution.the court made an identical order on january,when it sustained the allegations of the section petition and removed from her parents custody.although the court also adopted portions of the social worker report stating that had been placed with an approved relative,other information in the reports makes it clear the placement was made on an emergency basis and that the home was still being investigated.
though continued to reside with her grandparents in an emergency placement,this was not the same thing as an ordered placement with the grandparents.see in re cynthia th,cynthia.nor was the emergency placement transformed into a de facto formal placement due to the mere passage of time.ibid.agency could move minor from aunt home without petition when minor had been committed to agency custody without a formal relative placement mere passage of time did not give aunt a right to continuing custody or placement contrast in re miguel th,agency did not have the absolute authority to move a minor who had been formally placed with grandmother.
under section,a minor may not be formally placed with a relative until the necessary criminal records check has been performed.indeed,the failure to perform a criminal records check would render any formal placement with a relative subject to reversal.in re sabrina th.additionally,section,which provides for emergency placement with a relative,specifically recognizes that a social services agency may withdraw its approval of a relative home for this purpose when it discovers that the relative has a criminal record if a relative or nonrelative extended family member,and other adults in the home,as indicated,meets all other conditions for approval,except for the receipt of a the federal bureau of investigation criminal history information the county welfare department may approve the home and document that approval,if the relative or nonrelative extended family member,and each adult in the home,has signed and submitted a statement that he or she has never been convicted of a crime in the united states,other than a traffic infraction if,after the approval has been granted,the department determines that the relative or nonrelative extended family member or other adult in the home has a criminal record,the approval may be terminated,subd.c,italics added.
on december,the grandfather signed and submitted a statement under penalty of perjury that he had not been convicted of a criminal offense,but that statement was discovered to be false when the records check was conducted.section prohibited a formal placement in the grandparents home absent an exemption,and section,subdivision c authorized the agency to withdraw its approval of the grandparents home as an emergency placement and move to a foster home.
b.the juvenile court did not have the power to grant a criminal records exemption and exceeded its powers in placing with her grandparents on august.
according to the agency joined by minor appellate counsel,the grandfather criminal history operates as an absolute bar to placement in the grandparents home,because his application for a criminal records exemption was denied.the agency argues that in placing with the grandparents on august,the court effectively granted a criminal records exemption,something it lacked the power to do.we agree.
the decision to grant a criminal records exemption is an executive function that lies exclusively with the agency.in re th,sencere,supra,th at.by enacting section,the legislature has given the agency the express authority to veto a placement with a relative who has suffered criminal convictions.david superior court th.
having given the authority to grant an exemption to the agency,it is apparent that the legislature did not intend to confer such authority on the juvenile court.valerie,supra,th at see also sencere,supra,th at.accordingly,the juvenile court may not place a child with a relative who has an unexempted criminal history,even when the court determines that placement would be in the child best interests the general best interest of the child standard can not supplant the specific prohibition in section.citation.s ection represents the legislature determination that it would not be in the best interest of the dependent child to be placed with a relative with a disqualifying criminal conviction.valerie,at.
the grandmother suggests that the placement order was proper because the grandfather was no longer living in the home and she had no criminal history that disqualified her as a relative caregiver.we disagree for two reasons.first,the juvenile court specifically stated that would be returned to both grandparents and it did not care whether grandfather had moved out of the home or was only pretending to have done so.second,the criminal records check under section must be performed on any other person over years of age known to the placing agency who may have significant contact with the child,including any person who has a familial or intimate relationship with any person living in the home,subd.b.
by placing with her grandparents at the conclusion of the section hearing,the juvenile court effectively granted grandfather an exemption after the agency had declined to do so.in so doing,it exceeded the scope of its powers.sincere,supra,th at,supra,th at valerie,supra,th at.
c.the juvenile court determination that the agency abused its discretion in denying an exemption does not authorize placement with the grandparents.
during the hearing on the section petition,the juvenile court heard evidence about the exemption process,including testimony by the agency representative who heard the grandfather internal appeal.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court stated that the exemption should have been granted by the agency and that the agency handling of the case had been an abuse of discretion.the grandparents argue that placement in their home was appropriate notwithstanding section because the court determined that the exemption process itself was unfair.we disagree.
the agency decision to deny a criminal records exemption is an executive one subject to administrative review,supra,th at.the scope of this administrative review includes a hearing before an administrative law judge if timely requested.see also health,subd.a.the grandparents argue that an applicant whose exemption request has been denied may file a petition for administrative mandamus after exhausting the available administrative remedies.code.civ,in re esperanza th,esperanza.they acknowledge that no such petition was filed in this case,but argue that the agency denial of the exemption was an issue properly before the court.
in esperanza,supra,th at pages,the court recognized that a juvenile court may review an agency ruling on an exemption request as part of the dependency proceeding itself,even if no separate writ petition proceeding has been filed.considering the juvenile court role as parens patriae,the clear legislative preference for and the child interest in relative placement,the urgency of dependency timelines,the lack of a timely,effective remedy for a dependent child and his or her parent through existing administrative regulations and procedures,we hold that the juvenile court may review the agency denial of a criminal records exemption for abuse of discretion.id.at.
this does not mean that the juvenile court may substitute its own independent judgment on the exemption for that of the agency.esperanza,supra,th at.if the court determines that the agency did abuse its discretion,it may direct it to reconsider the request using the appropriate legal standard,but can not directly override the request and grant the exemption.id.at.the juvenile court finding in this case that the agency had abused its discretion did not give it the authority to grant grandfather exemption request or place in the grandparents home.
moreover,the record in this case does not support a finding that the agency abused its discretion,and the juvenile court comments show that it misapplied the standard.see mark jamie th.a review for abuse of discretion must be highly deferential to the here,the agency,and requires a showing that the decision was so irrational and arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.people carmony cal th,see also esperanza,supra,th at.under the standard,when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the juvenile court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the agency.citations.in re brittany th.
in considering grandfather request for a criminal records exemption,the agency was required to consider factors including,but not limited to,the following as evidence of good character and rehabilitation the nature of the crime and whether it involved violence or a threat of violence to others the period of time since the crime was committed and the number of offenses circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime that would demonstrate the unlikelihood of repetition activities since conviction,including employment,therapy or education a full and unconditional pardon or certificate of rehabilitation character references and honesty and truthfulness in the exemption application process.esperanza,supra,th at.while some of these factors arguably weighed in favor of an exemption the age of several convictions the granting of certificates of rehabilitations as to some of them,others did not,including the number of convictions and the grandfather submission of a form stating he had no criminal history.and,while the juvenile court minimized the significance of the grandfather arrest for domestic violence in a period when was residing in their home,in her parents custody,we can not say that no reasonable decision maker would have considered this an important factor weighing against an exemption.the juvenile court did not properly apply the abuse of discretion standard to the agency denial of the exemption rather,it substituted its own judgment that the exemption should have been granted.
although a section petition may have been unnecessary to move from the grandparents home,under the circumstances of the case,the juvenile court should have granted the agency motion to amend to conform to proof and granted the petition.
the agency argues that in light of the grandfather unexempted criminal record,the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the section petition that sought to move from her grandparents home.it alternatively takes the position first asserted by minor counsel that because had not been formally placed with her grandparents,no section petition was required to move her from that home.
the argument that no section petition was necessary to move finds support in cynthia,supra,th at pages,in which the court held that no such petition was required to move a child from a relative home when there had been no formal placement order.section states,an order changing or modifying a previous order by removing a minor from the physical custody of a parent,guardian,relative or friend and directing placement in a foster home shall be made only after noticed hearing upon a supplemental petition.italics added.subdivision b of the statute directs the agency to set forth a concise statement of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition has not been effective in the protection of the minor.italics added.the statute unambiguously governs situations involving an ordered placement which the agency later considers ineffective.cynthia,at.
as we have previously discussed,was never formally placed with the grandparents.accordingly,the agency was always authorized to exercise its discretion to reassess the suitability of the environment in which it had placed and,if deemed unsuitable,move her to an improved situation.cynthia,supra,th at.viewing this case as one in which no section petition was necessary,we would affirm the order dismissing the petition albeit on different grounds than that asserted by the juvenile court,but reverse the order placing with her grandparents.
that said,the agency elected to proceed via section,and we can not ignore that placement remained in a state of uncertainty while the hearing on that petition was held over a period of months.there is a rule that where the parties and the court proceeded throughout the trial upon the theory that a certain issue is presented for adjudication,the doctrine of estoppel precludes any party from thereafter asserting that no such issue was in controversy.auer frank d.given its pursuit of an order on the section petition,we deem the agency estopped from claiming that no such petition was required.
whether the section petition was unnecessary,or whether it was properly filed to obtain court approval of the new foster care placement,the end result reversal of the order placing with her grandparents is the same.the amended section petition filed by the agency on april,which was the operative pleading in this case,alleged in relevant part that grandfather had not cooperated with all the steps necessary to comply with the exemptions process.in light of the evidence produced at trial,the agency asked the court to amend the petition to conform to proof and sustain it based on a finding that,among other things,grandfather had failed to obtain a criminal history exemption.grandfather failure to obtain the exemption was uncontested and rendered the grandparents home ineligible as a relative placement.the juvenile court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition as insufficient rather than ordering it amended to conform to proof and sustaining it on its merits.see in re jessica th.
e.the reversal of the order placing with the grandparents makes reunification services and transportation assistance for the transition unnecessary.the agency argues that the juvenile court erred by ordering it to provide reunification services and transportation assistance to facilitate transition back into the grandparent home.as we are reversing the placement order under which that transition would have been made,the order requiring services and transportation assistance must be reversed as well.it is unnecessary to consider agency claim that the order was unauthorized in the first instance.
issues pertaining to june,status review hearing 
at the june,status review hearing,which was held while the section petition was pending,the juvenile court made a finding that the agency had failed to provide reasonable services to.the agency contends this finding was not supported by substantial evidence and must be set aside to avoid jeopardizing the federal funds available to maintain in foster care.see jennifer superior court th,angela superior court th,substantial evidence standard.the grandparents respond that the finding was supported by substantial evidence and was superfluous in any event because no such finding was required at a status review hearing in a case where reunification services to the parents have been terminated and no permanent plan selected.
although the agency asserts that the court finding of no reasonable services places its funding for in jeopardy,its general citation to federal statutes requiring the states to implement certain standards for children in foster care does not establish that or the agency will be directly impacted by the challenged finding.an appellant has the burden of demonstrating prejudicial error the agency has
