in this dependency case,rita petitions this court for relief from the juvenile court order terminating reunification services for herself and her son,blaine,and scheduling a hearing to consider termination of parental rights the trial court reached its decision only noting rita had performed so outstandingly during her reunification of her stumble in the effort to remain drug free.the court also considered the fact a very troublesome case as blaine likes his caretaker very much.
we conclude the juvenile court erred in terminating the reunification services.rita a tylenol with codeine prescribed for her adult daughter while suffering in bed with a quite minor,did not escalate into any more significant drug use,and did not indicate blaine would have been in any danger even had he been in rita custody at the time.more importantly,the record demonstrates the court improperly considered the quality of blaine relationship with his foster parents in reaching its difficult decision,tainting its decision.finally,it appears the court inadvertently interfered with the progress of rita reunification plan when it precluded the social worker from exercising his discretion to release blaine into her custody on a trial basis,without any hearing or determination of whether such a release would have been an abuse of that discretion.we therefore reverse the order and remand the case with directions either to offer additional reunification services to rita,or release blaine into her custody.
blaine was born in june of,with amphetamine in his system.he was taken into custody and the orange county social services agency ssa filed a petition to establish dependency jurisdiction based upon failure to protect welf,subd.b.the petition alleged that rita had exposed blaine to drugs and alcohol during her pregnancy,and that she had an extensive history of substance abuse.the petition also alleged rita had lost custody of other children in,due to acts of domestic violence with those children father,and due to the alcoholism of both parents.as to blaine father,rocky,the petition alleged he was on parole for receiving stolen property,had his own unresolved history of substance abuse,and failed to protect blaine from rita drug use during pregnancy.an amended petition,filed in july of,alleged rocky had been arrested again for possession of a controlled substance and violation of parole,and was incarcerated in the orange county jail.
in august of,rita and rocky both pleaded no contest to the amended petition.the court found the petition to be true,declared blaine to be a dependent,and ordered reunification services provided to rita and rocky.
after briefly staying elsewhere,blaine was placed in the concurrent planning home of norman and marcy in august of,apparently with the expectation they would be likely to adopt him if reunification efforts with rita and rocky proved unsuccessful.in june of,the filed a motion for an order declaring them to be blaine de facto parents,and allowing them to participate in the dependency court proceedings.no objection was filed,and the motion was granted.
after a bit of a slow start,rita performed very well in her reunification efforts.she went into a residential drug treatment program at a facility called the villa,and successfully completed it in may of.she consistently participated in drug testing and was consistently clean.she completed a parenting program and otherwise complied with the requirements of her reunification plan.she obtained a job at and she and rocky moved into a studio apartment.rocky had also performed well after a similarly slow start.
rita and rocky also visited with blaine consistently.however,conflicts developed between rita and more particularly rocky,on the one hand,and the on the other,concerning the visits.the social worker later relieved the from any role in monitoring the visitation,and assigned that role to professional staff from the agency which had placed blaine with the.unfortunately,some of the conflicts continued,and the social worker began to suspect that neither the nor their foster agency were supportive of rita and rocky reunification efforts.as the social worker explained,the emotionally charged bias that has become evident on the part of the foster agency and the is counterproductive to the development of a genuine supportive relationship between the foster parents and the birth parents.the social worker ultimately took over all responsibility for visitation personally.
the review was initially scheduled to commence on august.in preparation for that hearing,ssa prepared a report describing the progress made by rita and rocky,and noted t he distinct possibility exists for the child to begin a extended visit on or around this hearing date.the hearing was then repeatedly continued for a period spanning several months,pursuant to stipulations.
during the period encompassed by the continuances,several things happened.first,blaine began overnight visits with rita and rocky in august,and the visits went well.second,in september of,rocky turned himself in to the orange county sheriff department in response to a warrant alleging failure to appear on a charge of driving without a license at some point in the past.it appeared he was likely to be sentenced to up to two years in state prison.third,on october,ssa informed minor counsel of a tentative plant to return blaine to rita custody for a trial release beginning on october.
then,on october,minor counsel filed an ex parte motion pursuant to section,requesting that the court preclude ssa from carrying out its announced plan to release blaine into rita custody for the trial period.after hearing argument on that day,the court determined the issue required further hearing,granted blaine counsel request that the trial release not be commenced on october,and continued the hearing until october,which was,at that point,the date scheduled for the review.
the hearings were again continued until november,and were then trailed and again continued.the hearing finally commenced on november,over three months after it was initially scheduled.at the beginning of that hearing,minor counsel requested that no trial release be commenced until the conclusion of the hearing.the court agreed.
in connection with the hearing,ssa reported that blaine had begun visiting with rita alone from thursdays to saturdays,without incident,beginning in october.the social worker continued to recommend that rita be given an additional period of reunification services,and that blaine be placed with rita for a trial visit as soon as her child care arrangements were finalized.in that regard,the social worker also noted that rita had discussed her situation with her supervisor,who had been understanding of her situation and arranged to give her a firm work schedule which allowed her to make child care arrangements.
ssa report again reflected its concerns that blaine foster parents were attempting to undermine the reunification efforts.it noted that not only had rita complained that the foster mother was trying to subtly sabotage rita commitment to sobriety,but also that members of ssa staff had reported the foster parents had attempted to engage them in conversation critical of the assigned social worker management of this case and of the biological parents.ssa concerns about the foster parents behavior even prompted it to consider removing blaine from their custody.ultimately,however,ssa determined the disruption of such a move would not be in blaine best a consensus opinion of ssa staff that the foster parents were not in substantial agreement with the goal of family reunification.emphasis added.
the review occupied parts of five different days,but those days were spread over a period.the,as blaine de facto parents,were represented by counsel at the hearing,and their counsel conducted a vigorous of the social worker.he questioned the accuracy of the social worker reports,his credentials,and his conclusions concerning the parents compliance with their case plans and the stability of their housing.the also called their own witnesses in the proceeding,including a worker from the agency which placed blaine with them,and herself,as part of their challenge to the reliability of the social worker reports.despite those efforts,the court specifically found the social worker to be credible i find him very credible from the testimony i think there were several errors in the reports,but overall i just find him to be quite credible in his background and experience.
during the four week period in which the hearing was pending,only one significant thing occurred outside the courtroom,but it was one which substantially changed the court evaluation of the case.on november,a sunday,rita was in bed with a headache.blaine was not with her.her adult daughter was present,however,and offered her a tylenol.rita agreed and the daughter brought her the tablet,which was actually a prescription tablet of tylenol with codeine.rita took it,and went to sleep.
the next day,rita appeared for her usual drug test.she informed the testers that she had taken a tylenol with codeine without realizing what it was,and they told her she should expect to test positive.they advised her to tell her social worker.rita also informed her alcoholics anonymous aa sponsor about the incident as soon as she saw her at work.rita informed her social worker about it when she next saw him the following thursday for blaine usual thursday to sunday visit.the social worker allowed that visit to go forth as expected,but decided there should be at least one monitored visit thereafter prior to the next court hearing.
the next court hearing was the final day of taking evidence for the review.although rita testified she did not know the tablet was other than an ordinary tylenol when she took it,and the social worker testified he believed her,the court did not.the court concluded rita had taken the prescription medication knowingly,and viewed it as a possible attempt at on the eve of regaining custody t here a word for this to describe why people go through months of testing clean,superstars,clean,about ready to have their case dismissed,and use it most unfortunate.the court further stated that it had been ready to grant rita request for return of blaine to her custody in total,but things have changed.
rita and rocky counsel both argued that rita ingestion of the prescription medication was not,viewed in the context of her recovery as a whole,particularly significant.prescription painkillers were never rita drug of choice her ingestion of a single tablet did not devolve into something more significant and even assuming she had done it intentionally and blaine were present,there was no evidence suggesting the conduct would have presented any substantial danger to blaine safety or.
counsel also referred the court to our recent decision in david superior court th,d,in which this court emphasized that juvenile courts can not expect perfection from parents in dependency cases.as we stated in the opinion we are looking for passing grades here,not straight a.id.at,d.the court responded to that argument by declaring rita had not earned even a passing grade how can i give mother a passing grade on the eve when i wanted to return the child to the mother,she gives a dirty test.that really jeopardizes mother position,and i thought mother was doing so outstandingly.i was almost ready to rule last time 
both the court and counsel were concerned that the many delays in the hearing had resulted in a situation where there were few options for significant further services.even if the court were to continue services to the point,that review hearing would apparently be required to take place only a couple of weeks after the hearing was concluding.in that regard,rita counsel argued that the services,to the extent any were still necessary,could be extended beyond the point,since the services provided during the month period had not proved to be reasonable.
counsel point was that the court decision to block the social worker discretion to begin a trial release of blaine into rita custody,in response to minor counsel ex parte motion,had amounted to a de facto grant of the motion without due process.the court had curbed the social worker discretion to promote the reunification effort without ever determining his plan constituted an abuse of discretion,and thus thwarted rita progress toward reunification.counsel suggested the proper remedy for that error was to declare the reunification services for that period had not been reasonable,and to grant additional services on that basis.the court was uncertain it had that power,inquiring of counsel,are you confident of that position when she responded that she was,the court remarked well,it easy to say yes,but have you thoroughly researched it in the end,the court declined.
instead,it took the matter under submission on december,and ordered the parties to return to court on december,for its decision.on that date,the court announced it was terminating reunification services.the court also,however,expressly authorized ssa to continue drawing funds for the parents to continue their case plans,and specifically with their substance abuse.as the court explained,the court is granting additional funds for further services that mother complete counseling.she went to her meetings.she went to her meetings this dirty test comes at a time which the court was considering returning the child to the mother.mother has made some gigantic steps.she has worked,and she had periods of sobriety but at this time the court can not find another way to come to a different conclusion,just based upon the evidence that the court heard.
the court also scheduled a hearing pursuant to section,to take place on april,but made clear it intended to consider returning blaine to rita custody at that time.as the court stated,the likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home or may be placed for adoption,appoint a legal guardian,place permanently with a relative,or placed in another permanent living arrangement,is.
the court specified that the social worker would have discretion to liberalize visitation between blaine and rita,and then clarified what it expected rita to accomplish prior to the permanency hearing if she wanted to have blaine returned to her at that time.its list included continued clean drug tests,additional drug counseling,and completion of a personal empowerment program 
in its written minute order comprising its ruling,the court made the following additional comments the court finds mother to be very fragile,but she has completed her alcoholics anonymous meetings,her narcotics anonymous meetings and her counseling.but,she has made bad choices and she made one when she used codeine.she has a job,and for her a very good job.mother also has housing and is no longer living in motels.when mother testifies the first time she was very credible.then when she testified aft er a dirty test she was completely different.this is a very troublesome case as minor likes caretaker very much.italics added.
in the wake of that order,rita petitioned this court for extraordinary relief.rita petition was opposed by minor counsel and the de facto parents.ssa informed this court by letter that although it was disappointed by the court decision to terminate reunification services against its recommendation,it did not consider that decision to be an abuse of discretion.it declined to file a brief on the merits.
rita primary claim is that the court abused its discretion in terminating services,because it relied too heavily on the single dirty drug test,occurring after rita had ingested the tylenol with codeine,to establish that blaine could not be safely returned to her custody.rita relies upon jennifer superior court th,d.in that case,this court reversed a trial court decision that a child could not be safely returned to the mother,concluding it was not based on substantial evidence.the question we face is not whether mother has an unblemished drug testing record or whether mother is a perfect parent.rather,the question is whether substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding that returning the children to mother custody would create a substantial risk of physical or emot
