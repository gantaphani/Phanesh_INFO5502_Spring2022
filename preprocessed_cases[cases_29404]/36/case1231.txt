in this dependency proceeding,both the husband of eric mother and eric biological father sought presumed father status.a presumed father has greater rights than an alleged or biological father.we affirm an order awarding the husband presumed father status because the biological father did not seek that status until after a welfare and institutions code section hearing had been set and,at that time,he could not show a modification of his status was in eric best interest.
factual and procedural background 
eric and his half brother,michael,were removed from julie mother custody and detained in september.a section petition,as later sustained,alleged that mother has a history of substance abuse rendering her unable to provide adequate care for the children.it was alleged that mother suffers from mental and emotional problems requiring hospitalization in a psychiatric treatment center and rendering her incapable of providing regular care for her children.it also was alleged that robert,mother husband,had a history of substance abuse that may affect his ability to provide care 
on september,at the detention hearing,robert requested that the court find him to be eric presumed father,but the court refused to then consider the request the next day robert again requested to be found eric presumed father,and the juvenile court again refused to consider that request.the court found robert to be eric alleged father.
on november,gene,eric biological father,who was incarcerated,appeared in court for the first time.gene was ordered to undergo a drug rehabilitation program with random testing.the court further found although he an alleged father,gene is offered reunification services 
gene efforts to reunify 
a los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs report dated december,indicated that gene reported it may take him two to four years to reunite with eric.on the same date,dcfs filed a petition alleging that gene is a current user of marijuana and methamphetamine,which renders the father unable to provide regular care for the child eric.further,the father drug abuse endangers the child physical and emotional health and safety and places the child at risk of serious physical and emotional harm and damage and creates a detrimental home environment.the petition eventually was sustained.
in june,dcfs reported that gene tested positive for methamphetamine and had not contacted dcfs to visit with eric.gene did not comply with the case plan and did not appear at a hearing where the issue was the termination of his reunification services.gene attorney indicated that gene whereabouts were unknown.gene failed to keep dcfs updated with his address as he had been ordered.on august,gene reunification services were terminated.his whereabouts were still unknown.
gene appeared on december,and opposed a recommendation to terminate his parental rights.gene requested monitored visits with eric,and the juvenile court permitted such visits.on february,at the section hearing,gene requested a hearing to determine whether he rose to the level of a presumed father.
robert efforts to reunify 
robert appeared at all of the hearings and complied with his case plan.on february,after he provided several negative drug tests,robert was given custody of both michael and eric.throughout these proceedings,dcfs consistently and uniformly reported that robert provided a loving and stable home for michael and eric and that eric had bonded with both robert and michael.
competing motions to be declared eric presumed father 
gene and robert filed simultaneous motions to be declared eric presumed father gene attached evidence indicating that eric was born in nevada,gene name is on eric birth certificate,and gene signed a voluntary declaration of paternity,which he caused to be filed with the appropriate nevada authority.the court denied gene motion and granted robert.
the court found that under section b of the family code,you have two presumptions that arise under section of the family law code,that it a weighing process that must take place.robert has been acting as the father and has done so in an appropriate way t here is a sibling a nd now those two kids are obviously extremely bonded to one another and are extremely bonded to robert.i t robert who has been acting as the father,has conducted himself as the father,is looked at by the children as the father.and i sorry to say that not the case with gene.and i do think it that difficult of a call,really.
gene appealed the order to this court.we requested supplemental briefing regarding whether gene motion was pursuant to section.we granted rehearing to further consider gene argument regarding whether his request for presumed father status should be deemed a section petition and whether he has standing to contest the determination that robert is eric presumed father.
discussion 
gene contends the juvenile court was required to find him to be eric presumed father because he signed a voluntary declaration of paternity,which has the force of a judgment of paternity.as explained below,we disagree.
gene motion for presumed father status must be deemed a section petition 
section requires the juvenile court to inquire of the mother the identity of all alleged or presumed fathers at the detention hearing or as soon thereafter as practicable,subd.a see also cal.rules of court,rule describing procedure for determining paternity.each alleged father is entitled to notice that the child is the subject of dependency proceedings,subd.b.section is designed to protect the alleged father limited due process rights.in re paul th,d.an alleged father is entitled to notice so that he can challenge his paternity status.in re alyssa th,d.
there is no dispute that gene was given notice of the proceedings and he appeared after the detention hearing but during the reunification period.on december,the court found that although he an alleged father,gene is offered reunification services and the court will agree to that.no claim can be made that gene lacked notice of the proceedings,the opportunity to change his paternity status,or the opportunity to reunify with eric.thus,gene failure to participate in his case plan was not the result of the juvenile court failure to identify him as a possible father.
the primary purpose of achieving presumed father status in the dependency context is for the presumed father to have the right to reunification services and to custody.in re jerry th,d.there is no dispute that the juvenile court appropriately terminated gene reunification services because gene failed to comply with his reunification plan.gene did not seek custody of eric and acknowledged that he was not prepared to assume custody of eric for several years.
a request for presumed father status after the expiration of the reunification period is made by filing a section petition.in re zacharia cal th,d,fn.zacharia rejecting characterization that attempt to establish paternity was part of review hearing where father had not participated in dependency proceedings until that time.while a biological father is not entitled to custody under section,or reunification services under section if he does not attain presumed father status prior to the termination of any reunification period,he may move under section for a hearing to reconsider the juvenile court earlier rulings based on new evidence or changed circumstances.id.at,d,fn.omitted.thus,gene motion made after the reunification period had appropriately terminated was in essence a section petition,even though he did not identify it as such.
contrary to gene argument,in re jesusa cal th,d,jesusa does not hold otherwise.in that case,the court considered a biological father request to be declared a presumed father made nine days after the detention hearing.id.at,d.thus,jesusa simply does not bear on the issue of a dilatory request for presumed father status made after a section hearing had been set.
this case is distinguishable from the authority gene cites because gene waited until after the section hearing had been set to request presumed father status.while gene correctly points out the best interest of t
