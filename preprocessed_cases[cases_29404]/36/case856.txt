mother of dependent children jackson and trenton together,the minors,appeals a juvenile court order summarily denying her welfare and institutions code section petition for modification by which she sought a hearing on whether she received the effective assistance of counsel at an earlier stage of the proceedings.this appeal raises several issues of first impression whether a parent who waives the right to have the juvenile court appoint counsel trained in juvenile dependency law in order to retain counsel who does not meet those qualifications can claim privately retained counsel provided ineffective representation and whether a section petition is the proper mechanism by which to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.we hold a parent,after proper advisement,may knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily waive the statutory right to be represented by appointed counsel meeting the definition of competent counsel under california rules of court,rule d.once that right is waived,the parent is precluded from complaining about counsel lack of juvenile dependency qualifications.we further hold that a parent who has a due process right to competent counsel can seek to change a prior court order on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel by filing a section petition,although the customary and better practice is to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the juvenile court.
even assuming did not waive her right to raise the issue of her retained counsel incompetence,and even assuming she properly alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in a section petition,we conclude she has not met her burden of showing she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the petition or that she was prejudiced by counsel claimed deficiencies.accordingly,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
in june the minors were removed from the custody of their parents,and matthew together,the parents,when trenton was discovered to have multiple injuries,including a fractured femur and several fractured ribs in various stages of healing.trenton also had an injury to his mouth and a bruise under his eye which the parents could not explain.when discovered trenton had a swollen leg,she took him to the emergency room,but then left because it was too crowded,and waited until the next day to call the doctor.the parents explanation that the femur fracture resulted from a fall from their bed several days earlier was inconsistent with medical findings.when jackson was a newborn,he was taken to the hospital with bruises on the sides of his face.matthew claimed this occurred when jackson head got stuck between the crib railings.
the attending physician noted trenton would have been in tremendous pain at the time of the femur fracture,and he would have cried every time he had his diaper changed or was bathed.matthew said he could have caused the rib fractures by holding trenton too tight,and he could have caused the femur fracture by twisting trenton leg to turn him face up.the parents did not understand the severity of trenton injuries,and insisted matthew had not caused the injuries.
the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed petitions in the juvenile court alleging trenton had suffered severe physical abuse inflicted nonaccidentally,subd.e,and jackson was at substantial risk of harm as a result of the abuse inflicted on trenton,subd.j.the court made prima facie findings on the petitions and detained the minors in care.
in a report prepared for the jurisdiction and disposition hearings,agency recommended the court deny the parents reunification services under section,subdivision b.even after trenton injuries were called to attention and matthew admitted causing them,claimed trenton had a bone condition or the babysitter was responsible for the injuries.however,the medical reports ruled out a bone condition and concluded the injuries were caused by nonaccidental trauma.based on trenton visible injuries,the inconsistent story gave for them and her delay in obtaining treatment,the social worker believed was fully aware of the abuse that was occurring,allowed it to happen and chose to protect matthew rather than her children.
the social worker believed reunification services for would not be in the minors best interests because services would not likely prevent reabuse.had not protected the minors,and she lacked protective skills despite completing a parenting class and actively engaging in therapy.she refused to admit matthew abused the minors.
in july the parents appeared in court with their appointed counsel and the matter was set for trial.a month later,informed the court she wanted to hire her own attorney.the court advised of the importance of hiring an attorney because of the possibility she would not receive reunification services.county counsel commented that should be aware that her counsel of choice needed to be specialized or approved in child dependency law,and she would have to waive that specialty if she going to retain anybody that does not regularly practice in this field.
was enrolled in therapy and making some progress.she was now opening her eyes to the possibility matthew had caused trenton injuries,but was still really torn.acknowledged something had happened to trenton,but she was not sure how he was injured.
on september,appeared in court with her retained counsel,randall dierlam.the following exchange occurred 
the court all right.thank you.is that correct,that is as to the mother,you wish dierlam to be your attorney 
the mother yes,sir.
the court dierlam,are you a certified specialist in juvenile dependency law 
dierlam no,i not.
the court all right.and your attorney,dierlam,has indicated,or the attorney you would like to have represent you has indicated that he is not such a specialist.do you understand that 
the mother yes.
the court is it still your desire to have dierlam represent you in this proceeding 
the mother yes.
the court designated dierlam as counsel.
told the social worker she now believed matthew accidentally injured trenton by causing him to hit his eye and lip on the crib.said she no longer lived with matthew,she had filed for divorce and she was furious with him.however,the social worker observation of the parents led her to believe they intended to continue their relationship.
a psychological evaluation of showed she was not protective of her children.she had a tendency to lie,and it was not likely the minors could be safely returned to her custody within the limited time frame for reunification.
at a contested jurisdiction hearing,social worker beatriz luna testified that matthew had admitted causing trenton femur and rib fractures.saw the bruise under trenton eye and his busted lip,but claimed she did not know matthew inflicted those injuries.the minors would be unsafe with because she persisted in her belief that matthew did not cause trenton injuries.
child abuse specialist cynthia kuelbs testified trenton had a series of injuries resulting from inflicted trauma.his rib fractures occurred a few weeks before his femur fracture.a infant could not have scooted from the center of the bed to the edge,as described by the parents.the femur fracture was likely caused by twisting the child leg violently and with a great deal of force.the rib fractures would have been caused by compression,not by carrying the child as described by matthew.trenton would have been in obvious pain and discomfort from his injuries.trenton lip injury was likely caused by forcing an object into his mouth.it was unusual that the parents did not seek medical treatment for their child bleeding mouth.
the court sustained the allegations of the petitions by clear and convincing evidence.as to,the court found she knew or reasonably should have known trenton was being physically abused.
before disposition,the cherokee nation of oklahoma successfully sought to intervene in the case on behalf of the minors,who were indian children within the meaning of the indian child welfare act icwa.et.
at the contested disposition hearing,the court admitted psychological evaluation into evidence.testified she had no idea how trenton could have sustained broken ribs.she explained that she placed him on the bed,turned her back and then found him face down on the floor.trenton was not crying and did not appear to be hurt.the next day,did not notice any swelling or bruising as a result of trenton fall.trenton previously had a tiny bruise on his cheek and a bruised lip,and believed these injuries were adequately explained by matthew having bumped trenton head on the crib.after two days,the facial bruise disappeared and trenton lip appeared to be fine.
further testified that on the day trenton sustained the femur fracture,he did not appear to be in distress or have any injuries.the next day,picked up trenton from the babysitter house and noticed his leg was swollen.she took him to the hospital,but left because the emergency room was too busy.she waited until the following day to call for a doctor appointment.when tests showed trenton had a fractured femur,explained he had fallen from the bed.she had seen trenton scoot himself around.did not suspect matthew had injured trenton,and she believed matthew claim that he had never handled trenton in a way that could have caused the fracture.believed trenton was injured while in the care of the babysitter.even after matthew said he caused trenton injuries,remained confused.
when asked about her plan to protect the minors,testified she would move out of state and stay away from matthew.she had already filed for divorce.continued to participate in therapy and completed a parenting course.she spent the night with matthew a few times after the minors were removed from her custody,including one time recently.
social worker luna testified she considered to be nonprotective of the minors because she had not believed matthew caused trenton injuries luna was also concerned that was lying,living with matthew and lacked a significant bond with the minors.based on these factors,luna recommended the court deny reunification services.
the court received into evidence the declaration of indian expert witness nicole allison,a child welfare specialist for the cherokee nation.allison testified that in her opinion,the minors would suffer serious emotional damage if placed with 
after considering the evidence and hearing argument of counsel,the court declared the minors dependents,removed them from parental custody and placed them in foster care.the court denied reunification services under section,subdivision b and as to trenton,and under section,subdivision b and as to jackson,and set a section selection and implementation hearing.the court advised the parents of their right to challenge its findings and orders by filing a notice of intent and writ petition,and also instructed the parents counsel to provide the appropriate forms and to further advise the parents of their appellate remedies.
counsel filed a notice of intent to file a writ petition,signed by,on february.the next day,and her counsel signed and filed a substitution of attorney,substituting as counsel for herself.when a writ petition was not timely filed,this court dismissed the matter,deeming the notice of intent to be abandoned.
in may agency filed a report for the section selection and implementation hearing,recommending a permanent plan of adoption for the minors.agency recommended the minors be adopted by the paternal grandfather,and planned to move the minors to his home in colorado.the parents had been living together until matthew was recently arrested for child abuse.continued to support matthew,and cancelled a visit with the minors so that she could attend his criminal hearing.
at a hearing on june,the court relieved dierlam as attorney and appointed counsel for her.told the court she had fired dierlam because he was not child dependency qualified,and this was not helping her case.admitted that when she retained dierlam,the court had advised her of her right to a certified juvenile dependency lawyer,but she nevertheless wanted to proceed with dierlam.the court set a contested selection and implementation hearing for august.
on june,filed a section petition seeking to have the court vacate its jurisdictional and dispositional findings and orders on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel by dierlam.as to changed circumstances,the petition alleged numerous instances of counsel failure to properly represent.as to best interests,the petition alleged returning the minors to custody providing her with services would further foster the bond shared with them.the court summarily denied the petition,finding it did not state new evidence or changed circumstances.the court also found the issues raised were not viable for a section petition because they related to any appeal that may be filed for ineffective assistance of counsel,and,in any event,there was no showing the outcome would have been different.
discussion 
contends the court erred by denying her section petition without an evidentiary hearing.she asserts a section petition is the proper procedure for raising the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel as a way of challenging the court denial of reunification services her section petition made a prima facie showing of changed circumstances and best interests,entitling her to a full evidentiary hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel and whether the lack of competent counsel affected the outcome of the proceedings must be decided at a hearing on the merits.
before reaching the merits of contentions,we address agency assertion has waived the ability to complain that her retained counsel was not competent when she intentionally relinquished her right to be represented by counsel who was certified or who specialized in juvenile dependency law.
under section,subdivision b,the juvenile court must appoint counsel for an indigent parent unless the court finds the parent has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel.see in re th.a parent in a dependency proceeding may knowingly and intelligently waive the right to counsel after proper advisement by the juvenile court,and may also choose to be represented by retained counsel.in re brian th,in re christina d.the state will only interfere with an individual choice of legal representation when that choice will result in significant prejudice to the individual or in a disruption of the orderly processes of justice unreasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.people crovedi cal d.
here,exercised her right to retain private counsel,whom she knew was not a juvenile dependency law specialist,to replace the attorney appointed for her at the inception of the case.the court advised of her right to be represented by an attorney who was a certified specialist in juvenile dependency law,presumably referring to competency certification in the juvenile court within the meaning of section and rule d.under those provisions,all parties who are represented by counsel at dependency proceedings are entitled to competent counsel.rule d defines competent counsel as an attorney who is a member in good standing of the state bar of california,who has participated in training in the law of juvenile dependency,and who demonstrates adequate forensic skills,knowledge and comprehension of the statutory scheme,the purposes and goals of dependency proceedings,the specific statutes,rules of court,and cases relevant to such proceedings,and procedures for filing petitions for extraordinary writs.
expressly waived her right to be represented by an attorney who had the training,skills and knowledge of a juvenile dependency specialist.when the outcome of the proceedings was unfavorable to,she sought to discharge her retained counsel on the ground his lack of juvenile dependency qualifications had not helped her case.because knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily chose to proceed with counsel who was not a specialist in juvenile dependency law,she can not be heard to complain that counsel was not competently representing her precisely because he was not child dependency qualified.
