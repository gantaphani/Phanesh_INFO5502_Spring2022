this appeal presents a situation that not only reaches the outer limits of the ability of a prospective married couple to incorporate by reference terms into a prenuptial agreement,but so far exceeds those limits as to fall off the edge.it is one thing for a couple to agree to basic terms,and choose the system of law that they want to govern the construction or interpretation of their premarital agreement.see,subd.a parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to the choice of law governing the construction of the agreement.it is quite another to say,without any agreement as to basic terms,that a marriage will simply be governed by a given system of law and then hope that parol evidence will supply those basic terms.
here,a couple who married in egypt in had their marriage dissolved after living in the united states for about years.in the course of the proceedings,the husband asserted that the couple had a written prenuptial agreement.the document that he claimed was the prenuptial agreement was a piece of paper written in arabic and signed by him and his future at the time of the wedding.the bride did not sign it her father signed it as her representative.the record contains three english translations of the document,and,with the exception of the recitation of a dowry arrangement,none of the translations sets forth any substantive matter.at trial,the husband attempted to introduce parol evidence in the form of an expert witness who was prepared to testify that certain language in the document signified an intention on the part of the husband and wife to have their marriage,including property relations at the time of any divorce,governed by islamic law.the trial judge refused to allow the expert to testify,held there was no prenuptial agreement he found the document was really a marriage certificate,and proceeded to apply california community property law to the earnings and acquisitions of the parties.
we affirm the property division set forth in the judgment.it is not that a document in a foreign language is not a fit subject for parol evidence.it obviously is.see reamer nesmith cal.we affirm because the requirement that prenuptial agreements be in writing under california law is a statute of frauds provision,and to satisfy the statute of frauds,a writing must state with reasonable certainty what the terms and conditions of the contract are.an agreement whose only substantive term in any language is that the marriage has been made in accordance with islamic law is hopelessly uncertain as to its terms and conditions.had the trial judge allowed the expert to testify,the expert in effect would have written a contract for the parties.
the husband also mounts a challenge to an attorney fee order for fees on this appeal.the argument is based in part on the novel idea that the fee award was excessive because appellate practice consists,in the words of one of the husband briefs,of simply chang ing the trial points and authorities into an appellate format.we reject that contention in the strongest possible terms.
ahmad and sherifa shaban were married in the arab republic of egypt in february.they came to the united states in the early,and dissolved their marriage in in the superior court of orange county.at trial,ahmad contended that a document written in arabic on what appears to be a form there is arabic writing in the blanks of the form constituted a prenuptial agreement governing the disposition of any property acquired by either of them during the marriage.we set out in the margin the complete text of the translation of the document that,to the degree there is any difference among the three,best favors ahmad position 
the document designates the bridegroom and the bride,and then refers to a dowry often called a mahr of egyptian pounds and piasters due from the husband to wife proxy,her father.it states that a token portion of the dowry the piasters had already been paid,with the balance due at nearer maturity divorce or death.at oral argument,ahmad counsel acknowledged that the amount of balance due on the dowry was now equivalent to about.the document then describes two witnesses,one of whom was an ambassador,and the other an engineer.
then comes certain language,which forms the basis of ahmad appeal.one translation goes the above legal marriage has been concluded in accordance with his almighty god holy book and the rules of his prophet to whom all god prayers and blessings be,by legal offer and acceptance from the two contracting parties.another translation reads legal marriage concluded in accordance with god book and the precepts of his prophet and with the mutual agreement of the husband and the wife representative.after that there is an oblique reference to the two parties having taken cognizance of the legal implications.the document was signed by the husband and the wife representative or agent.
at trial,ahmad made an offer of proof that the phrase signified a written intention by the parties to have the property relations governed by islamic law,which provides that the earnings and accumulations of each party during a marriage remain that party separate property.in practical effect,that would mean that there would be no community interest in ahmad medical practice or retirement accounts his trial brief indicated that the real property of the parties,put in joint names,would be divided between them.the trial judge,however,concluded that the document was a marriage certificate and not a written prenuptial agreement,and therefore did not allow ahmad expert to testify concluding that there was no prenuptial agreement,the court entered a judgment applying california community property law to the acquisitions during the marriage and dividing what it then held was the community estate.ahmad has appealed from the property division portion of the judgment,arguing,among other things,that the trial judge erred in excluding the expert testimony.at oral argument he conceded that if california law were to govern,the court division of property was correct.
discussion 
the parol evidence was properly excludedbecause it was offered to establishthe substance of the alleged agreement 
at the outset,it is important to distinguish between the parol evidence rule and the statute of frauds.see generally ellis klaff d,comparing and contrasting the two rules parol evidence is a principle of substantive law the statute of frauds is designed to prevent perjury and fraud.parol evidence,of course,may be received to interpret a term of art used within a contract.see pacific gas thomas drayage.cal d,acl technologies,northbrook property casualty ins.th,d pacific gas,properly understood,is directed to situations where parties give words special meanings or use a code.
but independent of the parol evidence rule,the statute of frauds requires that the contract itself not be the product of parol evidence.as our supreme court explained in an early case turning on the statute of frauds the whole object of the statute would be frustrated if any substantive portion of the agreement could be established by parol evidence.craig zelian cal.
regardless of whether we are dealing with california law before or after our legislature adopted the uniform premarital agreement act in,california has had in place,since,a statute of frauds provision for prenuptial agreements.see hall hall d.the current incarnation of that statute is family code section a premarital agreement shall be in writing and signed by both parties.at the time of ahmad and sherifa marriage,it was former civil code section all contracts for marriage settlements must be in writing and executed and acknowledged or proved in like manner as a grant of land is required to be executed and acknowledged or proved.
often,prenuptial agreement cases have turned on whether a given oral agreement had been sufficiently performed to take it out of the writing requirement.see hall hall,supra,d at.and authorities collected therein.but in any event,there never has been any question that the writing requirement is a statute of frauds law.id.at.see also barton barton cal d,no enforceable prenuptial agreement because letters of a social and sentimental nature were insufficient to satisfy statute of frauds hughes hughes,statute of frauds barred enforcement of oral promise by prospective husband to give wife diamond ring,diamond stickpin,ermine coat and automobile if she would marry him,even though parties were,indeed,married afterwards.
in the context of the requirement of a writing for real estate transactions see,california courts have,since ellis klaff,supra,d at,adopted the principles set forth in section of the restatement of contracts,which provides that to be sufficient,the required writing must state with reasonable certainty the terms and conditions of all the promises constituting the contract see also ontario downs,lauppe d.rivers beadle d.burge krug d,ferrara silver d,potter bland d.as justice lillie noted in burge,the writing considered alone,must express the essential terms with sufficient certainty to constitute an enforceable contract,hence recovery may not be predicated upon parol proof of material terms omitted from the written memorandum.burge krug,supra,d at,emphasis added.
there is no reason the same requirement that the writing evidence with reasonable certainty the terms of the contract should not also apply to prenuptial agreements.the policy considerations behind the statute of frauds apply,if anything,with even more force to prenuptial agreements.such agreements will often be litigated in the highly emotional aftermath of the breakup of an intimate relationship,and will involve subject matter far more personal and more likely to strike home than an impersonal real estate transaction.the temptation for selective memory is usually greater in domestic relations cases than it is in real estate deals.
given the need for reasonable certainty of terms and conditions it is evident that the phrases in accordance with his almighty god holy book and the rules of his prophet and two parties having taken cognizance of the legal implications,no matter how much they might indirectly indicate a desire to be governed by the rules of the islamic religion,simply bear too attenuated a relationship to any actual terms or conditions of a prenuptial agreement to satisfy the statute of frauds.the reference to legal implications is particularly meaningless,because all marriages bear legal implications the world over the only thing that bears any resemblance to a material term is the lonely dowry provision indeed,all three translations of the document provide far more information about the two witnesses to the wedding than they provide about any agreement of the parties.
because the trial court did not err in excluding the parol evidence in this case,there is no need to address the question of whether any such agreement was against public policy.it is enough to remark that the need for parol evidence to supply the material terms of the alleged agreement renders it impossible to discuss any public policy issues.after all,how can one say that an agreement offends public policy when it is not possible even to state its terms 
the attorney fee orders were proper 
in a related appeal which we now consolidate with ahmad original appeal,ahmad attacks two attorney fee orders,one for and one for.the award was to provide sherifa with attorney fees for this appeal,after ahmad had filed a notice of appeal and bonded around the attorney fee award in the judgment,which was for fees incurred at trial.that particular fee award,for,has not been challenged in this appeal.the fee award was for the fees incurred in opposing a petition for modification of the judgment.
ahmad main argument against these awards is that,given the division of an estate worth some million,sherifa had so many assets that she did need any money for attorney fees.the argument fails for three reasons 
first,the nature of ahmad position in this appeal was that the property division in the judgment was incorrect.had ahmad prevailed on that,if he yet prevails assuming that the supreme court were to reverse today assets that he now claims are his wife to use to pay attorney fees could end up being his.
second,just because ahmad had a legal right to bond around a judgment does mean that the court could not compensate sherifa for her effective lack of liquidity to finance the defense of the judgment on appeal.see hunter hunter d.upholding attorney fees for appeal in case where wife was without funds to pay appellate counsel.unless there was an award of fees prospectively,sherifa would have been without means to present her case in this court.
third,the record contains some evidence of ahmad recalcitrance in transferring various assets to sherifa.the trial court thus had evidence,in addition to the bond staying execution of the judgment,that ahmad was determined to wage the litigation in such a way as to deprive sherifa of liquid assets pending the appeal.
the amount of the fee award for defending this appeal is,in our judgment,reasonable as well,but this issue requires a little more explication.ahmad does really argue that the amount is excessive in terms of the combination of traditional factors such as time spent,difficulty of subject matter,or experience and expertise of counsel.see generally in re marriage of cueva d.instead,he makes this,rather remarkable argument it was excessive because most of the work that would have to be done by appellate counsel on appeal had already been done in connection with the trial.
it is a contention the members of this panel,or any appellate or reviewing court,are particularly situated to reject out of hand.so let us do so.
appellate work is most assuredly not the recycling of trial level points and authorities.of course,the orientation of trial work and appellate work is obviously different see generally eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,to noting difference between determination of case on merits and examination for error,but that is only the beginning of the differences that come immediately to mind.
for better or worse,appellate briefs receive greater judicial scrutiny than trial level points and authorities,because three judges or maybe seven will read them,not just one judge.the judges will also work under comparatively less time pressure,and will therefore be able to study the attorney work product more closely.they will also have more staff there are fewer research attorneys per judge at the trial level to help them identify errors in counsel reasoning,misstatements of law and miscitations of authority,and to do original research to uncover ideas and authorities that counsel may have missed,or decided not to bring to the court attention.
additionally,because there is no horizontal stare decisis within the court of appeal,intermediate appellate court precedent that might otherwise be binding on a trial court see auto equity sales,superior court cal d,is not absolutely binding on a different panel of the appellate court.so,in appropriate and rare cases,appellate court precedent is open for reexamination and critical analysis.along the same lines,appellate counsel must necessarily be more acutely aware of how a given case fits within the overall framework of a given area of law,so as to be able to anticipate whether any resulting opinion will be published,and what effect counsel position will have on the common law as it is continuously developed.
then there is the simple matter of page limitations.appellate courts are more liberal than trial courts as to the number of pages counsel are allowed.cal.rules of court,rule d limit of or pages for trial level points and authorities without necessity of obtaining permission to exceed limit with rule e limit of pages for appellate briefs without necessity of obtaining permission to exceed limit.granted,the extra length of the briefs in appellate and reviewing courts is not always a good thing witkin,cal.procedure ed,appeal,quoting king gildersleeve cal,the learned counsel may not have had time to prepare a short brief,but the difference does mean that appellate counsel will have much more freedom to explore the contours and implications of the respective legal positions of the p
