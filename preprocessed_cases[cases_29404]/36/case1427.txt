in appellant,petitioner georgiana breeden hixson breeden,and respondent,harry franklin hixson,entered into a series of stipulated judgments dividing and distributing their marital assets.in breeden filed an order to show cause with respect to community property which she alleged had not been previously adjudicated.breeden propounded discovery with respect to the factual allegations set forth in her order to show cause and the family court granted hixson motion to prevent the discovery from taking place.thereafter the family court denied breeden any relief on the order to show cause.
we affirm.the evidence in the record is not sufficient to establish the existence of an unadjudicated community asset as to which discovery is necessary or as the basis for granting relief on breeden order to show cause.thus the family court acted properly in denying breeden any relief on the order to show cause.
after years of marriage,breeden and hixson separated in.during the course of the marriage hixson was the president and chief executive officer of a large biotechnology company,amgen,amgen.the bulk of the parties marital assets,consisting of amgen stock and their interests in limited partnerships,were held in a revocable family trust.following initiation of dissolution proceedings,hixson provided breeden and her counsel with an extensive declaration setting forth the trust assets.in addition,hixson participated in two days of depositions and provided breeden with all the financial records requested by her counsel.
in,by way of a series of stipulated judgments,most of the assets held in the trust were distributed to breeden and hixson as separate property.however,because of restrictions on their right to transfer their limited partnership interests,those interests were held in the trust even after dissolution of the marriage.
in breeden filed a probate petition in which she alleged that million in stock transactions had not been accounted for,that without her knowledge or consent,a substantial number of amgen shares had been withdrawn or distributed from the trust,and that hixson had exploited for himself an investment opportunity which should have been shared with the marital community.
on hixson motion,the probate petition was transferred to the family court,where breeden recast it as an order to show cause.prior to the hearing on the order to show cause,breeden propounded discovery on hixson.hixson moved to quash the discovery.the family court initially stayed the discovery pending a hearing on whether it would permit the discovery to take place.
on december,after considering declarations submitted by the parties,the existing record and argument of counsel,the trial court refused to permit breeden to go forward with the discovery she proposed.thereafter,the family court entered an order denying breeden any relief on her order to show cause.
breeden filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
in her principal argument on appeal breeden contends family code section gave her the absolute right to conduct discovery with respect to the allegations set forth in her osc.hixson on the other hand contends breeden had no right to any discovery.we conclude the family court,like any other court presiding over a civil proceeding,had discretion to limit discovery.that discretion required that it consider the nature of the proceeding before it and the issues in controversy.here we find that under all the circumstances set forth in the record,the family court did not abuse its discretion in limiting breeden discovery and did not err in denying her relief on her osc.
we begin our analysis with section,which states in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage,for nullity of marriage,or for legal separation of the parties,the court has continuing jurisdiction to award community estate assets or community estate liabilities to the parties that have not been previously adjudicated by a judgment in the proceeding.a party may file a postjudgment motion or order to show cause in the proceeding in order to obtain adjudication of any community estate asset or liability omitted or not adjudicated by the judgment.in these cases,the court shall equally divide the omitted or unadjudicated community estate asset or liability,unless the court finds upon good cause shown that the interests of justice require an unequal division of the asset or liability.
section was derived from the substantively identical provisions of former civil code section.prior to enactment of former civil code section,a spouse who believed that community property had not been adjudicated in a prior dissolution proceeding was required to bring a separate civil action.henn henn cal d.there are no reported decisions that have held that a community property claim to an asset left unmentioned in a prior judicial division of community property may be adjudicated in a motion to modify the prior decree.the only reported decisions that address this issue correctly conclude that such claims may only be adjudicated in a separate action.citations.id.at.
the legislative history of former civil code section indicates that it was sponsored by the author of a noted treatise on family law,justice donald king.justice king believed that permitting litigation of unadjudicated community property claims by way of orders to show cause in the prior family law matter would be considerably less expensive,less burdensome on the court,save a great deal of judicial time,permit resolution of the dispute within a very short period of time,and permit the aggrieved party to obtain attorney fees and costs which would not otherwise be available.senate judiciary committee report,ab reg,july.
contrary to hixson argument on appeal,nothing on the face of the statute or its history suggests that discovery on an order to show cause under section should be treated differently than discovery permitted in any other proceeding under the family law.the terms of the statute contain no express restriction on,or reference to,discovery.given the statute origins in the prior practice of requiring a separate civil action be initiated,where fairly unrestricted discovery would have been available,we would expect that had the legislature intended to impose strict limits on discovery,those limits would have been set forth on the face of statute or in some other manner expressed in the legislative history.although there is reference in the history to convenience and efficiency,those general references,in light of the prior practice,do not persuade us that the legislature intended that a section proceeding be treated any differently than other family law matters.
our conclusion that any limitation on discovery in section proceedings would have been expressed rather than left implied is consistent with our supreme court recognition that family law litigants are entitled to all the discovery provided by the civil discovery act,code of civil procedure section et and that the right to discover community assets is of particular importance.see schnabel superior court cal th,d.under the discovery statutes,information is discoverable if it is unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.citations.at the outset,we note that information about the value of community assets and the parties financial status is clearly relevant to the spouse interests in obtaining a fair division of those assets and fair attorney fee and spousal support and,in other cases,child support awards.moreover,at least as to a division of assets and child and spousal support awards,those interests are strongly protected by california law.ibid.
however,contrary to breeden contention on appeal,the right to discovery in civil proceedings is not absolute.section,subdivision b,provides generally that any discovery method,including depositions,may be restricted in the frequency or extent of its use if the trial court determines either that the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,less burdensome,or less expensive or the selected method of disc
