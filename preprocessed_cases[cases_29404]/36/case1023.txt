appellant tammy appeals from an order terminating her parental rights over her daughter,alice aka alicia,and selecting adoption as the permanent plan for alice pursuant to welfare and institutions code section in a prior appeal,we reversed an earlier order terminating parental rights due to a failure to adequately inquire about indian ancestry pursuant to the indian child welfare act icwa et.in re alicia,wl nonpub.opn.on remand the trial court again terminated appellant parental rights.appellant contends the new order terminating parental rights must be reversed for failure to comply with the notice requirements of icwa.we agree,and reverse the order.
background 
on june,the monterey county department of social and employment services department filed a juvenile dependency petition,alleging that alice came within section,subdivisions b failure to protect and g no provision for support.the petition stated that alice tested positive for methamphetamine at birth,that appellant failed to provide appropriate care for her other children,that alice father,steve,was incarcerated,and that both parents had significant criminal histories relating to substance abuse.
on august,the juvenile court sustained the petition and declared alice a dependent.at the selection and implementation hearing on june,the juvenile court selected adoption as the permanent plan and terminated parental rights.this court reversed that order.in re alicia,wl nonpub.opn.we remanded the case to the juvenile court for the requisite inquiry into whether alice is or may be an indian child and to order the completion of forms entitled parental notification of indian status.ibid.depending upon the result of this inquiry,the juvenile court was ordered to direct the department to give notice of the proceedings in compliance with icwa.ibid.
on october,prior to the remittitur in this case,appellant completed a form.appellant answered american indian,in response to the query whether alice is or may be a member of,or eligible for membership in,a federally recognized indian tribe.alice father denied any indian heritage.on february,a social worker sent the form,notice of involuntary child custody proceedings for an indian child,to all federally recognized navajo and apache tribes with notice of a hearing set for june,notice also was sent to the bureau of indian affairs bia.eight tribes responded to the notice by indicating that alice was not eligible for tribal membership.three tribes did not respond jicarilla apache nation,fort sill apache of oklahoma,and apache tribe of oklahoma.
the remittitur from the prior appeal in this case issued on april.on july,the juvenile court determined that icwa did not apply and reinstated the prior orders for termination of parental rights and adoption.appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
congress passed icwa to cure abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement,usually in homes.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,d.as defined by icwa,an indian child is any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.if there is reason to believe that the child that is the subject of the dependency proceeding is an indian child,icwa requires notice to the child indian tribe of the proceeding and of the tribe right of intervention.a see also,subd.b.notice is a key component of the congressional goal to protect and preserve indian tribes and indian families.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under icwa irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.in re kahlen d.kahlen.
appellant contends that the court implicit finding that the department complied with the notice requirements of icwa is not supported by substantial evidence.she argues specifically that the department failed to provide adequate notice to the three unresponsive tribes.the department contends,however,that appellant forfeited any argument regarding proper icwa notice by failing to raise an objection in the juvenile court.the department also asserts that it complied substantially with the notice requirements.in supplemental briefing,the department argues that it only was required to conduct additional inquiry into alice status as an indian child,and was not required to follow the strict notice requirements set forth in section.the california state association of counties csac joined in this argument in an amicus brief.
forfeiture 
the generally accepted rule in dependency cases is that the forfeiture doctrine does not bar consideration of icwa notice issues on appeal.see,in re marinna th,d marinna.as this court has held,t he notice requirements serve the interests of the indian tribes irrespective of the positions of the parents and can not be waived by the parent.citation.a parent in a dependency proceeding is permitted to raise icwa issues not only in the juvenile court,but also on appeal even where,as here,no mention was made of the issue in the juvenile court.in re justin th,d.the department argues,however,that this general principle should not apply when the issue of icwa compliance was raised in a prior appeal.citing in re th,d and in re amber th,d amber,the department contends that appellant forfeited any argument regarding proper icwa notice because she failed to object at the hearing on remand.in essence,the department position is that at some point the burden must be placed on the parents to establish that their child is an indian child.we disagree.
in,supra,th at page,d,the appellate court barred a second appeal relating to compliance with icwa notice provisions.in that case,after remand from the initial appeal involving icwa notice,the agency sent notices to indian tribes and four tribes responded.id.at,d.the court found that icwa notice requirements had been satisfied and that the minor was not an indian child.id.at,d.the parents raised no objection regarding the adequacy of the notices.ibid.the parents then appealed and sought a writ of habeas corpus,claiming that the notices included inaccurate and potentially incomplete information.id.at,d.the court concluded that the parents forfeited a second appeal of icwa notice issues.id.at,d.the court explained as a matter of respect for the children involved and the judicial system,as well as common sense,it is incumbent on parents on remand to assist the agency in ensuring proper notice is given.here,for instance,the inadequacies in the notices,a misspelling and the apparent use of a nickname,could easily have been rectified at the juvenile court given a timely objection.ibid.
similarly,in the first appeal in amber,the appellate court remanded for lack of compliance with icwa notice requirements.amber,supra,th at,d.on remand,the social worker sent a second round of notices and the juvenile court again found that icwa did not apply.id.at,d.the mother appealed a second time and argued that no notice was sent to one identified tribe,that one mailing was misaddressed,and that the wrong information was sent to the tribes.id.at,d.the court,relying on,held that the mother forfeited the issue by failing to bring the errors to the attention of the juvenile court.id.at,d.the amber court theorized at this juncture,allowing mother to raise these issues on appeal for the first time opens the door to gamesmanship,a practice that is particularly reprehensible in the juvenile dependency arena.ibid.
we decline to follow and amber first,this appeal presents only the first challenge to icwa notice in the prior appeal,we found that the department had failed even to inquire of indian ancestry pursuant to icwa.both and amber dealt with successive challenges to icwa notice.see,supra,th at,d concluding that congress did not intend to require successive or serial appeals challenging icwa notices for the first time on appeal.second,unlike,we are not presented with a situation in which the allegedly deficient notice was based on the notice content and,thus,related to the information provided by or within the purview of the appellant.here,the alleged notice deficiencies failure to send to the tribal chairpersons or designated agents and an incorrect address were solely the result of the department actions and within the department control.finally,although some of the facts of amber may be analogous,we disagree with the underlying rationale.invoking the forfeiture doctrine because appellant raised an icwa inquiry issue in a prior appeal would give the department a free pass in complying with icwa based solely on its previous icwa failure.such a result is contrary to icwa purpose and to the principle that the interest in proper icwa notice belongs to the same tribes that may have received deficient notice,or no notice at all.we find no statutory support or persuasive policy basis for shifting the burden of icwa compliance to the child parents,even if icwa was raised in a prior appeal.we regret that icwa errors often delay the resolution of dependency proceedings,but can not conclude that the prospect of such a delay excuses at the expense of those that icwa is intended to protect.see kahlen,supra,d at.rejecting forfeiture argument w hile we recognize the need for timely resolution of child custody proceedings,respondent can not benefit from the delay it created.
we reject the department forfeiture argument and therefore turn to the merits of appellant claim.
notice to the indian tribes 
in the context of juvenile dependency proceedings,notice to indian tribes is governed by both federal and state law.icwa provides that if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved in an involuntary state court proceeding,the party seeking foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the indian child tribe a.section,subdivision b reiterates that n otice shall be sent whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved,and for every hearing thereafter unless it is determined that the indian child welfare act does not apply to the case.at the time notice was sent in this case february,the applicable rule in the california rules of court further provided that if the court knows or has reason to know that the child is or may be an indian child,the enumerated notice procedures must be followed.former rule f,as amended effective january,italics added.these procedures included sending a form via registered or certified mail with return receipt requested,addressing the notice to the tribal chairperson or other designated agent for service,and sending notice to all tribes of which the child may be a member or may be eligible for membership.former rule f,as amended january.
at the least,the information in this case gave the court reason to know that alice may be an indian child.in completing the form,appellant stated that alice is or may be a member of,or eligible for membership in,an apache navajo tribe.the ambiguity in the form and the omission of more detailed information,such as specific tribal affiliation or tribal roll number,do not negate appellant stated belief that alice may be a member of a tribe or eligible for membership.
the department and csac nevertheless maintain that the information provided in this case triggered only a duty of further inquiry,and not the specific notice requirements of section and the rules of court.senate bill,enacted in,added several provisions to the welfare and institutions code,including sections through.bill reg.sess.stats,ch.csac contends that the codification of icwa notice requirements in section and related sections rejected established california caselaw regarding the standard required to trigger notice.csac argues that the requirement in section that notice be sent whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved makes clear that notice is not required unless there is a specific claim that the parent or child is a member or eligible for membership in an indian tribe.italics added.csac views the inclusion of the is involved language as repudiation of california caselaw that has consistently held that a suggestion that the child is an indian child is sufficient to invoke notice.see,in re merrick th,d the juvenile court needs only a suggestion of indian ancestry to trigger the notice requirement in re nikki th,d same dwayne superior court th,d reviewing cases and concluding that,in accordance with federal guidelines,courts have interpreted the icwa notice provision broadly finding statement that child has cherokee indian heritage sufficient to trigger notice.
we reject this argument.first,the legislature did not adopt new notice language in senate bill,but codified the existing federal requirement in state statute.as csac notes,the is involved language is taken directly from icwa itself.see a.thus,section adopted the same language california courts relied upon in fleshing out the notice standard prior to the enactment of senate bill.see,marinna,supra,th,d explaining that a requires the department to notify the indian child tribe of the proceedings if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved and concluding that icwa notice requirements were therefore violated because the court had reason to know the minor was an indian child of cherokee heritage.in this context,we can not conclude that the codification of the is involved language is necessarily a rejection of caselaw on the issue of notice.
second,contrary to csac contention that senate bill notably excluded from the determination of indian child status those terms found in caselaw such as mere hint or suggestion of indian heritage,section explicitly adopts such language.section,which is titled d etermination whether child is an indian child considerations scope of inquiry,states the circumstances that may provide reason to know the child is an indian child include,but are not limited to,the following a person having an interest in the child provides information suggesting the child is a member of a tribe or eligible for membership in a tribe or one or more of the child biological parents,grandparents,or are or were a member of the tribe,subd.b,italics added see also rule a a reiterating that information suggesting that child is an indian child may provide reason to know the child is an indian child.even if,as csac suggests,this type of language establishes a lower threshold for triggering notice than that found in the federal statute,we must apply california law.as discussed below,see infra section,section provides that the court shall follow california law if it provides a higher level of protection to the indian tribe.see,subd.d.bia guidelines state that the states may provide greater protection for rights guaranteed by icwa,as long as the additional protections do not deprive other parties of their rights under the act.see.
third,nothing in the bill text or stated legislative purpose suggests that the legislature intended to override or reject the california courts interpretation of icwa notice requirements.see generally stats,ch.the bill states only that it would revise,recast,and expand various provisions of state law to,among other things,apply to certain children who do not come within the definition of an indian child id.at.section legislative findings and declarations indian child custody proceedings reiterates the state commitment to protecting the essential tribal relations and best interest of an indian child by placing the child,whenever possible,in a placement that reflects the unique values of the child tribal culture and is best able to assist the child in establishing,developing,and maintaining a political,cultural,and social relationship with the child tribe and tribal community,subd.a.these provisions do not suggest an intention to scale back icwa procedures,but an intent to expand,or at least broadly apply,icwa protection.absent clear language regarding the intent to abrogate existing law,we find no reason to reject years of established and caselaw.
as a final point,csac and the depart
