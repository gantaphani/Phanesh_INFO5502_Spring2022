this is an appeal from a proceeding in the district court under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction the hague convention,which governs certain child custody disputes.hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction.we begin with a description of the background events,drawn from the record in the district court,and of the proceedings that led to the present appeal.
erica pappalardo,an american citizen,and lucas nicolson,an australian serving as a soldier in his country armed forces,began a relationship in australia when pappalardo was traveling there.pappalardo moved in with nicolson and became pregnant.after she returned to the united states,nicolson proposed marriage over the telephone,and she accepted and returned to australia where the couple was married in august.they moved to townsville,where nicolson was posted for service in the australian defense force.
in november,when pappalardo was eight months pregnant,nicolson told her he did not love her and was unsure whether marrying her had been a mistake.pappalardo,upset,told nicolson she wanted to move back to the united states as soon as she and the child were medically cleared to travel.but the couple continued to live together in australia pappalardo says they did so,despite continuing marital problems,because she was financially dependent on nicolson and could not travel with a baby until the baby was three months old.
their daughter,was born in december.until march,all three resided together in townsville.that month,nicolson and pappalardo arranged for a passport for says merely so could visit pappalardo family in the united states,but pappalardo says nicolson knew of and reluctantly acceded to her plans to move herself and permanently to the united states.
in exchange for nicolson signing for the child passport,pappalardo agreed to give the marriage another chance.nicolson says this trial was for three months,but pappalardo denies making any duration promises.she also claims that nicolson did nothing in the following months to repair the marriage.
the couple made preparations for pappalardo and travel,packing or shipping a large quantity of belongings including medical records and transferring title to the couple car from pappalardo to nicolson.on march,nicolson drove pappalardo and to the airport to fly to sydney where pappalardo mother would assist in their travel to the united states.the next day,in sydney,pappalardo mentioned to nicolson mother and sister that she did not plan to return.
nicolson mother informed nicolson,who immediately flew to sydney and angrily confronted pappalardo at her hotel about her intentions pappalardo said she was unsure.he met with an attorney that day but told pappalardo the next day that he would not pursue legal action because he wanted her to return with on her own accord.she said she was open to working on their relationship.on april,she and flew to the united states.
at first,the couple communicated regularly via and internet video chat.at nicolson request,pappalardo reserved a late may return airline ticket to australia for herself,with s.to sit on her lap.pappalardo claims nicolson began harassing her with profane phone calls,text messages,and threats.on may,after meeting with a counselor,pappalardo had an epiphany that their marriage would never work and notified nicolson that she and s.would not return to australia.
on may,pappalardo filed a complaint in maine state court seeking an ex parte temporary order for protection from abuse pfa against nicolson,which was granted immediately and served on nicolson on june.in the meantime,nicolson filed an application for then disclosed to the central authority of australia,pursuant to the hague convention.the convention,to which the united states and australia are parties,can result in an order requiring the return to its habitual residence of a child wrongfully taken or retained.
on september,nicolson maine attorney attended the hearing on the final pfa order,but nicolson did not attend and was denied permission to testify telephonically.the court was not told that nicolson was pursuing hague convention relief because nicolson says he was so advised by australian authorities in case it might prompt pappalardo to flee with instead,his attorney and pappalardo lawyer agreed to entry of a pfa order dated september,which is central to this appeal.
the order recited in a checked box with form language that t he parties have agreed to the following order,which is made without findings of abuse the phrase admission was added in handwriting.further checked boxes limited nicolson contact with pappalardo save that in the checked box form provision dealing with temporary parental rights and responsibilities custody of minor child ren,nicolson was given limited internet contact with the child.that checked box reads as follows the underlined portion being handwritten 
the plaintiff pappalardo is awarded temporary parental rights and responsibilities custody of minor child ren,whose names and dates of birth are as follows dob to be amended by court of competent jurisdiction.pa obo to be dismissed upon issuance of final fm order.
the defendant rights of contact are limited as follows pending further order in family matter,defendant nicolson may have reasonable contact via skype or other video conference system at least once per week and regular updates about child by regular contact.in emergency phone contact is permitted.defendant is granted access to records of child.
a closing form paragraph,on the second page of the form order,stated that the order would remain in effect for a specified this case,a date two years hence was inserted unless earlier modified or vacated by order of court or,with respect to child support or parental rights and responsibilities,by a magistrate.on october,pappalardo filed a suit for divorce in the state court.
on october,nicolson filed in federal district court in maine a petition seeking return of the child to australia,claiming under the hague convention that pappalardo had wrongfully retained s.in the united states the convention provides for the return of a child whose removal or retention in another country is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and those custody rights were actually exercised at the time.a.
under the convention,the this case the burden of proving wrongful removal or retention by a preponderance of the evidence.e.to do this,he must show that habitual residence was australia immediately prior to the retention,that he had custody rights over at the time,and that he was exercising those custody rights.hague convention.in this case,pappalardo challenged only the first of the three,but she also claimed that nicolson had consented to or acquiesced in the child retention,two separate exceptions under the convention.
the district court,in an extensive decision following the taking of evidence,concluded that habitual residence was australia,that nicolson had possessed and retained joint custody rights,and that he had not consented or acquiesced to pappalardo permanent retention of in the united states through the state court proceedings or otherwise.the court ordered return to australia.pappalardo appealed to this court which granted a temporary stay but expedited this appeal.
on this appeal,the issues of habitual residence,consent and acquiescence require discussion,and we begin with habitual residence.the hague convention does not define habitual residence,but the majority of federal circuits to consider it have adopted an approach that begins with the parents shared intent or settled purpose regarding their child residence in an unpublished opinion,this circuit has employed that approach.zuker andrews.lexis,at cir.
on appeal pappalardo argues only that never formed an initial habitual residence in australia.sensibly,she does not claim that,assuming habitual residence was australia prior to the move back to maine,merely retaining the child in maine without nicolson consent or acquiescence would establish a new habitual residence.so we are not concerned with the standards for evaluating such a claim.robert tesson,cir concerning differing tests on change of habitual residence.
pappalardo thesis is that she never shared nicolson intent for to reside habitually in australia because the couple marital relationship broke down and pappalardo formed the intent to leave with before the child was born.the district court,however,found that while their marriage was fraught with difficulties from the beginning and t here were numerous conversations about the viability of the marriage,both before and after was born,t hey lived together as a married couple from the time of their marriage until march,and shared responsibilities for until that time,when she was over three months old.
knowing nothing of private reservations,an objective observer would view as an australian resident her father was a citizen of the country and obliged to stay there during his term of service her mother,being pregnant,had returned to australia to marry him they had married there and were living together there at the time of birth and was born there and lived there for several months with both her parents.judged by nicolson actions incident to pappalardo departure,pappalardo intent to move permanently to the united states seemingly became manifest and definitive only at that time.
as against this,pappalardo position rests centrally on her earlier declaration to nicolson that she would move back to the united states and her testimony that her subjective intent at the time of the birth was not to remain in australia.she relies on the proposition that w here the parents relationship has broken down contemporaneous ly with the birth of the child,no habitual residence may ever come into existence.delvoye lee,cir.but the circumstances in that case were strikingly different.
in delvoye,the mother had traveled to a foreign country merely to save expenses by giving birth there instead of in her home country and with the intention from the outset of staying only a short time.id.at.here,the marriage was certainly troubled at the time of birth,but the evidence did not require,and the district judge did not make,a finding that a definitive breakdown had occurred before or at the time of the child birth.pappalardo behavior even after the birth remained equivocal as to her ultimate plans.
although pappalardo told nicolson mother that she was not going to return from maine,she was apparently willing to consider a reconciliation even after her arrival in the united states.in fact,she agreed before leaving to give the marriage a further trial and,in maine,reserved a may ticket to return to australia.by her own testimony,it was after she returned to the united seemingly in part because of nicolson alleged abusive she reached an epiphany that the marriage was over.
pappalardo assumes that,if she were credited with a fixed subjective intent to take her daughter permanently to the united states,then all other circumstances would be irrelevant.but s tanding alone,of course,the mother intent that the child should one day live in the united states could not support a finding of habitual residence.ruiz tenorio,n cir.ruiz accords with our own view that the law is less rigid than pappalardo assumes and that tests of habitual residence must be applied to the circumstances of the case 
it is not easy here to attach an abstract label to a complex of discrete facts,some of which push each way,especially as we are concerned with the subjective intent of two individuals and the objective circumstances of three.the district judge raw fact findings can be reversed only for clear error,whallon lynn,cir,and in this circuit some deference might also be given to his application of the standard,bolton taylor,cir.we think the district court decision on this issue must stand.
a child retained abroad over objection must be returned to his or her state of habitual residence unless the respondent can establish one of the defenses or exceptions.hague convention,friedrich friedrich,cir.pertinently,the district court is not bound to order the return of if pappalardo establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that nicolson had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in pappalardo removal or retention of hague convention a e b.the exceptions are narrow and must be narrowly construed.a state department text and legal analysis of the hague international child abduction convention.
we begin with consent,an inquiry that focuses on nicolson intent prior to the child retention,baxter baxter,cir pappalardo acquiescence claim on appeal rests on the consent order entered after the retention.consent may be evinced by the petitioner statements or conduct,which can be rather informal.mena,cir.pappalardo claims that a variety of conduct and circumstances establish that nicolson both knew and consented to permanent departure from australia.
pappalardo points to several facts already participation in extensive preparations for her and trip and the transfer of the car to others nicolson invitation to a male friend to move into the house after his family departure,nicolson mother expressing sadness at losing the child,nicolson internet posts on that described departure as my loss of my family and his baby girl ha ving been ripped from him and his change of status on that website from married to single which he quickly changed back,and various other statements 
but nicolson can also point to circumstances in his favor consistent with his testimony that he believed pappalardo and would return to australia and did not consent to more than a temporary stay for in the united states.these include his immediate arrangement for leave to fly to sydney to confront pappalardo and seek legal advice after his mother informed him of pappalardo intentions,pappalardo statements that she was open to continuing to work on their marriage,his efforts to persuade her to return thereafter and her reservation of a ticket to return.
nowhere is it claimed that nicolson expressly agreed that the child could move permanently to the united states.his behavior is at least as consistent with that of a man who wanted to continue the marriage and,therefore,to avoid forcing a final choice on his wife.if the district court had found consent,it might not have been easy to find this clear error or an unreasonable assessment but,in finding that pappalardo has not carried her burden to show consent to a permanent relocation of the child,the finding is no less protected against reversal.
the outcome of the case,therefore,turns finally on issue that the district court,in a generally thorough opinion,moved past rather quickly perhaps reasonably so given the general language of american cases on the issue.but we view most of the cases as distinguishable and not directly answering the question whether nicolson acquiesced to pappalardo retention of in the united states by his the maine state court entry of the pfa order.
the district court concluded that the pfa order could not bar nicolson petition because the hague convention takes precedence over state custody determinations.true,under the convention t he sole fact that a decision relating to custody has been given in or is entitled to recognition in the requested state shall not be a ground for refusing to return a child under this convention.emphasis added.the convention,after all,confers the privilege of deciding custody on the state of habitual residence.b.
but it remains a defense to the convention requirement of return to show that the party invoking a right to have the child returned acquiesced in retention and it is hard to think of a more formal acquiescence than entering into a consent order providing that the other parent be awarded custody.the consent order in this case provided only for temporary custody but,if it were read as agreeing to let the maine courts determine final custody as pappalardo claims,we would think that this was an acquiescence or,alternatively,a waiver of hague convention rights.journe journe,voluntary dismissal of custody action treated as waiver.
