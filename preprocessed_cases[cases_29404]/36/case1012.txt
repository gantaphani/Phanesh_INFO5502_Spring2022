background 
kwong and gong divorced in september,signing a marital settlement agreement msa that was incorporated into the judgment of dissolution.as relevant here,the msa required kwong to pay per month child support for the couple two children then and until the children reached the ages of and.kwong also agreed,and was required,to pay of the children college expenses.the msa further provided that in the event either party was required to bring any action or proceeding to enforce any of its provisions,the prevailing party would be entitled to recover attorney fees from the other party.
kwong almost immediately reneged on the msa,paying only a few months child support to gong.he also made a single payment of directly to the parties older child to offset some of that child college expenses.in november,gong filed a motion seeking,in part,to compel kwong to pay in child support arrearages and for college expenses.the parties ultimately reached a settlement under which kwong agreed to pay gong to satisfy his existing obligations to her.this settlement failed when kwong did not make the required payment.in january,gong filed another motion to enforce kwong obligations.in that motion gong also asked the court to determine the amount of kwong arrearages,issue a charging order and appoint a receiver to collect the amounts owed by kwong from his partnership interest in milpitas green.the matter was heard on may,and june,by judge steven dylina,who ruled kwong owed gong for child support arrearages and for of their children college expenses.judge dylina also appointed a receiver and issued a charging order against kwong interest in milpitas green to satisfy his obligations under the judgment.judge dylina ordered kwong to pay attorney fees to gong in the amount of.these rulings were set forth in an august,proposed statement of decision,an august,statement of decision,and,later in the court order on the rulings,entered on march,kwong received a statement of arrearages as of may,and a projected repayment schedule.thereafter,kwong obligations were paid down by means of quarterly payments of,beginning june,from his partnership interest in milpitas green.each quarter he received a statement showing the balance due,which he never disputed.
in early september,kwong,represented by mattaniah eytan and eric schenk of the law offices of mattaniah eytan,filed a motion seeking an order he had satisfied his obligation,claiming the receiver had collected more from kwong than he owed he also sought attorney fees from gong,and a statutory penalty for failure to file a satisfaction of judgment.see code civ.kwong calculations were premised on the theory that the amount of arrearages reflected in judge dylina order was the amount owed when the charging order was filed,march,rather than the date of the hearing,june.
judge dylina proposed statement of decision,statement of decision,and order all recited the current amount due for child support was and kwong obligations for the children college expenses is now the sum of.based on this wording,kwong argued judge dylina order set the amount of his obligation as of march,the date the order was filed.if that is the correct interpretation of this order,then judge dylina relieved kwong from any support obligations for the period from may to march,and also relieved him from any obligation to pay interest on his existing obligations for the same period.kwong argued he was relieved from these obligations because the words current and now are unambiguous and meant the amount due as of the march,entry of the order,not as of the time the evidence was adduced the court rendered its decision.
judge clifford cretan,who heard kwong motion,rejected his theory,finding,as quite clearly is true,judge dylina used the word current to refer to the date the evidence of kwong obligations was admitted judge cretan specifically found that the february order did not impact the child support order,which remained and continued on.he characterized his own decision as a common sense reading of the order,stating,otherwise,it would mean that judge dylina,in fact,held a hearing,reached a result,and then just called time out for eight or nine months while everybody agreed on the preparation of the final document that those nine months became nonexistent,basically,for both current support and interest calculations.i do believe that could have been his intention.and certainly,in reading the statement of decision,i do believe it was.
kwong has appealed,again asserting the terms current and now in the march,order are unambiguous and the order therefore must be read to state the full extent of his obligations as of that date.gong has filed a responsive brief.she also has filed a motion for sanctions against kwong for filing a frivolous appeal.we notified the parties we would consider imposing sanctions and invited them to address the question of sanctions at oral argument.see cal.rules of court,rules e e in re marriage of flaherty cal d,d flaherty finding due process requires a court imposing sanctions to provide the affected party or attorney notice,an opportunity to be heard,and a written order reciting in detail the circumstances justifying the sanction.

california courts have the inherent power to dismiss frivolous appeals.san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement th,d people ex rel.lockyer brar th,d.in addition,code of civil procedure section provides that w hen it appears to the reviewing court that the appeal was frivolous or taken solely for delay,it may add to the costs on appeal such damages as may be just.california rules of court,rule e allows the court to impose sanctions on a party or an attorney for the taking of a frivolous appeal or appealing solely to cause delay.an appeal is frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.citation.flaherty,supra,cal d at.the first standard is tested subjectively.the focus is on the good faith of appellant and counsel.the second is tested objectively.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group to.while each of the above standards provides independent authority for a sanctions award,in practice the two standards usually are used together with one providing evidence of the other.thus,the total lack of merit of an appeal is viewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay.citations.id.at.
there is no question whatsoever what judge dylina meant when he signed an order setting forth kwong child support and college expenses obligations.judge dylina used the figures supported by gong evidence at the hearing on her motion,which,of course,calculated the sums owed as of may.the order judge dylina signed on february,is entitled,order after hearing on may,and june.there is no reasonable basis to conclude judge dylina use of those figures in the order meant he had decided either that no additional sums accrued between the
