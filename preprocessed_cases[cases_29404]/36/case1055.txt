this is a dependency case in which a mother was arrested in california and extradited to florida.her daughter,who tested positive for opiates and cocaine because her mother was breastfeeding her while using drugs,was placed with foster parents.at the mother request,her sister did everything she could to have the child placed with her in florida,but the florida child welfare authorities refused to expedite the process and almost a year elapsed before the florida family obtained a foster care license.meanwhile and inevitably,the child now almost three years old and a complete stranger to her florida family bonded with her foster parents who are eager to adopt her.the dependency court,placing the child best interests first,terminated the mother parental rights and designated the foster parents as the child prospective adoptive family.the mother still incarcerated in florida appeals.we affirm.
margaret gave birth to lauren in january.nine months later,a police officer investigating a report of drug activity found margaret,lauren and a man in a parked car,ran a check on margaret driver license,and discovered a florida warrant for her arrest for drug trafficking and grand theft charges.margaret was arrested and booked for child endangerment as well as extradition on the florida warrant.when interviewed that evening by the department of children and family services,margaret said she was a heroin addict,that she had left florida in,and that she had been living in motels in california.she said her mother and sister lived in florida,and asked that lauren be placed with one or the other while margaret attended a drug program.lauren was detained and placed in foster care in los angeles.
a petition was filed on october,alleging that margaret had failed to protect lauren and that lauren was at risk based upon margaret drug problems in spite of her drug use,margaret was breastfeeding lauren.welf,subds.b,g,i.later that month,the department reported that margaret had a criminal history in florida theft,drug offenses,possession of a firearm,robbery,auto theft,possession of stolen property,and that lauren father could not be located he never was,and recommended the usual reunification services,random drug testing,and monitored visits,all of which were ordered.
in november,the department reported that margaret,then years old,had continuously used drugs since high school,and that she had been raised by an alcoholic mother and an abusive alcoholic stepfather.margaret asked the department to place lauren with her youngest sister,fanny,in florida.fanny and her husband,an electrician,have a daughter who was then months old,and they own their home in florida.according to margaret,fanny was willing to care for lauren until margaret was released from prison and,to that end,had initiated the process to obtain a florida foster care license.with a view toward reunification,the department asked the dependency court to expedite the procedures required by the interstate compact on the placement of children the icpc,et to determine fanny based on the uncertainty about the charges pending against margaret,also recommended concurrent permanency planning.meanwhile,lauren had been placed with foster parents john and bruce who had been to adopt.
margaret in custody appeared at a november hearing and submitted on the petition.the dependency court struck some of the allegations and,as amended,sustained the petition and ordered the department to complete an expedited icpc investigation of fanny.
the social worker submitted the paperwork for expedited icpc procedures to the department icpc coordinator in early november,but the papers were returned to the social worker because florida requires the court signature.the court signature was obtained on november and all of the required forms were sent to florida by december.
two days later,the department icpc coordinator learned from fanny that margaret had been extradited to florida.during their conversation,the icpc coordinator explained that fanny home had to be licensed by florida before california could send lauren to her,and also explained that if margaret was incarcerated for more than months,reunification would be short,that fanny would have to decide whether she and her husband were willing to become lauren permanent adoptive parents.fanny,shocked and disheartened,nevertheless said her family wanted to have a relationship with lauren and would go through with the icpc.she did not commit to adoption.
in response to a telephone call from fanny and an inquiry from the alliance for children rights about expediting the process by changing the icpc request to a relative placement home study instead of foster care,the social worker explained to fanny on january,that lauren would not qualify for the federal funds for which she is eligible unless fanny is a licensed caregiver,and that the florida licensing process takes three months and could not be expedited.the icpc coordinator also told fanny that she could forgo federal funding.when fanny asked whether lauren could come to her for an extended visit,the social worker explained that the department could not send a child to another state without icpc approval.by that time,fanny recognized the problem,commenting to the social worker that,by the time we are licensed,she will have been with her foster parents for months.i know it will be traumatic for her to move.fanny called back the next day and told the social worker that her family would forgo federal funding and obtain a relative home study in lieu of a foster care license.she still did not commit to adoption.
about two weeks later,the social worker learned from the department adoption coordinator that it is important to have a licensed foster care home study on a potential adoptive family because the adoption home study can be completed much more quickly with a completed licensed home study and that florida will not even begin the adoption home study process until florida has been provided proof that there are no legal barriers to adoption.the social worker presented the problem to a resource team within the department,and the decision was made to request the expedited relative home study while continuing the foster care licensing and home study so that the relative family could still be considered for funding.at that point,the department was strongly focused on a secure permanent plan for lauren and did not support any concurrent plan that did not involve the child adoption.the social worker asked the department icpc coordinator to immediately submit the expedited icpc relative home study request to florida.
on january,florida informed the department that it would not accept the expedited relative home study request unless the request was signed by a judge rather than a referee,and that it would not accept the request for an expedited review because it was based on a november minute order.the social worker explained the reasons for the delay,and the icpc coordinator informed her florida counterparts that there was no basis for questioning the referee signature.
at the same time the department was trying to expedite the icpc process,the social worker was trying to locate margaret within the florida prison system.when the social worker finally obtained a jail mailing address,she wrote to margaret,explaining what she should do while incarcerated enroll in and similar programs and how to reach the department,and asking margaret for documentation for completed classes and programs.margaret called the social worker on january,and said she was facing a maximum of months in prison and possibly only probation.the social worker called the florida state attorney office and other agencies in johns,florida,in search of more information,but her calls were not returned.
for her part,lauren was living with her foster parents,to whom she was very bonded.her foster parents conscientiously attended to lauren medical problems,their adoption home study was completed and approved,and they maintained regular contact with fanny,repeatedly urging her to call them directly for reports about lauren progress.
at a hearing held on january,the dependency court expressed its frustration with the icpc process and,more specifically,florida intransigence at a point where time was critical.when lauren lawyer asked whether the court would agree to have fanny just come and take lauren and we can close the case,the court explained that it could not do so without florida approval.the court urged the department to do everything it could before the next hearing,and offered to make phone calls if that would help.
shortly after the january hearing,a new social worker took over lauren case,and in april the replacement social worker went on unexpected medical leave and the case file was dispersed.the original social worker took charge temporarily,but the practical effect was that nothing happened between january and april in california or florida.on april,florida informed the department that it could not complete an expedited home study before may because it needed fingerprint checks from the fbi.on april,margaret called to report that she expected to be sentenced to at least some time in prison.finally,on april,the department icpc coordinator received word that florida had approved fanny home study report,and the department was formally notified of the approval on april.
in its report for the may hearing,the department noted margaret preference for lauren placement with fanny under a guardianship but recommended against it based upon margaret history of drug addiction and her substantial criminal record.assuming that margaret received a sentence,she would not have been released until may,and the department viewed her hopes for reunification as unrealistic.
the department also recommended against placing lauren with fanny,in part because florida would require fanny family to obtain medicaid for lauren and to pay for any uncovered medical expenses.because lauren may have medical problems and developmental issues concerning speech and language due to her drug exposure,the department had serious concerns about fanny ability to provide the required amount of care.more importantly,the department was concerned that fanny expected to rely on her mother to help with lauren same alcoholic mother who margaret blamed for her drug addiction and from whose care margaret had been removed at age.the department questioned fanny commitment to lauren,noting that her calls to the foster parents and the department were to discuss the icpc procedures,and that it was only as an afterthought that she ever inquired about lauren,and concluded that fanny,although willing to adopt lauren if necessary,still hoped to see the child returned to margaret and planned to take her to visit margaret in prison.the department did not question the florida relatives good intentions,but feared they might be placing margaret interests above lauren.
the department noted that florida had recently privatized its child welfare system,creating an upheaval in child welfare services and raising doubts about whether lauren would receive consistent and appropriate monitoring from child protective services in the state of florida.the department emphasized its policy and the law,which both are clear that children of lauren age deserve the most permanent and stable plan available at the earliest opportunity.in lauren case,this plan is clearly adoption and it is not appropriate to grant a guardianship,and certainly not appropriate to consider long term foster care for such a young and adoptable child.the department noted that lauren foster parents had an excellent relationship with her,and were providing her with a safe and nurturing home.given all these considerations,the department recommended that it was in lauren best interest to be adopted by her foster parents.
at the may hearing,the court granted the foster parents request for de facto parent status and appointed counsel for both the foster parents and for fanny and her husband.margaret lawyer told the court that margaret would be released the next day into a treatment program,and counsel asked for additional reunification services for her.the trial court,noting that no matter what,this is going to be a heartbreak for somebody,continued the hearing to june,and ordered the department to make sure that both margaret and fanny would be available by telephone that day.
before the june hearing,the dependency court learned that margaret lawyer had been mistaken and that,in fact,margaret had been sentenced to state prison for a term of three years.accordingly,the court found on june that there was no possibility for margaret to complete her case plan within the statutorily mandated time,that she had not stayed in touch with lauren,and that the department had provided adequate reunification services to margaret.the court terminated reunification services and set a section hearing.although the court expressly ordered the department to notify margaret of her right to seek relief by writ petition,margaret never received the notice.
by july,fanny and her husband had completed all the requirements to become licensed foster caregivers.for their part,lauren foster parents,with whom she had by then been living for nine months,agreed to an open adoption that would include regular contact between lauren and margaret and lauren other florida relatives.the department position was adoption by the foster parents,the only family she had ever known,was in lauren best interest,and that it would not be in her best interest to transfer her to a family she had never met.at a july hearing,the court denied fanny request for de facto parent status,but urged fanny to visit lauren in california she never did and to have regular telephone contact with the foster parents,and encouraged the foster parents and the family to find a mutually satisfactory arrangement.
in november,fanny and the foster parents but not margaret signed an agreement for post adoption contact guaranteeing fanny right to visits with lauren,memorializing fanny consent to lauren adoption by the foster parents,and allowing margaret to visit lauren.in court,margaret lawyer join ed with the relatives and thanked the foster parents and fanny for working out the agreement.
the section hearing was held on february.margaret appearing telephonically asked for further reunification services,objected to the termination of her parental rights,objected to the foster parents adoption of lauren,and insisted that,notwithstanding fanny agreement with the foster parents,she wanted lauren placed in florida.the by lauren termination of margaret parental rights and adoption by the foster parents.
after noting that lauren had just turned two,the court found that margaret had been unable to establish a relationship with lauren during the pendency of the case,terminated margaret parental rights,found lauren adoptable,and designated the foster parents as the prospective adoptive parents.margaret appeals.
lauren,now almost three years old,has spent all but the first nine months of her life with her foster parents.she has not seen her mother during that time,and she has never met fanny or fanny family.margaret nevertheless claims that,because she received inadequate reunification services,the order terminating her parental rights should be reversed and that lauren should be placed with fanny in florida we disagree.
margaret contends,the department concedes,and we agree that,because she did not receive notice of her right to file a writ petition challenging the dependency court termination of reunification services,margaret may challenge that order on this appeal,subd.l in re cathina th,d.
but we do not agree with margaret contention that she received inadequate reunification services.
first,the issue was waived by margaret failure to object at the time services were terminated.indeed,when the dependency court inquired of her attorney whether there was any information that would allow the court to find there was a substantial probability of return at the date,margaret lawyer responded,not at this time,your honor.i will certainly file a section petition if that is not the case.in re cal th,d,in re dakota th,d in re lorenzo th,d in re kevin th,d in re riva d.no section petition was ever filed.
second,the argument fails on the merits because substantial evidence supports the dependency court order.the department identified the problems leading to the loss of custody,offered services designed to remedy those problems,maintained reasonable contact with margaret under the circumstances,and made heroic efforts to assist margaret in areas where compliance proved difficult.in re riva,supra,d at.armando superior court th,d.the problems were drug addiction and it was the resolution of those problems that proved insurmountable because margaret was in custody in florida and the florida officials did little if anything to a assist the department in its efforts to comply with the icpc procedures so that lauren could be placed with fanny or b respond to the department inquiries about margaret status within the florida criminal justice system 
despite these problems,the social worker tracked down margaret,wrote to her,and spoke to her by telephone,explaining the types of programs she could search for in prison and encouraging her to stay in touch by telephone.beyond this,there was nothing the department could do margaret.lauren was too young to talk to her mother by telephone,and for all practical purposes actual visits were out of the question.see,subd.e the department is not obligated to provide reunification services to an incarcerated parent when those services would be detrimental to the child.and it can not be disputed that the department provided reasonable services to fanny who may in our view justifiably blame the florida child welfare officials for the delay,but not the california department of children and family services,subd.e d services to an incarcerated parent may include services to extended family members.
because margaret placed herself out of the reach of any meaningful rehabilitative services the department could have provided,no more was required.elijah superior court th,d and see in re brittany th,d criticizing the failure to provide reunification services for a mother incarcerated in facilities that were less than miles from where the child lived.
margaret contends the dependency court abused its discretion when it refused to place lauren with fanny.we disagree 
it is true,as margaret contends,that family preservation is the first priority when dependency proceedings are commenced.in re elizabeth th,d.it is for precisely this reason that the department did everything within its power to expedite the icpc process so that lauren could be placed with fanny in florida.reluctance to agree to adoption,the issues about lauren present and future medical needs and the attendant concerns about fanny willingness to relinquish lauren claim to federal funding and,primarily,florida frustrating refusal to acknowledge the human element of these proceedings and its bureaucratic adherence to its own time arose and time went by.lauren,now about three years old,bonded with her foster parents.fanny,notwithstanding her apparent financial security and the dependency court urging,did not visit and remained a stranger.under these circumstances,lauren best interests have to prevail over all other considerations,and those interests are plainly served only by adoption by her foster parents.in re stephanie cal th,d,even when the preference applies,it does not overcome the juvenile court duty to determine the best interest of the child in re robert th,d the child best interest must be the linchpin of the court analysis in re luke th,d in re diamond th,d.
we therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to place lauren with fanny,and trust margaret understands that severing the family unit the foster parents have created would have devastating consequences to lauren best interests.crystal superior court th,d.
disposition 
the orders are affirmed.
i dissent on the ground that the dependency court erred in rejecting placement with margaret sister fanny and terminating margaret parental rights.as discussed below,the primary rationale for the majority decision is that so much time had elapsed since the commencement of the dependency proceeding that,by the time of the dependency court last hearing,lauren had bonded with her foster parents and thus would be better off with them than with her natural mother.the majority approach gives far too much weight to the amount of time that a child resides with a foster parent,gives inadequate weight to facts that warranted placement of lauren with her aunt family,and ignores the insidious effect on the child welfare system of using the failure of the system itself as justification for the termination of parental rights.
the paramount goal in the initial phase of dependency proceedings is family reunification.in re precious th,d family preservation,with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services,is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced.citation.the legislature has defined the child best interest as reunification throughout that phase unless the dependency court finds that reunification would be detrimental to the child.in re elizabeth th,d in re precious,supra,th at,d.absent a finding of detriment,even incarcerated parents are entitled to reasonable reunification services,whatever the likelihood of success.in re brittany th,d brittany the effort must be made to provide suitable services,in spite of the difficulties of doing so or the prospects of success.see also in re precious,supra,th at,d.visitation is a critical component,probably the most critical component,of a reunification plan.in re luke th,d see also in re monica th,d.the relative placement preference,another part of the initial phase of dependency proceedings,is designed to facilitate reunification and visitation by placing a child with caregivers who will favor the goals of reunification and visitation and will be less likely than other foster parents to compete with the biological parents for custody of the child.welf,cesar superior court th,d see also in re sarah th,d places the relative at the head of the line when the court is determining which placement is in the child best interests.only a fter the termination of reunification services does the parents interest in the care,custody and companionship of the child cease to be paramount.in re stephanie cal th,d,see also in re elizabeth th,d andrea superior court th,d.all of these considerations favor margaret position.
the majority offers several reasons for its decision affirming the denial of placement with fanny and termination of margaret parental rights,but its primary rationale is that so much time has passed that it is in lauren best interest to remain permanently with her foster parents and to terminate margaret parental rights.i address this rationale below.none of the other reasons offered by the majority as a basis for rejecting placement with margaret sister family and terminating parental rights warrants the result the majority favors.
the majority reliance on the opinion of the department of children and family services dcfs that fanny herself was not a preferable alternative to the california couple is not justified by the governing law or the facts in this case.the law of california clearly and indisputably prefers initial placement with a relative over placement with.section command s that relatives be assessed and considered favorably,subject to the juvenile court consideration of the suitability of the relative home and the best interests of the child during the reunification phase of dependency proceedings.in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
the record demonstrates that i margaret wished to have lauren placed with fanny and her family ii fanny and her husband were approved by the florida welfare agency as licensed caregivers iii fanny wanted lauren placed with her and was ready to adopt her or accept other permanent placement and iv placement with fanny would facilitate visitation by lauren with her mother.on this last point,the majority is correct that telephone and visitation were impossible because of lauren age and because her foster parents resided in los angeles.these facts argu
