factual and procedural background 
joanne and alvin embree were married on july.on january,joanne and alvin entered into a marital settlement agreement msa to dissolve their marriage.the msa,executed by both joanne and alvin,was approved by a judicial officer as an order of the court and recorded as an abstract of support judgment in august.the msa provided in a section entitled spousal support that alvin would pay monthly spousal support to joanne in the sum of until joanne remarried or he or joanne died,whichever occurred first.in addition,in a separate section of the msa entitled covenant to will,alvin agreed that,in the event he predeceased joanne,a trust or annuity would be established to provide joanne with the monthly sum of for as long as she lived 
alvin,who remarried following the dissolution of his marriage to joanne,died on may.alvin only known property,his home,was distributed to his widow and his children in accordance with a revocable trust he had established during his lifetime.his estate was not probated,and the trustee of his revocable living trust elected not to file a proposed notice to creditors under probate code section.no annuity or trust was established to provide payments to joanne.
on december,joanne filed this lawsuit against alvin widow and his children for declaratory relief and breach of contract and sought to impose a constructive trust on the property distributed to them under the terms of alvin revocable living trust.alvin heirs asserted the claims against them were under code of civil procedure sections and in a bifurcated proceeding the trial court agreed joanne claims against the beneficiaries of alvin living trust were.
contentions 
joanne contends the provision of the msa and order requiring creation of a lifetime annuity for her benefit upon alvin death is a spousal support judgment enforceable against the beneficiaries of alvin revocable living trust without regard to the limitations period generally applicable to claims of creditors against a deceased settlor estate.alternatively,she argues the limitations period applicable to her claim was tolled under principles of equitable estoppel.
discussion 
standard of review 
the facts are undisputed.the question whether joanne is barred from pursuing trust property distributed to the beneficiaries of alvin revocable living trust to satisfy her claim is a legal issue subject to de novo review.bily arthur young cal th,d,arluk medical center industrial group,dobler th,d dobler ii.
joanne claim for breach of the covenant to will provision of the msa is under section 
section,subdivision a,adopted by the legislature in,provides,if a person has a claim which arises from a promise or agreement with a decedent to distribution from an estate or trust or under other instrument,whether the promise or agreement was made orally or in writing,an action to enforce the claim to distribution may be commenced within one year after the date of death,and the limitations period that would have been applicable does not apply.alvin agreement to establish a trust upon his death to provide monthly payments to joanne appears to fall squarely within the ambit of section.accordingly,joanne claim,filed more than one year after alvin death,is.
emphasizing that the msa,which included alvin covenant to will,and subsequent court order were recorded as a judgment,joanne attempts to avoid the bar of section by arguing she is not attempting to enforce a claim subject to that section limitations period,but a spousal support judgment that,pursuant to family code section,remains enforceable until paid in full.as we discuss in the following part of this opinion,even if joanne were correct in her characterization of the covenant to will as a spousal support judgment a description alvin heirs do not dispute for purposes of this appeal,her action to satisfy that judgment from assets received by the beneficiaries of alvin revocable living trust is not timely.but the parties msa expressly provides that alvin obligation to pay spousal support terminated upon his death the agreement to establish a trust for joanne benefit upon alvin death is distinct from,and independent of,alvin support obligation.accordingly,while alvin covenant to will may in some respects have been incorporated into a family law judgment,which provides certain procedural safeguards to the judgment creditor joanne is simply wrong in insisting her claim is founded on a spousal support judgment within the meaning of family code section.see in re marriage of iberti th,d marital settlement agreements incorporated into a judgment are construed under the rules governing interpretation of contracts generally when no conflicting extrinsic evidence is offered and the facts are otherwise undisputed,appellate court applies the unambiguous contract terms to the undisputed facts as a matter of law.
the property distributed to alvin beneficiaries may not be used to satisfy joanne judgment because she failed to file her claim within one year of alvin death 
even if we were to agree with joanne that she is seeking to enforce a spousal support judgment,for all practical purposes the result is the same the property distributed to the beneficiaries of alvin revocable living trust is not available to satisfy her support judgment because she failed to file her claim within one year of alvin death.
after the death of a judgment debtor,the ability of a judgment creditor to reach property of the decedent debtor in satisfaction of the judgment is governed by the probate code,not by the enforcement of judgments law et ejl.see code civ,enforcing claims established by judgment except with respect to liens that have already been executed,any judgment creditor seeking to satisfy its money judgment with property of the decedent must file a timely claim in the probate proceeding,or in connection with a trust claims procedure,if one has been initiated.the judgment is then paid to the judgment creditor in the ordinary course of the administration of the estate or trust,dobler arluk medical center industrial group,th,d dobler i.if both the estate and trust are insufficient to satisfy the judgment,a judgment creditor that has preserved its claim by filing a timely claim may pursue trust property distributed to the beneficiaries of the decedent revocable living trust to the same extent the property would have been available to satisfy the judgment during the decedent settlor lifetime.dobler i,at,d dobler ii,supra,th at,d.failure to file a timely claim in the probate or trust claims proceeding forever bars the creditor from recovering against the property of the decedent,whether or not distributed,probate trust see also dobler ii,at,d.
if no probate or trust claims procedure has been initiated,however,as in the case at bar,the short limitations periods applicable to claims filed in probate or trust claims proceedings do not apply and the availability of trust property to any creditor of the deceased settlor shall be as otherwise provided by law.probate code section in turn,permits a creditor to proceed against property distributed to the beneficiaries of the judgment debtor revocable living trust,subject to the limitation period of section see valentine read th,d in absence of probate or trust claims proceeding,authorizes judgment creditor to pursue claim against distributees of decedent revocable living trust within one year of settlor death.if the creditor fails
