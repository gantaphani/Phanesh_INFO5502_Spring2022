discussion 
takeshi contends he was not properly identified as a defendant because his name was misspelled,and that service of the summons and the statement of damages was defective.he asserts that the judgment against him was therefore void and should have been set aside pursuant to sections,subdivision d,or,or under the court equitable power.
we first address takeshi contention that the judgment is invalid because the summons and complaint have his first name incorrectly spelled as takechi.
in his opening brief,takeshi entire argument regarding this issue is as follows a sic provides in relevant part the summons must be directed to the defendant and must contain the names of the parties to the action.he apparently wishes us to infer that guillermina violated section by misspelling his first name,but he cites no authority for this proposition.to the contrary,if the service is otherwise properly made,and the person served is aware that he is the person named as a defendant in the erroneous manner,jurisdiction is obtained.billings edwards d.see also brum ivins cal,i f it is shown that a person was served with process in an action brought against him,the judgment will bind him,although he may have been wrongly named there are cases of slight errors in spelling,which do not destroy the virtual identity of name such errors are disregarded entirely.
as we shall explain,service of process on takeshi was proper.further,he identifies no evidence that the misspelling rendered him unaware that he was the person named as defendant.accordingly,the slight error in the spelling of takeshi name does not entitle him to have the judgment set aside.
