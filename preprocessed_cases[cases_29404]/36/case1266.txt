factual and procedural background 
in april twin sisters savannah and sierra were born to mother and david father.
on november,david david,a family friend whom father had met at work two years earlier,visited the home of mother and father,arriving in the afternoon.david was a father of seven children and had always talked about his children in a loving,fatherly way.when father arrived home from work at about,mother and david were drinking beer.at about,father and mother went to a store to buy milk,diapers and more beer,leaving the twin girls in david care when they returned about to minutes later,they saw david changing savannah diaper on the couch.they thought it strange because david had previously told them he does not change diapers and the twin diapers had been changed before mother and father left mother asked david are you messing with my daughter david replied i never do that.he said he was merely changing her diaper.mother and father argued over whether david was trustworthy.mother stated she did not fully trust david.father stated he trusted david and did not believe david was doing anything inappropriate.
at about,mother and father went to the store to buy cigarettes for david they apparently returned about minutes later.
at about,mother and father went to the store to exchange the cigarettes bought earlier for the correct brand.when they left,savannah was asleep on their bed and sierra was asleep on the couch.when they returned home about to minutes later,their bedroom door was ajar with the lights off.they heard david say,suck this.as mother entered the bedroom,she saw david lying on the bed next to savannah,who was awake,naked below her waist,and on her knees bouncing on the bed.according to mother,david had his right hand on savannah shoulder,apparently guiding her head to his crotch david pants were down and his penis was exposed.mother yelled,what are you doing she then told father to get him david out of here father grabbed david and shoved him out the front door,slamming it behind him.father then called police to report the incident.
at,police were dispatched to the home of mother and father regarding a reported molestation.savannah and sierra were taken into protective custody by police.police later apprehended david,who was walking along a street apparently intoxicated.
on november a san diego county health and human services agency agency social worker interviewed mother and father regarding the incident.father denied being intoxicated,but admitted drinking three or four beers between on november and on november.mother also denied being intoxicated,but admitted drinking about one beer and slightly more than one shot of whiskey during that period.father did not believe david was intoxicated while he was at their home david did not slur his speech or exhibit any unusual movements.mother told the social worker the incident made her not trust anyone and she would never again leave her children alone with anyone else.mother told the worker she would like the family to receive counseling,parenting classes and services to help cope with the incident.
a physical examination of savannah showed a superficial laceration of her labia minoria,consistent with either sexual abuse or another cause a physical examination of sierra was inconclusive regarding any sexual abuse.
on november agency filed section juvenile dependency petitions for both savannah and sierra.the juvenile court found prima facie showings had been made that the children were persons described in section and ordered them detained in foster care.
in agency jurisdiction and disposition hearing report dated december,agency noted that mother and father showed family strengths of being cooperative,willing to accept services,motivated to resolve problems,employed,raised children for a significant amount of time,attachment.mother and father had begun individual therapy and an parenting course.agency set forth its 
these two toddlers were brought into protective custody by law enforcement after one was sexually assaulted by a family acquaintance.the parents provided prompt intervention after they literally caught the perpetrator in the act by contacting law enforcement,which ultimately led to the capture of the alleged perpetrator.it is obvious the parents deep love for their children is genuine and that they have expeditiously immersed themselves in services initially recommended.however,what remains of concern is there appears to have been subtle yet intentional signals demonstrated by the alleged perpetrator of what his intentions were with these young children.he continually urged the parents to vacate their premises with requests for alcohol cigarettes.on one occasion,he offered them one hundred dollars if they would heed his request.unwittingly,the parents heeded his wishes by walking to a nearby store to purchase the wanted items,despite one of them verbalizing feelings of mistrust when they found the alleged perpetrator changing savannah diaper after they arrived home from the first of three trips completed that evening.it is difficult to say if the parents oversight could be related to being naive to sections of society considered to be perverse or being under the influence of alcohol,which led to impaired judgment.however the prior situation is scrutinized,it had raised questions of the parents ability to protect their children,and it is the recommendation of the agency that each parent undergo a psychological evaluation which will be used as a tool to provide valuable feedback when these children can be returned to their parents custody.
on december agency filed amended dependency petitions for savannah and sierra.the amended petition for savannah included an allegation she was a child described under section,subdivision b.the amended petition for sierra included an allegation she was a child described under section,subdivision j.
on january,a jurisdictional and dispositional settlement conference was held.mother and father waived their right to trials on the amended petitions and submitted the matters to the juvenile court based on agency reports and other documents.the court made true findings on the jurisdictional allegations that savannah was a child described under section,subdivision b and sierra was a child described under section,subdivision j.the court placed the children in the home of a relative,their maternal grandmother.
mother timely filed a notice of appeal
