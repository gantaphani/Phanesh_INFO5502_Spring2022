this is an appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york duffy,approving a settlement agreement in a class action certified pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in the action,class plaintiffs challenged policies adopted by the new york city administration for children services acs relating to the removal of children from their homes in cases of abuse and neglect.named as defendants are the city of new york city,of the city rudolph giuliani,and acs commissioner nicholas scoppetta collectively,defendants.at a fairness hearing held by the district court,conchita jones jones and appellant wilbur mcreynolds mcreynolds objected to the proposed settlement agreement the district court determined,inter alia,that jones had opted out of the class,and the court entered judgment on february,approving the settlement agreement,which provided for declaratory and injunctive relief to the class as a whole.
jones and mcreynolds,both acting pro se,filed a timely notice of appeal of the february,judgment.on august,this court granted jones motion to proceed in forma pauperis and for appointment of counsel to brief among any other issues,whether appellant conchita jones opted out of the settlement agreement.this court appointed pro bono counsel on march.
on appeal,jones claims that the district court erred in finding that she had opted out of the class settlement and in removing her as a class representative on the basis of that finding.jones also asserts that the district court accordingly failed to consider her objections to the class settlement.mcreynolds claims that the notice of the settlement hearing was insufficient to alert potential class members that the settlement was not fair,adequate,or reasonable that there is no compensatory relief provided in the class settlement and that the settlement contains an ambiguous provision in the release of class claims.for the following reasons,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that jones had opted out and,consequently,in removing her as class representative,but nevertheless we hold that the error was harmless.with respect to the agreement,we hold that it was fair,adequate,and reasonable,although the text of the release provision does not comport with the undisputed intent of the parties.we therefore affirm the order approving the settlement but remand for the district court to direct the parties to modify the release provision accordingly.
background 
in march,people united for children puc,a organization that conducts support group meetings for individuals who have lost custody of their children to acs,and a number of african american plaintiffs,including jones,filed a complaint,pursuant to,against defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the complaint,as later amended,alleged ten causes of action for violations of due process,equal protection,and parental,privacy,cultural,and religious rights,as well as claims of discrimination,under the new york state and united states constitutions.
the amended complaint primarily alleged as unconstitutional the defendants practice of removing or threatening removal of children from the homes of and latino parents and guardians where there was no imminent danger to the child life or health,without completely investigating allegations of child neglect and abuse,without offering or providing preventive services,without prior notice,without being fully and adequately informed of their rights,without a judicial hearing any opportunity to be otherwise meaningfully heard.the amended complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief,in addition to nominal and compensatory damages.
on july,the district court granted in part and denied in part the city motion to dismiss the amended complaint.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs religious discrimination claims but permitted the plaintiffs to proceed with their remaining claims.see people united for children,city of,d.
on april,the district court issued an order certifying the following class and subclasses of plaintiffs pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b 
african american or black parents or persons legally responsible for the care of children within the city of new york,who are subject to the administration for children services policy of resolving any ambiguity regarding the safety of a child in favor of removing the child from harm way and returning children to their parents or guardians only when families demonstrate to the satisfaction of acs that their children are safe and secure,and who have been or will be 
i threatened with the removal of their children following allegations of child neglect or abuse by the administration for children services without a proper investigation as to whether their children will be in danger if they remain in the custody of their parents 
ii subjected to the removal of their children following allegations of child neglect or abuse by the administration for children services without a proper investigation as to whether their children will be in danger if they remain in the custody of their parents

the certification order also provided that the statistical reports and anecdotal evidence appear to support the inference that there is an aggrieved class of african american or black parents,over latino or white parents,generally by order entered september,the district court found that jones and others were adequate class representatives for subclass ii,which was comprised of parents or guardians whose children were removed by acs without a proper investigation as to whether their children were in danger if they remained in the custody of their parents.
after two years of negotiations,in which jones did not participate,puc and defendants reached a proposed settlement agreement.the district court preliminarily approved a stipulation of settlement by order of october.the district court also approved the content of the notice and the method of giving notice to class members of the proposed settlement.a fairness hearing was scheduled for december.
on february,the district court sua sponte issued an order removing jones as a class representative following its finding that her claims were moot because her son was no longer a minor in foster care and her parental rights over her daughter had been terminated on motion of the acs in new york state family court.jones and mcreynolds both filed a notice of appeal as to that order,but this court dismissed the appeal sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction.on february,the district court issued an order the order finding that jones had opted out of the class action at the fairness hearing and therefore her objections need not be considered.people united for children,city of,wl,at.the order also approved the proposed settlement agreement the settlement agreement pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e id.at.

such procedures include i a critical case conference to be held in response to a request for voluntary placement of a child ii an elevated risk conference to be held by the division of child protection within three days of a caseworker assessment that the risk to a child has been increased iii a,child safety conference to be held by the division of child protection three to five business days after a protective removal and iv a family permanency conference to be held by the division of child protection thirty days after a protective removal.
although the court certified the class pursuant to rule b,which provides that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole,the settlement agreement also included an incentive award of to each of the named lesley adams,joslin cantave,and theresa logan an incentive award of to each of the named amanda sherman,agatha sibley,cherry mcclamy,and kaliah martin and a separate award of to puc for use in educational programs.jones was the only named plaintiff who did not receive an incentive award,and this was because the negotiating parties believed that she refused her award,in refusing to endorse the settlement.
the settlement agreement also included general release provisions.under paragraphs and,the settlement agreement stated that nothing in the stipulation shall be deemed to be a finding or an admission that defendants have in any manner violated plaintiffs rights,or the rights of any other person,and do es not constitute,and shall not be construed as,evidence of liability or wrongdoing in any other action or proceeding.this stipulation shall not be admissible in,nor is it related to,actions for damages brought by any individual,or to any other litigation or settlement negotiations.paragraph,entitled release,further provides

ii.notice to class members 
by order dated october,the district court approved the content of the notice of settlement to the class members the notice.the notice explained that a class action lawsuit had been brought to challenge acs policies with respect to their investigation of black parents or guardians following allegations of child neglect and abuse and the removal and return of their children to their custody.the notice also explained the new policies and procedures agreed to and set forth in the agreement settling the lawsuit and described the incentive awards,in the amounts of or,to be provided to each of the named plaintiffs in the class except jones.the notice informed the class members that they were allowed to come to court on the day of the fairness hearing to tell the judge what you think of the settlement,or to write to the judge by a certain date before the hearing.distribution of the notice was proposed as follows 
a to be published in the following papers,the amsterdam news,carribean life and our time press and b conspicuously posted in all of the children services field offices in poster format measuring x and c provide copies of the notice to the executive director of each foster care agency with whom children services contracts with directions that it be posted in areas of client contact.the municipal defendants shall provide plaintiffs counsel with a sufficient number of copies of the notice so that plaintiffs counsel shall cause to be distributed to all the offices of all child welfare policy,legal and organizing groups known to plaintiffs counsel.

iii.objections to the preliminary approval of the settlement agreement 
seven sets of written objections to the settlement agreement were filed with the district court in response to the notice.also,a number of class members and interested parties appeared at the december,fairness hearing to make oral objections to the settlement agreement.jones filed two sets of written objections and she made oral objections at the fairness hearing as well.mcreynolds filed two sets of written objections and also appeared at the hearing.the objections,made by jones and others,challenged the settlement agreement on the grounds that it provided no real reform in acs policies that no damages were awarded to the class members with the exception of incentive awards to the named plaintiffs that the distribution and content of the notice were inadequate that there was no finding made by the district court pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure that the settlement is fair,reasonable,and adequate that the class members were not directly involved in the settlement negotiations that the settlement was fraudulent that the settlement was a product of collusion and that the release provision in the settlement was ambiguous.jones did not object that the settlement agreement did not provide her with an incentive payment.
during the fairness hearing,when jones was afforded the opportunity to speak and present her objections on the record,the district court asked her whether she wished to withdraw from,or opt out of,the class.jones did not get the chance to answer the question directly but continued to assert objections 
the court jones,let me put this simply to you.do you want to withdraw from the class action here 
jones well 
the court and if so,do you want to go to trial or dispose of the case.i telling you,you saying one thing,which indicates to i just want to make absolutely sure of what you saying.
jones okay.what i saying is this.a communication with regard to this notice,which misrepresents the status,purpose,or impact of litigation,is unauthorized under the rule.
the court who made such a communication 
jones notice.
in an exchange with lead counsel for puc,joan gibbs,the district court expressed its view that it deemed jones to have opted out by virtue of her having raised two written objections to the settlement agreement 
the court as to the other one,jones,i guess she out of the class,or how else do you see it,if you do see it at all.
gibbs well,i do see it as her being not out of the class.i think that is a question,has some legal issues surrounding it.she rejected the settlement.but i do think that opting out is her position,because when you asked her a question as to whether she wanted to opt out,she did answer yes.
the court well,she is not in it,because she opting out.
gibbs right.yes,your honor.
the court if she objects to the settlement,then she is opting out am i correct 
gibbs yes.you right.
the court all right.
jones and the district court had a subsequent exchange in which jones made clear that she did not intend to opt out 
the court i also got a letter from eddie jones,who is the 
gibbs son of conchita jones,your honor.
the court i guess he is out of it,because his mother has opted out.and that one letter,i do want to miss anything here,let me just look through this.
jones excuse me,your honor.i have not opted out.
the court what 
jones i merely objected.
the court you ca have it both ways.
jones in the rules to object to class settlement as a class member.it is in the rules.it is perfectly legal.
the court you ca have it both ways,not for settlement.
jones the rules are the rules.
responding to the objections made at the fairness hearing,the district court determined,by order dated february,that 
t here have not been any credible objections raised to the settlement,either at the fairness hearing or otherwise.at the hearing,objections included allegations that the notice to class members was insufficient and that the terms of the settlement were unclear as to whether plaintiffs may still pursue individual damages actions.i find that the defendants fully complied with the notice procedures as put forth in the order dated october.furthermore,it was the intention of the parties that the plaintiffs may sue for individual damages,and it is clear that they are able to do so even without an explicit statement to this effect in the settlement.
people united for children,wl,at.while the district court rejected the objections raised by the class members,the court found that p laintiff conchita jones also raised a number of objections at the fairness hearing however jones has opted out of the class and therefore i need not address the substance of her claims here.id.final judgment was entered in the district court on february,and this timely appeal followed.
on appeal,jones argues that the district court erred in concluding that she had opted out of the class.jones further argues that because she did not opt out,the district court violated her due process rights by failing to consider her objections to the settlement agreement.
mcreynolds claims that the settlement agreement provides inadequate notice that the settlement agreement is not fair,adequate,or reasonable that the settlement agreement is deficient in that it fails to provide monetary relief to all class members,as sought in plaintiffs complaint and that the settlement agreement general release provision is ambiguous.
both puc and named argue that the district court neither erred in finding that jones opted out of the class,nor abused its discretion in removing her as a class representative.they contended that jones claims for injunctive relief became moot by virtue of the new york state family court order terminating jones parental rights.puc asserts that because jones did not have any parental rights at the time of the fairness hearing,she lacked standing to object to the settlement agreement,and,even if the district court erred in finding that she had opted out,that error was harmless because her claims for declaratory and injunctive relief have become moot.also claim that remand to the district court for failing to consider jones objections would be futile because her objections were raised by other class members.as to the adequacy of the settlement agreement,puc contends that the notice and terms of the settlement were adequate,fair,and reasonable.
standard of review 
we generally review a district court factual findings relating to a settlement agreement in a class action lawsuit under the clearly erroneous standard of review.omega eng g,omega,cir.a district court determination that a settlement in a class action lawsuit is fair,reasonable,and adequate,however,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see,maywalt parker parsley petroleum,cir county of suffolk long island lighting,cir.to the extent a district court decision rests on an interpretation of law,our review is de novo.see omega eng g,at stores,visa,cir.
ii.whether jones opted out 
the right of a class member to in rule b and b actions is not obvious on the face of the rule however,the language of rule is sufficiently flexible to afford district courts discretion to grant rights in b and b class actions.eubanks billington,see also penson terminal transp,cir a lthough a member of a class certified under rule b has no absolute right to opt out of the class,a district court may mandate such a right pursuant to its discretionary power under rule.accord long island lighting,at.where,as here,the right to opt out in a rule b class action is permitted by the court,we have noted that class members may exercise that right by a ny reasonable indication of a desire to opt out of the class action lawsuit.plummer chem.bank,cir.in this regard,however,a mere objection to a proposed settlement can not necessarily be deemed a reasonable indication of a desire to opt out of the class action.id.rule e provides a separate right of class members to object to a settlement proposal,and there is no authority for the questionable proposition that an automatic occurs by filing or raising an objection.see.e.
here,following a colloquy with jones at the fairness hearing,the district court concluded that jones elected to opt out of the class action.in response to this finding,jones informed the district court that she had not opted out i merely objected.jones asserted that she had a right to object to the settlement agreement under the rules and explained to the district court that her actions were perfectly legal.despite jones clear indication that she did not intend to opt out of the class action and her invocation of her right to object under the rules,the district court nevertheless found that jones had opted out of the class because she ca have it both ways.in so finding,the district court erred in two ways first,the finding that jones elected to opt out of the class action was a clearly erroneous finding of fact and,second,the court conclusion that jones opted out of the class by reason of her objection to the class settlement was an error of law.
notwithstanding the district court errors,the appellees argue that remand would be futile.the appellees contend that every objection raised by jones had been raised by other members of the class,and,therefore,the district court had considered jones objections in full in any event in response,jones argues that two of her objections were not raised by other class members,namely,that the notice was not provided in the spanish language,and that despite being a class representative,she did not have an opportunity to participate in the settlement negotiations.
jones objection that the notice of the settlement agreement needed to be published in more than one language,because some class members are latinos,however,was made by another class member,who stated at the fairness hearing that a large population of black people who are latinos do know about the notice.the class member also argued at the fairness hearing that most of the people affected have no idea of the class action and that notice should have been published in the india preza publication as well.thus,the objection that the notice needed to be published in more than one language was adequately presented before the district court through objections concerning the issue of notice generally and,specifically,notice to latinos.
with respect to jones objection that she had no hand in the settlement or that she was not given the opportunity to contribute,this objection amounts to a challenge to the fairness of the process of negotiating the settlement issue that had also been raised by other class members.for example,mcreynolds written objection states,c lass members have received inadequate representation in the settlement and settlement approval process as evidenced by the unfair and disparate distribution of the incentive awards.mcreynolds written objection elaborates 
plaintiffs counsel,joan gibbs,has violated the rules governing professional conduct by wearing two hats in this adversarial proceeding advocating on behalf of defendants,failing to take remedial measures regarding fraudulent conduct,including disclosure to the tribunal,knowingly making false statements to plaintiffs,failing to keep plaintiffs informed,failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing plaintiffs,failing to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the classes,failing to promptly provide accurate information,failing to reasonably consult with clients,failing to protect plaintiffs interests,failing to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the various classes,and failing to obtain informed and voluntary consent to the proposed settlement.
although jones objection that she,personally,should have been permitted to contribute to the settlement negotiations is different from mcreynolds objection that there was
