procedural background 
tyler filed a petition for legitimation on or about may,under in the territorial court,seeking a decree that tyler is the legal daughter of francis louis armstrong,as administrator of the estate of felix francis,filed a motion to dismiss.
the territorial court granted the motion to dismiss,noting,sua sponte,that had been repealed in.it further noted that the legislature had simultaneously amended the statute authorizing paternity suits to provide that a father public acknowledgment of a child provides evidence of paternity.see a the paternity statute the territorial court apparently interpreted this to mean that,after,the paternity statute was the exclusive means of accomplishing what tyler sought to accomplish.because tyler was not among the classes authorized to bring an action under the paternity statute,the territorial court dismissed her petition.see a 
tyler appealed the territorial court decision to the appellate division of the district court appellate division,and argued that the application of the paternity statute to her as opposed to brought about a wrongful taking and deprivation of her vested inheritance rights and violated her due process rights.the appellate division affirmed the territorial court on two grounds.first,the appellate division agreed with the territorial court that tyler could not bring an action under because she was not within the class of persons entitled to bring such an action under a.second,the appellate division determined that tyler argument that should have been applied to her was totally without merit because t he changes made to title of the virgin islands code in have no bearing on whatever inheritance rights tyler may claim to have against the estate of her alleged biological father,felix francis.indeed,tyler claim of heirship is currently pending in the separate probate proceeding,which is not before us.app.div.op.at.
tyler appealed the decision of the appellate division to this court,and again argues,inter alia,that the failure to apply to her resulted in the denial of her right to due process and an unjust taking of her vested rights.

iii.the claim 
prior to,entitled legitimation by acknowledgment provided 
the father of an illegitimate child,by publicly acknowledging it as his own,receiving it as such,with the consent of his wife,if he is married,into his family,and otherwise treating it as if it were a legitimate child,thereby adopts it as such and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth.
id.section was repealed in.see sess.laws,at repealing title,chapter of the virgin islands code.
tyler most serious challenge on appeal is her claim that francis had satisfied all of the requirements for legitimation under,and tyler had accordingly been legitimated thereunder,prior to the repeal of as a result,she insists that she must be deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of her birth.intestate distribution is one such purpose.
the basis for the appellate division disposition of this claim is not altogether clear to us.at one point,it seems to suggest that the statutory amendments have no bearing on whatever inheritance rights tyler may claim to have and that she may assert those rights in a pending separate probate proceeding.app.div.op.at.at the same time,the conclusion of its opinion states that tyler lacks the standing to pursue her allegations under the law as it was amended and revised in may,and it affirms the territorial court order dismissing the petition without expressly preserving tyler right to press her claim elsewhere.id.the appellate division further commented in a footnote that an illegitimate child right to share in the estate is governed by.id.at.that section provides 
an illegitimate child shall be considered to have the same status,for the purpose of the descent and distribution of the property of his or her ancestors,as if he or she were born in lawful wedlock provided that in cases where the ancestor in question is a father,he admitted of record paternity of such child by signing the official birth certificate or he was adjudged the father of such child by a court of competent jurisdiction or by written acknowledgment he recognized such child as his.
we conclude that tyler is entitled to have the merits of her claim adjudicated by the territorial court.because we are concerned that the presently outstanding judgment might preclude her from doing so,we will reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
