melissa abdouch brought this action under against the defendants,a group of south dakota social workers.she alleged that after the defendants discovered her infant son had seventeen broken bones,they violated her constitutional rights by removing him from her care for a period of approximately seven months.the district court found the defendants entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in their favor.we affirm.
melissa abdouch and her husband,michael abdouch,lived with their three children,and on august,melissa took the youngest child,eleven,to a cardiologist because of a heart murmur.the cardiologist took a chest that revealed multiple fractured ribs.the next day,august,the abdouch family physician informed melissa that the had revealed bone abnormalities.he asked her to bring to a hospital emergency room.a physical exam and taken at the emergency room revealed that had seventeen fractures including fractures of the ribs and clavicle and of the arms and legs,both above and below the joints.despite the severity and extent of injuries,all doctors involved with the case later concurred that the injuries would not have been apparent to a lay person.
two police detectives interviewed melissa and michael,starting at the hospital and continuing at a police station.the police quickly focused on michael as the suspected abuser,although there was little evidence to suggest what role each parent might have played.melissa and michael denied harming and denied having knowledge of any abuse.when michael was later deposed,however,he admitted that he had anger management issues and that melissa had encouraged him to seek anger management help or counseling at about the time that the doctors discovered injuries.
defendant alison downs was the department intake social worker assigned to the case.she was present at the police station.downs permitted melissa to take home on august on the condition that michael not stay at the family home.
the following day,august,melissa brought the older children to the hospital for evaluation.although neither exhibited signs of abuse,downs and her supervisor,defendant raina boyum,decided to remove all three children from the home and place them in a care center.downs completed a child placement agreement and case plan form for each child to authorize the care center to provide services.in addition to noting severe injuries,downs noted on the forms that there was possible sexual abuse.boyum initialed the forms.there was no evidence of sexual abuse.
also on august,downs told melissa that there would be a temporary custody hearing the following day and that she would recommend the court send the three children home with melissa.on august,at the hearing,downs did not make the recommendation.after the hearing,downs and boyum released and to michael parents and placed in foster care.michael returned home to live with melissa.melissa had urged that be placed with the children grandparents,who were willing to take into their home move to care for in a different location.following placement in foster care,melissa and michael were each allowed one supervised visit per week.
on august,downs completed an information collection form.she marked boxes to indicate that had suffered physical abuse in the head,face,genitals,stomach or back area.she marked boxes to indicate that required immediate medical attention,that there was no evidence of sexual abuse,and that there had been frequent or increasingly harsh physical contact.she also marked boxes to indicate that melissa was emotionally handicapped and had an uncontrolled mental illness.finally,without noting which caretaker she was referring to,downs marked boxes to indicate that the caretaker had an unrealistic expectation of the child behavior and did not believe that there is a problem.
after downs and boyum completed their initial investigation and intake,case manager kathrin betzing and her supervisor,vicki burger,took over the case.according to betzing and burger,did not tolerate the supervised visits from michael and melissa well and screamed and refused to eat after the visits.during one of michael visits,michael became frustrated and called a little shit.melissa contests the department claim that did not tolerate her visits well.
an assistant attorney general involved in the case,anthony sanchez,recommended that the department terminate the supervised visits.sanchez stated that melissa was not cooperative in the abuse investigation and that he did not want her to have more visits until he knew what part melissa had in the child injuries,whether she actually caused them or knew michael caused them.betzing and burger decided in september to terminate the visits.at about the same time,they decided to seek the termination of michael and melissa parental rights regarding 
melissa testified that she wanted to remain married to michael and have her children at home.she initially appeared not to believe that michael had abused.she testified that she was told by the department that she would not regain custody of her children if she remained married to michael.she requested that be tested for a rare congenital disease that causes brittle bones,osteogenesis imperfecta.was tested in late september and found not to have the disorder.melissa filed for divorce on october,one week after she received the test results.the divorce became final on january.the january divorce decree did not resolve any issues of child custody and visitation between michael and melissa.when asked,melissa could not say whether she would have filed for divorce if the department had not recommended that she do so.
notwithstanding the fact that melissa filed for divorce,michael continued to live with melissa until just before a state court adjudicatory hearing on october.at the hearing,a state court judge relied on the medical evidence of injuries to determine that was an abused or neglected child.after the hearing,placement in foster care continued,and the two older children returned to the family home to live with melissa.
investigators who visited melissa home after michael moved out reported that it appeared that a married couple still lived at the home.further,in discussions with one of the social workers before michael moved out,melissa initially lied about michael living arrangements.melissa first stated that michael had already moved and that he was living with a friend.when pressed to give the friend name,however,melissa became flustered and admitted that michael still lived at home.based on this deception,melissa reluctance to believe that michael had abused,and her claimed ignorance that abuse had occurred,the defendants believed that melissa had filed for divorce only as a pretext to regain custody of 
a criminal investigation continued throughout this time.a prosecutor,pam tiede,filed an abuse and neglect petition.michael eventually admitted that he had treated roughly,that he lost his cool,and that he must have injured,although he said he did not purposely injure.in november,he agreed to plead guilty to simple assault.he entered a guilty plea on february.
melissa visits with resumed in december.melissa visits were initially once per week and later twice per week.in january,she was allowed to take on home visits.in february,melissa was permitted to begin taking on overnight visits.on march,was conditionally returned to melissa on a basis.following a custody hearing on june,all conditions on melissa custody of were removed.
notwithstanding the transitioning of back into melissa custody,betzing and burger continued to seek termination of melissa parental rights.before the june hearing,prosecutor tiede told burger and betzing that she did believe there was sufficient evidence to terminate melissa parental rights.at burger and betzing request,assistant attorney general sanchez took the case from tiede.sanchez reviewed the case,and with burger and betzing,decided not to pursue the termination of rights.they did not notify melissa of this decision until june,the day of the hearing.at the hearing,the department sought termination of michael parental rights and sought continuation of the case
