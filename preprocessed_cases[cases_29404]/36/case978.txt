introduction 
after michael brooks and annikkawa robinson were married,robinson took title to certain residential property solely in her name without reference to the marital relation.brooks agreed that title would be held in robinson name.when they separated,robinson moved out and brooks remained in the house.shortly before brooks filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage,robinson sold the property to executive capital group,ecg.brooks then filed a complaint for joinder against ecg for a declaration that the property was community property and requesting that the transaction be set aside because he had not joined in the conveyance.the issues raised by the complaint for joinder were bifurcated from the family law proceedings and tried to the court.the court rejected brooks claims and entered judgment for ecg.we affirm.
ii.summary of facts 
brooks and robinson were married in.in october,they purchased a home in san bernardino the property.the money for the down payment was paid from brooks earnings robinson did not contribute any money.their real estate agent recommended that title be taken solely in robinson name because it would be easier to obtain financing for the purchase.brooks agreed.
the grant deed to the property recites that title is held by annikkawa robinson,a single woman.the deed was recorded with the san bernardino county recorder in november.although brooks knew that title was being taken in robinson name only,he did not know that the deed included the phrase,a single woman.
two deeds of trust against the property recite that the trustor is annikkawa robinson,a single woman,and are executed solely by her.brooks testified that he made the payments on the loans secured by the two deeds of trust.
in february,brooks and robinson separated.robinson moved out and brooks continued to live on the property with their son.initially,brooks testified that he did not have a clue as to where robinson went.later,he testified that she had moved in with a friend named geneva.
around the time they separated,the property was,according to brooks,in foreclosure.robinson contacted brandon floyd,an employee of ecg.ecg is in the business of purchasing distressed properties that is,properties that are the subject of foreclosure proceedings.in late march,floyd and his supervisor,rene garcia,met with robinson at the property.
brooks,on the one hand,and garcia and floyd on the other,presented conflicting testimony of what happened at the march meeting.brooks testified as follows.he participated in the meeting along with robinson,floyd,and garcia.robinson introduced him to floyd and garcia as her husband.he told garcia that he wanted to refinance.garcia said that they did do refinances,they purchased houses,and offered to purchase the property for.brooks told garcia that he would go for that.he also told them that the property was community property and that he refused to sell.nevertheless,garcia asked brooks to take him through the house to look at it,and brooks did so.robinson stayed in the living room.after showing the house to garcia,garcia ignored brooks and talked only to robinson.eventually,brooks became angry and called him some words.called him a snake.brooks remained with the others during the entire meeting,which lasted more than one hour.
garcia testified about the march meeting as follows.he and floyd met with robinson at the property.he was not introduced to brooks,and brooks did not speak to him.brooks was in the living room,away from the others,just standing there and mumbling in the background.he talked with robinson about the house and did a walkthrough with her.this meeting lasted approximately or minutes.
garcia further testified that he dealt exclusively with robinson because he only deals with the owner of the property.he believed that she was the sole owner of the property based upon his search of the record title and the language in the grant deed and deeds of trust.when he asked robinson about the man he saw in the house during the meeting,robinson told him he was just a tenant.robinson never gave him any indication that she was married.
floyd testimony regarding the march meeting was consistent with garcia testimony.according to floyd,robinson contacted him.he and garcia then met with her at the property.brooks was somewhere standing around the house.just hanging out.he was not introduced to brooks and did not talk with him.he talked with robinson about comparable sales in the area.no one at the meeting said anything to indicate that the property was community property or that brooks was robinson husband.
garcia and floyd met with robinson a second time on april.this meeting took place at geneva home,where robinson was staying.during this meeting,robinson signed a home equity sales contract to sell the property to ecg for.she also filled out and signed a statement of information form.in a space on this form for listing the name of a husband,robinson wrote.regarding former marriages,she wrote,none.during this meeting,robinson told floyd that the tenant was supposed to be out of the house by a certain date in april.
on april,robinson and ecg entered into an amendment to the home equity sales contract by which the sales price was increased to.on the same day,robinson executed a grant deed to the property to ecg.after deducting for the payoff of loans and other expenses,robinson received.the deed was recorded on april.
on april,brooks filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage.
on may,floyd and garcia went to the property to see if the tenant had moved out,and to inspect for repairs.there,they met brooks and told him that robinson sold the property to them.brooks told them that he was robinson husband and had a community property interest in the property.garcia testified that this was the first time he had any knowledge that brooks was robinson husband.
ecg commenced an unlawful detainer action against annikkawa robinson and mike robinson.in that proceeding,ecg was awarded possession of the property 
in january,brooks filed a complaint for joinder in his marital dissolution case alleging five causes of action against ecg,styled as declaration of community property,injunctive relief,setting aside the sale,cancellation of deed,and constructive trust.as is relevant here,brooks alleges,in essence,that he holds a community property interest in the property and that the deed from robinson to ecg is invalid.in addition to other relief,brooks sought an order setting aside the sale of the property to ecg and cancelling the deed from robinson to ecg.
a bench trial on the issues raised by the complaint for joinder was bifurcated from the family law proceedings.the court did not expressly determine whether the property was a community property asset.the court found that ecg is a bona fide purchaser with respect to purchase of the property and takes it s title free of any unknown community property claim brooks may have with respect to the property.
iii.analysis 
title to community real property can not be conveyed by one spouse to a third party unless the other spouse joins in the execution of the deed.see,subd.a.a conveyance in violation of this rule is generally voidable by the spouse who did not join in the conveyance.andrade development martin d.however,a deed to community real property given to a third party purchaser is presumed valid if the purchaser received the deed in good faith without knowledge of the marriage relation,subd.c.moreover,a bona fide purchaser for value who acquires his interest in real property without notice of another asserted rights in the property takes the property free of such unknown rights.citations.citations.melendrez d i investment,th,d.
here,the court found that ecg was a bona fide purchaser of the property and that it therefore held title free of brooks claim.brooks challenges this finding.he argues that,even if his testimony is rejected and we accept the testimony of garcia and floyd,ecg knew,at a minimum,that robinson was an absentee owner and that brooks was in possession of the property.because they knew that he held possession,brooks contends that ecg had a duty to inquire of him as to his interest in the property and is charged with knowledge of his rights in the property.the applicable rule,he explains,is stated in pacific gas minnette d,possession of land is notice to the world of every right that the possessor has therein,legal or equitable it is a fact putting all persons on inquiry as to the nature of the occupant claims.citation.except in so far as the rule has been varied by statute,actual possession of land is such notice to all the world,or to anyone having knowledge of such possession,as will put on inquiry those acquiring title or a lien on the land to ascertain the nature of the right that the occupant has in the premises.the presumption is that inquiry of the possessor will disclose how and under what right he holds possession,and,in the absence of such inquiry,the presumption is that,had such inquiry been made,the right,title,or interest under which the possessor held would have been discovered.the notice which the law presumes has been held to be actual,and not merely constructive,notice.possession is notice not only of whatever title the occupant has but also of whatever right he may have in the property,and the knowledge chargeable to a person after he is put on inquiry by possession of land is not limited to such knowledge as would be gained by examination of the public records.citations.id.at,see also sheerer cuddy cal,claremont terrace homeowners united states d.
ecg argues it is a bona fide purchaser who took the property in good faith without knowledge of the marital relation or of brooks purported interest in the property.ecg does not,however,address brooks argument that even if ecg did not have actual knowledge of his interest in the property,they were told that brooks was a tenant and aware that he held possession,and that ecg is therefore charged with the knowledge that would have been disclosed upon inquiry to brooks.
ecg also relies heavily upon evidence code section,which provides that facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto this section is based upon the doctrine of estoppel by contract,a party to a contract is generally estopped to deny essential facts recited therein.estate of wilson d.gas app.bastian.ecg reliance on this presumption is misplaced because it applies as between the parties to written instruments.it does not apply to persons that are not parties to the instrument.henneberry henneberry d,franklin dorland cal.brooks is not a party to any of the written instruments involved in this case.thus,evidence code section has no application here.
based upon the arguments and authorities presented in the parties briefs,there appears to be merit to brooks contention that ecg is charged with whatever knowledge it would have acquired from inquiry made to brooks.if brooks does have an interest in the property,it would thus further appear that ecg title is subject to whatever interest brooks has in the property and that such title is voidable by brooks.however,we do not need to reach these issues because,as we explain below,brooks did not have an interest in the property as a matter of law.
there is a presumption regarding the characterization of property that was not addressed in the parties initial briefs.according to the form of title presumption,the description in a deed as to how title is held is presumed to reflect the actual ownership interests in the property.in re marriage of haines th,d haines in re marriage of broderick d.this common law presumption is codified in evidence code section,which provides the owner of the legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title.this presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.see haines,supra,at,d.the presumption is based on promoting the public policy in favor of the stability of titles to property.citation.allegations that legal title does not represent beneficial ownership have been historically disfavored because society and the courts have a reluctance to tamper with duly executed instruments and documents of legal title.citation.ibid.thus,in the absence of any showing to the contrary,the status declared by the instrument through which the parties acquired title is controlling.knego grover d.see generally hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
the applicability or inapplicability of the form of title presumption is essential to resolving the threshold issue of whether the property is community property or robinson separate property.see,mackay darusmont d,to set aside a conveyance of property on the ground that it was made in violation of the right to join in the conveyance,spouse must establish that it was community property.if this presumption applies and there is insufficient evidence in the record to rebut the presumption,then title to the property at the time of the sale to ecg was held solely by robinson as a matter of law,and brooks claims necessarily fail.
pursuant to government code section,we requested supplemental briefing on two questions relating to this presumption.first,whether the subject property is presumed to be the separate property of robinson because title is held in her name without reference to the marital relationship or to brooks.for this question,we referred the parties to evidence code section and to a section of miller and starr treatise on california real estate that states where one spouse takes title to property in his or her name,without reference to the marital relationship or the other spouse,it is presumed that the property is the separate property of the spouse who holds title.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fn.omitted.second,if such presumption arose in this case,whether there is evidence in the record to rebut the presumption.
ecg filed a supplemental brief,which essentially reproduced and expanded upon its discussion of evidence code section,but offered no discussion of evidence code section.as explained above,evidence code section does not apply to this case.
in his supplemental brief,brooks concedes that when robinson took title to the property solely in her name,a presumption arose that the property was robinson separate property.he also acknowledges that ecg had raised in the trial court the issue of whether the property was robinson separate property.regarding the question of whether there is evidence in the record to rebut this presumption,he points to evidence that he and robinson were married in,prior to the time robinson took title to the property.evidence of their marriage,he asserts,effectively rebutted the separate property presumption and created the presumption that the property is and was community property at the time of purchase in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.see.brooks argues,in essence,that the general community property presumption that arises when property is acquired during marriage negates the presumption arising from the form of title.
the relationship between the general community property presumption and the form of title presumption was discussed in in re marriage of lucas cal d,lucas.the lucas court stated the presumption arising from the form of title is to be distinguished from the general presumption set forth in family code section that property acquired during marriage is community property.it is the affirmative act of specifying a form of ownership in the conveyance of title that removes such property from the more general presumption.id.at,italics added see also siberell siberell cal,community property presumption has no application to a case where a different intention is expressed in the instrument.in lucas,a motor home was paid for with both community funds and the wife separate funds.lucas,supra,at.the wife wished to have title in her name alone,and the husband did not object.the motorhome was purchased for family use and was referred to and used by the parties as a family vehicle.id.at.the supreme court upheld the trial court determination that the motor home was the wife separate property because t itle was taken in the wife name alone.the husband was aware of this and did not object.id.at.thus,the mere fact that property was acquired during marriage does not,as brooks argues,rebut the form of title presumption to the contrary,the act of taking title to property in the name of one spouse during marriage with the consent of the other spouse effectively removes that property from the general community property presumption.in that situation,the property is presumably the separate property of the spouse in whose name title is taken.see generally miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.
brooks contends that lucas is not valid authority because it has been superseded by statutes.indeed,the legislature enacted several statutes in response to lucas,including what is now codified as family code sections and former,respectively see in re marriage of kahan d.recommendation relating to civil code sections and cal.law revision com.as we explain below,however,these statutes supersede aspects of lucas that are unrelated to the analysis and holding we rely upon.
in addition to the characterization of the motor home in lucas,the parties disputed the character of a residence.the residence had been purchased in part with the wife separate property and in part with community funds.lucas,supra,cal d at.title to the residence was taken in the names of both spouses,husband and wife as joint tenants.id.at.at the time lucas was decided,civil code section provided w hen a single family residence of a husband and wife is acquired by them during marriage as joint tenants,for the purpose of the division of such property upon divorce or separate maintenance only,the presumption is that such single family residence is the community property of said husband and wife.lucas,supra,at.based upon this statute,the court held that in the absence of an agreement that the wife was to retain a separate property interest in the residence,her separate property contributions were to be treated as a gift to the community for which she was not entitled to a credit or reimbursement when the property is divided in dissolution.id.at.this aspect of lucas was widely perceived as unfair by the public as well as by family law professionals.recommendation relating to civil code sections and,supra,cal.law revision com.
in response to this holding,former civil code sections and were enacted to provide that all property held in joint tenancy form by the spouses is presumed community absent a written agreement otherwise and all community property is divided subject to a right of reimbursement for separate property contributions absent an express agreement otherwise.recommendation relating to civil code sections and,supra,cal.law revision com.these statutes thus superseded the lucas decision to the extent lucas held that,for purposes of division of property at dissolution,separate property contributions to the community were treated as gifts and not reimbursable.the analysis and holding of lucas that we rely upon was unaffected by these statutes,and the case remains,for our purposes,good law.
moreover,the new statutes clearly have no application to this case.family code section the recodification of former,applies only to the division of property on dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties.this case concerns a dispute between brooks and ecg,and does not involve the division of property on dissolution.even if this case did concern such a division of property,the section creates a presumption of community property for property that is acquired by the parties during marriage in joint form,including property held in tenancy in common,joint tenancy,or tenancy by the entirety,or as community property,italics added.thus,property taken in the form of joint tenancy,for example,is presumed to be community property for purposes of the division of property.here,the subject property was not acquired in any style of joint form.it was unambiguously acquired by robinson in her name only.
family code section the recodification of former,also applies only to the division of the community estate,and creates a right to reimbursement for a spouse who made separate property contributions to the community,subd.b see in re marriage of weaver th,d.again,this bifurcated case does not involve a division of the community estate between brooks and robinson.whether robinson might be obligated to reimburse brooks for his contributions to the property was not before the trial court and is not an issue on appeal.the statute has no application here.
significantly,the legislature rejected a recommendation by the california law revision commission to supersede the aspect of lucas upon which we do rely and to eliminate the form of title presumption.in,the commission recommended that a new civil code section section be enacted to provide except as otherwise provided by statute,the form of title to property acquired by a married person during marriage does not create a presumption or inference as to the character of the property,and is not in itself evidence sufficient to rebut the presumptions established by this article.recommendation relating to family law cal.law revision com.in its recommendation,the law revision commission specifically criticized the lucas court conclusion that the parties motor home was the wife separate property.id.at.according to the law revision commission,the law should be revised not only to eliminate the title presumptions but also to overrule the title inferences of separate property.id.at.in,legislation was introduced to enact section as proposed by the law revision commission,along with other recommended statutes regarding transmutation of marital property.assem.bill reg.sess.the estate planning,trust and probate law section of the state bar of california opposed the proposed elimination of the form of title presumption,stating the form of title should create a presumption as to the character of the property.when property,for example,is taken in the name of a wife as her sole and separate property,it is the intent for the parties that it be so treated.estate planning,trust and probate law section,state bar of,letter to assemblyman alister mcalister.citing this opposition and other comments to the proposed statute,the law revision commission requested that the bill be amended to omit section.cal.law revision,letter to assemblyman alister mcalister.the legislation was so amended,leaving only the proposed statutes concerning transmutation,and became law without affecting the form of title presumption or superseding the aspect of lucas upon which we rely.see amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.
the form of title presumption affects the burden of proof.haines,supra,th at fn,d in re marriage of ashodian d.that is,the party asserting that title is other than as stated in the deed here,brooks has the burden of proving that fact by clear and convincing evidence.in re marriage of weaver d.haines,supra,at,d.the presumption can be overcome only by evidence of an agreement or understanding between the parties that the title reflected in the deed is not what the parties intended.lucas,supra,cal d at,in re marriage of munguia d.significantly,the presumption can not be overcome solely by tracing the funds used to purchase the property,nor by testimony of an intention not disclosed to the grantee at the time of the execution of the conveyance.in re marriage of broderick,supra,d at.see also gudelj gudelj cal d,lucas,supra,at.nor can the presumption be rebutted by evidence that title was taken in a particular manner merely to obtain a loan.in re marriage of kahan,supra,d at.when title was taken by spouses as joint tenants to obtain loan,property was presumptively held in joint tenancy.
to overcome the form of title presumption,the evidence of a contrary agreement or understanding must be clear and convincing,in re marriage of weaver,supra,d at.this standard requires evidence that is so clear as to leave no substantial doubt and sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.in re marriage of weaver,supra,at.
we now apply these principles here.with brooks knowledge and agreement,title to the property was taken solely in robinson n
