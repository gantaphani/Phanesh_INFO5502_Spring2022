oren adar and mickey ray smith the adoptive parents,individually and next friends of their adopted minor son,j c infant j,all three referred to collectively as,brought this injunction action against darlene smith,the louisiana state registrar the registrar,to force her to issue a new original birth certificate certificate for infant j,who was born in louisiana.the adoptive parents are unmarried adult males who obtained a joint adoption decree for infant j in a new york state court.after obtaining that decree,the adoptive parents applied to the registrar for a certificate listing both men as parents of infant j.the registrar refused to issue the certificate,citing louisiana statutes that prohibit the adoption of children by unmarried couples.on a motion for summary judgment,the district court issued a mandatory injunction,commanding the registrar to issue the certificate on grounds that louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree,and.ann.authorizes the issuance of a certificate listing both men as adoptive parents of infant j.the registrar timely appealed.we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
infant j is a male who was born in shreveport,louisiana,in.in april the adoptive parents,who then resided in connecticut,obtained an agency adoption of infant j in the family court of ulster county,new york,pursuant to new york state law that authorizes joint adoptions by unmarried,couples.
after obtaining this new york adoption decree,the adoptive parents arranged for a report of adoption to be forwarded from the new york department of health to the louisiana department of health and hospitals,office of public health,vital records and statistics.the adoptive parents sought to have a certificate issued and recorded for infant j,reflecting his new name and his relationship to the adoptive parents.before deciding whether to comply with that request,the department of health and hospitals requested an opinion from the state attorney general whether louisiana was required to issue the requested certificate.the attorney general issued an opinion that louisiana does not owe full faith and credit to the instant new york adoption judgment because it is repugnant to louisiana public policy of not allowing joint adoptions by unmarried persons.
approximately one week after receiving this opinion,the registrar wrote to the adoptive parents informing them of her decision to decline to issue the certificate.the registrar letter stated that because louisiana only authorizes adoptions by single adults or married couples.ann.vests the registrar with full discretion in issuing amended birth certificates for adoptions of children and.ann.d only authorizes the registrar to issue amended certificates in accordance with louisiana law,the state office of vital records and statistics was not able to accept the new york adoption judgment to create a new birth certificate.as additional support for not issuing the certificate,the registrar cited the state attorney general opinion that louisiana does not owe full faith and credit to the instant new york judgment.
proceedings 
in october,the filed suit in the eastern district of louisiana against the registrar in her official capacity,seeking a declaration that the registrar refusal to issue the certificate violates both the full faith and credit clause the clause and the equal protection clause of the united states constitution and a mandatory injunction requiring the registrar to issue a certificate that identifies both adoptive parents as infant j parents.
the registrar filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction which the district court denied.after the registrar filed an answer to the amended complaint,the adoptive parents filed a motion for summary judgment.in it they asserted that by its plain language.ann.expressly requires the issuance of a certificate for infant j reflecting that both adoptive parents are his parents,louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york state adoption decree,and failure to issue a certificate for infant j denies the equal protection under the united states constitution.
in granting summary judgment to the,the district court held that louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree and that there is no public policy exception to the clause.the court also went on to state that a forum state enforcement of such a decree from an adjudicating state is subject to the evenhanded enforcement of the laws of the forum state.the district court then examined the louisiana statute that governs the recording of adoptions of children and held that the plain language of the statute mandates that,on receipt of a duly certified copy of the new york adoption decree,the registrar had to issue a certificate for infant j that contains the names of the adoptive parents as his parents.as the trial court granted summary judgment on grounds of full faith and credit and louisiana law,it did not reach the equal protection claim.
before filing her timely notice of appeal,the registrar filed a motion in the district court seeking either a new trial or dismissal.in that motion,the registrar asserted for the first time that the adoptive parents lacked standing and,in the alternative,that the district court should abstain from interpreting.ann.and instead certify the question to the louisiana supreme court.after briefing and a hearing,the district court denied the registrar motion for a new trial or dismissal,as well as her motion for a temporary stay.subsequently,the registrar filed a motion in this court seeking a stay pending this appeal,which we granted.
ii.standard of review 
we review questions of jurisdiction,including standing,de novo if the district court expressly or implicitly resolves any factual disputes in making its jurisdictional ruling,we review such findings for clear error we review a grant of summary judgment de novo under the same standards applied by the district court summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law we review determinations of fact in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and we review questions of law de novo we also review the district court determinations of state law de novo,giving no deference to such rulings 
iii.analysis 
this case poses an issue of first impression in this circuit only one other circuit has addressed a similar one the instant dispute implicates the questions whether louisiana owes full faith and credit to the subject new york adoption decree and whether full faith and credit requires louisiana,under the plain language of its own statute and under the constitutional requirement of evenhanded enforcement of that judgment,to issue a certificate for infant j that lists both adoptive parents as his parents.
the registrar is now challenging the standing of the to bring this action.as standing is jurisdictional,we address that issue before addressing full faith and credit and state law.
the registrar contends that the have not satisfied article iii standing requirements specifically,that the harms they allege are not sufficient.the harms alleged are difficulties encountered in enrolling infant j in smith health insurance plan problems encountered with airline personnel who suspected that the adoptive parents were kidnappers of infant j and denial of the emotional satisfaction of seeing both of their names on the birth certificate.in supplemental briefing,the registrar also contends that.ann.does not grant a right to judicial relief.
the adoptive parents counter that the issue of standing is more properly framed as two broader questions whether the registrar refusal to issue a fully compliant certificate reflecting the entire relationship created by the new york adoption decree results in a legally cognizable injury in and of itself and whether the barriers imposed by the registrar refusal to list both adoptive parents in a certificate,as evidenced by past difficulties,constitutes a legally cognizable injury for purposes of standing.in supplemental briefing,the adoptive parents also invoke.ann.which they assert constitutes a mandate that the registrar issue certified copies of certificates to adoptive parents of children.
standing is a question of justiciability that poses two questions whether the parties claims present a constitutional case or controversy and whether federal court is the proper forum to decide this question as the jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited,parties may not seek redress there unless they can show an actual case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution,an.
there are three aspects to the constitutional requirement for standing under article iii,a showing by the plaintiffs of an that constitutes the invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent a causal connection between such injury and the conduct complained of and the likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury the party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing these elements article iii standing may also obtain by virtue of a state or federal statutory right,the invasion of which confers standing 
the registrar asserts that the injuries allegedly suffered by the do not rise to the level of.the disagree,pointing to the barrier of health care coverage,the impediments to travel,and the dignitary harm of an obsolete,incorrect birth certificate,as providing the requisite.we need not resolve this disagreement,however,because have sufficiently alleged,for the purposes of standing,that.ann.and mandate that the registrar issue a certificate and they have suffered cognizable harm by registrar refusal to do so.
the state of louisiana recognizes a private right of action to correct public records.in state ex rel.treadaway louisiana state bd.of health,the supreme court of louisiana approved of civil actions as the proper vehicle for requiring the state to correct birth certificates treadaway dealt with the attempt of the relator to have his deceased mother birth certificate altered to designate her race as white rather than colored.the relator sought alteration under the statutory provision for correcting birth certificates.ann.that statute read no certificate or record on file in the local registrar office shall be altered except upon submission of sufficient documentary or sworn evidence acceptable as the basis of the alteration.the contemporary analog of that statute is.ann,which subjects any alteration procedure to regulations of the department of health and hospitals and requires a showing by sworn and documentary proof.the current statute that governs birth certificate corrections for adoptions is.ann,the predecessor.ann,and.ann.requires that specified documentary evidence be submitted before a new certificate will be issued,and as discussed in more detail infra is couched in mandatory language.accordingly,we find apposite treadaway holding that 
s ince the matter was brought to the attention of the board of health by a person who was affected by the record,the board of health is authorized and,in fact,required by the statute to receive such evidence as might be available and,in accordance with its own rules,to make the change if the evidence submitted is found by the court to be satisfactory 
given the plain language of the governing statute and the louisiana supreme court recognition of private rights of action to correct the state public documents,we hold that infant j has made sufficient allegations of a statutory right to an accurate birth certificate and thus has article iii standing to compel the registrar to issue a new certificate.
this reasoning applies,by virtue of.ann.with equal force to the allegations of the adoptive parents.therefore,we hold that,like infant j,the adoptive parents have made sufficient allegations of a statutory right to provide standing to pursue their claims against the registrar.
this is not dispositive of the question of constitutional standing by itself,however,because the law is that a statute can not grant standing to parties whose claims do not rise to the constitutional threshold when a person alleges a concrete,particularized,and individual injury by virtue of the operation of a statute,however,article iii standing to challenge that statute execution usually obtains we therefore hold that allegations of injury flowing from the registrar failure to comply with the statute satisfy the prerequisites of for article iii standing purposes 
full faith and credit 
turning to the substantive claims at issue,we first consider whether,under the united states constitution,louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree.the registrar asserts several rationalizations why louisiana does not owe full faith and credit to the decree as a constitutional matter,and she categorizes the argument based on them as an alternative to her argument that louisiana adoption statute does not,by its plain meaning,require her to issue a new certificate.as we need consider.ann.only if louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york decree we first address full faith and credit.
the full faith and credit clause 
the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution reads 
full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records,and judicial proceedings of every other state.and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,records and proceedings shall be proved,and the effect thereof 
congress enacted implementing legislation for the clause in and has amended that legislation only once,in the supreme court first interpreted the clause in mills duryee to require that an judgment be given the same effect in the several states as it would be given in the adjudicating state such expansive full faith and credit was later held not to be owed to a statute enacted in another state,however,when the forum state is competent to legislate on the matter 
the supreme court most recent full faith and credit decision dealing with judgments,baker ex rel.thomas general motors both reiterates that full faith and credit is owed to and explains the exacting nature of this duty.important to the instant appeal,the court in baker emphasized that there are no roving public policy exceptions to the clause that is,the forum state may not refuse to an judgment on the grounds that the judgment would not obtain in the forum state although the duty of recognition that is owed is exacting,however,it is not absolute.for example,even though the forum state may not refuse to enforce the judgment of the adjudicating state,the forum state is not required to substitute the adjudicating state provisions for the enforcement of judgments for their own the substantive issues adjudicated in that state are afforded full faith and credit within particular bounds,the provisions for enforcing that judgment are determined by the law of the forum state.
application 
as a threshold matter,there is virtually universal acknowledgment that louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree and must recognize that the adoptive parents are infant j legal parents.numerous authorities hold that a state must afford adoption decrees full faith and credit the parental rights and status of the adoptive parents,as adjudicated by the new york court,are not confined within that state borders and do not cease to exist at louisiana borders the registrar points to no precedent or persuasive authority to the contrary.in the face of this legal principle,however,the registrar tenaciously insists that there are exceptions to the application of the clause that allow louisiana to refuse to give full faith and credit to the instant adoption decree.the registrar contends first that the preclusive effects of an judgment do not compel another state to alter its public records.she asserts further that adoption decrees are fundamentally different judgments from those that must be given categorical effect under the clause,because,unlike typical money judgements,adoption decrees create new status,forge family relationships,are typically the product of proceeding s,and may subvert a state core domestic policies.finally,the registrar echoes her first contention by advancing that the clause does not support extending the effects of an adoption decree to control the public records of another state.we consider each of these contentions in turn.
a.an adoption decree has only preclusive effect on future litigation 
the registrar first contention is in reality an argument that the clause reach is coextensive with that of the traditional principle of res judicata and therefore does not constrain a forum state actions beyond such strictures.by way of example,the registrar offers that an adjudicating state divorce decree would preclude the forum state from the matters decided in that divorce,but would not mandate that the forum state alter its public records to reflect that judgment.from this premise,the registrar propounds the argument that full faith and credit,being no greater than res judicata,does not require the registrar to alter louisiana vital records in a manner contrary to louisiana substantive family law.the registrar takes this argument further by noting correctly that full faith and credit does not require a state to substitute its own statutes for those of another state.therefore,she continues,because categorical recognition of the new york judgment as opposed to giving it mere res judicata effect would be tantamount to exporting new york public policy determination about who may adopt in louisiana,requiring louisiana to accept the new york judgment would be no different than requiring louisiana to substitute a new york statute for one of its own.consistent with her argument that full faith and credit is nothing greater than res judicata,the registrar also contends that,because louisiana was not party to the new york proceedings adjudicating her duty to register the new york adoption decree,louisiana is not required to obey new york law that louisiana processing of vital statistics is collateral to the decree res judicata effects.
these arguments fail for a number of reasons.first and foremost,full faith and credit is not merely a redundant reiteration of res judicata.at its core,the common law doctrine of res judicata is concerned with respecting the finality of litigation in contrast,even though the clause does promote this laudatory end its primary purpose is to serve the modus vivendi of federalism by harmonizing the competing sovereign interests of the several states a crucial difference between res judicata and the clause is that res judicata is the voluntary restraint by a forum state from exercising its power so as to respect the judgment of another state.indeed,as to judgments,a forum state may and sometimes does choose to issues as it sees fit in contrast,the clause is a mandatory,constitutional curb on every state sovereign power.with respect to judgments although not to statutes,a state as a rule has no discretion to disregard a decision of another state on a matter over which that other state is competent to exercise jurisdiction 
the registrar second argument,that the new york adoption decree is a judgment cum statute to which louisiana does not owe full faith and credit,is a leap too far.although she is correct that,under the clause,a statute is not owed the same exacting obeisance as is a judgment,the registrar cites no authority for the proposition that some kinds of judgments may be treated as statutes for purposes of full faith and credit analyses.she appears to be arguing that,because the new york court adoption decree embodies both the public policy of new york and new york adoption statutes as interpreted by new york courts,the decree may be ignored by louisiana as an attempt to substitute new york statute for louisiana.but,if credited,this shallow,circular attempt to conflate judgment and statute would swallow the clause curb on the states if the registrar argument were correct,its natural conclusion would be that only those judgments that are rendered on purely common law by any statutory nexus,effect,or have to be afforded protection under the clause.under this reasoning,to the extent that a judgment incorporates the policy of the adjudicating state,a forum state would be free to ignore the adjudicating state judgment as an improper substitution for the forum state statute.such a reading,for the purpose of interstitially importing such an illicit public policy exception to the reach of the clause,is utterly contradicted by precedential full faith and credit jurisprudence.
we acknowledge,as the registrar observes,that an judgment may not force the forum state to accomplish an official act within its exclusive province.but,this exception refers to judgments that themselves purport to compel action by not in another state even though the clause may not serve as a puppeteer to empower an adjudicating state to govern a forum state by judicial decree,that is not occurring here.the new york court has not ordered louisiana,or any other state,to do or refrain from doing anything.it has merely adjudicated a relationship between the adoptive parents and infant thus,the question here is not what has a new york decree purported to compel louisiana to do or not to do rather,the question here is what respect does louisiana owe to new york adoption decree.the obvious answer is that louisiana owes exacting full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree 
adoptions decrees are fundamentally different from those judgments that must be given categorical effect under the full faith and credit clause.
arguments like those of the adoption decrees are fundamentally different kinds of judgments and are not owed full faith and either been rejected by those courts that have considered them or simply reflect a fundamental misapprehension of the law and the constitution.first,as already noted,multiple demonstrated virtually universal agreement that adoption decrees are judgments for purposes of full faith and credit furthermore,although the supreme court itself has not addressed this precise issue,it has held that other types of judgements are to be afforded full faith and credit.for example,the very case on which the registrar would rely for her argument,new york ex rel.halvey halvey recognized that the results of custody proceedings are owed full faith and credit.in halvey,the court considered a mother attempt to have a new york court enforce her determination.the new york state court had given effect to the determination,but had modified its terms.after the mother challenged this modification under the clause,the supreme court held that new york may alter the custody decree because under florida law,such decrees are modifiable by a florida court,but new york could do so only to the same extent as could a florida court in reaching this result,the court reiterated the general principle that judgments are due full faith and credit,stating t he general rule is that this command the full faith and credit clause requires the judgment of a sister state to be given full,not partial,credit in the state of the forum.
the registrar claim that adoptions fall within a category of judgments that are not owed full faith and credit is likewise unavailing.the dichotomy she purports to identify would describe judgments as either prospective or retrospective,with retrospective judgments being owed full faith and credit but prospective judgments not being owed such respect by forum states.according to this contention by the registrar,the clause would apply to such retrospective judgments as money judgments,but not to prospective judgments to which subset she would assign adoption decrees.this assertion echoes the argument dismissed by the supreme court in baker that there is some per se difference under the clause between money judgments and equitable judgments.the baker court held unequivocally that both kinds of judgments are afforded full faith and credit under the constitution 
the registrar cites no authority for her proposed dichotomy of judgments.instead,she confuses the broad full faith and credit obligation owed by a forum state to judgments with the tightly restricted obligation of the forum state to respect an court ability to determine activity in the forum state this distinction was articulated most recently in baker,when the court noted that,although respect for judgments is exacting,the clause does not require one state to adopt the practices of other states regarding the time,place,manner,and mechanisms for enforcing judgments.
the registrar would support her distinction by a negative analogy,seeking to show that,unlike money judgments or divorces,which are final,an adoption judgment concern s the new and ongoing status created in the originating state.this description of the nature of an adoption is misleading,however like divorce decrees between spouses,adoption decrees seek to make legally final the relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child the status is no more ongoing or less final than any other legally determined domestic relationship.that is,the adoption decree creates a legal relationship that remains in effect until and unless it is subsequently changed by legal processes.no one questions that adoptive parents may lose or surrender their parental rights through judicial action just as spouses may divorce and later remarry each other but this truism does not in any way mitigate the obligation of one state to give full faith and credit to the status judgments of other states 
the registrar concludes her argument on this point with the statement that categorically enforcing adoption decrees will inevitably undermine core social policies of the second state in a way that simple money judgments or even divorce decrees do not.to the extent that this assertion is meant to cast doubt on whether louisiana must give full faith and credit to the subject new york adoption decree,the supreme court has made pellucid that there is no roving public policy exception to the full faith and credit clause again,the specific question here is not whether louisiana may refuse to recognize the new york adoption which it clearly may not,but whether that recognition requires it to issue a certificate under the terms of its own statute.whether the new york adoption contravenes louisiana public policy is simply irrelevant and immaterial.put another way,the new certificate merely records the action done by the new york court and expresses nothing about what louisiana would or would not do in matters of its solely domestic concern.
c.the clause does not support extending the effects of an adoption decree to control the public records of another state.
the registrar argument here is that the clause does not command complete recognition of a adoption in another state public records.this is nothing more than a rehash of her earlier argument that adoptions are not a specie of judgment that is owed universal recognition under the clause.it is equally unavailing.
having determined that louisiana owes full faith and credit to the instant new york adoption decree,we turn to the registrar arguments concerning louisiana duty vel non to give effect to that decree.she contends that louisiana adoption birth certificate statute is an enforcement mechanism,and therefore,even if louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree,is not required to enforce the decree by issuing a certificate to infant alternatively,the registrar urges us to certify the question of application to the supreme court of louisiana.we address certification before addressing the registrar proffered interpretation of the state statute.
certification of the question of interpretation of to the louisiana supreme court.
rule of the louisiana supreme court authorizes us to certify questions of state law to that court.the registrar urges us to certify the proper construction of to the louisiana supreme court.she offers as support for this request that the state law is unsettled on this question a definitive interpretation would impact the constitutional question and the the state law implicates sensitive and interstate comity issues.because we hold that the statute meaning is clear and unambiguous,we decline the registrar request for certification under rule.
section is an enforcement mechanism for purposes full faith and credit.
the registrar does not point to any direct authority for her bald assertion that a statute such as is a time and manner mechanism for enforcing judgments.the counter not only that the statute is not an enforcement mechanism,but that it would be immaterial if that were not clear because,even if the statute were an enforcement mechanism,under baker,the registrar has failed to enforce the statute in an evenhanded manner.
we are at least doubtful that the adoption statute is an enforcement mechanism.but even if we assume arguendo that it is such a mechanism,the registrar can not prevail.if the plain language of louisiana own statute requires that a new,corrected birth certificate be issued to adopted minors and their adoptive as it clearly does,that requirement must be applied in an evenhanded manner the pertinent question thus turns on the language of louisiana statute.
interpreting.ann.
neither the parties citations nor our research reveals that any other court,state or federal,has interpreted.proceeding on a blank slate,therefore,we must look to analogous decisions of louisiana courts for guidance in construing its statutes when we interpret state law,we are bound to apply the law as the state highest court would.with regard to judicial interpretation of state statutes,the louisiana supreme court has held 
as a general rule,t he plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters in which case the intention of the drafters,rather than the strict language controls.
furthermore 
while it is true that the civil code directs that laws on the same subject matter should be construed with reference to one another,it is also true that it is only when one statute is unclear that another on the same subject should be called in aid to explain it.otherwise,where there is no ambiguity,the words of a statute are to be read in their most usual significance,that is,according to their general and popular use 
with these general principles in mind,we examine the text of the subject statute itself.ann.reads 
a.when a person born in louisiana is adopted in a court of proper jurisdiction in any other state or territory of the united states,the state registrar may create a new record of birth in the archives upon presentation of a properly certified copy of the final decree of adoption or,if the case has been closed and the adoption decree has been sealed,upon the receipt of a certified statement from the record custodian attesting to the adoption decree.
b.the decree is considered properly certified when attested by the clerk of court in which it was rendered with the seal of the court annexed,if there is a court seal,together with a certificate of the presiding judge,chancellor,or magistrate to the effect that the attestation is in due form.the certified statement is considered proper when sworn to and having the seal of the foreign state or territory record custodian.
upon receipt of the certified copy of the decree,the state registrar shall make a new record in its archives,showing 
the date and place of birth of the person adopted.
the new name of the person adopted,if the name has been changed by the decree of adoption and 
the names of the adoptive parents and any other data about them that is available and adds to the completeness of the certificate of the adopted child.
the district court interpreted the plain language of c to mandate that the registrar issue a certificate for infant j that identifies both adoptive parents.the registrar takes issue with the district court interpretation for two reasons.first,she asserts that a vests her with the discretion to decide whether to issue a new birth certificate the state registrar may create a new record of birth in the archives,and that c mandatory language upon receipt of the certified copy of the decree,the state registrar shall make a new record applies only to the contents of the new certificate.this reading,she argues,renders her decision whether to issue a new certificate wholly discretionary and not subject to challenge.the registrar further contends that the phrase adoptive parents should be construed in pari materia with those provisions of the louisiana civil code that prohibit adoptions within the state by unmarried couples.the registrar does not offer,and our research does not reveal,any place where the phrase adoptive parents is expressly defined in the louisiana civil code,the state statutes,or the case law.
the crux of the registrar first argument is that each word in the statute must be given effect accordingly,giving effect to this permissive language in a renders the entire statute discretionary as to whether a certificate is issued.thus,according to the registrar,a affords her broad discretion in deciding whether to issue a certificate on the basis of an adoption b establishes the authentication requirements for an decree and c mandates only the contents of the certificate,when and if the registrar should choose to issue one.
dealing as we are with a statutory grant of ministerial authority,we look to louisiana precedent on this matter as a guide for our interpretation.under the state constitution,a statutory grant of ministerial authority must comport with that document clause,which prohibits unconstitutional delegation of authority by the legislative branch of state government to another branch delegation of authority by the legislature to the executive branch must not be so broad as to impinge the mandatory separation of powers in considering this issue,louisiana courts have traditionally distinguished between two types governmental authority ministerial or administrative authority,which may be delegated and purely legislative authority,which may not be delegated as for the former,louisiana highest court has observed that 
the complexity of our social and industrial activities have lead the court decisions to hold as the authority conferred upon boards and commissions t he legislature may make the operation or application of a statute contingent upon the existence of certain conditions,and may delegate the power to determine the existence of such facts and carry out the terms of the statute.so long as the regulation or action does not determine what the law shall be,or involve the exercise of primary and independent discretion,but only determines within prescribed limits some fact upon which the law by its own terms operates,such regulation is administrative and not legislative in its nature 
as for the delegation of legislative authority,that court has stated 
when the delegated authority is unfettered,its exercise becomes legislative,not administrative,in nature,and contravenes the mandate of article,section of the louisiana constitution 
the supreme court of louisiana has fashioned a test for determining whether a statute unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority 
delegation of authority to an administrative agency is constitutionally valid if the enabling statute contains a clear expression of legislative policy,prescribes sufficient standards to guide the agency in the execution of that policy,and is accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards to protect against abuse of discretion by the agency 
whenever possible,a court should avoid interpreting a statute in a way that renders it unconstitutional if the registrar interpretation of would render it unconstitutional under the all pro paint body test,then it should be rejected in favor of a more constrained construction,assuming one is available.
the registrar interpretation fails at least prongs two and three of the all pro paint body test.first,even if the registrar were correct that the permissive may in a allows her unfettered discretion to issue or not to issue a birth certificate,there is still no accompanying legislative guide to implementing the legislative policy assuming there is one in furtherance of this grant of discretion.under the registrar own argument it would be within her sole decision whether to issue a birth certificate no standards for making that decision,outside of mere whimsy,are to be found in the statute by the same token,this absence of any guiding policy is linked to the absence of any procedural safeguards.because,under the registrar interpretation,she would have the unlimited discretion to issue or to decline to issue birth certificates for adoptions,she in her discretion may simply choose not to issue a birth certificate for a child to a married couple who could legally adopt in louisiana.her proffered reading of the statute would thus afford such a couple no safeguard in their access to a new,corrected birth certificate.the legislature intent in enacting,at a minimum,is surely not to allow the any reason or for no reason at deny birth certificates to adopters who could have adopted the child under louisiana law.the statute plain language suggests no such legislative intent.
in the framework of all pro paint body,we do not find the registrar excessively broad interpretation of to be persuasive or reasonable.under the registrar interpretation,she would enjoy absolute discretion in issuing or denying birth certificates for adoptions,without any legislative guidance or limitation whatsoever.furthermore,there is some authority which holds that when a statute directs a public official to perform some act,the otherwise permissive auxiliary may is in fact read as mandatory,if to deem it discretionary would thwart the act very purpose 
we need not go so far as to hold that the language in a is mandatory,however,because a facially reasonable reading of that statute would restrict the applicability of the may in that section to that section only,limiting the registrar discretion to issue a birth certificate for an adoption to the determination whether the decree is properly certified,or,in the case of sealed records as is the case here,on receipt of a certified statement.this more circumspect reading affords the registrar the discretion of the permissive language in the exercise of her ministerial function,in determining the validity and sufficiency of the certification furnished,without granting her the plenary and arbitrary power to decide which children will receive certificates and which will not.
we hold that the correct interpretation of a is that its use of may affords the registrar the limited discretion of determining whether the certification furnished by the applicants is satisfactory.the discretion afforded her is that she need issue a certificate only when she is satisfied that the certification is satisfactory,a decision that is guided in turn by b list of the required contents of such certification.finally,if the decree certification is proper,then c mandates that the registrar issue a new,corrected birth certificate.this interpretation avoids the registrar manifestly strained and unconstitutional attempt to go beyond the plain language of the statute.
in her second argument,the registrar notes that construing c as requiring her to issue a birth certificate that lists both adoptive parents whenever,under a,she determines that the proffered certification satisfies b,is a reading improperly isolated from the rest of louisiana substantive law,specifically articles,and of the louisiana children code,which authorize joint adoptions by married couples only,and article b of the louisiana civil code,which limits state recognition to married heterosexual persons only thus,according to the registrar interpretation,because the adoptive parents are an unmarried,couple,and adoption provisions other than would deny them the right to adopt in louisiana,should likewise require such a prohibition for adoptions by referential implication.
the registrar relies on article of the louisiana civil code,which directs that statutes are to be construed with reference to one another.assuming arguendo and not without serious doubts as to its validity that the statutory provisions which the registrar cites are relevant or salient to the meaning of adoptive parents,the registrar reasoning nevertheless fails to account for the strictures established by the supreme court of louisiana when interpreting the civil code article.the court held in crescionne that other statutes are to be consulted only when one statute is unclear.in essence,the registrar entire argument rests on construing the term adoptive parents not to include couples for purposes because an adoption can be effected only by married,heterosexual couples.nowhere does she argue,however,that the term adoptive parents is ambiguous or unclear.
the court decision in crescionne is instructive here.in that case,the parties disagreed about the meaning of the phrase surviving spouse in a particular state statute.the court reasoned that 
the ordinary meaning of the word spouse is one husband or wife,and marriage is dissolved only by death,divorce,judicial decree of nullity,or the contracting of another marriage on account of absence when authorized by law.had the legislature intended that a use of the term other than the one usually and generally understood,it could have given the words surviving spouse a legal definition 
since there is no special statutory definition of the term surviving spouse,we hold that it must be given its ordinary,commonly understood meaning 
like surviving spouse,the term adoptive parents is nowhere defined in the statute,or elsewhere in the codes or the case law of louisiana.when we parse the term for its plain meaning,we find that a common dictionary definition of parent is father or mother,and that the meaning of adoptive is of or involving adoption acquired or related by adoption.thus,when effect is given to the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute,the plain meaning of adoptive parents is a father or mother who adopts a child.it is obvious to us that this construction is the ordinary,commonly understood one.as the meaning of adoptive parent is clear and unambiguous,our inquiry is over we need not consult other statutes for interpretive guidance neither shall we overstep our mandate by importing the strained and attenuated reading that the registrar urges by reference to other statutory provisions of at best uncertain applicability.the new york adoption decree constitutes both adar and smith as a father related by adoption to infant accordingly,under the plain meaning of the term adoptive parents,written as it is in,and by virtue of the new york adoption decree,we hold that adar and smith are the adoptive parents of infant j for purposes of and.
iv.conclusion 
we hold that under the plain meaning of the statutes,adar and smith are the adoptive parents of the minor.for purposes of.ann.and,and that under the full faith and credit clause of the constitution of the united states,louisiana owes full faith and credit to the new york adoption decree that declares.to be the adopted child of adar and smith.we hold further that said does not vest the registrar with discretion to refuse to make a new,correct birth certificate for a child when,as here,his adoption decree is evidenced by documentation that indisputably satisfies the requirements of a and b.we also hold that mandates that the registrar make a new record for.and issue a new,correct birth certificate for him containing all statutorily directed information.
we therefore lift our stay of the district court order affirm the district court grant of a mandatory injunction and order that the registrar comply with the district court injunction forthwith

the tenth circuit dealt with similar facts and claims in finstuen crutcher.we summarize it briefly.in finstuen,three couples challenged an amendment to oklahoma foreign adoption statute that prohibited the state from recognizing adoptions by couples.at.the district court held that the amended statute was unconstitutional because it violated the full faith and credit clause,and the court ordered oklahoma to issue a revised birth certificate to one of the couples.the tenth circuit affirmed on full faith and credit grounds.id.at.the appeals court reasoned that each state owes full faith and credit to every other state judgments.id.at.that court also noted that the forum state mechanisms for the enforcement of such a judgment are determined by the lex the rights of the judgment flowed from the law of oklahoma,not california,the state of adoption.id.at.the court ruled that,because the amended adoption statute categorical refusal to recognize judgments was unconstitutional,and because oklahoma had a duty to recognize the california adoption decree,the doe plaintiffs were entitled to whatever rights would be afforded them from the judgment under oklahoma law.id.at.concluding that oklahoma foreign adoption statute,sans the amendment,provided for the issuance of a birth certificate to the does,the tenth circuit held that denial of the birth certificate would be a violation of the evenhanded requirement in applying local enforcement mechanisms to foreign judgments and affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment.id.
the registrar argues throughout her briefing that the appellees lack standing to pursue this action,and she does not differentiate between the adoptive parents and infant j for purposes of her argument.as the adoptive parents bring suit both individually and as next friend to infant j,however,the standing of both the parents and infant j must be determined independently.we construe the registrar arguments on this matter as applying with equal measure to each.

see lujan,at.when the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or inaction,the nature and extent of facts that must be averred at the summary judgment stage or proved at the trial stage in order to establish standing depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action or forgone action at issue.if he is,there is ordin
