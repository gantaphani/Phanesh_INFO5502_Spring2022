mary cherrington and her daughter,daija king,appeal the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of andre skeeter,jon kinney,and the city of circleville,ohio in this action brought under.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the rulings of the district court,and remand this case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in the summer of,the city of circleville,ohio commenced an undercover law enforcement investigation in response to concerns of increased illegal drug trafficking activities within the city.because of insufficient resources and a concern that the city traditional police force could not conduct an anonymous undercover operation amidst circleville small population,the city sought outside assistance in its investigation.specifically,police chief jon kinney contacted a private security firm,which in turn referred chief kinney to andre skeeter,a private investigator.based on this referral,chief kinney met with skeeter,reviewed his credentials,conducted a background check,and then decided to hire him.
skeeter was sworn in as a police officer on september,and began his undercover investigation under the direct supervision of investigator kevin clark.skeeter spoke with clark on a regular basis,and submitted periodic reports on the progress of his investigation.skeeter also met from time to time with chief kinney.throughout his investigation,skeeter was not told to target any particular individuals,but rather was directed to go out into the circleville community,befriend people,and determine who to target for further investigation.through these efforts,skeeter came into contact with mary cherrington.the two became friends,periodically smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine together 
after nearly a year of this investigation,chief kinney,investigator clark,skeeter,and the county prosecutor decided to conclude the matter by arresting selected individuals and seeking their cooperation in additional drug purchases.chief kinney further determined,in consultation with the county prosecutor,that these individuals should be taken to a motel rather than the circleville police department or the county jail,in order to avoid tipping off potential targets of this operation.skeeter chose cherrington as one of the individuals to arrest,believing that she might be willing to cooperate with the authorities.
accordingly,on the evening of friday,august,skeeter arranged for a mutual acquaintance,leslie jones,to go to cherrington residence and ask her to purchase worth of cocaine.cherrington agreed,left her home to make the purchase,and returned about a half an hour later.a short time later,cherrington friend,scott smallwood,arrived at her house and began smoking crack in the kitchen.skeeter then arrived at cherrington home,accompanied by another law enforcement agent.upon witnessing smallwood smoking crack and learning that cherrington had made the requested cocaine purchase,skeeter placed both cherrington and smallwood under arrest.this arrest apparently occurred at around on saturday,august.
cherrington was told to pack a bag,and skeeter then drove her and her daughter,daija king,to a travel lodge motel at the outskirts of circleville.at around,cherrington signed a form indicating that she had been advised of her miranda rights by inspector clark,and that she had agreed to waive these rights and voluntarily speak to the police.cherrington remained at the motel with her daughter for the next hours,during which time she cooperated with the authorities by arranging a drug purchase.cherrington testified at her deposition that she requested permission to contact someone to pick up daija,but that this request was refused,leading her to surreptitiously call a friend to come and get her daughter.before this friend could arrive,however,cherrington and daija were taken from the motel and placed in a police car.
on sunday,august,at,about hours after her arrest,cherrington was taken to the circleville police department for processing and placed in a cell.her daughter daija was released to a friend.over hours later,at around on tuesday,september,cherrington was arraigned on drug trafficking charges.she subsequently pled guilty to two counts of trafficking in cocaine.
based on these incidents,mary cherrington and daija king brought this suit on may,alleging that skeeter,kinney,and the city of circleville violated their rights under the fourth,fifth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments to the constitution by opinion and order dated may,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,and ordered that plaintiffs claims be dismissed.through their present appeal,plaintiffs challenge only certain aspects of the lower court decision i the dismissal of daija king claims ii the grant of qualified immunity to the individual defendants on mary cherrington fourth amendment claim of an unlawfully prolonged detention without arraignment and iii the determination that plaintiffs failed to identify a basis for municipal liability against the defendant city of circleville.we affirm the first of these rulings,but reverse and remand on the remaining two points.
ii.analysis 
a.the standards governing this appeal 
this case is on appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.accordingly,we review this district court ruling de novo.see holloway brush,cir.likewise,to the extent that this appeal challenges the district court decision to confer qualified immunity upon the individual defendants,we review this question of law de novo.see gardenhire schubert,cir.
b.the individual defendants are protected by qualified immunity against the claims asserted by daija king.
among the grounds advanced in defendants summary judgment motion in the court below,the individual defendants,andre skeeter and chief kinney,argued that they were shielded from liability under by the doctrine of qualified immunity.in addressing the claims asserted by plaintiff daija king,the district court did not explicitly conduct a qualified immunity analysis,but instead found more generally that the individual defendants did not act objectively unreasonabl y under the circumstances in electing to keep mother and daughter together during the arrest and initial detention of plaintiff mary cherrington.district court op.at,at.upon assessing defendants conduct under the standards of qualified immunity,we reach the same conclusion.
the supreme court has instructed that a qualified immunity inquiry generally entails two discrete analytical steps.as a threshold matter,we must ask whether the record,viewed most favorably to the plaintiff,establishes that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d see also burchett kiefer,cir.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.saucier,at.at.on the other hand,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.at.at see also burchett,at.
to this point,the parties have made little effort to identify the constitutional rights of daija king that might have been implicated by defendants conduct.indeed,the record on appeal fails to indicate that the parties even addressed daija king claims in their submissions to the district court.plaintiffs appellate brief offers only slightly more guidance,summarily asserting that daija was falsely arrested and illegally detained.br.at.this suggests that daija claims rest upon the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures.and,to be sure,the supreme court has recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away,he has seized that person.terry ohio,d see also burchett,at.under this definition,daija king was seized when defendants insisted that she remain with her mother as the latter was arrested and detained in a motel room.daija was not free to remain at home or to walk away from the the contrary,the record suggests that defendants actively opposed any effort to release daija from their custody into the care of a third party.
yet,other cases tend to place a different constitutional gloss upon daija king claims in this case.in davis brady,cir,for example,we held that a fourteenth amendment substantive due process violation can occur when the state takes an individual into its custody and then fails to adequately ensure her safety and.in so ruling,we relied in part on the decision in deshaney winnebago county dep t of social services,d,in which the supreme court explained 
w hen the state takes a person into custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and.the rationale for this principle is simple enough when the state by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself,and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human,food,clothing,shelter,medical care,and reasonable transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the eighth amendment and the due process clause.the affirmative duty to protect arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expression of intent to help him,but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.in the substantive due process analysis,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause 
deshaney,at.at citations and footnote omitted.these principles seemingly are implicated here,where defendants restrained daija freedom to act on her own behalf or to secure the assistance of a substitute caregiver in providing for her basic needs.
in the end,however,the outcome is the same whether we analyze daija king allegations under fourth amendment or substantive due process standards.under the fourth amendment,daija seizure must not have been unreasonable,with the proper measure of unreasonableness depending upon the type of seizure.thus,if daija was arrested,as plaintiffs argue,defendants action must have been supported by probable cause.see dunaway new york,d.no one seriously contends that defendants had probable cause to arrest daija.
yet,not all seizures are tantamount to arrests sustainable only upon probable cause.see michigan summers,d dunaway,at.at.in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect,for example,the courts have held that a caseworker may remove a child from her home upon a reasonable belief that the child is in imminent danger of harm.see,roe texas dep t of protective regulatory services,cir brokaw mercer county,cir.as another example,the police have the limited authority to briefly detain those on the scene,even wholly innocent bystanders,as they execute a search or arrest warrant.see summers,at.at burchett,at see also united states enslin,cir finding that summers applies in the context of arrest as well as search warrants.
unfortunately,the present case does not fit neatly within any of these recognized analytical frameworks.plainly,daija king was not held on suspicion of any criminal activity.nor,in contrast to the child abuse and neglect cases,did defendants seize daija out of a belief that she faced an imminent danger of harm in her home.neither can it be said that daija was detained in order to facilitate the orderly completion of mary cherrington arrest and minimize the risk of harm to officers and others as they carried out this arrest.burchett,at.rather,daija king was taken along with her mother because the arresting officers deemed it inappropriate to leave the child alone at home,and because they either failed to identify or declined to pursue other options for ensuring daija safety and following her mother arrest.
lacking any direct guidance on the legal inquiry that might govern such a situation,the district court assessed defendants conduct under a general standard of reasonableness.see district court op.at,at.this approach comports with the supreme court general instruction that,in cases involving seizures short of a traditional arrest,the courts should be guided by the ultimate standard of reasonableness embodied in the fourth amendment.summers,at.at footnote omitted see also terry,at.at describing the central inquiry under the fourth amendment as the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen personal security.
at least one other court has employed this same reasonableness inquiry under facts similar to those presented here.in matheny boatright,the defendant police officers brought the plaintiff children along as their mother,angela matheny,was arrested on drug charges,taken to a detention facility,interrogated,and booked.matheny alleged that she had sought permission to contact her children aunt and grandmother to come and take care of the children,but that she was not allowed to make such arrangements until nearly an hour after she arrived at the detention facility.the court analyzed these circumstances under fourth amendment standards,as well as on other grounds,and found that the defendant officers had acted reasonably 
matheny does not contend that defendants had any physical contact with the children.nor does she claim that the children suffered any physical injury inflicted by defendants.matheny also does not claim that defendants directed any harsh or abusive language at the children.in light of the circumstances surrounding matheny arrest,namely that her three minor children were present without any other adult present to care for them,defendants actions were reasonable.the facts suggest that rather than putting the children at risk,defendants undertook to care for the children until suitable arrangements could be made for their care.
matheny.at 
we agree with the district courts here and in matheny that fourth amendment claims of the sort asserted by daija king in this case are most appropriately measured against a general standard of reasonableness.upon performing this inquiry,moreover,we are inclined to agree with the district court that the conduct of the individual defendants was reasonable,although we are somewhat hesitant to reach this conclusion as a matter of law.on one hand,daija was just two years old at the time,and the officers obviously had to make some sort of arrangement for her care as they placed her mother under arrest the child plainly could not have been left alone and unsupervised at home.the options,then,were either to keep daija with her mother or to arrange for daija to be placed with a relative,family friend,or a state social service,given the late hour of mary cherrington arrest,the latter might well have proved difficult.so long as mary cherrington remained in a hotel room rather than a detention facility,and generally remained available to care for daija needs,we can not say that one course of action was manifestly preferable to the other.in addition,defendants note that their chosen course served the law enforcement objective of preserving the secrecy of their ongoing undercover operation.on the other hand,mary cherrington testified that the defendant officers used daija as a tool to secure her cooperation.this testimony,if believed and found to rest upon more than cherrington own speculation would tend to cast doubt on the reasonableness of daija detention.
yet,it ultimately is unnecessary for us to decide whether the individual defendants did or did not heed the fourth amendment command of reasonableness in their conduct toward daija king,because they are entitled to qualified immunity in any event.as noted,the second prong of the qualified immunity inquiry turns upon whether the defendant has violated clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.burchett,at internal quotations and citations omitted.we have explained 
for a right to be clearly established,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.although it need not be the case that the very action in question has been previously held unlawful,in the light of law,the unlawfulness must be apparent.
burchett,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
as is evident from our foregoing discussion,the law is silent on the lawfulness of keeping a young child with her mother while the latter is placed under arrest and held in custody at a location other than a traditional detention facility.if the defendant officers had scoured the case law at the time or even to this day,they could not have located a decision indicating that daija king fourth amendment rights might be violated if she were taken with her mother to a hotel for about a period while mary cherrington cooperated with the authorities by attempting to arrange drug purchases.rather,the most closely analogous case,matheny,leads to the opposite conclusion.under these circumstances,the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,because the law did not and still does not clearly proscribe the actions they took.mitchell forsyth,d.
we reach precisely the same conclusion upon evaluating daija king claims under substantive due process standards.here,we have somewhat more case law to guide us several cases,including at least one in this circuit,have considered the substantive due process implications of a police officer decision about what to do with children whose parent or custodian has been placed under arrest.see,walton city of southfield,cir moore marketplace restaurant,cir white rochford,cir matheny.at.upon reviewing these cases,we conclude that the allegations and evidence in this case are insufficient to establish either a substantive due process violation or a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.
in walton,for example,plaintiff barbara walton was driving a car in which her daughter and granddaughter were passengers.the defendant police officers stopped and approached the car to investigate why the was not riding in a proper seat.upon determining that walton was driving with a suspended license,the officers placed her under arrest.when she asked that the children be placed in protective custody,the officers responded that they could not do so,but suggested that the children could call someone to pick them up.the officers then waited while the children entered a nearby office building to make a phone call,but did not remain on the scene to confirm that they had secured a ride home.in fact,nearly six hours passed before someone finally arrived to pick up the children.
we held that the defendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the children substantive due process claims.we began by noting that the sixth circuit had not yet addressed the issue of passenger abandonment by state or local law enforcement officials,but that other circuits had done so,reaching somewhat different conclusions.in addition,while cases such as white,supra,had recognized a due process protection against police abandonment of passengers upon arresting the driver of a vehicle,we found that white was distinguishable as involving abandonment in a more dangerous situation.walton,at accordingly,despite an exercise of very poor judgment on the part of the defendant police officers,we held that the contours of the due process right,if there is such a right,were not sufficiently clear so that a reasonable officer would have known that leaving the children in the parking lot violated that right.walton,at.
because walton did not decide whether such a substantive due process right exists,it did not reach the issue of the standard by which to judge alleged violations of such a right.we addressed this question in davis,supra,however,holding that where the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of being placed in the state custody,it has consistently and uncontroversially been the rule that a constitutional claim arises when the injury occurred as a result of the state deliberate indifference to the risk of such an injury.davis,at see also bukowski city of akron,cir applying a deliberate indifference standard to a substantive due process claim.similarly,the other child abandonment cases consider whether the conduct of the defendant police officers amounted to gross negligence or a reckless disregard for the safety of the children.see moore,at white,at.
under this standard,we do not believe that the record in this case can be viewed as establishing a violation of daija king substantive due process rights.admittedly,the situation into which she was taken with her mother as she was placed under arrest,and being held in a hotel room for a period,surrounded by police officers,as her mother cooperated with the authorities by attempting a drug not ideal.yet,given the hour of mary cherrington arrest,it is not clear that there were any available and preferable alternatives to the course chosen by defendants.further,there is no evidence that daija suffered any harm during this period of detention at worst,mary cherrington deposition testimony indicates that she and her daughter were fed only once during their stay at the hotel.the most that can be said,perhaps,is that the defendant officers might have been better advised to attempt to arrange for daija to be picked up by a relative or friend,and that they might have sacrificed a degree of daija comfort and emotional in an effort to preserve the secrecy of their undercover operation.this,in our view,is not tantamount to gross negligence or a reckless disregard for daija safety.
in any event,as with our fourth amendment analysis,we conclude that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the clearly established prong of our substantive due process inquiry.again,we note the utter absence of any case finding a substantive due process violation based upon a police officer decision to retain custody over a child while her parent or custodian is placed under arrest.to the contrary,the case law suggests that the defendant officers would more likely have run afoul of substantive due process concerns if they had left daija king at home or otherwise placed her in a situation which failed to adequately ensure her safety and.because the law would not have alerted the individual defendants that their conduct might violate daija king substantive due process rights,they are entitled to qualified immunity.more generally,in light of our similar conclusion under a fourth amendment analysis,we affirm the district court dismissal of daija king claims against the individual defendants on the ground of qualified immunity.
under the present record,the individual defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on mary cherrington claim that she was denied a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.
of the various claims asserted by mary cherrington in the court below,the only one she is pursuing on appeal,against the individual defendants at least is her claim that she was not provided with a sufficiently prompt judicial determination of probable cause following her warrantless arrest.in the lower court,and again on appeal,plaintiff cherrington has cited ohio rule of criminal procedure e as the source of this claimed right to a prompt probable cause hearing the district court rejected this claim,reasoning that a violation of a state rule of criminal procedure can not sustain a federal claim.be that as it may,and fully acknowledging plaintiffs rather inarticulate presentation on this point,we readily conclude that mary cherrington has stated a viable fourth amendment claim as a result of the delay in affording her a probable cause hearing.we further find that the present record fails to establish as a matter of law that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.
though plaintiff cherrington has mentioned this ruling only in passing,the supreme court decision in county of riverside mclaughlin,d,provides the basis for her present fourth amendment claim.the court previously had recognized in gerstein pugh,d,that the fourth amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.in county of riverside,the court considered just how soon such a determination must be made,and concluded that judicial determinations of probable cause within hours of arrest will,as a general matter,comply with the promptness requirement of gerstein.county of riverside,at.at.while a delay of over hours is not per se unlawful,the government bears the burden in such cases to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance that led to the delayed probable cause determination.county of riverside,at.at.
in this case,mary cherrington was arrested without a warrant in the early morning hours of saturday,august,but she was not brought before a magistrate for a probable cause determination until about on tuesday,september.this delay of over hours significantly exceeded the general rule announced in county of riverside.absent some bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance,then,this delay violated cherrington fourth amendment right to a prompt judicial determination of probable cause.
neither of defendants two proposed extraordinary circumstances take this case outside the usual rule.first,defendants note that their undercover investigation continued after cherrington arrest,and that she agreed to cooperate in this ongoing operation by attempting to arrange a drug purchase.defendants reason that this undercover effort would have been jeopardized if cherrington had been brought before a magistrate.yet,this undercover operation surely had concluded by sunday,august,at,when cherrington was taken from the travel lodge motel and placed in jail.even so,cherrington was made to wait more than from this point before a magistrate found probable cause to arrest her.cherrington participation in the ongoing investigation,then,did not prevent defendants from complying with county of riverside rule 
next,defendants point to the intervening weekend and labor day holiday between mary cherrington arrest and the magistrate probable cause determination.county of riverside itself,however,expressly cautions that intervening weekends and holidays do not qualify as extraordinary circumstances that permit relief from the requirement.see county of riverside,at.at.accordingly,this court recently held that a municipality court scheme,under which court was never held on weekends or holidays,would very likely run afoul of the hour time limit established in riverside in cases of warrantless arrests on friday evenings or saturday mornings.alkire irving,cir.
in sum,the undisputed record establishes a violation of city of riverside rule,and defendants have failed to identify any emergency or other extraordinary circumstance that might take this case outside of the general rule.it follows that plaintiff cherrington can withstand the first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry by virtue of the violation of her fourth amendment right to a judicial determination of probable cause within hours of her arrest.her claim also survives scrutiny under the second,clearly established prong of the qualified immunity inquiry,because county of riverside itself,a decision which predated cherrington arrest by several years,would have alerted a reasonable official to i the existence of cherrington fourth amendment right to a judicial determination of probable cause within hours,and ii the unavailability of any intervening weekend or holiday exception to this rule.under the present record,therefore,the individual defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff cherrington fourth amendment claim of an excessive delay in the magistrate determination of probable cause for her arrest.
nonetheless,we hasten to add that the liability of the individual defendants is not a foregone conclusion upon remand.because the district court determined at the threshold that there had been no constitutional violation,it had no occasion to consider whether the two individual defendants actually named in the complaint,andre skeeter and chief kinney,could be held liable for such a violation.likewise,the parties have not addressed this issue in their briefs on appeal,and the record does not disclose all of the pertinent details of the specific roles played by defendants skeeter and kinney in mary cherrington detention and eventual appearance before a magistrate.consequently,we are limited to offering only a few general observations that the district court might wish to consider in any subsequent proceedings.
it is axiomatic,of course,that prohibits actions under color of state law which deprive an individual of a right secured by the constitution or a federal statute.see,cassady tackett,cir.thus,before a defendant may be held liable under section,that defendant must first possess power by virtue of state law,then misuse that power in a way that violates federal constitutional rights.christian belcher,cir.in the present context,this means that we must look to state law to determine who is responsible for ensuring that a judicial determination of probable cause is made within hours after an arrest.
under ohio law,where an arrest is made without a warrant,it generally falls to the arresting officer to bring the arrested person without unnecessary delay before a court having jurisdiction of the offense.ohio crim.e.in this case,the record establishes that defendant skeeter was one of the arresting officers,and there is some evidence of defendant kinney involvement in the decisions to arrest mary cherrington and initially take her to a motel rather than the circleville police station.the record is almost entirely silent,however,as to the roles played by these defendants or other law enforcement officials in the roughly period that cherrington remained in jail without being brought before a magistrate.
under this record,it is possible that either or both of the named defendants had a duty under ohio law to see that cherrington was promptly brought before a magistrate for a determination of probable cause to arrest her,and that either or both failed to take the necessary steps to discharge this obligation.it is equally possible,however,that one or both of these defendants took some steps to ensure that there was a prompt judicial determination of probable cause,but that,through no fault of their own,this did not occur.in other words,we lack the information necessary to resolve the issue of,whether the delay in mary cherrington probable cause determination was attributable to the actions or inaction of one or both of the named defendants.see,luck rovenstine,cir addressing this question of causation in the specific context of a claimed violation of county of riverside rule hallstrom city of garden city,cir same strepka miller,cir same.see generally gazette city of pontiac,cir addressing the proximate cause element of a claim.this matter must be determined upon remand to the district court.
under the present record,the defendant city is not entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff cherrington county of riverside claim.
as their final issue on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court award of summary judgment to the defendant city of circleville on their claims.although this sweeping challenge largely fails to withstand scrutiny,we find that this grant of summary judgment must be reversed in one limited,as it relates to plaintiff cherrington claim of undue delay in the judicial determination of probable cause to arrest her.with this lone exception,we affirm the district court rulings as to the defendant city.
a municipality can not be held vicariously liable under for the acts of its employees or agents.see monell department of soc.servs.of city of new york,d gregory shelby county,cir.rather,municipal liability attaches only where a constitutional violation results from the execution of a government policy or custom.gregory,at.beyond having to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality itself,a plaintiff 
must also demonstrate that,through its deliberate conduct,the municipality was the moving force behind the injury alleged.that is,a plaintiff must show that the
