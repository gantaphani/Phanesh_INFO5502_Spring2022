after years of marriage,appellant jenness brewer brewer and respondent ovidio federici federici entered into a marital settlement agreement and stipulated to a judgment of dissolution based thereon.subsequently,based upon mistake,federici filed a motion to set aside the judgment and a motion to set aside the marital settlement agreement.brewer appeals from the order granting the motions.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
preliminary facts.
brewer and federici were married in.brewer was a vice president at the national broadcasting company nbc in,brewer earned approximately.federici was an artist.he was not actively involved in his career.the family lived primarily on brewer salary.federici managed the family household,including the family finances,the community checking account,and the bills.he had access to the parties tax information.the parties had one daughter,born in.
brewer and federici separated in after years of marriage.
the dissolution and settlement.
on january,brewer served federici with a petition for dissolution of marriage and related documents.
the parties negotiated a marital settlement agreement.they agreed to a division of property as follows federici would receive his car,his personal property,specified furnishings,his investment accounts,his art collection,in lieu of stock options,shares of ge stock,and an equalizing payment of.he also was to receive for relocation expenses.brewer agreed to pay federici per year,for five years in,spousal support,and to pay federici health and auto insurance for that period of time.brewer was to receive a family trust and a medical malpractice claim.additionally,she was to receive the family home,her car,her personal property,furnishings not otherwise designated,her investment accounts,her ira individual retirement account,and ge stock options.she was also to receive a ny and all right,title and interest in her retirement and pension plan,her savings and security program with an approximately total balance of,though her employer,nbc.italics added.brewer assumed all marital debts.there was to be joint legal custody of the child,and brewer was to be the custodial parent.brewer agreed to be solely responsible for the child support.
there is no evidence that either spouse refused to provide documentation requested by the other spouse.
during the negotiations of the marital settlement agreement,brewer was represented by counsel and federici consulted an attorney on two occasions.
on february,the parties met in brewer attorney office.they signed the marital settlement agreement.at the time,the parties exchanged final declarations of disclosure,both dated january.all documents had been prepared by brewer attorney.
the two final declarations of disclosure were identical in content.they each included a schedule of assets and debts.the schedules had five columns,two of which were labeled and current gross fair market value.they provided a current gross value for the family residence at and showed that was owed.the following items were valued as unknown miscellaneous household furniture,furnishings,and appliances miscellaneous jewelry,antiques,art,coin,collections a brewer family trust and a medical malpractice action.
the two schedules of assets and debts further reflected the following 
a number of federici paintings were valued in another document at approximately.
attached to brewer final declaration of disclosure were two pages of an annual statement supplied by her employer,nbc.it showed that as of december,the nbc savings and security program had a value of.
at the time the final declarations of disclosure were signed,federici believed brewer had one pension plan and it had an approximate value of 
also on february,the parties signed a stipulated judgment.it contained a division of property,duplicating verbatim that which had been detailed in the marital settlement agreement.the stipulated judgment also had been prepared by brewer attorney.
on april,the stipulated judgment was entered.
the motions to set aside.
in december,federici moved to set aside the property division and spousal support portions of the judgment.in part,federici contended the motion should be granted because substantial community assets were not valued,including brewer nbc pension,and ge stock options.federici declared he had been under a mistaken belief regarding the amount he could earn during the next few years while he was in school.he found that while in school he could only earn per hour working parttime.he further declared that he would not have agreed to the spousal support provisions in the judgment or waived his community interest in brewer retirement benefits had he understood his limited earning potential.federici also contended that brewer final declaration of disclosure was inadequate because the schedule of assets and debts had not valued substantial community assets,including brewer nbc pension.
an expert declaration was submitted on behalf of federici.the expert declared that brewer interest in the nbc pension was worth,assuming a date of separation of august,and was worth,assuming a december,date of separation.
the parties conducted discovery.
on february,federici filed supplemental points and authorities.he pointed out that the judgment awarded brewer her retirement and pension plan,and her savings and security program with an approximate total balance of italics added.federici noted it had been learned through discovery that the value of the savings and security program was not.that sum that had been ascertained from brewer december annual statement,which was more than a year before the january disclosure statements.federici also noted that the annual statement had pages,but brewer had attached only two pages to her final declaration of disclosure.the omitted pages would have revealed other relevant information about the program,such as the amount brewer was to receive upon retirement.federici produced evidence revealing that brewer savings and security program was worth as of december,and as of december.additionally,federici showed that the nbc pension was worth at least.federici stated that when he agreed to the property settlement,he had not understood that brewer had two retirement plans through her employer.this mistake explained why he had accepted the global settlement,including the equalization payment,and why the marriage settlement agreement and the stipulated judgment referred to a total balance of for the retirement plans.
on february,federici filed a second motion.it was to set aside the marital settlement agreement.federici contended,among other arguments,that there had been a mistake.federici argued that the parties were mistaken as to the value and possibly as to the number of brewer pension plans and that brewer had failed to comply with the disclosure requirements as set forth in family code and elucidated in marriage of varner th,d by listing unknown for the value of her nbc pension and ge stock options and by listing an outdated value for her savings and security program.
in opposing the motions,brewer stated she did not understand how her retirement benefits worked and she had valued the nbc pension as unknown because she had not known its value.brewer also stated that she had not attempted to hide anything,as she acknowledged she had two retirement plans through her employer.brewer admitted she had not tried to ascertain the value of the nbc pension.
the order setting aside the judgment and the marital settlement agreement.
the trial court set aside the judgment and the marital settlement agreement,except as to marital status.
in its statement of decision,the trial court found the following brewer contended the date of separation was august.federici claimed the date of separation was december,the community interest in brewer nbc pension,a defined pension plan,was worth between and,depending upon the date of separation and,brewer savings and security program was a defined contribution plan.as of december,it was worth,and was entirely community property.as of december,the savings and security program was valued at,and as of december,it was valued at.the community interest in this asset after december,would depend upon how much was contributed by brewer from her earnings.
in the statement of decision,the trial court further found the following 
the final declarations of disclosure of both parties,which were signed on january,listed the value of brewer nbc pension plan as unknown and listed the value of brewer savings and security program as.brewer attached to her final declaration of disclosure only those two pages of her annual benefits statement showing the value of her savings and security program as of december.brewer did not attach the remaining pages of the benefits statement which provided an estimate of the monthly income brewer would receive from her nbc pension plan upon retirement at a certain age,but did not include an actuarial value.
the equalization payment awarded to federici in the judgment was based upon a valuation of for the savings and security program.
the approximate total value of brewer nbc pension and savings and security program as of december,was to,almost all of which is community property 
on the basis of the foregoing findings alone and without consideration of federici claims regarding the division of other community assets or the terms of the spousal support award,federici has met the requirement of family code b.
the failure of brewer final declaration of disclosure to state the value of the nbc pension or the current value of the savings security program constituted a material omission.while the statement that the value of the asset was unknown did not constitute perjury,the omission of any value for the nbc pension plan constituted a breach of fiduciary duty imposed upon spouses by family code and e.the omission led to a mistake of fact regarding the value of what appear s to be the largest and second largest community assets.the parties entered into the marital settlement agreement and the judgment without full knowledge of the facts and as a result their decision and any waivers made as part of that decision can not be said to be knowing.family code requires an accurate and complete disclosure of assets and liabilities.the parties final declarations of disclosure were neither accurate nor complete.
the court finds that pursuant to family code e and marriage of varner th,d,the judgment must be set aside in its entirety except for the termination of marital status.it would be both illogical and unlawful to hold either of the parties to an agreement where there was not full and complete disclosure or to allow either party to choose which portions of an agreement to set aside.
on july,the trial court ordered that the judgment and the marital settlement agreement,except as to status,be set aside.brewer appealed.
discussion 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting aside the judgment and the marital settlement agreement based on mistake.
brewer contends the trial court abused its discretion in setting aside the judgment and the marital settlement agreement.this contention is unpersuasive.
the lack of full and accurate disclosure may be grounds for a motion to set aside based upon mistake.
marriage creates a fiduciary relationship between spouses,subd.b,subd.e.the confidential relationship between spouses imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,subd.b.as part of these obligations,each spouse is required to provide the other spouse with access to all books regarding transactions for purposes of inspection and copying,subd.b,and rendering upon request true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property,subd.b.additionally,spouses must make full and accurate disclosure and account for separate and community property,subds.b c sound public policy favors reducing adversarial nature of marital dissolution and attendant costs by fostering full disclosure and cooperative discovery,requiring accurate and complete disclosures,requiring both preliminary and final declarations of disclosure,requiring preliminary declaration of disclosure,subd.a requiring final declaration of disclosure.the duty of disclosure includes the obligation to make full disclosure to the other spouse of all material facts and information regarding the existence,characterization,and valuation of all assets in which the community has or may have an interest,subd.e,italics added.
the parties also have a continuing duty to update and augment that disclosure to the extent there have been any material changes so that at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of any of these issues,each party will have as full and complete knowledge of the relevant underlying facts as is reasonably possible,subd.c.the final declarations of disclosure must include,among other items,a ll material facts and information regarding the valuation of all assets that are contended to be community property or in which it is contended the community has an interest,subd.b,italics added.
these duties arise without reference to any wrongdoing.in re stanifer bankr th cir.
the formulation of a marital settlement agreement is not an ordinary business transaction,resulting from an negotiation between adversaries.rather,it is the result of negotiations between fiduciaries required to openly share information,subd.b,subd.e,subds.b c.
a trial court may not set aside a dissolution judgment on the sole grounds the judgment is inequitable or the support ordered is inadequate.in re marriage of rosevear th,fn,d.
motions to set aside judgments are governed by family code section under this statute,there are five exclusive grounds to set aside a judgment.a ny action or motion to set aside such a judgment must be based on actual fraud,perjury,duress,mental incapacity,or mistake.in re marriage of rosevear,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
to set aside a stipulated or uncontested judgment based upon mistake,the mistake may be either mutual or unilateral,whether mistake of law or mistake of fact,subd.e.
in re marriage of varner th,at page,d varner,recently discussed setting aside a stipulated judgment based upon mistake.in varner,husband misrepresented the value of substantial assets.he prevented wife and her advisors from having access to the information from which the assets could be valued.the trial court refused to set aside the judgment.the appellate court reversed,concluding the failure to disclose the existence or value of a community asset constituted grounds for setting aside the judgment on the grounds of mistake.accord,in re marriage of jones th,d.
brewer asserts varner holding should be limited to its facts,facts that would have been sufficient for findings of fraud and perjury.varner should not be read so narrowly.varner decision to set aside the settlement agreement was based solely upon an extreme of important community assets.varner held,w e conclude that the failure of a spouse to disclose the existence or the value of a community asset,as occurred in the present case,constitutes a basis for setting aside a judgment on the grounds of mistake under section.varner,supra,th at,d.
thus,spouses may be relieved of a stipulated judgment based upon incomplete or inaccurate information.varner,supra,th at,d,claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
in addition to establishing mistake,the party seeking relief must also establish that the facts alleged as the grounds for relief materially affected the original outcome and that the moving party would materially benefit from the granting of the relief,subd.b.
brewer and federici seem to agree that if the facts support setting aside the judgment,the marital settlement agreement must also be set aside.there were conflicting declarations as to the circumstances leading up to the settlement agreement and the judgment based thereon.we review the trial court decision in ruling on the motion to set aside the judgment and the motion to set aside the marital settlement agreement to determine if the trial court abused its discretion.in re marriage of rosevear,supra,th at,d varner,supra,th at,d.
here there was a unilateral mistake by federici warranting relief.
contrary to brewer contention,the t
