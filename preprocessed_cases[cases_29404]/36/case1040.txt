introduction 
appellant floyd appeals from a final order regarding custody of his daughter sarah and floyd were dating when sarah became pregnant with floyd and sarah lived together,but never married.when was approximately one and a half years old,sarah decided to leave floyd and move to colorado with.a month after sarah and arrived in colorado,sarah filed a petition in the trial court to establish that floyd was father,and requested that the court determine custody and visitation,and appropriate child support.
after reviewing the report of the evaluator and hearing testimony from the parties,the trial court concluded that because had a more mature and stable relationship with her mother,it would be in best interest to grant sarah primary physical custody,even though sarah resided in colorado.
on appeal,floyd raises a variety of legal and factual challenges to the trial court actions in this case.floyd asserts that the trial court erred when it did not find sarah in violation of the standard temporary restraining order tro issued in conjunction with sarah petition to establish a parental relationship on the ground that she moved with to colorado.floyd also contends that it was error for the court to adopt the reports of the family court mediator and the child custody evaluator.floyd further asserts that the trial court failed to apply the appropriate standard for a case.in addition,floyd raises a number of other contentions,in which he essentially the facts of this case and claims that it was inappropriate for sarah to move to colorado,and that he can not have a meaningful relationship with if sarah is permitted to retain primary physical custody of in colorado.
floyd also raises arguments in his reply brief that he did not raise in his opening brief.floyd contends in his reply brief that the trial court made a number of procedural errors that deprived him of a fair hearing.specifically,floyd asserts that the trial court never required sarah to request a move away order that the court prevented floyd from presenting his entire case by insisting on concluding the hearing before on the day of the hearing,and that the court failed to define the purpose and scope of the evaluation the court ordered pursuant to evidence code section.
we conclude that none of the arguments floyd raises presents a sufficient ground for reversing the trial court order.although floyd takes issue with the evidence presented and the trial court interpretation of that evidence,he has not shown that the trial court committed legal error or that the court abused its discretion in setting out a custody plan for.we therefore affirm the trial court custody order.

discussiona.standard of review 
b.the tro does not provide a basis for reversing the trial court order 
floyd argues that by removing from california,sarah violated the standard tro that is issued upon the filing of a petition to establish a parental relationship.the tro prohibits any party from removing the child from the state without the consent of the other party or a court order.floyd contends that early in the process,when the court heard sarah osc and issued a temporary custody order,the trial court should have required that sarah return to california rather than allowing her to remain in colorado with 
sarah filed the petition to establish floyd as father pursuant to the uniform parentage act,family code section,et.section provides that when a petition is filed under this section,in addition to the contents required by section of the code of civil procedure,in a proceeding under this part the summons shall contain a temporary restraining order restraining all parties,without prior written consent of the other party or an order of the court,from removing from the state any minor child for whom the proceeding seeks to establish a parent and child relationship.floyd contends that the court failure to order that be returned to california pursuant to the restraining order constitutes error.we disagree.
as the trial court pointed out,the statute does not state that a child who is already residing in another state at the time the petition is filed must be returned to california.rather,the provision states only that a parent may not remove the child from the state,absent written permission from the other party or an order of the court,once the petition has been filed.was not in california at the time the petition was filed,and there is no indication that sarah unlawfully removed from california.there was no court order in effect in february when sarah moved with to colorado,since neither party had petitioned the court for an order determining custody at that time.
floyd admits that there was no court order in place before sarah moved to colorado.he states in his opening brief,prior to february,there were no custody orders in place.in fact,neither floyd nor sarah had ever been before this court on any issue and as such,the custody was truly joint custody there was thus no legal impediment to sarah changing residence 
floyd has cited no authority that suggests that a parent who is residing in another state with a child at the time he or she seeks the assistance of
