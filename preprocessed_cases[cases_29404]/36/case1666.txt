this appeal is from a judgment terminating the parental rights of julie to her son steven h.the appeal asserts the judgment must be reversed because the orange county social services agency ssa failed to comply with the requirement of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b b that notice of the termination hearing be served on steven grandparents.we issued an order indicating we were considering dismissing the appeal on our own motion,on the ground that julie herself had not authorized it.julie counsel filed opposition,arguing that the requirement appellant personally authorize an appeal did not apply where,as here,the appellant is a minor.counsel also contended that dismissal of the appeal for lack of authorization was improper where the basis of the appeal is lack of proper notice to appellant in the trial court 
we determined that the motion to dismiss would be resolved in conjunction with the merits of the appeal.now,having considered counsel arguments in light of the facts contained in the record,we conclude that dismissal of the appeal is inappropriate.we further conclude that the requirement of notice to the grandparents is intended,at least in part,as an attempt to deliver notice to the absent parent.under those circumstances,julie has standing to raise the issue,and the failure to give required notice to the grandparents warrants reversal of the judgment.
julie gave birth to steven in may,when she was barely years old and attending junior high school.on november,a petition was filed alleging that steven came within section because julie herself had been detained due to medical neglect by her mother and her mother failure to comply with her service plan.on january,steven was adjudicated a dependent,but custody was vested with julie under a plan of family maintenance.
julie initially did well with steven.in fact,the initial report for the six month review hearing recommended termination of his dependency.the social worker noted that while julie was young,she was willing to learn.moreover,the fact that julie herself remained a dependent meant that her care of steven would remain supervised,regardless of steven own dependency status.
however,the social worker changed her recommendation in an updated report.julie had reportedly stated she wanted steven to spend weekends with her mother,and was planning on having him live with her sister once the case was closed.based upon those facts,the social worker recommended continued supervision.the court adopted the social worker recommendation and set the case for a further review in december.
the ssa report filed in december stated that steven remained with julie in a foster home in fontana.julie had improved her parenting skills and was asking for additional parenting classes.julie also participated in weekly counseling classes and was reported to be enthusiastic about them.she demonstrated an understanding of her responsibilities through her daily care of steven.the social worker reported that julie felt very comfortable being a mother and did not feel her youth was a hinderance.the parties stipulated to continued dependency and the court set another review hearing for may.
unfortunately,the situation began deteriorating after that.in february,ssa filed a subsequent petition pursuant to section,alleging steven came within the provisions of section,subdivisions a and b because it was alleged julie had spanked or hit him on the hand and the back,leaving a hand print on at least one occasion.additionally,julie herself was removed from her foster care and placed at orangewood,because her foster mother had been mean to the foster girls and had reportedly hit steven.julie denied ever hitting steven,reporting she used to discipline him.shortly after the move,julie caretaker reported,i amazed at how well julie parents steven,especially due to her young teen age of only.it was also reported that steven was somewhat aggressive with julie,and had a habit of hitting,but that julie was never seen to hit back.
the court ordered steven detained under the subsequent petition,setting a hearing for march.the social worker report noted that julie was then requesting placement of both herself and steven with her mother,ladonna c.she also wanted to become emancipated so she could get a job and support steven.at the march hearing,julie entered a plea of nolo contendere to count three of the petition,which was based upon the fact that julie herself had been placed at orangewood.counts one and two,alleging failure to protect,were dismissed.
in april,ssa filed a supplemental petition pursuant to section.julie,then placed at the florence crittenton home,was threatening to run away because she was not allowed to have visits with a male who was significantly older,or to attend skin head group meetings.additionally,she had threatened to kill herself.at julie request,steven was taken into protective custody at orangewood,because she felt she could not care for him.julie was considering relinquishing her parental rights.
on april,the court ordered steven detained on the supplemental petition,set a hearing for may,and ordered unmonitored visitation for julie.however,julie left her placement on may,and her whereabouts were unknown.although julie was aware of the may hearing,she did not appear,and the hearing was continued several times.in the interim,the social worker contacted julie mother,ladonna,to arrange visitation with steven.ladonna stated she did not know julie whereabouts,but was aware that julie had tried to reach her by phone.
on june,julie telephoned the social worker,and informed her she was residing out of state.she did not give an address or telephone number.julie also stated she was planning to attend the next hearing.
on june,the hearing proceeded without julie.the court found the allegations of the supplemental petition to be true as amended and ordered custody taken away from julie and vested with ssa.the court ordered a review hearing for november,telling julie counsel to notify julie if you able to find her.
julie visited steven on september.in october,she reportedly contacted a foster family agency worker and stated she wanted steven foster family,with whom he had been placed since june,to adopt him.julie was advised to contact the social worker about adoption,but she did not do so.instead,when julie contacted the social worker on november,she stated she could not decide what to do.she wanted steven back,but was aware she had been making very bad decisions.she stated she was planning to turn herself in.julie contacted the social worker again on november.she was unsure if she could make it to the scheduled hearing,as she was in arizona.she refused an offer of transportation back to california.she also stated she was willing to have steven foster family adopt him if they would agree to allow her to have pictures at least once per year.
ssa recommended termination of reunification services at the six month review hearing scheduled for november.at that hearing,the court set the matter for a contested hearing,which took place on december.at the december hearing,julie counsel requested a continuance because she did not yet know julie wishes.the request was denied.the court then made a finding that reasonable services had been provided,ordered services terminated,and set the case for a section hearing.the court also specifically found that ssa had used due diligence to locate julie,and ordered she be given notice of the section hearing through counsel.
julie was given notice of the section hearing by publication.there is no evidence julie was actually aware of the hearing her counsel stated she had not spoken to julie since the middle of september.counsel objected to the hearing on the basis that notice had not been given in accordance with the requirements of section,subdivision b b.specifically,she contended that notice had not been given through counsel,and more importantly,that no notice had been given to steven grandparents as required by the statute.
the court overruled the objection and proceeded to terminate parental rights.julie counsel then filed notice of appeal on her behalf,candidl
