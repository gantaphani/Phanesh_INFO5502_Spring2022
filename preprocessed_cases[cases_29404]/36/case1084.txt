this is an appeal from a judgment entered in favor of respondents alameda county child protective services county and two of its employees,michael yee and paula richards collectively,employees.appellant jacqueline,individually and as guardian ad litem for minors roes through collectively,minors,filed a complaint alleging several causes of action sounding in negligence and negligence per se based on employees conduct in investigating reports of possible sexual abuse to minors.
respondents moved for summary judgment,which the trial court denied.respondents then filed a petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition in this court,which we granted after concluding respondents were immune from liability under government code section section.complying with the alternative writ,the trial court vacated its order denying respondents summary judgment motion and entered a new order granting the motion.
on appeal,jacqueline raises essentially the same arguments she relied upon in opposing summary judgment and the petition for a writ of mandate or prohibition.and for the same reasons we rejected her arguments previously,we reject them here.the judgment will thus be affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
jacqueline is mother to minors with her former husband,albert collectively,parents.after they divorced,parents shared joint custody of minors,while primary physical custody remained with jacqueline minors routinely had weekend visits with albert at the house he shared with his girlfriend,kelly,and her son,on three,and received reports alleging that was sexually abusing roes and during their weekend visits with albert 
the first report was submitted on august,by minors therapist,clark conant.according to the report,conant informed county that,during a visit to his office,roe screamed when using the toilet.jacqueline then examined roe and found redness in her vaginal area.when asked about the redness,roe explained she hate s because he sits on me and kisses me.roe then said that asked roe to kiss roe and to suck his penis.
after receiving the report,county immediately completed an emergency response unit child protective services cps intake form and screener narrative,and the matter was referred to respondent michael yee,a county social worker,for investigation.during his subsequent investigation,yee,among other things,contacted jacqueline prepared a history visited the homes of both jacqueline and albert conducted interviews of,mother and siblings,and minors and spoke by telephone with albert in addition,on september,yee the alleged abuse to the newark city police department,which decided not to pursue any action at that time.ultimately,yee concluded in a written investigative narrative that the child abuse allegations were unsubstantiated,noting in doing so that parents were engaged in a messy child custody fight.
the second report was submitted on october,by minors maternal.according to this report,roe told her during a bath to lick her bootie.when the asked roe where she learned to say that,roe said from 
again,after receiving the report,county immediately conducted an emergency response unit cps intake form and screener narrative,and the matter was referred to respondent paula richards,another county social worker,for investigation.during richards subsequent investigation,she reviewed the file from yee investigation the prior year,and noted that the screener narrative identified the new allegations as substantially similar to the earlier ones that yee had found unsubstantiated.richards spoke several times by telephone with jacqueline and attempted a home visit,but no one answered the door.she also obtained authorization from jacqueline to speak to minors family court therapist,and thereafter spoke to the therapist several times.
like yee,richards also the alleged abuse to the newark city police department.in doing so,richards spoke to the officer assigned to the case,detective ramirez,who informed her that she was familiar with the family and had decided against pursuing a criminal investigation at that time,noting the family was dealing with several custody issues.
ultimately,richards deferred further investigation due in part to the ongoing and contentious family court proceedings and mediation.but richards kept the matter open until,when the third report of suspected abuse was received.
the third report on june,was again submitted by minors maternal,and then referred to richards upon the immediate completion of an emergency response unit cps intake form and screener narrative.in the third report,the stated,among other things,that roe had told her was gay,and when she asked him to explain why he believed this,roe had explained pulls his own and roe pants down and puts his private part on roe and in his face.the also reported that,when jacqueline asked roe whether anyone had touched her private parts,she replied sometimes touches me with my pants off and my pants on.roe further told her i hate going there to house every time he does it,and i do like it.jacqueline then asked roe whether touched his private parts,and he responded,not me,just roe.
in response to the third report,richards again to newark city police department,speaking to detective ramirez on july.county,in conjunction with the newark city police department and the alameda county district attorney office,then arranged for child abuse listening interview coordination center calico interviews of roes and,which were conducted by a forensic child interviewer on july.
ultimately,all three,the newark city police department and the alameda county district attorney based on the evidence that the sexual abuse allegations were unsubstantiated.thereafter,richards concluded in a written investigative narrative that nothing the children said during the calico interviews indicated they had been sexually abused,and that their encounters with,including one in which,according to roe,put his private part on my face,were best described as horseplay.richards thus closed the case file.
sometime after the case was closed,admitted sexually molesting roes and.and during subsequent calico interviews,the children revealed much more specific evidence of abuse.was thus criminally charged for the abuse and detained in a juvenile detention facility.
on june,jacqueline filed this lawsuit,asserting causes of action for child per se,statutory per se,negligence,and negligent hiring,supervision and retention.after two rounds of amendments,respondents demurred to the second amended complaint on the ground that they were immune from liability under government code sections and.the trial court overruled the demurrer.respondents then moved for summary judgment on the same ground,which the trial court also denied.
on june,respondents filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition in this court,challenging the trial court denial of its motion for summary judgment.after permitting informal briefing,this court issued an alternative writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside and vacate its order denying summary judgment and to enter an order granting the motion.alternatively,this court ordered the trial court to show cause why it should not be compelled to comply with the alternative writ.
on august,the trial court complied with the alternative writ,issuing an order granting summary judgment to respondents.this court thus discharged the alternative writ and summarily denied the petition as moot.as such,no formal briefing was ordered,and the matter never came on calendar for hearing.respondents have included the alternative writ as exhibit b to respondents brief.alameda county child protective services et superior court of alameda county,order issuing alternative writ.
on september,jacqueline filed a petition for review in the california supreme court,which was denied.on october,judgment was entered in favor of respondents,leading to this appeal.
discussion 
summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we review this question of law independently.code civ,subd.c preach monter rainbow th,d.in doing so,however,we must view the evidence in a light favorable to the losing party citation,liberally construing his evidentiary submissions while strictly scrutinizing the prevailing party own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in the losing party favor.saelzler advanced group cal th,d,barton elexsys international,th,d.
here,summary judgment was granted on the ground that,as a matter of law,respondents are immune from liability for alleged negligence and negligence per se in connection with reporting,investigating and allegations that roes and had been sexually abused.jacqueline contends this grant of summary judgment on immunity grounds was erroneous because respondents alleged investigatory failures amounted to breaches of mandatory and ministerial duties.
this court has once before addressed the issue of respondents immunity under california law.as set forth above,in issuing an alternative writ of mandate ordering the trial court to grant summary judgment in favor of respondents,we concluded both county and employees were immune from liability under two code sections.in so concluding,we reasoned that the investigation of allegations of child abuse and the decision of what action,if any,should be taken are uniquely governmental functions.fn.a decision to remove a child from his her home or not to do so and the investigation that informs that decision involve precisely the kinds of sensitive policy decision s that require judicial abstention to avoid affecting a coordinate governmental entity decisionmaking or planning process.barner leeds cal th,d.
despite having previously explained via the alternative writ our conclusion that respondents are entitled to immunity,we consider the issue anew on appeal,given that we summarily denied respondents writ petition as moot,without ordering formal briefing or giving the parties the opportunity for oral argument,when the trial court complied with the writ.kowis howard cal th,d,where a respondent to a petition for writ of mandate chooses to act in conformity with the alternative writ,the petition becomes moot and there is no cause to be decided by the court of appeal in a written opinion.we therefore turn again to the relevant law.
under the california tort claims act,government code section et e xcept as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person,subd.a emphasis added stats,ch.the liability of a public entity established by this part commencing with section is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute,including this part,and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.id.at subd.b.
here,jacqueline sets forth two statutory bases for holding respondents liable under the california tort claims act.first,jacqueline seeks to hold county derivatively liable for the alleged acts or omissions of employees under section.second,she seeks to hold county directly liable for alleged acts or omissions under section.we address each claim in turn.
liability under section.
a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative,subd.a stats,ch.except as otherwise provided by statute,a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability,subd.b.stats,ch.
here,jacqueline seeks to hold county derivatively liable for employees alleged acts or omissions in investigating allegations that roes and had been sexually abused.respondents,in turn,argue employees,and thus county,are immune from such liability under section and section.section provides a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,whether or not such discretion be abused.section,in turn,provides a public employee is not liable for injury caused by his or her instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his or her employment,even if he or she acts maliciously and without probable cause.stats,ch,stats,ch.
our california supreme court has recently considered a claim of a public employee discretionary act immunity under section.in barner leeds,supra,cal th,d,the court concluded not all acts requiring a public employee to choose among alternatives entail the use of discretion within the meaning of section.barner,supra,cal th at,d,barner.rather,immunity is limited to policy and planning decisions,and does not reach lower level decisions that merely implement a basic policy already formulated.id.at,d.the scope of the discretionary act immunity should be no greater than is required to give legislative and executive policymakers sufficient breathing space in which to perform their vital policymaking functions.ibid.
applying this rule to the facts before it,the barner court concluded a public defender initial decision to provide representation to a criminal defendant was a sensitive policy decision subject to discretionary act immunity under section.barner,supra,cal th at,d.a public defender subsequent decisions in implementing that initial decision,such as decisions regarding the type and extent of legal services to provide the defendant,however,were operational,related to policy implementation,and thus not subject to immunity under section.ibid.
here,not surprisingly,jacqueline argues employees alleged tortious acts were operational decisions,and thus not immunized by.she reasons that m any of the decisions inherent to th e investigatory process including whether to accept a report of child abuse from a reporter,whether to prepare an internal report and to timely to other agencies,whether to respond immediately,whether to utilize social workers skilled in emergency response,whether to interview certain individuals regarding the allegations or to have contact with the alleged victim,and whether to take further actions to protect the largely operational or ministerial decisions pertinent to the implementation of those and other prescribed duties,as well as to the overall investigative function.
several appellate courts,however,have rejected such reasoning.those courts have held that a social worker decisions relating to,as here,the investigation of child abuse,removal of a minor,and instigation of dependency proceedings,are discretionary decisions subject to immunity under section,prosecutorial or decisions subject to immunity under section,alicia county of los angeles d.county and its social workers held immune from liability under either or both of sections and for alleged negligence in investigating report of child molestation alicia jenkins county of orange d.county and its social workers held immune from liability under section for fail ing to use due care by not thoroughly investigating the child abuse report and fail ing to weigh and present all the evidence jenkins newton county of napa d.citing section in holding county immune from liability for actions necessary to make a meaningful investigation of child abuse newton county of los angeles superior court th,d county held immune from liability under section for alleged negligent placement and supervision of child in foster home where child was sexually molested terrell see also ronald county of san diego th,d county held immune from liability under section for negligent selection of an adoptive home for a dependent child ronald.such courts have reasoned that c ivil liability for a mistaken decision would place the courts in the unseemly position of making the county accountable in damages for a decisionmaking process delegated to it by statute,newton,supra,d at.see also ronald,supra,th at,d t he nature of the investigation to be conducted and the ultimate determination of suitability of adoptive parents by social workers bear the hallmarks of uniquely discretionary activity.
alicia is illustrative.there,the plaintiff argued,as jacqueline does here,that a social worker investigative is ministerial and not discretionary.rejecting this argument,the court explained it is necessary to protect social workers in their vital work from the harassment of civil suits and to prevent any dilution of the protection afforded minors by the dependency provisions of the welfare and institutions code.therefore,social workers must be absolutely immune from suits alleging the improper investigation of child abuse,removal of a minor from the parental home based upon suspicion of abuse and the instigation of dependency proceedings.alicia,supra,d at.
similarly,relying on section,the court in jenkins concluded a social worker was entitled to absolute immunity from liability arising out of her actions in investigating child abuse allegations,initiating dependency proceedings and removing a child from his custodial parent.d at.in doing so,the court explained immunity under section covers not just the act of filing a criminal complaint,but also other prosecutorial or functions such as weighing and presenting evidence when rendering a decision on whether to proceed with litigation.id.at.see also kemmerer county of fresno d.amylou county of riverside th,d concluding that since investigation is part of the prosecution of a judicial proceeding,id.at,d acts committed in the course of the investigation are covered by section.
of course,particularly in light of our supreme court decision in barner,we would be remiss to interpret the case law as supporting the proposition that all actions by social workers involve policy or prosecutorial decisions falling within the scope of statutory immunity.on this point,scott county of los angeles th,d scott,is illustrative.there,the court held a social worker could be held liable for negligent supervision of a foster child where she failed to comply with regulations requiring her to make monthly home visits to the child.id.at,d.in doing so,the court reaffirmed alicia holding that a social worker decision to initiate dependency proceedings is a decision immunized by section.the court clarified,however,that the actual delivery of public social services,such as foster care,to abused,neglected or exploited children,are actions governed by specific statutory or regulatory directives which leave the officer no choice.id.at,d.as such,they would not be subject to immunity.ibid.
newton is also helpful.there,the court held a county was immune from liability for conduct relating to its investigation of reported child abuse,including failing to properly,thoroughly and completely investigate the source and basis for the underlying child abuse complaint.newton,d at and fn.immunity did not extend,however,beyond actions implied in the decision to investigate to gratuitous actions,unnecessary for a proper investigation.id.at.the county was thus not immune for such gratuitous actions as causing the minors to disrobe and stand naked in the presence of strangers and failing to seek or receive voluntary consent to disrobe them.id.at and fn.
with this case law in mind,we turn to the facts before us.unlike in scott,we are not concerned with the actual delivery of public social services to abused,neglected or exploited children.rather,we are concerned with social workers preliminary determinations regarding whether such services,including removal,were in fact necessary.moreover,unlike in newton,jacqueline makes no claim that employees engaged in gratuitous actions unnecessary for a proper investigation.rather,the alleged acts and omissions of which jacqueline the failure to conduct a reasonable and diligent investigation and to timely to other incidental to employees investigation,within the scope of their employment,of reports of possible abuse to roes and,and employees subsequent conclusion that such reports did not warrant initiation of dependency proceedings.newton,d at and fn.failing to properly,thoroughly and completely investigate the source and basis for the underlying child abuse complaint were not gratuitous actions unnecessary for a proper investigation.as such,we conclude as a matter of law that employees alleged acts and omissions are covered by the broad grant of immunity section affords to a public employee instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his or her employment,as well as the grant of immunity section affords to sensitive policy decisions that result from a governmental entity unique decisionmaking or planning process barner,supra,cal th at,d,
further,because we conclude employees are immune from liability for their alleged acts and omissions under sections and,we conclude county is likewise immune.though sections and expressly immunize only the employee,if the employee is immune,so too is the county,subd.b kayfetz state of california d.kemmerer county of fresno,supra,d at.
we thus turn to the issue of county direct liability under section.
liability under section.
a public entity may be directly liable for failure to discharge a mandatory duty.section provides where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.stats,ch.an enactment for purposes of section may include both formal legislative measures,such as statutes,and measures,such as regulations adopted by a state agency.scott,supra,th at,d.
a public entity may avoid direct liability under section,as it may avoid derivative liability under section,by establishing that it has statutory immunity.section,subdivision b provides t he liability of a public entity established by this part commencing with section is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute,including this part,and is subject to any defenses that would be available to the public entity if it were a private person.further,as set forth above,section,subdivision b provides except as otherwise provided by statute,a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.stats,ch,see also kemmerer,supra,d at.t hough sections and expressly immunize only the employee,if the employee is immune,so too is the county.
here,jacqueline claims county may be held directly liable under section for breach of mandatory duties imposed by the following enactments penal code section et penal code section,subdivision a,f,and i penal code section penal code section penal code section welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f and department of social services manual of policies and procedures dss manual regulation we consider each claim below.
penal code section et.stats,ch.
jacqueline contends penal code section et,also known as the child abuse and neglect reporting act canra,imposed a mandatory duty on county and employees to investigate suspected child abuse.moreover,jacqueline contends county and employees breached this mandatory duty,not by failing to investigate the alleged abuse,but rather by failing to reasonably and diligently investigate it.
section provided 
a this article shall be known and may be cited as the child abuse and neglect reporting act.
b the intent and purpose of this article is to protect children from abuse.in any investigation of suspected child abuse,all persons participating in the investigation of the case shall consider the needs of the child victim and shall do whatever is necessary to prevent psychological harm to the child victim.
as clear from this language,the statute imposed no mandatory duty on county or employees.rather,the statute merely stated the legislature intent and purpose in enacting canra,an article composed of over separate statutes.as such,section provided no statutory basis for liability under section.terrell,supra,th at,d an enactment creates a mandatory duty for purposes of section only if it requires a public agency to take a particular action.citation.an enactment does not create a mandatory duty if it merely recites legislative goals and policies that must be implemented through a public agency exercise of discretion.citation.
moreover,to the extent jacqueline,in citing penal code section generally,actually seeks to rely on unspecified sections of canra to establish liability,such attempt would likewise fail.the law is clear that,to prove a violation under section,a plaintiff must plead the existence of a specific statutory duty.unless the applicable enactment is alleged in specific terms,a court can not determine whether the enactment relied upon was intended to impose an obligatory duty to take official action to prevent foreseeable injuries or whether it was merely advisory in character.citation.terrell,supra,th at,d.
penal code section,subdivisions a,f,and i.stats,ch.
jacqueline contends penal code section,subdivisions a,f and i imposed mandatory duties on county and employees to accept reports of abuse from mandated,voluntary and anonymous reporters to make internal reports and to timely to other agencies regarding suspected child abuse she further contends county and employees breached these mandatory duties when yee allegedly failed to timely to law enforcement after receiving a report of suspected abuse from minors therapist,and when richards allegedly failed to timely prepare an internal report or to timely to law enforcement after receiving reports of suspected abuse from minors.
the relevant version of penal code section,subdivision a required,with some exceptions,a child care custodian who has knowledge of or observes a child,whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse to report such abuse to a child protective agency immediately or as soon as practically possible.the relevant version of subdivision f permited,but did not require,a ny other person who has knowledge of or observes a child whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been a victim of child abuse may report the known or suspected instance of child abuse to a child protective agency.and the relevant version of subdivision i required,with some exceptions,a county welfare department to immediately,or as soon as practically possible to law enforcement and certain other agencies by telephone every known or suspected instance of child abuse,and to submit a written report of the known or suspected abuse to such agencies within hours of receiving the relevant information.
we conclude jacqueline reliance on these three provisions to prove violations of section is misplaced.with respect to penal code section,subdivision a,a mandatory duty was imposed on certain mandated reporters,including child care custodians,of child abuse.here,county and employees were the alleged receivers of three reports of alleged child abuse from third parties rather than the reporters themselves.as such,they could not,as a matter of law,have breached a mandatory duty to report pursuant to this provision.
with respect to penal code section,subdivision g,it simply imposed no mandatory duty.rather,it permited,but did not require,certain voluntary reporters to submit reports of child abuse.as such,neither county nor employees could,as a matter of law,have violated a mandatory duty pursuant to this provision.terrell,supra,th at,d application of government code section requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory.
finally,as set forth above,the relevant version of penal code subdivision i required a county welfare department to immediately,or as soon as practically possible by telephone to certain public agencies every known or suspected instance of child abuse,and to then submit certain written reports within hours.here,it is undisputed that employees to the newark city police department each of the three reports of alleged abuse it received.it is further undisputed that,following receipt of each of those,the newark city police department determined based on the evidence that the abuse allegations were unsubstantiated.as such,even assuming county or employees breached a mandatory duty to timely under subdivision i,jacqueline could not,as a matter of law,establish that such breach was a proximate cause of minors alleged injuries,which section requires wilson county of san diego th,d to establish liability under section,a plaintiff must demonstrate breach of the statute mandatory duty was a proximate cause of the injury suffered see also thai stang d.i f the same harm,both in character and extent,would have been sustained even had the actor taken the required precautions,his failure to do so is not even a perceptible factor in bringing it about and can not as a matter of law be a substantial factor in producing it.
penal code section.stats,ch.
jacqueline also claims breach of a mandatory duty to instances of known or suspected child abuse pursuant to penal code section 
the only language in the relevant version of this statute that purported to govern county conduct provided the county welfare department or probation department shall,in cases where a minor is a victim of actions specified in section of this code and a petition has been filed pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code with regard to the minor,evaluate what action or actions would be in the best interest of the child victim and then submit in writing its findings and the reasons therefor to the district attorney on or before the completion of the investigation.emphasis added.here,undisputedly,no petition to initiate dependency proceedings had been filed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section when county alleged breach of this duty occurred.as such,penal code section provided no basis for liability under section.
penal code section.stats,ch.
jacqueline contends penal code section,like section,subdivision a,imposes a mandatory duty on county and employees to report suspected child abuse,which they also breached in this case 
this provision sets forth the statutory definition of the term mandated reporter it does not purport to impose any duty.as such,jacqueline reliance on section to establish liability under section fails.
penal code section.stats,ch.
jacqueline contends county and employees breached a mandatory duty under penal code section to accept reports of suspected child abuse from mandated,voluntary and anonymous reporters.as jacqueline concedes,however,a different version of this that merely set forth the statutory definition of child protective agency and did not purport to impose any in effect when the alleged child abuse was occurring between and moreover,even assuming county or employees were subject at the relevant time to a mandatory statutory duty to accept reports of abuse,jacqueline neglects to inform us how or when they breached such duty.the undisputed evidence proved county received three reports of possible child abuse of roes and received one report from minors therapist,and richards received two reports from minors.while jacqueline complains county and employees failed to adequately respond to these reports,she does not contend county or employees refused to accept them.given this,we conclude jacqueline can not as a matter of law prove any breach of a mandatory duty to accept reports of abuse.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f.stats,ch.
jacqueline contends county and employees breached a mandatory duty under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f to respond to any report of imminent danger to a child immediately and all other reports within calendar days.
with respect to the duty under this section to respond immediately to reports of imminent danger to a child,it is clear such duty arises only if a prior determination has been made that imminent danger discretionary determination expressly entrusted to county and employees.newton,supra,d at.as such,county or employees determination that no imminent danger existed is protected by the broad grant of immunity sections and afford county welfare departments and their officials in investigating alleged acts of child abuse and thereafter deciding whether to instigate dependency proceedings.newton,supra,at.concluding that county welfare department officials were immune from liability for their determination regarding whether an emergency situation existed that would trigger a mandatory duty to conduct an immediate response pursuant to welfare and institutions code section see also haggis city of los angeles cal th,d,where a statute calls for the exercise of judgment,expertise,and discretion,it does not create a mandatory duty within the meaning of section.
with respect to the duty under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f to respond within days to all other reports of abuse,we conclude the undisputed evidence reveals no breach.nowhere does the statute define respond or mandate a particular response.and here,county officials undisputedly responded to each report of alleged abuse of roes and by promptly generating screener narratives and then referring the matters to social workers for investigation,well within days of receiving the reports.to the extent jacqueline contends these responses were inadequate,county and employees decisions in this regard were again discretionary,and thus immunized under sections and for the reasons discussed.haggis,supra,cal th at,d.
dss manual regulation.
finally,jacqueline contends county breached a mandatory duty under dss manual regulation to utilize social workers skilled in emergency response when responding to referrals of reports of alleged child abuse 
we agree this regulatory language amounts to an order leaving county no choice but to utilize social workers skilled in emergency response when responding to a child abuse referral.see scott,supra,th at,d.however,even if county could be held liable for failing to obey this order,the record reveals no facts,disputed or otherwise,tending to prove a failure occurred in this case.
in particular,jacqueline has failed to set forth any evidence that identifies what it means to be skilled in emergency response.further,the evidence jacqueline has identified does not tend to prove that county utilized social workers unskilled in emergency response when responding to referrals with respect to the alleged abuse of roes and.
jacqueline points us to nothing in the record tending to reveal a failure of skills or training with respect to yee,and the undisputed evidence suggests otherwise.at the time of his investigation into the alleged abuse,yee had been a social worker for years,and had received extensive ongoing training in child abuse investigation.
with respect to richards,jacqueline points only to select portions of her deposition testimony where she admits to not being aware of all the details of what the dss manual says,to not knowing what the dss manual states with respect to the significance to be given during an investigation rather than during a referral to a parent history of substance abuse or criminal behavior,to receiving more extensive training in division regulations after her investigation in this case,and to not hav ing the department protocols memorized.such evidence,however,without more,would not permit a reasonable person to conclude she was unskilled in emergency response.rather,suggesting the contrary,undisputed evidence shows richards held a degree in psychology and an advanced degree in social work,was assigned to county emergency response unit in,over a year before she began investigating the alleged abuse of roes and,and began receiving ongoing professional training in child abuse investigation at the time of her hiring in.
based on this record,we conclude that,even viewing the evidence in a light favorable to jacqueline,as the law requires,no reasonable person could here find a breach of this duty.and such,jacqueline argument based on dss manual regulation provides no basis for holding county liable for negligence or negligence per se.
accordingly,for the reasons set forth above,we conclude the grant of summary judgment to respondents was proper and,thus,affirm the judgment.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.
sometime later in,jacqueline was advised by a friend,laura,that roe said her pee pee hurt because touches her there.jacqueline told laura that county was already investigating the alleged abuse,which had been reported by minors therapist,and requested that she call county to give this new information to the social worker in charge of the investigation.laura did so,speaking to a man whose name she did not recall and giving him her phone number in case he later had questions.laura did not hear from the man again.
during the calico interview,roe denied had sexually contacted or abused her,but described him as really mean.
all references to a particular code section are to the section in effect on the date when the relevant conduct allegedly occurred.
unless otherwise stated,all statutory citations herein are to the government code.
that employees ultimately decided against initiating dependency proceedings does not render section inapplicable.as both the statute and the case law make clear,the decision whether to initiate such that decision immunized.ingram flippo th,d district attorney conduct was an exercise of prosecutorial discretion immunized under section even though he decided not to prosecute an action.
in arguing that county and employees breached certain mandatory duties in violation of section,jacqueline relies in her opening brief on several enactments that she did not rely upon before the trial court,including penal code sections and,subdivision i.because jacqueline failed to raise arguments based on these enactments below,we decline to consider them here.reyes kosha th,fn,d.jacqueline also concedes that certain enactments she relied upon in her opening california code of regulations title,division,chapter,sections,and no mandatory duties on county.given her concession,we do not address these enactments,jacqueline concedes she relied on several dss manual regulations in her opening brief that are substantially similar to and cumulative of other code sections that have been cited by plaintiffs,and that are also similar and mostly cumulative as between themselves,including regulations,and.again,given her concession,we do not address these cumulative regulations here.
penal code section was amended effective january.stats ch.references here to penal code section are to the statute as it read prior to amendment,when the alleged child abuse occurred.
jacqueline acknowledges the language in penal code section,subdivision j and subdivision g,upon which she relies on appeal,is part of the current version of the statute rather than the version in effect when the alleged breach occurred.jacqueline explains,however,that the language in subdivision j is nearly identical to that found in subdivision i of the prior version of the statute,and that the language in subdivision g is nearly identical to that found in subdivision f of the prior version of the statute,both of which were in effect at the relevant time and were relied upon below.we find jacqueline reliance at various times on different versions of the same statute both confusing and frustrating.nonetheless,rather than find waiver,which we are no doubt entitled to do,we give jacqueline the benefit of the doubt and address the merits of her argument based on the version of the statute in effect during the relevant time to provided in relevant part a except as provided in subdivision b,any child care custodian,health practitioner,employee of a child protective agency,child visitation monitor,firefighter,animal control officer,or humane society officer who has knowledge of or observes a child,in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment,whom he or she knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse,shall report the known or suspected instance of child abuse to a child protective agency immediately or as soon as practically possible by telephone and shall prepare and send a written report thereof within hours of receiving the info
