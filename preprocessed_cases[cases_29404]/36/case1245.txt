discussion 
wife argues the trial court erred by refusing to apply in re marriage of haines th,d haines and family code section to a determination that the residence was husband separate property.wife further argues,applying haines and section husband has the burden of proof to rebut a presumption of undue influence over wife in signing the quitclaim deed.additionally,wife contends that clear and convincing evidence is required to overcome this presumption and husband did not meet this evidentiary standard.
application of haines and section 
statutorily,spouses have the right to enter into transactions with each other as well as other persons,subd.a.however,interspousal transactions must comport with the rules controlling the actions of persons occupying confidential roles with each other,subd.b.section,subdivision b provides i n transactions between themselves,a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other.section,subdivision b requires interspousal transactions to be pleasing to the fiduciary standard.haines,supra,th at,d.if one spouse secures an advantage from the transaction,a statutory presumption arises under section that the advantaged spouse exercised undue influence and the transaction will be set aside.haines,at,d.
the prerequisite elements for the statutory presumption under section to apply are there exists an interspousal transaction and one spouse has obtained an advantage over the other.haines,supra,th at,d.generally,a spouse obtains an advantage if that spouse position is improved,he or she obtains a favorable opportunity,or otherwise gains,benefits,or profits.bradner vasquez cal d.in the present case,husband and wife entered into an interspousal transaction by signing a quitclaim deed permitting the residence to be acquired in husband name only.through this transaction,the residence was acquired as husband separate property.husband received an advantage or benefit from wife execution of the quitclaim deed when the residence became his separate property.because the prerequisite elements are met,the statutory presumption of section and haines apply to the instant case.
the trial court declined to apply haines and section in this case based solely on a determination that the cases were factually distinguishable.in haines,the wife executed a quitclaim deed conveying her joint interest in the property to the husband,making it his separate property.the wife testified she did so under considerable emotional and physical duress the husband disputed this,characterizing the transaction as calm and businesslike.haines,supra,th at,d.during a period of reconciliation,the husband reconveyed his separate property interest in the property to himself and his wife as joint tenants.after the parties later separated,the wife filed for dissolution.id.at,d.
in the division of property,the trial court awarded the husband reimbursement for the full value of the property at the time of the second transfer to joint property as his separate property contribution to the community.haines,supra,th at,d.concluding the presumption of undue influence trumped the conflicting presumption of record title and the husband had not rebutted the wife claim of duress in the transaction,this court reversed the trial court reimbursement of the husband separate property interest.id.at,d.
although the facts of haines differ from those here,the reasoning and analysis supporting the applicability of section is the same in both cases.the rationale of haines applies to any interspousal property transaction in which the evidence shows one spouse obtained an advantage over the other.in re marriage of delaney th,d dela
