gordon albert sonne husband,the former administrator of monterey county,is a member of the california public employees retirement system calpers.members of calpers,once vested,participate in a defined benefit retirement plan,which supplies a monthly retirement allowance under a formula comprising factors such as final compensation,service credit,the credited years of employment,and a multiplier.the retirement allowance consists of an annuity which is funded by member contributions deducted from the member paycheck and interest thereon and a pension which is funded by employer contributions and which must be sufficient,when added to the annuity,to satisfy the amount specified in the benefit formula,subd.a,subd.a.
in,husband transferred to his former wife,dalia,years of service credit,which represented her interest in the service credit husband had earned during their marriage.dalia subsequently exercised her right to a refund of the accumulated contributions in the account,thereby permanently waiving her rights to any further claim on husband retirement benefits,including any service credit,subds.a,d.husband,who was then married to theressa lynn sonne wife,exercised his right to redeposit the contributions,and paid for it with community funds through monthly deductions from his salary.by the time husband and wife had separated,the community had redeposited percent of the scheduled payments,and the question arose what was the community share of the service credit from the marriage 
the trial court and the court of appeal agreed with wife that the community was entitled to percent of the service credit because the community had redeposited percent of the member contributions for that period of service.husband contends that such an apportionment vastly overstated the community interest,in that it accorded no weight or value to husband service as a deputy sheriff during that earlier period,which had supplied the consideration for the service credit.amicus curiae barbara difranza,certified family law specialist,contends further that since community funds contributed only to the annuity component of the retirement allowance,the community was entitled only to a pro tanto share of the not to a share of the much larger pension component,which was funded by employer contributions.
we agree with amicus curiae.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the matter for reconsideration of the apportionment of the service credit arising from the marriage.
background 
in march,husband began working as a deputy sheriff for monterey county.he was elected sheriff of monterey county in and retired in december.he earned years of service credit in the calpers retirement system.
for present purposes,we discuss two of husband marriages,each of which ended in dissolution.the first marriage,to dalia,ended in after more than years.under the original divorce settlement,husband was awarded all calpers pension and retirement rights earned during the marriage.in return,husband was to make an offsetting cash payment to dalia.
husband married wife on november.in,because husband could no longer keep up with the equalization payments to dalia,he transferred to her of the calpers service credit earned during their prior marriage.accordingly,calpers credited dalia nonmember account with years of service credit and in member contributions and interest.when dalia withdrew the contributions and interest,husband elected to redeposit them into his member account through a paycheck deduction over a period of years.the deduction at first was taken from his salary and then,when he retired,from his monthly retirement allowance.the redeposit ultimately restored the service credit to his member account.
husband filed for dissolution of his marriage to wife in january,after he had retired,but the deductions from his retirement allowance for the redeposit continued.the total of the deductions taken during his marriage to wife was.the member contributions and accumulated interest over husband entire career totaled.the actuarial present value of the retirement benefit at the time of trial was in excess of million.the difference between husband total contributions and the actuarial present value of the retirement account was funded entirely by husband employer as a current period expense.
in the dissolution proceeding arising from the marriage,the parties disputed the character of the redeposited member contributions and the service credit arising from the marriage,among other issues.
husband expert,ronald reddall,opined that the service credit was husband separate property and that the community had a right only to reimbursement of the community funds used to make the redeposit.however,when asked whether the community would be entitled to a pro tanto share of the appreciation,reddall replied that he would leave that to the lawyers.
wife expert,george mccauslan,did not address the issue of the redeposited member contributions or the service credit in his trial testimony.in an unsworn posttrial letter that was considered by the trial court,he articulated his understanding that the service credit should be allocated between community and separate property in the same proportion by which those estates had contributed to the redeposit.he determined that community funds had been used to redeposit percent of the member contributions from the marriage and concluded that the community should therefore be allocated an additional years x years of service credit.when these years were added to the service credit that was earned during the marriage,mccauslan calculated the community share of the retirement allowance to be percent.
husband offered an unsworn posttrial letter from reddall,who determined the community share through a different method,which assigned only an additional years of service credit to the community.reddall began with an estimate of the actuarial present value of the years of service credit.because the community had redeposited only percent divided by of the actuarial value of the service credit,the community was entitled only to percent of the service is service years.
the trial court largely adopted wife approach.it calculated that the community had provided of the in redeposited member contributions or percent and concluded that the community share of the service credits from the marriage was therefore percent.when added to the service credit earned during the marriage,the total community share of the retirement allowance was calculated by the trial court to be percent,and wife was awarded of this as her share.
the court of appeal affirmed this aspect of the judgment,but on different grounds.the court of appeal agreed that husband had a separate property interest in the premarital service to his employer,which created his right to repurchase the service credits.however,the court found that husband had commingled community property with his separate property when he used community funds to redeposit member contributions in order to recoup the premarital service credit,and he did not indisputably establish or unequivocally trace what proportion of the service credit was attributable to his separate property and what proportion to the community so as to overcome the presumption that the service credit became community property.see.according to the court of appeal,the trial court could have credited reddall allocation of the respective shares but was not required to credit this evidence,since t he trial court was vested with the power to credit or discredit husband evidence.if it discredited husband evidence,it could properly conclude that the community property presumption applicable to property purchased during a marriage with community funds had not been rebutted,and therefore the repurchased service credits were community property.the appellate court also rejected husband suggestion that the community be reimbursed for its contribution instead of being awarded an interest in his retirement allowance.
we granted husband petition for review and now reverse.
