background 
initial proceedings 
devin kilpatrick and ronda conn ronda married in.thereafter,kilpatrick,ronda,and,ronda son from a previous marriage,lived together in scottsbluff,nebraska.ronda mother,shirley conn shirley,also lived in scottsbluff,and she served as a frequent babysitter for 
in the spring of,shirley took to an appointment with bart mueller,one of physicians.shirley told mueller that had claimed that kilpatrick had punched him hard enough to cause a nosebleed.mueller saw no signs of facial injuries.as required by nebraska law,mueller called local law enforcement officials to report the suspected child abuse of,who was then ten years old.local authorities notified hhs case worker jolie becker,who investigated the report.recanted the story after ronda and shirley confronted him,and becker ultimately concluded that the allegation was unfounded.the scotts bluff county attorney office did not file charges against kilpatrick or seek to remove from his care.
on august,than six months case worker pat king received a phone call at home from jody eckhardt,ronda cousin.eckhardt told king that had bruises from being beaten by kilpatrick.king immediately contacted the local police,and scottsbluff police officer steven lopez arrived at shirley home,where had gone following the alleged beating.lopez noted that eyes and lips were bruised and swollen,and had other bruises on his forearm,shoulder,chest,and ankle.after riding to the police station with shirley,told lopez that kilpatrick had punched him several times.
lopez drove to the home of kilpatrick and ronda and arrested kilpatrick.at the police station,kilpatrick admitted to striking on prior occasions for disciplinary purposes and to spanking earlier that day.kilpatrick maintained that he did not cause the bruises on face,however,and suggested that those injuries may have been.when lopez told ronda that kilpatrick believed had caused the bruises himself,ronda shook her head and stated,no.ronda immediately petitioned the district court of scotts bluff county for a domestic abuse protection order against kilpatrick,but she voluntarily vacated the protection order two days later.
king and nan carver,another hhs case worker,investigated the matter for hhs.carver accompanied ronda and on a visit to one of physicians on the day ronda filed for the protection order,and carver noted that ronda disbelieved story of abuse.on august,king interviewed and shirley,and king informed ronda that hhs would file a petition to remove from her custody due to her failure to protect him from kilpatrick abuse.king also warned ronda that if she supported kilpatrick,she would lose.following day,scottsbluff police officer ken webber conducted a formal interview with ronda.suffered from disorder,and ronda told webber that she had seen hit himself before though he had never caused himself physical injuries as extensive as those displayed on august.shortly thereafter,the scotts bluff county attorney office initiated proceedings to remove from the care of ronda and kilpatrick.ronda filed for divorce.
the county attorney indicted kilpatrick on felony child abuse charges,and the case went to trial in december.kilpatrick submitted medical evidence that was prone to events to receive attention from ronda and that had engaged in in the past.a jury acquitted kilpatrick of all charges.the county attorney subsequently dismissed the parallel custody suit to remove from the care of ronda and kilpatrick,and was returned to ronda.
investigation and lawsuit 
vindicated in state proceedings,ronda and kilpatrick soon began raising complaints regarding hhs handling of allegations.counsel for the couple successfully sought the appointment of a special county prosecutor to investigate king behavior in the case,particularly whether king engaged in criminal witness tampering when she cautioned ronda against supporting kilpatrick.ronda and kilpatrick made comments critical of king and hhs that were published in a series of newspaper articles appearing in the omaha and the scottsbluff in the spring of.following publication of the articles,hhs began its own internal investigation of king conduct and reassigned her to different office duties.on july,the special prosecutor issued a press release stating that he would not file criminal charges against king.the special prosecutor noted that,while king actions push ed the envelope and c a me close to crossing the line of legality,the context of king statement to ronda indicated that it was likely made to explain the consequences of testifying falsely regarding known abuse,rather than to coerce ronda into testifying falsely or to chill her from testifying truthfully.the hhs internal investigation concluded the next day,finding that king conduct in the case was proper and that her comment to ronda was not inappropriate.king immediately returned to normal duties.
kilpatrick then took legal action on august,he filed a lawsuit against king and hhs alleging that the defendants conduct in handling allegations violated kilpatrick fourth,sixth,and fourteenth amendment rights,and that the defendants conspired to violate his civil rights.one month later,kilpatrick amended his complaint to add two new defendants hhs director ron ross and kathy carter,one of king supervisors in the gering,nebraska hhs office.the discovery process was slow,due in large part to hhs evasive and answers to some of kilpatrick interrogatories.on april,kilpatrick filed a motion to compel hhs to give complete responses to those interrogatories,which the district court granted.
placement on central register 
in the spring of,carter instructed hhs protection and safety supervisor holly brandt to clean up the open files on roughly to old cases,a grouping that included the kilpatrick case.this task involved reviewing the files to make one of four possible case status determinations unfounded,meaning that the evidence indicates that no abuse or neglect took place inconclusive,meaning that a preponderance of the evidence shows that abuse or neglect occurred,but there was no judicial substantiation of the allegations,meaning that a court has found that the child at issue was the victim of abuse or neglect and unable to locate,meaning that hhs can not find the subjects of an allegation.if hhs classifies a case as inconclusive or,it must place the names of the alleged perpetrators on nebraska child central register of abuse and neglect the register.listings on the register are not available to the general public,although some agencies have direct access to such listings.other and agencies may inquire as to whether a particular individual is listed on the register by requesting that information from hhs.in addition,hhs will provide such information to any other agency or organization that obtains written consent from the subject of the inquiry.
brandt was familiar with the kilpatrick file.she served as king immediate supervisor in the gering office,and she had participated in the internal investigation that cleared king of wrongdoing in the matter.she was aware that kilpatrick had been acquitted of felony child abuse,though she had neither attended the trial nor obtained transcripts of the proceedings.after a five to discussion,brandt and carter agreed that the kilpatrick case warranted an inconclusive finding.on may,they notified kilpatrick by mail of this case status determination and his placement on the register,as well as his right to request expungement from the register.
kilpatrick immediately exercised that right.in a written expungement request,kilpatrick reminded the agency that he had been acquitted of the criminal charges relating to allegations and stated that he considered his placement on the register to be a retaliatory act that he would include in his lawsuit.shortly after requesting expungement,kilpatrick amended his complaint to include a claim that hhs employees placed his name on the register in retaliation for his complaints about king,his critical comments about king and hhs to news reporters,and the act of filing his lawsuit against several hhs employees 
steven wilson,an hhs protection and safety program specialist,received the expungement request.wilson reviewed materials in the hhs case file on kilpatrick,including police reports,the hhs investigative report,king initial assessment of the allegations,materials relating to the internal investigation of king conduct,and photos showing injuries.wilson did not review the transcript of kilpatrick criminal trial.upon noting that kilpatrick had filed a lawsuit against hhs employees,wilson discussed the matter with robert wheeler,a special assistant attorney general for nebraska and counsel for hhs.wheeler,who had represented king in a deposition relating to kilpatrick criminal trial,discussed the decision with wilson and recommended denying expungement.wilson acted upon wheeler recommendation and denied kilpatrick expungement request in a letter dated july.the letter stated that n o reason was found to expunge,and it informed kilpatrick of his right to appeal the expungement denial within the agency.
kilpatrick appealed the decision to an hhs hearing officer.as the hearing date approached,wilson sent an email to hhs deputy administrator chris hanus that described the facts of the case and concluded in reviewing the file,this appears to me to be one of the better cases for an entry of inconclusive.of course,my experience is that inconclusive determinations are difficult to defend at a hearing,but his is one that deserves our efforts.kilpatrick filed a motion asking the hhs hearing officer to summarily expunge his name from the register.hhs resisted this motion in a reply brief submitted by wheeler.one section of the reply brief reads as follows 
the appellants allege in paragraph of their motion that the department has listed them on the register in retaliation for their actions against the department.that issue is pending before the federal district court.the hearing officer has no authority to consider that issue except as it may relate to the ultimate issue in this contested case of whether the entries are maintained appropriately and consistent with the law.to that extent,the department responds.
as the appellants attorney acknowledges in her motion,they early took their complaints to the news media.there they began a public attack on the worker and the department,and they have maintained their attacks in the media and in several other forums.they attacked the work and integrity of the protection and safety worker assigned to the case,and they demanded that the department undertake an internal investigation of the worker.they demanded the department considered attention and investigation of the matter.they have received it.and the result is this listing.the department submits that the facts demand and support the listing.
hhs eventually expunged kilpatrick name from the register,although it did not reach this decision until april.
litigation following kilpatrick addition of the retaliation claim 
the defendants moved to dismiss each of kilpatrick claims as presented in his second amended complaint,and the district court ruled on this motion on march.it dismissed the bulk of kilpatrick claims,but allowed two claims to survive kilpatrick claim of retaliation by hhs employees for the exercise of his constitutional rights,and his claim that they violated procedural due process with regard to kilpatrick family liberty rights.kilpatrick then filed a third amended complaint containing those remaining claims and adding wilson and brandt as defendants.
discovery battles continued,resulting in more motions to compel discovery and multiple monetary sanctions against the defendants.the last of these motions came in november,shortly after the defendants had moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.kilpatrick moved for and was granted an extension of time to respond to the motion for summary judgment,and he thereafter deposed wilson regarding the decision to deny expungement.during the deposition,counsel for kilpatrick asked wilson whether he and wheeler discussed kilpatrick acquittal of criminal charges.counsel for wilson objected,arguing that wilson communications with wheeler were protected by privilege.counsel for kilpatrick then asked wilson several questions relating to the expungement decision,each time inviting wilson to assert privilege.wilson accepted these invitations not to answer.some of the questions prompting wilson assertion of the privilege appear below 
i would like to know what all of the evidence was that supported your decision that a preponderance of the evidence showed in your opinion abuse.are you going to give me that information,or are you going to assert privilege 
assert privilege.
are you going to tell me specifically how you believe that kilpatrick posed a future risk to vulnerable children,or are you going to assert privilege 
assert privilege.
even if you truly believe in your heart that kilpatrick and ronda did percent of what they were accused of having done,why not exercise the discretion to expunge them knowing that kilpatrick and are unlikely to ever come into contact again or are you going to claim privilege for that as well 
i will claim the privilege for that as well.
then we go to the next sentence of wilson email to hanus w hy does this case deserve our efforts or are you going to use the privilege on that one too 
in his motion to compel discovery,kilpatrick argued only that wilson should have answered the questions because the privilege does not extend to communications sought for the purpose of effectuating a crime or fraud.the district court found the exception inapplicable and denied kilpatrick motion to compel wilson testimony on these matters on february,
the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on august.as to kilpatrick procedural due process claim,the district court determined that king lacked direct involvement in the temporary removal of from the care of ronda and kilpatrick and that there was no evidence that a reasonable official in her position would have known that her conduct could have violated the alleged right to family integrity.as to the retaliation claim,the district court found that carter,brandt,and wilson were the only defendants with personal involvement in the decisions to place and keep kilpatrick on the register.according to the district court,kilpatrick had not presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that retaliatory motives informed the relevant decisions of those defendants.therefore,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.
kilpatrick now appeals the denial of his motion to compel wilson testimony and the grant of summary judgment against him on his retaliation claim.we address these issues below.
