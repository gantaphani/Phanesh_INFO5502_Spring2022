introduction 
in this child support modification case,the mother,a successful insurance agent,tried to upwardly modify a child support order against her,a recently unemployed stockbroker who had just lost his license and started an unrelated business,without first obtaining his most current tax returns.rather,she merely presented lifestyle evidence based on a series of photos showing her at the home of his girlfriend and in or by a series of cars.based on this evidence,the trial judge found that the had a nontaxable income of figure which appears to have been plucked from thin air.the income and expense declaration,otherwise noncontroverted at the hearing,showed at most a gross income of over the previous twelve months,and that before taxes.we reverse the ensuing child support order.evidence of lifestyle,particularly a lifestyle subsidized by a new nonmarital partner see,is not a cheap substitute for proper discovery of income reported on tax returns.
pamela and victor loh were divorced in july.pamela was an insurance agent and victor was an investment advisor.the stipulated judgment provided that victor would pay pamela a month for each of their three children.the judgment was based on victor earning each month after business expenses and before taxes and on pamela earning per month before taxes.
a little more than a year later,in october,pamela filed an order to show cause proceeding osc for an upward modification of the child support payments to the guideline level she had just had a very bad month in her work as an insurance agent,and had been assessed a number of charge backs from previous commissions.the net result was that she had a negative income of that month.longer term,however,things were somewhat better,and she was still averaging about a month gross income for the previous twelve months.
victor was not served with the osc until sometime after june.by then,pamela net disposable income had increased to about a month,and she had averaged about gross per month for the previous twelve months.the matter was then continued by mutual agreement a number of times over the next year by july victor stipulated to produce a number of documents,including title to all vehicles he owned,his bank records from to the present,and his state and federal tax returns for.
victor did not produce the documents,pamela did not bring any discovery motions,and the osc went to hearing in october.pamela most recently filed income and expense declaration showed net monthly disposable income of about she was grossing an average of over the previous twelve months.victor filed his income and expense declaration the day of the hearing.his i e showed net disposable income of about,current net disposable income of about,and total gross salary or wages of some over the previous twelve months,which averaged out to a monthly gross of less than.
there were a total of five exhibits a packet of photos showing victor with different cars,including a suburban he would later testify was his girlfriend,and a bmw a packet of photos showing where victor lived an house in south orange county owned by his girlfriend tax returns for and showing income of and respectively and a printout obtained over the internet from the national association of securities dealers indicating he was currently working at a firm known as western securities.
the only witness was victor himself.victor testified he owned a bmw,worth about and a race car described as a buggy kit car volkswagen base car.he had been living with his girlfriend for four years.her cousin owned a boat,victor believed that she made or a month when they had previously worked together at a savings and loan,and the document from the securities dealers association was inaccurate the securities exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers had closed victor old firm down two months previously,and victor ended up on the list from western securities when he applied for employment there.because victor could transfer his license from one firm to another,he was unable to find employment as an investment advisor and had started a new business selling race car parts,which allowed him to make to a month net.
in closing argument,pamela trial attorney argued that it was inconceivable that one could duplicate victor lifestyle for a sum less than per annum.her attorney also explicitly argued apparently unaware of in re marriage of wood th,d,about which more anon that victor significant other or should be looked at as well.
the trial judge disregarded the and income tax returns because the osc was to modify a order,did not find that victor had an income of,but that,considering the standard of living,as per the evidence,he had a monthly income of.the court determined that pamela net disposable income was.plugging victor nontaxable and pamela into the dissomaster plus an percent custodial time division yielded a child support order of.from that order victor has timely appealed.
iii.discussion 
a.the order can not be sustained as a discovery sanction 
before we can address victor main the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding concerning his must address the predominant subtext of the case,that this order is,deep down,really only a discovery sanction directed at victor for not turning over the documents called for in the july stipulation.adherents of the realistic school of jurisprudence are likely to surmise that the income figure was the functional equivalent of an issue sanction on the question of victor income.
the salient fact is,however,that pamela never made any motions to compel the production of those documents.as far as the record discloses,the sum total of her discovery efforts was to obtain the july stipulation.
victor may have been,as litigators sometimes say,dirty concerning the requested documents.no doubt,had pamela brought a motion to compel,it would have been granted,and victor hit with sanctions for his recalcitrance.nothing we say in this opinion is meant to countenance victor failure to honor the stipulation.even so,the legal fundamentals must be observed.
the family code has an entire article whose purpose it is to facilitate the inexpensive discovery of facts before the commencement of a child support modification proceeding.see.once a year one parent may,without leave of court,serve a request on the other parent for the production of a completed current income and expense declaration,which includes attachment of income tax forms,subds.a b,subd.a.the underlying idea is obviously to expedite the basic information necessary to the calculation of statewide uniform guideline amounts for purposes of modification orders.in re marriage of hall th,d child support statutes permit no alternative to actually calculating the guideline amount.
in enacting this expedited discovery scheme,however,the legislature did not obviate the traditional requirements of civil practice that discovery requests must be enforced.in fact,section specifically makes the usual practices of civil discovery applicable to the enforcement of expedited family law discovery moreover,if a party submits an income and expense declaration that is incomplete,inaccurate,or even missing the prior year federal and state personal income tax returns,the party may be ordered to pay all costs of the subsequent motion as sanctions.
pamela thus had the tools to readily obtain all the necessary information,including his income tax returns,from victor.she could have brought a motion to compel documents see code civ,and,if victor remained obstinate,obtained any number of sanction orders,including an issue sanction,an evidence sanction,or a monetary sanction.code civ,subd.n.
had pamela formally obtained an issue sanction order regarding victor income,today result might be different.however,in the face of the legislature having provided a clear method of relief for victor failure to turn over current income tax returns,and pamela not having availed herself of it,we can not justify the order before us as a de facto discovery sanction.
of course,by the same token,on remand our opinion is obviously without prejudice to pamela bringing whatever future motions to compel are necessary to obtain victor tax returns.our opinion is also without prejudice to pamela as to any attorney fee requests that she may bring because victor failure to turn over his tax returns has dramatically increased the cost of her modification proceeding,including this appeal.
b.this is neither a capacity nor an asset case 
two minor subtexts must be briefly addressed as well.first,this is not an earning capacity case and the order can not be justified on that basis either,subd.b,in re marriage of hinman th,d.there was no evidence that victor had quit his job,rather than having been laid off,that he could have found more remunerative employment in his old profession as a stockbroker,or even that he could have made any more money in his current occupation selling race car parts.
nor is this an asset case.that is,pamela has not argued victor income is artificially low,but he owns assets that should be used for support,county of kern castle th,d million dollar inheritance including lump sum,while not income,still had to be considered in setting support level.she presented no evidence,for example,that victor girlfriend is holding assets in trust for him,or that he has any interest at all in items of property that ostensibly belong to her.under the facts as they are before us in this record,she could kick him out tomorrow.we need only note that,given the elementary distinction between assets and income any attempt to proceed to make a child support order based on assets still requires,under section,the calculation of the guideline amount using the respective parents which the support level could then be adjusted upward to reflect the assets.see,subd.b court can vary guideline when application of formula would be unjust.
income tax returns are presumptively correct as to a parent income in a child support proceeding 
a parent gross income,as stated under penalty of perjury on recent tax returns,should be presumptively correct.see in re marriage of scheppers th,d although federal law is not conclusive on the interpretation of section,it is persuasive.returns are,after all,ultimately enforced by federal and state criminal penalties.hence it is not surprising that tax returns are the core component of determinations under the guideline formula.
to calculate the guideline,the court must ascertain the variable tn,which means the total net monthly disposable income of both parties,subd.b e.the definition of net disposable income in section,subdivision b directs the reader to section.section,in turn,defines annual net disposable income by deducting from gross income certain amounts.and section defines gross income with language that was lifted straight from the definition of income in section of the internal revenue code.in re marriage of schulze th,d.
the statutory tie to actual tax returns is underscored by the requirement in section that state and federal income tax liability for purposes of computing a parent net income must bear an accurate relationship to the tax status of the parties.section further specifies that the income of the parent must be based on state and federal income taxes actually payable not necessarily current withholding.
in more common sense terms,the use of income as stated on a tax return accords with the legislature goal of uniformity and expedition.section refers,after all,to a statewide uniform guideline,and determining income by using tax returns has the advantage of not only being relatively easy,but,as we have just said,enforced by federal and state civil and criminal penalties.it also spares chronically overcrowded family courts the burden of determining income on an ad hoc basis,with the risk of inconsistent results.
there is only one statutory exception to the tax model of income that one finds in section.subdivision b specifically allows a court to use earning capacity in lieu of the parent income.
accordingly,much of the jurisprudence governing determination of income has followed,or been consistent with,basic income tax law principles.that is,if one knew the tax law,one could predict whether a given item would,or would not,be included in section income for purposes of the guideline calculation,in re marriage of cheriton,supra,th,d proceeds from sale of stock acquired by stock options should have been included as income in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th,d life insurance proceeds received upon death of eldest child not income because,among other reasons,such proceeds are not income under internal revenue code and are not derived from labor,business or property county of kern castle,supra,th,d inheritance was not income,though income it could generate if invested could be considered income in re marriage of rocha th,d proceeds from a student loan not income because of expectation of repayment in re marriage of schulze,supra,th at,d car and rent subsidy were income because they were employer provided.in fact,as the scheppers court has noted,even cases holding that lottery and gambling winnings are income for child support purposes are consistent with income tax law such winnings are,after all,essentially a return on the investment of capital.see scheppers,supra,th at,d.
cases involving significant nontaxable benefits should be dealt with under section,which governs special circumstances,not as section income 
two cases,however,have departed altogether from an income tax model of section income with regard to certain free housing benefits.see stewart gomez th,d holding that free housing afforded disabled carpenter on indian reservation was income county of kern castle,supra,th at,d following stewart to hold that obligor parent housing could be considered income.the theory,first articulated in the stewart case and simply followed in castle,was that the obligor parent was the recipient of a benefit that otherwise reduced his living expenses.
to the degree that these cases stand for a blanket anything that reduces living expenses approach to section income,we respectfully decline to follow them.in the first place,such an approach creates serious anomalies when one realizes that the most common instances of things that reduce living expense are new mate or nonmarital partner income,items which the legislature has specifically forbidden,in section,to be taken into account in determining or modifying child support.see generally in re marriage of wood,supra,th,d.
indeed,the facts of the stewart and wood cases juxtapose rather uneasily against each other to illustrate the sort of anomaly that the stewart approach creates.in stewart,a disabled carpenter who had his children percent of the time and was trying to rehabilitate himself in a vocational rehabilitation program was living,rent free,on an indian reservation.yet the reasonable monthly value of his indian reservation housing benefit was included as section income based on an theory.effectively,that meant that the support order was based on money that the disabled carpenter did not have.
in wood,by contrast,an unemployed woman was living very well,thanks to the talents of her new husband,a successful business artist.yet because of the strictures of section,precluding consideration of new mate or nonmarital partner income in determining or modifying support,the trial court erred by,in substance,taking that income into consideration under the guise of lifestyle.see wood,supra,th at,d.
indeed,when castle is read side by side with wood,the anomalies created by the stewart approach to income become even more painful.in castle,a large inheritance from the obligor parent mother allowed him to pay off his mortgage.the castle court,expressly following stewart,said it was permissible for the trial court to consider as income the housing the obligor parent was now living in.castle,supra,th at,d.thus,if the stewart approach is followed,we are left with this rule if you move in with your new spouse or nonmarital partner in a home that reflects the new spouse or partner income,the court can not consider the value of the housing to be imputed income but if your parents let you move in with them,it can.
in the second place,stewart theory of income contraven
