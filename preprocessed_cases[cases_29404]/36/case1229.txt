sheryl appeals from an order dismissing her petitions to free michael from his birth mother tammy parental custody and control on the ground of abandonment,et all statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted and to independently adopt him.we conclude sheryl failed to demonstrate standing to adopt under section and therefore the family court did not err in dismissing her adoption petition.we also reject her claim she raised a prima facie case of parental abandonment under section.finally,we disagree with sheryl claim the family court lacked jurisdiction to alter the probate court child custody order accordingly,we affirm the order dismissing sheryl petitions.
factual and procedural background 
a single mother with two other children,tammy gave birth to michael on november.she was unmarried and did not cohabit with the man she identified as the biological father,loren tammy relinquished her son to a licensed adoption agency,nightlight christian adoptions nca.the agency placed michael with prospective adoptive parents sheryl and roger following the birth.in a document entitled,relinquishment,tammy named the as the intended adoptive parents.
on november,nca petitioned to determine the extent of loren parental rights and whether his consent for the adoption was required.no adoption without judicial determination that nonrelinquishing parent rights have been terminated or that consent is not required.loren timely petitioned in the probate court to establish a parental relationship nca filed an amended petition in december the petitioned to adopt michael in january,and nca joined in the petition.in february,the probate court joined the as necessary parties in loren action,and the family court consolidated the three proceedings and ordered genetic testing to determine whether loren was michael biological father.after one postponement,the court scheduled a hearing for may.
in early may,the,nca,and loren entered into a postadoption contact agreement.see.loren agreed to give up his parental rights,and the promised to inform michael when he was older that loren was his biological father and to permit four visits per year,among other provisions.the court signed the agreement,dismissed nca and loren petitions,and ordered that the adoption proceed without loren consent 
in late august,sheryl petitioned to dissolve her marriage.on september,nca notified tammy of the pending divorce and that the couple could not meet tammy desire for a adoption of michael.tammy immediately notified nca she intended to rescind her relinquishment,and submitted a formal written request to rescind on september.
on october,sheryl petitioned the probate court for appointment as michael temporary guardian on the grounds that tammy may rescind the relinquishment,but there is no information that she has and therefore a guardianship was necessary to maintain the status quo until the relinquishment issue is resolved.the following day,over tammy objection,the court granted temporary letters of guardianship,expiring november,and ordered weekly supervised visits for tammy at nca offices.the court set a rehearing for november,and ordered a guardianship investigation under probate code section 
on november,nca consented to tammy rescission of the relinquishment.in reaching this conclusion,nca referred to the recent change in circumstances,including tammy clearly stated intention to have michael raised in a household and no exposure to drug use the pending dissolution of the marriage,apparently prompted by the husband drug use tammy demonstrated parental skills,and her ability to now provide a home for michael because of her marriage seven months earlier to jeff because of the temporary guardianship,nca informed tammy it could not return physical custody of michael and advised her to retain counsel in the guardianship matter.
represented by counsel,tammy filed objections to sheryl guardianship petition in advance of the november rehearing.she claimed she selected the based on representations they could provide michael stability and financial security.she was also misled to believe the adoption would be open so that she and michael siblings could visit him regularly.she immediately rescinded her relinquishment when she learned sheryl husband had admitted to drug use,and no longer lived in the home.she formally object ed to the appointment of any guardian and demanded an immediate return of her child.
the court extended the temporary guardianship several times,apparently to conclude the previously ordered investigation.on january,tammy counsel filed a declaration noting the investigating social worker concluded that an appropriate disposition would be to return michael to his mother.counsel requested the court terminate the temporary guardianship.he attached an nca report concerning tammy visits with michael in november.the agency found tammy behavior very appropriate,michael appeared content during two of the visits,
but cried during the last one.because sheryl ignored requests to stay in a separate office during these visits,nca requested she leave the property during any future visits.
sheryl lawyer disputed nca account,claiming each visit had been cut short because of the child negative reaction to tammy and that the parties had agreed at a previous hearing the visits would cease.counsel submitted a letter from the family therapist that urged the court to reconsider tammy visitation with michael because there was no existing relationship and to have a child at this stage begin a new relationship with a mothering figure is to potentially disrupt the child psychological.the baby as a is frightened by strangers and perceives the birth mother as a stranger.michael pediatrician had a similar opinion and recommended visitation be withheld until a final decision on the adoption can be made.
in january,sheryl petitioned to terminate tammy parental rights under section on the grounds of abandonment.sheryl alleged tammy had not provided for michael support and had rarely visited michael since his birth,and asserted it would be in michael best interests to terminate tammy parental rights.
tammy filed a response to sheryl petition.her opposition included an allegation the had misrepresented their marital relationship and failed to disclose the husband background,which included information about his psychological problems,and incidents of domestic violence and arrests during a previous marriage.tammy asserted it would not be in michael best interests to be permanently separated from his mother and two siblings.
in march,probate court services prepared a report concerning the abandonment petition.it contained statements from sheryl,tammy,and nca adoptions social worker recapitulating most of the information related above.the report referred to ssa earlier report under probate code section noting ssa conclusion it would not intervene if the court placed michael with tammy.the report recommended the court conduct further proceedings to determine whether the petition should be granted.
on march,sheryl filed an amended adoption petition designating the adoption as independent,and deleting her earlier references to an agency adoption through nca.the family court consolidated the guardianship and adoption cases,directed sheryl lawyer to notify loren of the pending adoption petition,and continued the matter to april.
on april,sheryl filed a petition to determine loren parental rights,the family court appointed counsel for michael,extended the temporary guardianship letters to may,and continued the matter to that date.the court declined to increase visitation beyond the weekly visits in place.
on may,tammy moved to dismiss sheryl adoption petition,and requested expanded custodial time and joint legal and physical custody during a reunification period.tammy also asserted sheryl had no standing to file for an independent adoption under section.
on may,sheryl responded to tammy motion.sheryl asserted she had standing because loren would be executing a parent placement agreement.she argued the family court had no jurisdiction to order reunification or to alter the probate court custody order.she also noted the court had denied a request for increased visitation at the april hearing and therefore the court should not consider the new request.
on may,the court granted tammy motion to dismiss the adoption petition for lack of standing,concluding tammy had a right to her child after she rescinded the relinquishment.the court observed the probate court in the guardianship case erred in establishing the temporary guardianship for other than transitional purposes.to ease michael adjustment,the court adopted an schedule proposed by michael lawyer that gradually increased time with tammy.beginning june,tammy would care for michael eight hours a day during the week and overnight on saturdays.the court ordered the guardianship matter returned to the probate department and set a review hearing for june.
on june,sheryl filed an appeal from the may order dismissing her petition to terminate tammy parental rights and her petition to adopt the minor,and all prior orders.on june,this court denied sheryl petition for writ of supersedeas and request for immediate stay.this appeal followed.
discussiona.adoption procedure 
before turning to sheryl claims on appeal,we briefly examine the procedure for adoptions.the law of adoptions is exclusively statutory.adoption of mcdonald cal d.the legislature has established three methods for adopting an unmarried minor an agency adoption et an independent adoption et and a stepparent adoption.
in an agency adoption,the existing parents of the child the birth parents,see relinquish their parental rights to the child to a licensed adoption agency acting as an agent of the state.see scott family ministries d.a relinquishment of parental rights terminates the birth parents parental rights and responsibilities and gives exclusive custody and control of the child to the agency pending adoption of the child,subds.e j.the agency is responsible for the care of the child and entitled to exclusive custody and control until the court issues an adoption order.the agency may exercise its discretion and terminate any placement for temporary care or adoption at any time before the court issues an adoption order,and the child must be returned promptly to the physical custody of the agency,subd.a.
typically,the agency conducts a home study and places the child with the prospective adoptive parents for a test period before consenting to the adoption,subds.a b see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.supp.only the prospective adoptive parents with whom the child has been placed for adoption may file a petition to adopt,subd.b.after the adoption petition has been filed,the agency may remove the child from the prospective adoptive parents only with the court approval,upon the agency motion after notice to the prospective adoptive parents,supported by an affidavit stating the grounds on which removal is sought.ibid.if the department or licensed adoption agency refuses to consent to the child adoption by the person or persons with whom the agency placed the child for adoption,the court may nevertheless order the adoption if it finds that the refusal to consent is not in the child best interest.ibid.upon court approval of an agency adoption,the adoptive parents attain all the rights and duties as parents of the child and the birth parents are relieved of all their parental rights and duties.
an independent adoption differs from an agency adoption in that the birth parents agree to relinquish their parental rights directly to the adoptive parents.see also.the birth parents select the prospective adoptive parents and must consent to the adoption by signing an adoption placement agreement their consent becomes irrevocable after a specified period,subds.b,c.upon court approval of the independent adoption,the adoptive parents attain all parental rights and duties to the child and the birth parents are relieved of all parental responsibilities.
section governs relinquishments to licensed adoption agencies.it provides that in a written statement either birth parent may relinquish a child to a licensed adoption agency for adoption.subdivision e provides the relinquishment is final business days after it is filed with the state department of social services.see adoption of baby boy th,d relinquishment form substantially complied with statutory and regulatory requirements.the birth parent relinquishment of a child allows the adoption to proceed without further consent of that birth parent.a relinquishment that has been filed may be rescinded only with the mutual consent of the licensed adoption agency and the birth parent or parents relinquishing the child,subd.e tyler children home society th,d.
section,subdivision f,further provides that the relinquishing parent may designate in the relinquishment the person or persons with whom the licensed adoption agency must place the child for adoption.subdivision g provides that if the child is not placed in the home of the named person or persons,the agency must notify the birth parent signing the relinquishment within hours of the agency decision.per subdivision h,the relinquishing parent has days to rescind the relinquishment,measured from the date the agency mailed notice of its decision.if the relinquishing parent requests rescission during the period,the licensed adoption agency must rescind the relinquishment.
by regulation,the agency must arrange the return of the child if the agency agrees to rescind the relinquishment.return of the child to the parent is required no later than seven working days from the time the decision to rescind is made,tit.here,nca agreed to rescind the relinquishment on november.the rescission restored tammy parental rights as of that date and,normally,she would have obtained custody of michael within the week.but just days before nca transferred custody,sheryl obtained a temporary guardianship,later petitioned to terminate tammy parental rights and attempted to proceed with an independent adoption.we now consider whether the trial court erred in rejecting sheryl claims.
sheryl independent adoption petition 
persons not designated under section lack standing to adopt 
sheryl contends the family court conclusion she lacked standing contravened the statutory scheme for independent adoptions.section,the independent adoption provision,specifically lists persons eligible to file an adoption petition.in relevant part,section provides,a any of the following persons who desire to adopt a child may,for that purpose,file a petition c a person with whom a child has been placed for adoption.d i a legal guardian who has been the child legal guardian for more than one year.ii if the court has found the child to have been abandoned pursuant to section,a legal guardian who has been the child legal guardian for more than six months.the legal guardian may file a petition pursuant to section in the same court and concurrently with a petition under this section.italics added.sheryl argues this list is not exclusive because the statute does not state only those enumerated persons may file an adoption provision it uses the word any.consequently,sheryl concludes the legislature did not intend to limit adoptions to those persons listed in section.we are not persuaded.
when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain the legislative intent so we may effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.our first step is to consider the statutory language,being careful to give the statute words their plain,commonsense meaning.citation.if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.if the statutory language is unclear,we may consider the history and background of the measure to discern the legislature intent.people birkett cal th,d.we construe the statute with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citations.in re michael cal d.
the plain language of section supports the family court interpretation that persons not designated by the statute lack standing to adopt.a commonsense reading of section reveals the legislature expressly granted a certain class of persons standing to adopt.it is difficult to imagine the legislature intended the statute to give the same rights to undesignated persons that it gave to those expressly named.such an interpretation would make section specific grant of standing to designated persons redundant.songstad superior court th,d statute permitting proponents of an initiative to seek prequalification judicial review shows legislative intent to deny standing to those not designated.adopting defendant interpretation is at odds with the detailed and specific adoption procedures the legislature designed to resolve parental determinations.if the legislature intended to grant standing to additional persons,we think it would have done so explicitly.
sheryl asserts the trial court interpretation failed to harmonize section with section.this section authorizes any interested person to seek a court declaration freeing a minor child from parental control when the parent intends to abandon the child and the child has been left in the care and custody of another for a period of six months without any communication or provision for the child support.an interested person is one who has a direct,and not merely consequential,interest in the action.in other words,one who has a real interest in the ultimate adjudication.in re eugene d.
sheryl argues that under section any person who had the care and custody of a child for six months should receive standing to file an adoption petition indeed the list in section does not include those persons who traditionally would be persons seeking to adopt a child after that child had been abandoned,a person with whom a child has been left without provision for the child identification,subd.a.she notes the abandonment statute contemplates cases where the child has been voluntarily surrendered or left in the care and custody of another without agreement or provision for support,which presupposes no guardianship or other formal custody agreement.she asserts under the family court interpretation,a person who has provided care for a child nevertheless would lack standing to adopt unless that person had obtained a guardianship order if the universe of petitioners who may file an adoption petition is restricted to those persons specifically mentioned in,then this would lead to a situation in which a caretaker could file a section abandonment petition,obtain termination of parental rights,but then go no further,not adopt the child.this is an absurd result we do not agree.
there is nothing absurd in requiring the caretaker in sheryl hypothetical to proceed with an adoption only after obtaining a guardianship.when a nonrelative seeks a guardianship,the investigation must be made by the county agency designated to investigate potential dependency.the investigative report must include a discussion of the guardian social history and relationship to the minor,the minor social history and an assessment of psychological and educational needs,and the minor relationship to the guardian,subd.a.if the guardianship petition states that an adoption petition has been filed,the agency investigating the adoption must file a report with the court on the proposed guardian suitability,subd.a.these procedures are consistent with the legislature ordered and detailed adoption procedures and is one manifestly designed to protect the children to be adopted.
at oral argument,sheryl claimed,albeit equivocally,that in the initial adoption statute the word only preceded a list of persons eligible to adopt,but the legislature subsequently deleted the word only,and replaced it with the word any.sheryl argues this demonstrates an intent to relax limitations on who may adopt.she provides no support for this claim,and our research discloses no prior version of the statute containing the word only preceding a list of qualified petitioners.contrary to sheryl assertion,the history of section and its predecessor reflects a trend toward limiting those who may petition for adoption.see former,subd.a stats,ch,eff.july,any person desiring to adopt a child may for that purpose petition the superior court of the county in which the petitioner resides former stats,ch,eff,same former,subd.a stats,ch,eff,a grand parent,aunt,uncle,sibling,legal guardian who has been the child legal guardian for more than three years,person named in the will of a deceased parent as an intended adoptive parent where the child has no other parent,or person with whom a child has been placed for adoption,who desires to adopt a child may,for that purpose,file a petition in the county in which the petitioner resides former,subd.a stats,ch,eff,any of the following persons who desire to adopt a child may,for that purpose file a petition in the county in which the petitioner resides a a grandparent,aunt,uncle,first cousin,or sibling.b a person named in the will of a deceased parent as an intended adoptive parent where the child has no other parent.c a person with whom a child has been placed for adoption.d a legal guardian who has been the child legal guardian for more than one year.however,if the parent nominated the guardian for a purpose other than adoption for a specified time period,or if the guardianship was established pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code,the guardian ship shall have been in existence for not less than three years.subsequent revisions have altered the categories slightly but have not deviated from setting forth specific categories of persons who may file a petition for adoption.nor has the word only been added to or removed from the statute.see stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.thus,to prevail on appeal,sheryl must show her adoption petition fit within the explicit requirements of section.
sheryl failed to satisfy section express requirements for standing 
sheryl contends she qualified as a person with whom the child had been placed for an independent adoption under subdivision a c of section.but tammy did not place her son with sheryl.tammy initially relinquished the child to nca and later rescinded it when she learned of sheryl pending divorce.nca accepted tammy rescission of her relinquishment and sheryl does not contest the validity of her rescission.simply put,tammy did not sign an adoption placement agreement.the child is not deemed to be placed for adoption with the prospective adoptive parents until the adoption placement agreement has been signed and witnessed,subd.b.
sheryl asserts loren,michael biological father,subsequently signed a placement agreement consenting to sheryl adoption of the child and therefore she qualifies as a person with whom the child has been placed for adoption.true,sheryl submitted as an exhibit on her writ petition a purported placement agreement loren allegedly signed on may.but this document bears no file stamp,and there is nothing in the record to demonstrate sheryl presented this document to the court or that the parties informed the court the agreement had been signed before the matter was decided.consequently,sheryl forfeited this claim.
we also reject sheryl argument the guardianship provision of subpart d applied to confer standing.because sheryl had been temporary guardian for less than one year october to may,she did not qualify under subpart d i as a person who has been the child legal guardian for more than one year.nor did sheryl qualify under d ii because the court made no judicial finding of abandonment under section.and,as we explain below,the court dismissal of the abandonment petition was proper on this record.consequently,the trial court did not err in rejecting sheryl adoption petition because she failed to satisfy any of section explicit requirements for standing.
finally,sheryl argues the family court ruling is at odds with county of los angeles superior court d.the facts in county of los angeles also concerned an agency adoption and a divorce by the prospective adoptive parents,but present one overriding distinguishing feature.there,the birth mother did not participate in the case because the agency in tha
