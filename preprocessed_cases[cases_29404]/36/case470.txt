cyndie de silva appeals the judgment of the district court denying her hague convention petition for return of her son,jonathan,to her custody in canada and allowing him,instead,to remain with his father in oklahoma pending a custody determination.after review ing the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions regarding principles of domestic,foreign,and international law de novo,shealy shealy,cir,we affirm.
background 
the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention or convention,wl,is implemented in the united states by the international child abduction remedies act icara.the hague convention was adopted to protect children from the adverse effects of being wrongfully removed to or retained in a foreign country and to establish procedures for their return.see ohlander larson,cir.the convention is meant to provide for a child prompt return once it has been established the child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in any affiliated state.id.quoting convention,
the removal or retention of a child is wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention,where such rights were actually exercised by the parent seeking return of the child.the petitioner bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal or retention was wrongful.more specifically,the petitioner must show that the child was habitually resident in a given state at the time of the removal or retention the removal or retention was in breach of petitioner custody rights under the laws of that state and petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of removal or retention.
shealy,at quotation and citations omitted.we are concerned under the hague convention only with the merits of the retention claim,whether pitts retention of jonathan in oklahoma is wrongful.see id.at.the question of which parent would be the better custodian for jonathan is not before us.id.
de silva and pitts,who were never married,are the natural parents of paul jonathan de silva pitts,who was born in ardmore,oklahoma,on february.de silva,who was in the united states on a student visa,registered jonathan as a citizen of her native sri lanka within the first few months of his life.
shortly after jonathan first birthday in february,de silva was notified by the immigration and naturalization service that her visa had expired and that she was required to leave the united states by march.de silva did not comply with this deadline.in may,pitts secured an order from the district court for carter county,oklahoma,enjoining either parent from removing jonathan from that court jurisdiction ne exeat order.on july,and despite the carter county ne exeat order of which she had notice,de silva took jonathan with her to sri lanka without pitts consent.approximately one month later,the carter county court awarded full custody of jonathan to pitts and,later that summer,held de silva in contempt of the ne exeat order.
pitts eventually reunited with his son on a visit to sri lanka,a country which is not a signatory to the hague convention and could not provide pitts an opportunity under the convention to argue in the courts of that country that de silva had wrongfully removed jonathan from oklahoma.see united states amer,cir.on one of his visits to sri lanka,pitts was served with papers relative to a second custody proceeding in sri lanka filed by de silva.after being advised that the sri lankan courts would never enforce the oklahoma custody order and that de silva would almost surely be awarded custody,pitts decided to agree to her custody demands,reasoning that,if he did not,she would likely flee again with the child.in,de silva obtained an order from a sri lankan court awarding her custody of jonathan.
in january,after living with her son for almost nine years in sri lanka,de silva fled to canada where she was accepted as a refugee.jonathan joined her in canada a few weeks later.the parents had kept in contact over the years,and pitts knew that his son had relocated to canada.pitts visited jonathan in canada on a couple of occasions,and jonathan traveled from canada to visit his father in oklahoma at least once before the summer of.in,jonathan had a ticket for a summer visit to oklahoma that provided for his return in august to canada,where he was scheduled to attend an camp.instead of returning to his mother in canada,however,jonathan expressed his desire to stay with his father in oklahoma.jonathan has remained in oklahoma ever since with pitts and his wife,sabrina pitts.
de silva quickly objected to jonathan relocation to oklahoma and petitioned a canadian court to enforce the sri lankan custody order.she neither informed pitts of this action,nor disclosed to the canadian court the fact of the custody order from oklahoma.
in response to de silva petition,the canadian court entered an ex parte order making a preliminary finding that de silva was entitled to custody of jonathan,ordering the return of the child to her,and setting the custody matter for further hearing after pitts received notice.after the canadian order was served on pitts,he filed a response in the canadian court which eventually stayed its earlier ex parte order.counsel has advised us the canadian matter remains abated.
while the canadian action was pending,de silva filed a petition for return of child in the federal district court for the eastern district of oklahoma pursuant to of icara seeking the return of jonathan to her in canada so that the canadian courts can determine the matter of custody pitts filed an objection to the petition,informing the district court for the first time of the oklahoma order granting him custody of jonathan.
the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge who conducted a hearing at which both parties were present and represented by counsel.with consent of counsel,the magistrate judge also carefully and considerately conducted an interview in chambers with jonathan.afterward,she concluded that he was sufficiently mature to justify taking his wishes into account in this matter.after the parties reviewed the hearing transcripts and submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,the magistrate judge determined that jonathan had been wrongfully abducted from oklahoma when his mother took him to sri lanka in at a time when oklahoma was his habitual residence,and that jonathan wished to remain in oklahoma with his father.the district court adopted the findings and recommendation of the magistrate judge to deny de silva icara petition,and she appeals.
on appeal,de silva,now appearing pro se,argues that the united states and specifically oklahoma was never jonathan habitual residence the oklahoma custody order is stale and thus unenforceable the temporary order of the canadian court should be accorded full faith and credit by the district court pitts has acquiesced in her full custody both in sri lanka and in canada and pitts failed to show that jonathan return to canada will harm jonathan de silva also weaves various arguments into her brief going to her belief that custody of jonathan should properly be with her.as mentioned above,however,o ur scope of inquiry under the hague convention is limited to the merits of the abduction claim.as such,the merits of the underlying dispute related to custody of jonathan are not before us.shealy,at quotation and citation omitted.
iii.analysis 
although we affirm the conclusion of the district court that jonathan should remain in oklahoma while the custody matter is determined,we do so via a different analytical path and relying on a different emphasis than the district court.
initially we note that it was incorrect for the district court to apply the principles of the hague convention to de silva removal of jonathan to sri lanka.the regulations implemented by the united states department of state to govern hague convention actions apply only when a child is taken to another country party to the convention.if a child is taken from a signatory country and is retained in a country,it appears that there is no remedy under either icara,or the hague convention.mezo elmergawi,see also united states amer,cir noting that the requirement that both the and the retaining countries are signatories to the convention is also implicit in its very operation.because the convention functions solely through the designated central authorities in the respective states,and because only contracting parties will have designated such authorities,the convention can operate only between two signatory states.thus,because sri lanka is not a signatory country,pitts had no rights under the convention to get a judicial determination that de silva removal of jonathan to sri lanka was wrongful.see mohsen mohsen.
the district court also placed too much reliance upon the carter county court order awarding pitts full custody of jonathan.article of the hague convention provides 
the sole fact that a decision relating to custody has been given in or is entitled to recognition in the requested state here the united states shall not be ground for refusing to return a child under this convention,but the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested state may take account of the reasons for that decision in applying this convention.
the rationale for article is to prevent abductors from being able to rely upon a dead decision taken prior to the removal but never put into effect.shalit coppe,cir.further,the legal analysis provided by the state department when the convention was presented to the united states senate in for ratification states that the alleged wrongdoer may not rely upon a stale decree awarding him or her custody,the provisions of which have been derogated from subsequently by agreement or acquiescence of the parties,to prevent the child return under the convention.at,see also miller miller,cir noting that upon establishment of canada as the children habitual residence,the mere existence of the new york order granting permanent custody of the children to the father was not itself a defense for wrongful removal by the father to new york.
under other circumstances,we might remand a case like this to the district court for further development of the issue of habitual residence without the distraction of the carter county custody order clouding the analysis.if canada were held to be jonathan habitual residence,the carter county custody order,although first in time,would not have had priority.a custody determination from a child state of habitual residence takes priority over a similar decision from the requested state,here the united states and specifically oklahoma.miller,at.further,an inquiry into whether pitts had acquiesced in de silva custody of jonathan,at least upon their relocation to canada,might also have been appropriate on remand.despite these issues,we do not find it necessary to remand this case because jonathan wishes provide an important alternative basis which can appropriately inform and support the district court decision.
as an initial matter,de silva,as the petitioner,was required to establish that pitts retention of jonathan in oklahoma was wrongful.to do that,she had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that pitts retained jonathan away from jonathan habitual residence.she was also required to show she was exercising her parental custodial rights at the time of the wrongful retention or at least would have exercised those rights but for the wrongful retention under the laws of the country of jonathan habitual residence.friedrich friedrich,cir.
once a petitioner establishes that removal was wrongful,the child must be returned unless the respondent can establish a defense.friedrich friedrich,cir.there are four defenses set out in the convention,which are narrowly construed,rydder rydder,cir,and which are not relevant here.there is also a fifth consideration,left to the discretion of the judicial or administrative authority,which allows for refusal to order the return of a child where the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.hague convention,wl.
courts in signatory nations take violations of the convention very seriously.in fact,even if a defense is established,a court still has discretion to order the return of the child if it would further the aim of the convention which is to provide for the return of a wrongfully removed child friedrich,at see also danaipour mclarey,cir noting that even if the conditions for an article b exception are met,the hague convention gives the court discretion to return the child to the country of habitual residence miller,at.on the other hand,the very nature of these exceptions gives judges a does not impose on them a refuse to return a child in certain circumstances.report at,para.thus,even if de silva had established that pitts retention of jonathan was wrongful,and despite the usually strict construction accorded the convention,there remains room in the proper case for the exercise of judicial discretion.
one of the primary areas in which a court may appropriately decide not to return a child occurs when a child of sufficient age and maturity objects to being returned to the country of habitual residence.the convention provides in article the judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.emphasis added.
the report expands on this idea 
t he convention also provides that the child views concerning the essential question of its return or retention may be conclusive,provided it has,according to the competent authorities,attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient for its views to be taken into account.in this way,the convention gives children the possibility of interpreting their own interests.of course,this provision could prove dangerous if it were applied by means of the direct questioning of young people who may admittedly have a clear grasp of the situation but who may also suffer serious psychological harm if they think they are being forced to choose between two parents.however,such a provision is absolutely necessary given the fact that the convention applies,ratione personae,to all children under the age of sixteen the fact must be acknowledged that it would be very difficult to accept that a child of,for example,fifteen years of age,should be returned against its will.moreover,as regards this particular point,all efforts to agree on a minimum age at which the views of the child could be taken into account failed,since all the ages suggested seemed artificial,even arbitrary.it seemed best to leave the application of this clause to the discretion of the competent authorities.
pérez vera report at,para.emphasis added 
although courts have construed this exception narrowly,see england england,cir,a court may refuse repatriation solely on the basis of a considered objection to returning by a sufficiently mature child.blondin dubois,cir.a court must apply a stricter standard in considering a child wishes when those wishes are the sole reason underlying a repatriation decision and not part of some broader analysis.id.
in applying the age and maturity exception,a court must not focus solely on the general goal of the protect children from the harmful effects of wrongful must also carefully determine that the particular child has obtained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.blondin dubois,cir quoting convention,wl.the convention contains no age limit for applying the exception,blondin,at haro,d,and if a court determines that the youngster opinion is the product of undue influence,the child wishes are not taken into account,in re robinson.
given the and idiosyncratic nature of the inquiry,decisions applying the age and maturity exception are understandably disparate.compare anderson acree,d,considering views of an child who was com
