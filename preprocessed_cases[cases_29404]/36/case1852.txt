the grandmother of the minors,ivan and marifer maria,reported that maria had been sexually abused by jorge,the paramour of the mother,respondent,jaqueline m.the trial court ultimately adjudicated the minors neglected based on a finding that respondent had not tried to prevent contact between the minors and jorge,as directed by the department of children and family services dcfs.however,the court also found that the state failed to prove the underlying sexual abuse allegations.
respondent appeals the adjudication of neglect,arguing in various ways that the order must be reversed because the sexual abuse allegations were based entirely on maria statements,which were neither corroborated nor subjected to as required by section c of the juvenile court act of act ilcs c west.respondent alternatively argues that the state failed to prove that dcfs established a safety plan,that respondent understood it,or that she violated it.
the state does not dispute that it did not introduce evidence to corroborate maria alleged outcry.instead,the state resorts to procedural arguments.according to the state,the issue of the hearsay admissibility is moot because the trial court credited evidence that respondent failed to adhere to dcfs directive to prevent contact between jorge and the minors.we disagree.the state failed to show probable cause that maria had been sexually abused,and therefore the minors were adjudicated neglected based only on a finding that respondent did not follow a safety plan that never should have been implemented.we reverse the order adjudicating the minors neglected.
dcfs took the minors into temporary custody on september,after the mundelein police department submitted a hotline report that maria had been sexually abused by jorge,who was living with the family.at the time of the report,ivan was six and maria was four.
on september,the state filed two petitions for adjudication of wardship based on allegations that jorge touched or placed his finger in maria vagina.the petitions alleged that ivan and maria were neglected in that they had been exposed to an injurious environment ilcs b west.the petitions also alleged that the minors were abused in that they faced a substantial risk of physical injury ilcs ii west.the petition directed toward maria additionally alleged that she was an abused minor because she had already suffered physical injury ilcs i west and because respondent had allowed a sex crime to be committed against maria ilcs iii west.
at the hearing,robert musial,the dcfs caseworker assigned to the family,testified that on september,the mundelein police department reported that it suspected that maria had been sexually abused by jorge.according to musial,the minors grandmother brought maria to the police station that day and detective katie smith interviewed maria.referring to a police report,musial testified that maria told detective smith that jorge had touched her private parts with his hand,and inserted his fingers into her four times.maria called her vaginal area pochita and identified the area on a body chart.maria specified that one instance of abuse occurred in a bedroom while jorge was living with the family.maria reported that she saw something red in her underwear one time after she had been touched or penetrated.
musial further testified that robert schnabel,a child protective investigator who was on call at the time of the report,went to the grandmother home the next day,on september.maria was not there,so schnabel went to condell hospital,where ivan was being treated for an infection in a broken arm.ivan injury was unrelated to the neglect or abuse allegations.musial testified that schnabel notes indicate that he spoke with respondent at the hospital and told her that dcfs did not want the children to have contact with jorge during the pending report police investigation.respondent was told of the allegations,and she agreed to keep the children away from jorge while the allegations were investigated.the notes indicated that schnabel communicated with respondent via the hospital interpreter line,which operates as a conference call.respondent and schnabel each spoke into a telephone handset and a third party in another location translated english to spanish over the phone.
after musial was assigned the case,detective smith told him that she had informed respondent that the minors were not to have any contact with jorge,and respondent had agreed to the directive.musial testified that,on september,he was alerted to call condell hospital.musial spoke with a nurse who said that maria,jorge,and respondent were all at the hospital visiting ivan.over respondent objection,musial testified that the nurse said that jorge told them not to tell anybody he was there because he was in trouble with the police.the nurse reported that ivan was too sick to be released that evening,so respondent,jorge,and maria left.
the next day,on september,musial went to ivan hospital room,where he encountered respondent and maria.when musial learned that jorge was on another floor,he told respondent that we needed to make a plan because the minors were not to have contact with jorge.musial used the interpreter line to communicate with respondent,but respondent acted as though she was unaware of the allegations.when musial pressed the issue,respondent handed him her attorney business card and declined to speak until counsel was present.musial contacted respondent attorney and informed him of dcfs position that jorge should not be around the minors.
respondent left and spoke with jorge for about minutes,returned to ivan room,and agreed to resume the conversation about the safety plan.respondent explained that she and the minors were moving out of the grandmother home and into an apartment that jorge was renting for them.musial said the arrangement was unacceptable,and respondent replied,do what you are going to do.musial asked respondent to identify a family member with whom the minors could be placed,but respondent refused.
on,musial admitted that respondent believed that the grandmother had fabricated the allegations.at the time of the hearing,musial believed that jorge had not been charged with an offense,but the police investigation was ongoing.maria had passed a cursory medical check,but a more thorough sexual abuse exam was scheduled in two weeks.there was no allegation that respondent or jorge had hurt ivan.
without citing section c by name,respondent counsel asserted in closing argument that the state had not produced sufficient evidence because there was nothing to corroborate maria alleged outcry.unpersuaded,the trial court entered written findings that probable cause existed that the minors were neglected and abused.the court found that maria had reported that jorge,who was residing with the family,had been sexually abusing her in that he touched her vagina four times.respondent ha d refused to consider that the allegations may be true and ha d refused to take part in a safety plan.it was in the minors best interest to remove the children from the home and place them in shelter care.the court awarded dcfs guardianship and granted temporary custody to the minors grandmother.
on may,the state amended the petitions to allege that the minors were neglected under section b of the act because their environment was injurious to their welfare in that,after dcfs established a safety plan,respondent violated the plan by allowing contact between jorge and the minors.
on october,respondent filed a motion in limine to exclude any statements that maria might have made to detective smith.respondent argued,as she does on appeal,that such statements,alone,are insufficient to support a finding of neglect or abuse.see ilcs c west.
on november,the trial court resumed the adjudicatory hearing by denying respondent motion without comment.detective smith then testified that she interviewed maria after her grandmother brought her to the police station.detective smith testimony showed that she was uncertain as to the date of the interview.detective smith testified that maria told her that jorge touched her pochita,which meant vaginal area.maria identified
