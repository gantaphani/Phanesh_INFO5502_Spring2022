edward and romelia are the parents of suzanna l.when they divorced,romelia was given sole custody.edward was allowed monitored visitation however,he visited only sporadically for a year or so,and then not at all.thereafter,romelia married alan w.in this action,the trial court granted romelia petition to terminate edward parental rights,based on abandonment,so alan could adopt suzanna.
edward contends the trial court violated the indian child welfare act icwa because he,and hence suzanna,were part indian,yet proper notice was not given to their tribe.we agree.in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold that the icwa notice provisions applied,even if,under the existing indian family doctrine,its other provisions did not.on remand,the trial court must require proper notice.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,however,we find no other prejudicial error.accordingly,if,after proper notice has been given,the trial court determines that the icwa does not otherwise apply,it must reinstate its order terminating edward parental rights.
failure to give notice pursuant to the indian child welfare act 
edward contends the trial court erred by proceeding in the absence of proper notice pursuant to the icwa.
additional factual and procedural background.
on april,romelia filed a petition to free suzanna from edward custody and control,et no icwa issue was presented until june,when edward counsel stated to the court i just found out yesterday that my client is half indian,half cherokee indian.she added a ccording to the research we done,there should be a special indian social worker appointed in the case.the trial court ordered edward counsel to file a written request for any action she wanted taken.
on july,edward filed an objection to the a doption o f the m inor b ased on h is indian ancestry.in it,he asserted that he was indian as both of his maternal grandparents are full blooded indians he added that he was maybe cherokee or ya qu i indian.he provided copies of his mother and his mother sister birth certificates,which indicated that one or both of their parents edward grandparents were indian.he asked the court to allow sufficient time for the bureau of indian affairs to investigate the matter.
on july,the department of children services the department advised the trial court that it was going to send the appropriate requests to the tribes.it added that the tribes in question were the papago four separate bands,cherokee three separate bands,and yaqui possibly one band.it requested a continuance.
on july,the trial court stated s hould the child fall under the provisions,the tribe could or could not choose to intervene.the department is recommending a continuance because they going to contact the tribes.and they going to request of the tribes to see what they going to do.so i think that we going to have to put it over.counsel for the replied,i concur continue it,let social services do their thing,and if the tribe wants to come here and assert their rights,then the c ourt can decide how to act at that point.edward counsel said,i completely concur.the trial court set a status conference for october.
on october,the department reported we are in the process of obtaining information on the indian ancestry of the minor our results as of this date are as follows 
cherokee tribe tahlequah,on rol l 
cherokee tribe north on rol l 
papagos and yaquis no response.capitalization omitted.
the court continued the matter to january.
on january,edward counsel said we talked to the social worker and she had indicated she was going to be sending a request to the c ourt for another extension because the yaquis had not responded,neither have the papago the court denied a further continuance.it ordered the matter trailed to january.
on january,edward counsel stated i have an objection to this case even being ready for trial because we never got back information from the indian tribes the trial court ordered her to brief the issue.it set the trial for january.
edward filed a brief asserting that he was a papago indian.he did not clearly indicate what he believed the effect of this should be.he did argue that t he f ederal law has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter he also argued that s ince the s tate law does not prescribe what constitutes a member of a tribe the federal government would have exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of indian ancestry.the responded with a brief claiming that,back on july,when it had granted a continuance,the trial court had denied the jurisdictional objection and ruled that the tribes could participate at their election.
when trial began,on january,the court said to edward counsel you raised the issue but you have asked me for any relief.what your request edward counsel asked the court to dismiss this case based on the federal jurisdiction of the federal court over the matter minor counsel objected,o nce they been put on notice,it is up to the tribe if they want to assert that.if they do,we proceed the trial court then ruled t here a fairly common,procedure for invoking the jurisdiction of the indian tribes and for obtaining a stay o f the proceedings so they can invoke their jurisdiction.you have done that.your motion is denied.
statutory background.
the icwa et was enacted in,out of an increasing concern in the over the consequences to indian children,indian families,and indian tribes of child welfare practices that separated large numbers of indian children from their families and tribes,and placed them in homes through state adoption,foster care,and parental rights termination proceedings.citations.
the stated purpose of the icwa is to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster care or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture,and by providing for assistance to indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.citation.in re santos th,d,fn.omitted.
the icwa defines a child custody proceeding so as to include any proceeding for either termination of parental rights,which shall mean any action resulting in the termination of the relationship or adoptive placement,which shall mean the permanent placement of an indian child for adoption,including any action resulting in a final decree of adoption.ii,iv.thus,a proceeding to terminate parental rights under family code section et is a child custody proceeding within the meaning of the icwa.in re crystal d.the icwa defines indian child as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.
the icwa also lays out a dual jurisdictional scheme.section a establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal courts for proceedings concerning an indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe section b,on the other hand,creates concurrent but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of children not domiciled on the reservation on petition of either parent or the tribe,proceedings for termination of parental rights are to be transferred to the tribal court,except in cases of good cause,objection by either parent,or declination of jurisdiction by the tribal court.mississippi band choctaw indians holyfield,d,fn.omitted.moreover,if a proceeding for termination of parental rights is pending in state court,the indian child tribe shall have a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.c.
the icwa provision most critical in this notice in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the termination of parental rights to an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the tribe.no termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the tribe or the secretary provided,t hat the tribe shall,upon request,be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding.a see also.if parental rights are terminated without such notice,then either the child,the parent from whose custody the child was removed,or the tribe can petition to invalidate the termination.
when the icwa applies,an indigent parent has the right to appointed counsel.b.moreover,n o termination of parental rights may be ordered in the absence of a determination,supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.f.
we begin by correcting several of the parties mistaken notions regarding the icwa.the icwa does not give either the federal courts or the tribal courts exclusive jurisdiction in this kind of case.it may require that such a state court proceeding be transferred to a tribal court,but not that it be dismissed.it does not require a trial court to continue a case indefinitely while awaiting a response from a tribe.and it never requires a special indian social worker.
the argue notice was not required because there was insufficient evidence that suzanna was an indian child within the meaning of the icwa.an indian child is defined as either a a member of an indian tribe or b eligible for membership in an indian tribe and the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.notice,however,is required whenever the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved a,italics added.
the determination of whether a minor is,or is not,an indian child is made exclusively by the tribe.citation.o ne of the primary purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable the tribe to determine whether the child involved in the proceedings is an indian child.citation.citation.because the question of membership rests with each indian tribe,when the juvenile court knows or has reason to believe the child may be an indian child,notice must be given to the particular tribe in question or the secretary of the interior.citation.thus,the indian status of a child need not be certain or conclusive in order to trigger the act notice requirements.citation.in re jonathan th,d,quoting in re desiree th,d.
here,the evidence did not show that suzanna was,in fact,an indian child,it did not show that she was a member of,or eligible for membership in,an indian tribe or that edward was a member of an indian tribe.however,it did show that edward maternal grandparents were indian.such evidence of indian ancestry is sufficient reason to know a child is an indian child so as to trigger the notice requirement.in re samuel th,d in re jonathan,supra,th at,d in re desiree,supra,th at,d.
the trial court erred by finding that edward had somehow been dilatory.the do not even argue otherwise.notice is mandatory,regardless of how late in the proceedings a child possible indian heritage is uncovered.citations.citation.in re jonathan,supra,th at,d,quoting in re kahlen d.the notice requirements serve the interests of the indian tribes irrespective of the position of the parents and can not be waived by the parent.citation.in re samuel,supra,th at,d,quoting in re kahlen,supra,d at.thus,where the notice requirements of the act were violated and the parents did not raise that claim in a timely fashion,the waiver doctrine can not be invoked to bar consideration of the notice error on appeal.in re marinna th,d.
the do argue that the department gave adequate notice.technically,it was not the department job to give notice the,as the part ies seeking the termination of parental rights to an indian child,should have given notice.a.still,if the department gave adequate notice,presumably this error would be harmless.it is far from clear,however,that the department contacted the appropriate tribe s.given the uncertainty as to the tribe with which edward grandparents were affiliated,notice should have been given to the bureau of indian affairs the bia,on behalf of the secretary of the interior.a c in re edward th,d.
moreover,the trial court was not provided with copies of the notices the department sent or the return receipts if any it received.thus,there is insufficient evidence that two of the tribes that failed to actual notice.in re samuel,supra,th at,d.there is likewise insufficient evidence that the department properly notified the tribes,not only of the proceeding,but also of their right to intervene.ibid.s peaking with various members of the tribe in an attempt to determine the minor status does not satisfy the notice requirement.citations.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.
although two tribes did respond,their actual responses are also not in the record.the department summarized the responses as,not on rol l.it is not clear whether this referred to suzanna,edward,or edward grandparents.in any event,e nrollment is not required in order to be considered a member of a tribe many tribes do not have written rolls.citation.while enrollment can be one means of establishing membership,it is not the only means,nor is it determinative.citation.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.moreover,the ultimate question was whether suzanna was either a member or eligible for membership in a tribe.thus,we can not say that giving proper notice would have been fruitless.
finally,the argue that notice was not required because suzanna was not being removed from an existing indian family thus,the underlying purposes of the icwa were not implicated.they did not raise this contention below.the issue is properly before this court,however,because the facts are undisputed and the issue merely raises a new question of law.citation.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,fn,d.
under the existing indian family doctrine the icwa is not applied where its purpose,preventing the improper removal of indian children from their indian families,would not be served.in re santos,supra,th at,d.this doctrine had its genesis in matter of adoption of baby boy,which involved the child of an indian father and a mother.id.at.as in this case,a proceeding was brought to terminate the father parental rights so the child could be adopted.id.at.notice was given to the father tribe.id.at.the trial court,however,denied the tribe petition to intervene and refused to transfer the case to the tribal court it ruled that the icwa did not apply baby boy,supra,at,in part because the child has never been a part of any indian family relationship.id.at.it then proceeded to terminate the father parental rights.id.at.
the appellate court agreed that the icwa did not apply.it based its opinion on legislative intent a careful study of the legislative history behind the act and the act itself discloses that the overriding concern of congress and the proponents of the act was the maintenance of the family and tribal relationships existing in indian homes and to set minimum standards for the removal of indian children from their existing indian environment.it was not to dictate that an illegitimate infant who has never been a member of an indian home or culture,and probably never would be,should be removed from its primary cultural heritage and placed in an indian environment over the express objections of its mother.matter of adoption of baby boy,supra,at.
some california courts which have accepted the existing indian family doctrine derive it,as baby boy did,from legislative intent.crystal superior court th,d sixth dist.in re wanomi d.second,div.one,cert.den.sub nom.mic mac nation giesler,d.others have rejected the doctrine as an unwarranted judicial gloss on the icwa.in re alicia th,d fifth dist.in re junious d.first,div.three see also adoption of lindsay d.first,div.three.
recent california decisions,however,have reformu
