here we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting child and spousal support amounts that exceed appellant total monthly income.substantial evidence supports the conclusion that appellant extensive property holdings and the existence of special circumstances permit a deviation from codified support guidelines.
appellant contends that the trial court exceeded its authority by effectively forcing him to sell his ancestral home and other inherited separate property to perpetuate an excessive level of marital spending.appellant asserts that the trial court also erred in ordering him to make additional support payments for certain housing and educational expenses.
we modify the judgment as to the additional payments ordered,but otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
christian and vaughn de guigne were married in,when christian was years old and vaughn was they have two children allison,born in,and eleanor,born in.the couple separated in november.
christian was born into wealth and social prominence.his family home is a square foot hillsborough mansion built by his grandfather in.the residence is surrounded by acres of land containing hiking trails,streams,wildlife,and gardens,in a setting of extraordinary quiet and privacy.the house has multiple bedrooms,bathrooms,a ballroom,pavilion,formal dining room,library,and swimming pool.it contains valuable artwork,jewelry,furnishings and other items of personal property collected by christian parents and grandparents.
when christian and vaughn met in the early,christian was not employed and had not worked since.he relied on income from securities and family trusts.from to,he lived in a telegraph hill house purchased with money from his father.vaughn was also born in hillsborough in very comfortable circumstances.however,due to her parents divorce,vaughn standard of living was reduced when she was a teenager.although she had a masters degree in art therapy when she met christian,vaughn was doing volunteer work and was supported by a stock portfolio established by her father.
christian inherited the hillsborough property and its contents.he and vaughn moved into the mansion shortly before their marriage and lived there together until christian moved out in.the family maintained an opulent lifestyle.the house was staffed by two housekeepers,three gardeners,a laundress,chef,childcare provider and a chauffeur.the de guignes frequently took costly vacations,and maintained multiple club memberships.the children attended private school and engaged in extracurricular activities including horseback riding,tennis and piano lessons,various other sports activities,and overnight camps.vaughn purchased expensive clothing for herself and the girls,and incurred significant monthly expenses for personal services such as hair care,makeup and massage.
according to vaughn,christian insisted on a lifestyle similar to that enjoyed by his parents and expected vaughn to emulate the very high standards of dress and fashion set by his mother.christian strenuously disputed this assertion and recounted unsuccessful attempts to curtail his wife spending.it is clear,however,that neither parent worked and the court found that annual household expenses averaged,consistently exceeding christian annual income of from securities holdings and family trusts.christian had sole control over the family finances and consistently liquidated his separate property assets during the marriage.between and,christian withdrew over million from his securities account.he also sold an antique knife collection for and his telegraph hill house for.some of the proceeds were used to meet household expenses.
the marriage generated no community property.christian testified that his separate property hillsborough estate was worth million.vaughn appraisal experts placed the value at million if the house and land were sold as a unit.according to expert testimony,the value of the home on acres would be to million,and the remaining acres would be worth million or more.the real estate is by far christian most significant asset.the corpus of christian primary family trust was valued at an estimated million at the time of trial,but these assets are not under christian control.vaughn securities account was worth at the time of trial.
support orders 
the issues of child and spousal support were tried before a retired judge sitting pro tempore by stipulation of the parties.vaughn sought an award of child and spousal support in excess of per month,in addition to the costs of housing and household help which she contemplated would be added to christian support obligation once her permanent residence was determined.applying statutory guidelines to his annual trust and securities income of,christian requested an order for child support of per month and monthly spousal support of.in addition,he expressed a willingness to pay for the children tuition and other education expenses.subject to certain conditions,he proposed that vaughn and the children remain in the hillsborough residence,with reduced household staff.on his income and expense declaration,christian listed his own monthly living expenses as.this sum included for dues in six private clubs.
the trial court ordered christian to pay per month in child support and per month in spousal support beginning when vaughn obtained rental housing.the court also required christian to pay all the children private school tuition and tutoring expenses,and to pay vaughn a lump sum of to cover rental deposits and furniture purchases.a judgment of dissolution in accordance with these terms was entered in may,and this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
appealability 
vaughn challenges our jurisdiction to hear christian appeal under code of civil procedure section.according to vaughn,the judgment is neither final nor appealable because it includes a provision specifying that vaughn prospective move into rental housing might constitute a changed circumstance warranting modification of support.initially,the trial court expressed reluctance to set permanent support terms without knowing what vaughn and the children actual expenses would be.the modification provision incorporated in the final judgment addresses this uncertainty.
inclusion of this language does not render the judgment.the judgment created enforceable rights and obligations modifiable as provided by statute.any support judgment may be modified in light of changed circumstances.see.in any event,even temporary support orders are appealable.in re marriage of skelley cal d.the judgment in this case was final in form and substance,and thus appealable.
ii.child support 
background 
statutory guidelines regulate the determination of child support in california.see in re marriage of fini th,d.the guideline amount of child support,calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the relative incomes of the parents,is presumptively correct.see,subd.a.that presumption may be rebutted by admissible evidence showing that application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case,consistent with the principles set forth in section,subd.b.
section makes clear that the court paramount concern in adhering to or departing from the guideline amount must be the interests of the children a a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life b both parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children d each parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability e the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority f children should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children 
here,the court awarded child support in an amount three times greater than the guideline provides,citing section,subdivision b as the basis for this departure.that provision permits a deviation from the guideline if the court finds that a pplication of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate due to the special circumstances of the particular case.the question,then,is whether special circumstances support the deviation here.
the court found that a per monthly child support award would subvert the overriding principle behind the support guideline.it would not serve the interests of the de guigne children,which must remain paramount.those interests were best protected,the court found,by shielding the children as much as possible from a drastic reduction in their standard of living.the order was not intended to maintain the family former standard.the court explicitly found that per month in basic support would necessitate a substantial reduction in the standard of living for both parents and for their children.christian disputes that the order would result in a decreased standard of living for vaughn and the girls.however,his comparison between the support award and historical spending patterns overlooks the significant rental expenses that vaughn will incur when she leaves the hillsborough residence.
our review is limited to determining whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.mcginley herman th,d.we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court,but confine ourselves to determining whether any judge could have reasonably made the challenged order.in re marriage of aylesworth d.we answer these questions in the context of christian multifaceted attack.he argues that the court erred in concluding that special circumstances exist here that a court may deviate from the guidelines only when it identifies specific and quantifiable unmet needs and that the court lacked jurisdiction over his separate property.
special circumstances 
the parties cite no published decision either authorizing or forbidding reliance on special circumstances as a basis for an award exceeding guideline amounts.section b provides that any deviation from the guidelines must be consistent with the principles in section,which designates interests of the children as a top priority and provides that parents should support their children at a level commensurate with their ability.these principles seem primarily to mitigate against downward deviation.
further,section does not catalogue all of the special circumstances in which the formula amount would be inappropriate.the words including,but not limited to reflect the legislature intent to give courts broad discretion to determine when such circumstances apply.according to the bill author,legislative amendments putting section in its present form were designed to clarify that courts retain their traditional discretionary authority to adjust child support orders according to the circumstances of each case.letter from senator gary hart,appendix to court of appeal decision in in re marriage of fini,supra,th at,d.
marital overspending 
according to christian,marital overspending is not a special circumstance warranting application of section.for this proposition,he relies primarily on in re marriage of th,d marriage of,in re marriage of simpson cal th,d,simpson,and in re marriage of smith d.smith.in marriage of,the husband argued a guideline support award would result in a substantial reduction in his standard of living.the appellate court rejected his claim that this reduction was a special circumstance justifying a downward departure from the guideline amount.observing that child support almost inevitably reduces the payor standard of living,the court found that recognizing such an exception would undermine the presumption that guideline amounts are appropriate by inviting inquiry in numerous cases as to whether the particular reduction in living standard constitutes an injustice.supra,at,d.
marriage of does not assist christian.the court there was not faced with the question of how guideline support would impact the children standard of living,but instead with how payment would affect the supporting parent.in fact,the marriage of court stressed that the statutory scheme seeks to mitigate the financial impact of divorce on the children,not the parents.supra,th at,fn,d.christian suggestion that a drastic reduction in the children lifestyle can never constitute a special circumstance flies in the face of this statutory priority 
christian reliance on simpson and smith is likewise misplaced as both are readily distinguishable.each involved a couple that lived on the income produced by the husband salary.in order to support the couples chosen lifestyle the husbands worked extraordinary hours.the wives maintained that,following dissolution,their support levels should reflect the marital standard.both couples lived beyond their means,in the sense that they depended upon the income derived from a salary and that exceptionally burdensome work schedules were required to generate the salary needed.both the simpson and smith courts concluded that a lifestyle supported in such a fashion was unreasonable.
this case presents a different paradigm.here the de guignes did not support themselves by working.christian held a variety of assets,some of which produced income and some of which were sold to generate liquid capital.christian financed the family lifestyle in this fashion throughout the marriage,generating well over four million dollars.by the time of the dissolution sources had been substantially depleted.the trial court concluded that throughout the marriage,christian had chosen to live on money beyond that generated by investments.thus,it was inappropriate that christian support obligation be based on that investment income alone,while he sheltered and benefited from substantial assets that produced no income.rather,the court found it more consistent with the statutory principles of child support for the court to consider all of christian assets in determining his earning capacity.
in evaluating the court decision,in re marriage of destein th,d destein is instructive.it is factually similar,albeit on a lesser scale than that encountered here.during their marriage,the desteins enjoyed a lavish lifestyle,living in a million home,employing a housekeeper and spending an average of monthly.the husband was not gainfully employed during the marriage,relying for living expenses on his substantial wealth and property.in his income and expense declaration,husband listed over six million dollars in stocks,bonds,retirement accounts and real estate.he listed monthly expenses of with an annual income of.an accountant testified that husband yearly income should be deemed to be,based on income as a lloyds of london principal,vineyard rental income,ira and other investments and real estate valued at million.the realty figure excluded the value of the family home.the real estate income value was arrived at by figuring the amount to be realized from sale and assuming that the amount was invested at a annual return.
the trial court based its child support award,in part,on earning capacity attributed to husband real estate holdings.in upholding the award the appellate court noted that section expressly authorizes the court to attribute income even if there is no evidence that a supporting parent has taken steps to reduce his or her income.destein,supra,th at,d.it agreed with the holding of in re marriage of dacumos th,d dacumos that the earning capacity doctrine embraces the ability to earn from capital as well as labor.it also observed that the only limitation on a court discretion to apply the earning capacity doctrine to investment assets is the best interest of the child.destein,supra,at,d,citing,subd.b.it embraced the observation of the dacumos court that just as a parent can not shirk his parental obligations by reducing his earning capacity through unemployment or underemployment,he can not shirk the obligation to support his child by underutilizing assets.here,as in destein,the trial court reasonably considered assets beyond christian securities and trust income in evaluating his overall earning capacity.dacumos,supra,at,d.
the recent case of in re marriage of cheriton th,d follows the same approach.in
