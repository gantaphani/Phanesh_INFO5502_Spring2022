a minor child,appeals an order denying her request for a hearing to suspend visitation with her father terminate his reunification services under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a and c specifically,she contends the juvenile court erred when it ruled that the statutory framework of the dependency system as well as principles of due process required the juvenile court to hold a status review hearing to determine whether reasonable services were offered or provided to the parent before it could consider a request to terminate reunification services under section,subdivision c,and the allegations in the child section petition did not state a prima facie case to show that the action or inaction of the parent created a substantial likelihood family reunification would not occur,or that a modification of the prior visitation order was in the child best interests.
we conclude that the juvenile court misinterpreted section,subdivision c when it denied request for a hearing to terminate her father reunification services.while section,subdivision c requires a reasonable services finding,the juvenile court is not required to hold a review hearing to determine whether reasonable services have been offered or provided to a parent before it holds a hearing on a petition to terminate reunification services under section,subdivision c.the reasonable services finding required under section,subdivision c may be made at a hearing on the petition.in addition,terminating reunification services before the statutory reunification period has ended does not violate a parent due process rights where the parent action or inaction has created a substantial likelihood that family reunification will not occur.where there is a substantial likelihood the child will not be reunited with his or her parent as a result of a parent action or inaction,the child interests in a safe,permanent home takes precedence over the parent diminished interests in the child.in addition,the juvenile court erred when it found that petition to terminate her father reunification services suspend visitation did not state a prima facie case.
we nevertheless conclude reversal is not necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice.in view of the lack of any challenge on appeal to the juvenile court findings at the review hearing that visitation was not detrimental to the child,and the father was making progress with his case plan and it was likely that reunification would occur by the next review hearing,any error in not granting a hearing on the section petition is harmless.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
born march,is the daughter of marina and alejandro alejandro and marina had a brief romance while alejandro was separated from his wife,with whom he has three children.before dependency proceedings began,alejandro visited four times.he last saw her in approximately march.alejandro made regular child support payments and maintained health care insurance for

the social worker talked to alejandro about the importance of maintaining regular contact with to establish and strengthen their relationship.the social worker was aware that alejandro travel time to visit was approximately two and a half hours each way,and that his financial circumstances were stressed and he was at risk of losing his home.
the foster mother set up weekly visits on sunday evenings and offered alejandro the opportunity to have another visit the following day if he wished to stay overnight in san diego.
first visit with her father occurred on june.alejandro said the visit was awesome.according to foster mother,appeared to recognize her father when she first saw him.however,pulled away from her father when he hugged and kissed her goodbye.

the juvenile court found that alejandro was now making progress with his case plan and that he was provided reasonable reunification services.minor counsel then renewed her request for a hearing on petition to terminate alejandro reunification services under section,subdivision c.the court denied the request on the grounds the petition did not state a prima facie case to show that reunification would not occur and that terminating reunification services under section,subdivision c at the hearing would violate alejandro due process rights.
discussion 
ithe issues on appeal 
contends the juvenile court erred as a matter of law in denying a hearing on her section petition.she challenges the ruling that the juvenile court can not grant a hearing on a request to terminate reunification services under section,subdivision c until it has made a reasonable services finding at a status review hearing.she also contests the ruling that granting a hearing on the section petition prior to a status review hearing would infringe on the parent due process rights.in addition,contends the juvenile court erred when it determined that the section petition did not state a prima facie case that a modification of the prior visitation order was in her best interests,or there was a substantial likelihood that reunification would not occur.
the agency does not address arguments concerning the juvenile court interpretation of section,subdivision c and its ruling that holding a section hearing to terminate a parent reunification services before the hearing violates the parent due process rights,thus implicitly acknowledging the juvenile court misinterpreted the law.instead,the agency argues does not meet her burden on appeal to show that the juvenile court clearly abused its discretion in denying a hearing because the petition failed to state a prima facie case.
the court is not required to hold a review hearing before holding a hearing on a petition to terminate reunification services under section,subdivision c astatutory framework 
family reunification services play a crucial role in dependency proceedings.in re alanna th,quoting in re joshua th.when a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent,the juvenile court is required to offer or provide family reunification services to the child mother and presumed father,and has the discretion to offer or provide reunification services to the child biological father,subd.a.
however,in some circumstances,the juvenile court need not order reunification services to a parent at the disposition hearing under section,subdivisions b or e the reunification bypass provisions.for example,reunification services need not be provided to a parent who has severely abused a child,either sexually or physically caused the death of another child willfully abandoned the child has a history of extensive,chronic drug use and has resisted treatment or failed to comply with a drug or alcohol treatment program on at least two prior occasions failed to reunify with the child sibling and has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the sibling removal or who is incarcerated or institutionalized and providing services to that parent would be detrimental to the child,subds.b,e.
family reunification services,when provided,are subject to time limitations.for a child who was three years of age or older on the date of the initial removal from the physical custody of his or her parent,services shall be provided beginning with the dispositional hearing and ending months after the date the child entered foster care unless the child is returned home,subd.a a.for a child who was under three years of age on the date of the initial removal from the parent custody,or for a child who is a member of a sibling group services shall be provided for a period of six months from the dispositional hearing but no longer than months from the date the child entered foster care,unless the child is returned home,subd.a b,c.thus,generally,the statutory scheme envisions that a parent of a child who is three years of age or older will have months to mitigate the conditions that led to the initial removal and continued custody of the child,whereas a parent of a child who is under three years of age,or who is a member of a qualified sibling group,will have only six months in which to reunify.see in re marilyn cal th.the juvenile court must review the case at least once every six months.
at each review hearing,if the child is not returned to the custody of his or her parent,the juvenile court is required to determine whether reasonable services that were designed to aid the parent in overcoming the problems that led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child have been offered or provided to the parent reasonable services finding,subd.e,f.generally,the remedy for not offering or providing reasonable reunification services to a parent is an extension of reunification services to the next review hearing,subds.e,g see in re tracy th.
any motion to terminate reunification services prior to the month review hearing for a child who is three years of age or older,or prior to the review hearing for a child who is under three years of age or who is a member of a qualified sibling group,shall be made pursuant to section,subdivision c,subd.a,subd.c.a motion to terminate reunification services is not required at a review hearing if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the child parents are still unknown,the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,or the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness,subd.a.
section,subdivision c provides that any party,including a child who is a dependent of the juvenile court,may petition the court,prior to the applicable review hearing,to terminate reunification services only if one of the following conditions exist it appears that a change of circumstances or new evidence exists that satisfies a condition set forth in the reunification bypass provisions under section,subdivision b or e or the action or inaction of the parent creates a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur,including,but not limited to,the parent failure to visit the child,or the failure of the parent to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,subd.c a,b.in determining whether there is a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur,the court is required to consider factors such as the parent incarceration,institutionalization,federal immigration detention,deportation,or participation in a residential substance abuse treatment program,subd.c.
the court shall terminate reunification services only upon a finding that reasonable services have been offered or provided,and upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence that one of the conditions of section,subdivision c a or c b exists,subd.c.
standard of review and principles of statutory construction 
the interpretation of a statute is a legal issue,which we review de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th.in construing a statute,we look to the words of the statute to determine legislative intent and to fulfill the intent of the law.gooch hen drix cal th.where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,we follow the plain meaning of the statute and need not examine other indicia of legislative intent.in re alanna th.the language is construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and courts give significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuing the legislative purpose.people canty cal th.the term shall is mandatory and the term may is permissive.
in denying the request for a hearing on section petition,the juvenile court explained 
when you have a child over the age of three,the statute says it is the burden of the agency to establish the statutory criteria.the parents have a due process right to hold the agency to their burden.and usually at a review for a child over the age of four,the primary consideration in that regard is whether or not reasonable services have been offered or provided.
here there appears to be no disagreement that reasonable services were offered or provided.so i think that the due process rights of the parents compels the court to follow the statutory scheme under the supreme court precedent that there be continuity of our statutory scheme in the rollover nature for findings in all of these hearings.the legislature made a specific exception for children under the age of three,but did not do so for children over the age of three,and that because of the developmental considerations that come into play.so i do believe that a motion at a review for a child over three where there is no dispute as to reasonableness of the services is actually premature,and if heard contemporaneously or prior to the review findings,would endanger the parents due process rights of holding the agency to its burden.
the juvenile court interpretation of section is incorrect.
section,subdivision a and section,subdivision c each provide that a motion to terminate reunification services for a child who was three years of age or older at the time of removal may be made prior to the hearing set pursuant to subdivision f of section.the hearing under section,subdivision f,commonly referred to as the month review hearing,shall be held no later than months after the child entered foster care,subd.f.this language is clear and unambiguous.in re alanna,supra,th at.nothing in the language of section,subdivision c limits the authority of the juvenile court to consider terminating a parent reunification services until after the review hearing has been held.
further,neither the statutory framework of the dependency system nor principles of due process require the juvenile court to continue to provide reunification services to a parent where a party can show,by clear and convincing evidence,that a condition set forth in section,subdivision b or e exists as to that parent,or that the action or inaction of that parent creates a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur,subd.c.the juvenile court has the authority at the disposition hearing to deny services to a parent under a reunification bypass provision,subds.b,e.if the existence of such a reunification bypass condition is brought to the juvenile court attention after the disposition hearing on a showing of changed circumstances or new evidence,the termination of reunification services on those grounds completely comports with the dependency framework.it would contravene the purpose of the dependency system to be required to attempt to reunify a child with a parent who,for example,has been sentenced to a lengthy prison term,has committed a violent felony,or has been found to have committed severe physical harm or severe sexual abuse to the child or the child sibling,unless reunification is in the best interest of the child,subds.b,c,e in re th,juvenile court erred when it did not grant child petition to terminate reunification services to her father under,subd.c after he was incarcerated on charges of transporting the child with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.
in enacting section,subdivision c,the legislature did not distinguish between the two alternative grounds for terminating reunification services prior to the completion of the applicable review period.the statutory requirements that govern termination of reunification services where a reunification bypass provision is found to apply,also govern a petition to terminate reunification services to a parent whose action or inaction has created a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur,subd.c.where a parent is not creating or maintaining a relationship with his or her dependent child by regularly visiting or contacting the child,and is not participating and making progress in reunification services,it is not premature to consider terminating reunification services to that parent prior to the review hearing.childhood does not wait for the parent to become adequate.in re marilyn cal th.there is a limitation on the length of time a child has to wait for a parent to become adequate.id.at.where a party establishes a prima facie case under section,subdivision c,granting a hearing on the merits comports with the legislative directive to the juvenile court to give substantial weight to a minor need for prompt resolution of his or her custody status,the need to provide children with stable environments,and the damage to a minor of prolonged temporary placements.in re marilyn,supra,at,citing,subd.a.
in addition,the plain language of section,subdivision c requires the juvenile court to make a reasonable services finding before it may terminate reunification services to a parent,subd.c.thus,it is not necessary to hold a review hearing prior to hearing a motion to terminate reunification services in order to make a reasonable services finding.
the juvenile court ruled that a parent
