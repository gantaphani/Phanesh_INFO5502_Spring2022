claire simcox appeals from the decision of the district court ordering her to return to mexico with two of the four children currently residing with her in ohio,which return the district court found was required under the hague convention on civil aspects of international child abduction the convention and its implementing legislation,the international child abduction remedies act icara,et.because of evidence of serious abuse to both simcox and the children at the hands of simcox,the district court conditioned return of the children on certain undertakings designed to ameliorate the risk of harm to them upon their return to mexico.although we agree with much of the district court legal analysis of the hague convention,its ordered undertakings are problematic on the facts of this case,particularly its command that simcox herself return to mexico.we therefore reverse and remand to allow the court to reconsider what conditions,if any,could ensure the safety of the children in mexico during the pendency of custody proceedings.
background 
joseph and claire simcox,both united states citizens,were married in london in.they traveled extensively throughout their marriage and moved frequently,visiting approximately countries.simcox is a botanical explorer by collects and sells exotic plant seeds.simcox assisted him in this business and also cared for the couple five children,each of whom was born in a different country.simcox maintains that the family had no real home and lived a nomadic and isolated existence.appellant br.at.nevertheless,it appears from some temporary sojourns resided in mexico since at least the birth of their youngest child there in.simcox nevertheless points out that they lived in three different states in mexico and continued to travel abroad extensively.the last place of residence for the family was the town of rafael delgado in the state of veracruz.simcox characterized their residence in rafael delgado as a flophouse,but the oldest child,who still resides there with her father,testified that it is a lovely house that we all considered home.
the parties paint a starkly different picture of what family life in mexico was like.simcox describes the children lives as blissful,filled with exotic travel and wondrous educational and cultural opportunities.appellee br.at.simcox,on the other hand,claims that the children lives were filled with hard labor,severe physical punishment,exposure to simcox humiliations and violent behavior,and long weeks of travel confined to a car.appellant br.at.the district court expressed frustration at the lack of credibility of both parties and noted that the disparities in their testimonies are so broad this court can only speculate on the truth.nevertheless,although there was no clear picture of exactly what life was like in the simcox household prior to the alleged wrongful abduction,it is clear that simcox was both verbally and physically violent with his wife and children.for example,the oldest child testified that he would call simcox a f ing bitch and a c in the presence of the children,and that h e would maybe grab her jaw and put his finger on her neck,pulling hair.she also stated that her father once while driving banged her mother head against the passenger window of the vehicle in which they were traveling,and that she often had to intervene by placing herself between them.the other children with the exception of the youngest,who did not testify expressed fear of their father and recounted frequent episodes of,spanking,hitting,yelling and screaming,and of pulling their hair and ears.they also witnessed their father strike their mother on numerous occasions.for example,simcox,testifying in camera,recalled an incident in which her father held her mother by the neck against the wall.her older sister tried to stop him but he hit her.simcox himself acknowledges that he would physically discipline his children,but downplays the seriousness of this discipline.appellee br.at.
while there is no dispute that simcox is an and violent man,it is unclear precisely how grave the abuse in the simcox household actually was.simcox admits that she never sought medical attention following the assaults,either for her own injuries or for those of her children,and she never reported the abuse to any government officials until the weeks immediately prior to her flight from mexico,when she contacted the american consulate.there was also some evidence that simcox may have left mexico not or,at least,not only to escape simcox abuse,but to be closer to another man with whom she had become romantically involved.
ultimately,whether to escape her husband increasingly violent abuse as simcox claims,or to be with her adulterous lover as simcox claims,or perhaps some combination of the two motivations,simcox decided to leave mexico with the children and live with her family in ohio.during early january,while temporarily in ohio with her family,simcox began to make arrangements to leave mexico with the children.she contacted some individuals at the united states consulate in mexico city and at the center for domestic violence in cleveland,and also spoke to several attorneys.on the night of january,after simcox had fallen asleep,simcox instructed the four younger children to pack their bags and then left with them in the family car,driving to the texas border.simcox testified that his wife took his passport and identification papers with her to prevent his pursuit of the fleeing family.the oldest child was living with simcox mother in france at the time,and simcox apparently made no arrangements to reunite with her.she was picked up by her father in france in early february,and returned to live with him in rafael delgado,mexico,where she remains 
simcox filed this petition seeking return of the children to mexico on january,nearly one year after the abduction.preliminarily,the district court concluded that simcox had established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the children were wrongfully removed from country of habitual residence within the meaning of the hague thus the burden shifted to simcox to prove one of the defenses against return permitted under article.simcox simcox,d.the court noted that the convention authorizes a court to decline to order the return of a child who objects to such return,if the child is of sufficient age and maturity to consider its views.id.at.the court found that the two older children possessed the requisite level of age and maturity sufficient for this court to consider their views,noted their unequivocal objections to return ing to mexico,and thus declined to order their return.ibid.although the district court also noted that the child simcox,then age eight had expressed his objections to return,the court did not find him of sufficient age and maturity to take his views into consideration.ibid.similarly,at four years of age,the youngest child was not of sufficient age and maturity for this court to consider interviewing her.ibid.the court thus moved on to analyzing whether the return of the two younger children would pose a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to them or would otherwise place them in an intolerable situation under article of the convention.id.at,citing e a.
before doing so,however,the district court paused to express its disdain for simcox behavior throughout the proceedings,describing his deposition testimony as unresponsive,obnoxious,intentionally obtuse and arrogant.his own counsel had to repeatedly admonish him to stop being argumentative.id.at.the court stated that,at trial,simcox became belligerent and fail ed to follow repeated instructions by court and counsel to answer only the questions put him by counsel and to refrain from monologuing on simple yes and no questions id.at.the court further noted that simcox 
behavior exhibits an arrogance,a need to be in control and a tendency to act out violently that presents serious concerns such traits have been amplified outside the confines of the courthouse.when coupled with testimony from simcox own family and friends describing him as mean,and one friend comparing simcox control over his wife with the nazi treatment of jews and simcox own desire not to be remembered as a mean and overworking hollering bastard,this court has serious concerns simcox does indeed present a serious threat to his children physical and psychological.ibid.nevertheless,although concluding that simcox ha d provided evidence of a serious risk of harm due to abuse and emotional dependence,the court noted that it could only consider that evidence directly establishing the existence of a grave risk that would expose the child to physical or emotional harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.id.at quoting friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich ii.the court concluded that the threshold of a grave risk was not met.ibid.
finally,the court rejected simcox argument that simcox had either consented or acquiesced to the removal of the children.id.at.simcox strongest piece of evidence for consent was an simcox sent to her when she was in ohio in the weeks prior to her flight with the children.in the,simcox states 
there is no reason for you to come back here i will arrange for the kids to join you when you have a place to stay please do not come back,ask your dad to help you find an apartment,as soon as you are ready i will bring up the kids.i am resolved to leaving them with you until should it happen that they are big enough and decide they want to live with me.
the district court,however,noted simcox deliberately secretive nature in leaving mexico with the children and found that n either party acted consistent with the understanding that simcox had consented to removal of the children.id.at citing friedrich ii,at.
the court ultimately concluded that simcox has not met her burden of demonstrating a valid defense to the return of the two youngest children and the court orders their return to mexico for determination of custody by the mexican courts.id.at.the court did,however,condition the return on several undertakings 
d ue to this court concern over the children safety,the court orders return under the following conditions the court orders the two youngest children returned to mexico but they must remain in the custody of simcox in the family residence in rafael del gado,mexico until the mexican court hears and determines whether a protective order is appropriate.simcox shall have no contact with simcox until the mexican court determines access and visitation rights.upon return to mexico,simcox shall provide the oldest child reasonable access to her siblings.
ibid.the court issued its order on june.
simcox moved to stay the district court order pending appeal,asserting that simcox had subsequently threatened to have her arrested and prosecuted upon her return to mexico.exulting in his partial victory in district simcox attorneys and stated in messages that simcox would be immediately incarcerated upon her return to mexico.simcox made a similar threat to simcox directly by interrupting a speakerphone conversation between the oldest child and her siblings.nevertheless,the district court rejected this as a legitimate basis for staying its order pending appeal.whether simcox has committed a crime under mexican law is no basis to stay return.this court granted a stay of the district court order pending expedited appeal,citing the evidence of physical abuse,simcox threats to subject simcox to criminal prosecution,and the nearly delay between the time of the alleged abduction and simcox filing a petition for return.
ii.analysis 
in a case involving an action for return of a child under the hague convention,this court review s the district court findings of fact for clear error and review s its conclusions about american,foreign,and international law de novo.friedrich ii,at.whether there is a grave risk of harm under the convention is a mixed question of law and fact and thus review is de novo.see silverman silverman,cir blondin dubois,cir the district court application of the convention to the facts it has found,like the interpretation of the convention,is subject to de novo review.
on appeal,simcox raises five arguments the district court erred in holding that mexico was the children place of habitual residence prior to their removal the district court misinterpreted article of the convention,which permits a court to decline to order return if such return would present a grave risk of harm to the children the district court erred in adopting undertakings that required simcox herself to return to mexico and that did not sufficiently ameliorate the risk of harm to the children the district court erred in holding that simcox had not consented to the removal of the children and the district court erred in determining that simcox was not of sufficient age and maturity to consider his objection to being returned to mexico.we dispense first with issues one,four,and five,and affirm the district court judgment as to those issues.we then deal with issues two and three,which are substantially intertwined,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
habitual residence 
the hague convention prohibits the removal of a child,in breach of the rights of custody,from the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal hague convention,article.habitual residence is not defined by the convention,but as this court has noted,there is no real distinction between ordinary residence and habitual residence.friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich i.a person can have only one habitual residence.on its face,habitual residence pertains to customary residence prior to the removal.the court must look back in time,not forward.ibid.in answering the question of habitual residency,a court should consider whether the child has been physically present in the country for an amount of time sufficient for acclimatization and whether the place has a degree of settled purpose from the child perspective.robert tesson,cir quoting feder,cir the petitioning party in this case,simcox has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal was wrongful under the convention.see e friedrich i,at.
friedrich is directly on point here.the case involved a boy born in germany to an american mother and a german father aside from a few vacations,he had resided in germany his entire life twenty months until removed to the united states by his mother.see friedrich i,at.we concluded that friedrich was a simple case and held that the child was a habitual resident of germany at the time of his removal.id.at.similarly,in this case,the youngest simcox child was born in mexico and resided there her entire life other than for some temporary sojourns abroad.the,who was about seven years old at the time of removal,appears to have lived there since the age of four.as simcox concedes,the entire family stayed in mexico since at least.appellant br.at.that they may have moved around to different communities within mexico,had a nomadic lifestyle,or often traveled internationally,does not change the fact that mexico was the country in which the family principally resided during the period in question.the district court credited evidence that simcox presented regarding leases of real property in mexico,utility bills,frequent withdrawals on accounts in mexican banks,membership cards to various stores in mexico,and simcox own testimony in concluding that simcox had met his burden of demonstrating,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the family place of habitual residence was mexico.simcox,d at.the district court did not err in so finding.
consent to removal 
article of the convention provides a consent defense where the petitioner consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention.hague convention,article.the respondent has the burden of establishing the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.e b.simcox points to the message her husband sent her while she was in ohio during the early weeks of january as illustrating that he consented to the removal.appellant br.at.she states that while her departure may have been precipitous,t here was never a time that simcox did not know where to find the children.ibid.but even if simcox knew where the children were which he disputes,it does not necessarily follow that simcox had his consent to remove them from mexico.indeed,the message that simcox points to as her most damning piece of evidence would seem to argue against a finding of consent.in the message,after admonishing his wife to remain in ohio,simcox states,i will arrange for the kids to join you when you have a place to stay,and that as soon as you are ready i will bring up the kids.emphasis added.the implication is that the children were to remain in simcox custody until some unspecified future point when he would deliver them to their mother in the united that simcox could return to mexico and surreptitiously retrieve them.
moreover,regardless of the proper interpretation of the message,as we pointed out in friedrich ii,e ach of the words and actions of a parent during the separation are not to be scrutinized for a possible waiver of custody rights.at.although we were speaking specifically about acquiescence,the logic applies also to consent.that is to say,a single message indicating a willingness to allow the children to live with their mother in ohio should not be the basis for a finding that simcox consented to their removal,especially given the manner in which simcox removed the children.as this court has stated,the deliberately secretive nature of the actions of the removing parent is extremely strong evidence that the other parent would not have consented to the removal friedrich ii,id.at.simcox admits that she left with the children at midnight after her husband had fallen asleep.simcox,d at.the district court credited simcox testimony that his wife had taken his passport and identification papers to prevent his pursuit of the fleeing family,and that once he realized they were gone he engaged in a desperate search for the children.ibid.thus,the district court properly found that n either party acted consistent with the understanding that simcox had consented to removal of the children,and that simcox had therefore failed to establish the defense.ibid.
age and maturity exception 
simcox argues that the district court erred in not taking into consideration simcox objection to returning to mexico because it deemed him too immature.appellant br.at.article of the hague convention authorizes a court to refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.the respondent has the burden of establishing this by a preponderance of the evidence.e b.whether a child is mature enough to have its views considered is a factual finding,and as such,the district court is entitled to deference.see friedrich ii,at findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.
in this case,the court interviewed simcox in camera and found him to be preoccupied,disinterested and detached in short,a typical eight year old boy who strongly desired to be anywhere but in a judge chambers answering questions.simcox,d at.although the district court noted the child avoidance in discussing his father and stated that he was visibly uncomfortable dealing with memories of mexico,the court concluded that he was not of sufficient age and maturity to permit this court to appropriately consider his views.ibid.
simcox points out that other courts have found children of a similar age to be sufficiently mature.appellant br.at.but g iven the and idiosyncratic nature of the inquiry,decisions applying the age and maturity exception are understandably disparate.de silva pitts,cir.simply because other have been found to be sufficiently mature does not mean that the district court erred in not finding the same with regard to simcox.the district court was obviously in a much better position to judge the child maturity than are we.because the court factual determination that simcox was not sufficiently mature to take his views into consideration was not clearly erroneous,there is no ground for reversal.
article and the district court undertakings 
under article of the hague convention,a court is not bound to order the return of the child if there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.the burden is with the respondent to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the exception applies.e a.the grave risk exception is to be interpreted narrowly,lest it swallow the rule.see friedrich ii,at.that c hildren who are wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention are to be promptly returned,a was designed to protect the interests of the state of habitual residence in determining any custody dispute,and to deter parents from unilaterally removing children in search of a more sympathetic forum.see friedrich ii,at linda silberman,hague convention on international child abduction a brief overview and case law analysis,fam.these purposes,however,must give way before the primary interest of any person in not being exposed to physical or psychological danger or being placed in an intolerable situation.elisa,explanatory report,in hague conference on private international law,acts and documents of the fourteenth session,child abduction report it thus makes sense that the convention purposes would not be furthered by forcing the return of children who were the direct or indirect victims of domestic violence.merle weiner,navigating the road between uniformity and progress the need for purposive analysis of the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,colum.human rights.
thus,while all jurists would agree that some level of domestic abuse will trigger the article exception,the more difficult question is at precisely what level will return expose the child to a grave risk of harm or place the child in an intolerable situation there is no clear answer,though this court has favorably cited a state department report that states,the person opposing the child return must show that the risk to the child is grave,not merely serious.friedrich ii,at citing public notice,march,see also walsh walsh,cir t he harm must be a great deal more than minimal.the same report also noted that a n example of an intolerable situation is one in which a custodial parent sexually abuses the child because such circumstances would constitute a grave risk of psychological harm.friedrich ii,at.
in friedrich ii,we determined that adjustment problems that would attend the relocation of most children,which was all that friedrich had alleged,did not meet the grave risk exception.id.at.the case did not involve any allegations of abuse,however,and courts that have confronted abusive situations tend to refuse to order the return of the children,at least where the abuse could be characterized as very serious.see,van de sande van de sande,cir reversing order of return where the father had beat en his wife severely and repeatedly in the children presence,and also threatened to kill them walsh,at reversing order of return where father was psychologically abusive and had severely beaten the children mother in their presence elyashiv elyashiv,d,refusing return where father frequently hit the children,threatened to kill his son,and severely abused their mother in their presence rodriguez rodriguez,d,refusing return where child had been,punched,and kicked,and where the child mother had been subjected to more serious attacks,including choking her and breaking her nose.
nevertheless,even when confronted with a grave risk of harm,some courts have exercised the discretion given by the convention to nevertheless return the child to the country of habitual residence,provided sufficient protection was afforded.walsh,at.that protection may take the form of undertakings,or enforceable conditions of return designed to mitigate the risk of harm occasioned by the child repatriation.see feder,at i n order to ameliorate any harm to the child,courts in the appropriate circumstances have made return contingent upon undertakings from the petitioning parent.baran beaty,d,the determination of whether any valid undertakings are possible in a particular case is inherently and the petitioner proffering the undertaking bears the burden of proof.danaipour,at,see also baran,d at w hether any valid undertakings are possible in a particular case is an issue on which the petitioner bears the burden of proof.citing danaipour,at.
many courts and commentators have advocated the use of undertakings in order to accommodate both the interest in the child welfare and the interests of the country of the child habitual residence.van de sande,at see also danaipour,at a potential grave risk of harm can,at times,be mitigated sufficiently by the acceptance of undertakings and sufficient guarantees of performance of those undertakings.silberman,fam,advocating the use of undertakings.the same courts,however,have viewed undertakings much more skeptically in cases involving an abusive spouse.see van de sande,at i n cases of abuse,the balance may shift against undertakings.danaipour,at where substantial allegations are made and a credible threat exists,a court should be particularly wary about using potentially unenforceable undertakings to try to protect the child.see also baran,d at declining to adopt undertakings where there was abundant,credible evidence before the court that petitioner is a violent and abusive man.a particular problem with in situations involving domestic the difficulty of their enforcement.see danaipour,at expressing serious concerns about whether undertakings or safe harbor orders that go beyond the conditions of return are enforceable in the home country merle weiner,international child abduction and the escape from domestic violence,fordham,t here is currently no remedy for the violation of an undertaking.contrary statements by some courts are simply wrong.paul beaumont peter mceleavy,the hague convention on international child abduction i f one of the article or exceptions is applicable the court should not exercise its discretion to return the child unless enforcement of the undertakings can be guaranteed.clearly,then,undertakings are not appropriate in all cases,and a court must recognize the limits on its authority and must focus on the particular situation of the child in question in order to determine if the undertakings will suffice to protect the child.danaipour,at.
the state department,whose comments are frequently cited in case law and are accord ed great weight,id.at,has offered guidance on the proper use of undertakings.see also blondin,at t he meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.the state department recommends that 
undertakings should be limited in scope and further the convention goal of ensuring the prompt return of the child to the jurisdiction of habitual residence,so that the jurisdiction can resolve the custody dispute.undertakings that do more than this would appear questionable under the convention,particularly when they address in great detail issues of custody,visitation,and maintenance.
danaipour,at citing letter from catherine brown,assistant legal adviser for consular affairs,united states dep t of state,to michael nicholls,lord chancellor dep t,child abduction unit,united kingdom,at.txt.the report goes on to assert,
if the court is presented with unequivocal evidence that return would cause the child a grave risk of physical or psychological harm,however,then it would seem less appropriate for the court to enter extensive undertakings than to deny the return request.the development of extensive undertakings in such a context could embroil the court in the merits of the underlying custody issues and would tend to dilute the force of the article b exception.
id.at.in examining this official guidance,courts have concluded that undertakings are most effective when the goal is to preserve the status quo of the parties prior to the wrongful removal.this,of course,is not the goal in cases where there is evidence that the status quo was abusive.van de sande,at quoting danaipour,at.
as the government of mexico pointed out in its amicus brief before this court,in considering whether a grave risk exists and whether any undertakings can ameliorate it,a court should primarily focus on the time period between repatriation and the determination of custody by the courts in the child homeland.we acknowledge that other circuits have stated that t he convention does not require that the risk be immediate,only that it be grave,walsh,at,and that u ndertakings that will protect the child from grave risk for only a very limited time are insufficient to defeat an article b claim,danaipour,at,but we do not believe that these statements should be interpreted as an invitation for a court to engage in an grave risk analysis.that is,an inquiry that focuses on too lengthy a period of time runs the risk of turning into a child best interests analysis,which is not the proper standard under the convention.see hague international child abduction convention text and legal analysis,noting that the article defense may not be used as a vehicle to litigate or relitigate the child best interests see also friedrich ii,at the exception for grave harm to the child is not license for a court in the country to speculate on where the child would be happiest.that decision is a custody matter,and reserved to the court in the country of habitual residence.
in considering these authorities,we believe that hague convention cases dealing with abusive situations can be placed into three broad categories.first,there are cases in which the abuse is relatively minor.in such cases it is unlikely that the risk of harm caused by return of the child will rise to the level of a grave risk or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation under article.in these cases,undertakings designed to protect the child are largely irrelevant since the article threshold has not been met,the court has no discretion to refuse to order return,with or without undertakings second,at the other end of the spectrum,there are cases in which the risk of harm is clearly grave,such as where there is credible evidence of sexual abuse,other similarly grave physical or psychological abuse,death threats,or serious neglect.see,van de sande,at walsh,at both rejecting undertakings in the face of such evidence.in these cases,undertakings will likely be insufficient to ameliorate the risk of harm,given the difficulty of enforcement and the likelihood that a serially abusive petitioner will not be deterred by a foreign court orders.consequently,unless the rendering court can satisfy itself that the children will in fact,and not just in legal theory,be protected if returned to their abuser custody,van de sande,at,the court should refuse to grant the petition.third,there are those cases that fall somewhere in the middle,where the abuse is substantially more than minor,but is less obviously intolerable.whether,in these cases,the return of the child would subject it to a grave risk of harm or otherwise place it in an intolerable situation is a inquiry that depends on careful consideration of several factors,including the nature and frequency of the abuse,the likelihood of its recurrence,and whether there are any enforceable undertakings that would sufficiently ameliorate the risk of harm to the child caused by its return.even in this middle category,undertakings should be adopted only where the court satisfies itself that the parties are likely to obey them.thus,undertakings would be particularly inappropriate,for example,in cases where the petitioner has a history of ignoring court orders.see walsh,at citing the petitioner history of violating court orders in concluding that undertakings would be insufficient to protect the children.where a grave risk of harm has been established,ordering return with feckless undertakings is worse than not ordering it at all.
we pause to note that,although the grave risk threshold is necessarily a high one,there is a danger of making the threshold so insurmountable that district courts will be unable to exercise any discretion in all but the most egregious cases of abuse.absent
