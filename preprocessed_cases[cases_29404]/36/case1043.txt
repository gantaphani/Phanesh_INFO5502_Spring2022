marilyn and,a minor,appeal judgments terminating parental rights to and his four siblings under welfare and institutions code section marilyn also appeals orders denying her petitions for modification under section,which joins.the judgments and orders are affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
marilyn is the mother of eight children.this appeal concerns five of the children,joanna,israel and eric collectively the children the children are now ten,seven,six,five and three years respectively.in may as a result of ongoing domestic violence between marilyn and a boyfriend,israel the children were adjudicated dependents of the juvenile court.and his older sister also reported that marilyn and israel hit them and the other children with hands,belts,hangers and a telephone cord.
at the disposition hearing,the court removed the children from marilyn custody and ordered a plan of family reunification services.marilyn case plan was focused on helping her understand the dynamics of domestic violence and its impact on her children,and to gain the stability and maturity necessary to provide a safe and secure home for her children.
the san diego county health and human services agency agency placed the five children in three foster care homes and provided services to meet their developmental and emotional needs.joanna and eric were placed in foster care for approximately six months and then moved to the home of a parental relative,where they remained.joanna had developmental delays and behavioral problems.eric,who was detained at birth,was happy,healthy and active.
was placed in foster care.in december due to behavioral problems,she was moved to another foster home with was assessed in the borderline range of mental development.she had significant language deficits and displayed severe tantrums and defiance.with continued therapy and services,behavior improved.
and israel had multiple placements,many of them together.between april and may,was in a relative placement,three foster homes,a group home and two temporary placements.israel was placed with a relative,and then in three foster homes.he also had two temporary placements.
who was six years old when he was removed from marilyn care,was upset about not being able to live with his mother.he had problems sleeping and cried frequently for long periods of time.was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder,recurrent.his behavior and school performance improved after he was treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.
israel was months old when he was detained.evaluators believed he was mildly mentally delayed.israel was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and unspecified disturbance of conduct.his behaviors included defiance,sexualized conduct,eating problems,tantrums and spreading feces.
marilyn was offered reunification services for months.at the time of the review hearing,marilyn was not attending individual therapy,had not participated in a psychological evaluation and was not visiting the children regularly.in january the court found that she made minimal progress with her case plan and terminated reunification services.
in may the agency requested a continuance of the section hearing to assess the children needs and to develop the most appropriate permanency plan for them.in september the agency identified adoption as the preferred plan.the court authorized psychological evaluations for,and joanna to assess factors that might affect the proposed adoptions evaluations for joanna and were completed in october.at the time of the section hearing in january,evaluation had not yet been scheduled.
rosa,diagnosed with depressive disorder,nos,adjustment disorder with anxiety and disorder,nos.opined that temper tantrums and aggression toward others were partly related to depression and anxiety.told the psychologist that her number one wish was to live with her mom.recommended a carefully transition plan to avert a rocky transition and an intensification of acting out behaviors.
elaine spencer,stated that joanna appeared to be a good candidate for adoption by parents who were able to meet her needs and understand her background.joanna was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed emotions and conduct,and tested below average in cognitive and intellectual functioning.spencer believed joanna current behavioral and emotional issues were related to the upcoming change in placement.
in november marilyn filed petitions for modification under section modification petitions seeking the children return to her care.the modification hearing was heard on november and december,and january.the court considered the evidence presented at the modification hearing at the section hearing,which took place on january and.
marilyn testified that she had stable housing with her boyfriend and their baby.she was working at a franchise.marilyn completed a domestic violence program in november and had attended three support group sessions.there was no domestic violence in her current relationship.marilyn believed the children behavioral problems were due to their placement in foster care,and the children would not have problems once they were returned to her care.marilyn stated that if she had to choose between living with his siblings or living with her,she would want to stay with siblings.
testified he wanted to return home.he did not want to be adopted with or without his siblings.said of marilyn,she the best mom i ever had.
social worker jessica parker opined that the risk to the children in marilyn care continued to be high.marilyn gave birth to her eighth child in june.she did not have stable housing during the reunification period and was currently dependent on others for her housing needs.the baby father was on probation for an assault with a firearm in related to gang activity and had a history of methamphetamine use.
parker believed marilyn loved the children but her role was that of an older sibling rather than a parent.marilyn was loving and affectionate with the children during visitation and provided clothes and shoes when she could.in view of the love and affection between marilyn and the children,parker did not find it easy to recommend adoption.however,returning the children to marilyn care was not a realistic option.no permanency plan other than adoption would allow the children to be raised together in a stable,secure home.
parker opined that the children were adoptable.they were making good progress and all but israel were on track academically.eric was a very active toddler and required constant supervision.israel had tantrums and developmental delays but otherwise was a healthy,socially engaging and likable child.joanna struggled to behave,but there were no obstacles to adoption.was a sociable,engaging child.although her behaviors were challenging,they had improved with structure.
although did not want to be adopted,parker believed his feelings about adoption would change once he had the opportunity to live in a stable,home with his siblings.had an affectionate relationship with marilyn and sought her approval for his projects.if adopted,would need therapy to ameliorate the grief and loss of losing his relationship with marilyn.he would also be grieved if his relationships with his siblings were severed.
parker testified the children had strong,affectionate sibling relationships.and israel had an incredibly special bond.when was with them,the three children held hands while they walked.the children enjoyed each other company and supported each other.joanna and eric were very close to each other and enjoyed their relationships with their siblings.
parker strongly believed the best outcome would be to keep the children together for adoption,but would consider separating the children into two groups if the agency was not able to find an adoptive home for the sibling group of five.she was aware of a family that was interested in adopting a sibling group of five children,and had talked to them in hypothetical terms about the children.the family did not have an approved foster or adoptive home study and had not been introduced to the children.
the court found that marilyn had made modest progress with services after reunification services were terminated,but her circumstances remained unstable.the court determined it was not in the children best interests to return to marilyn care and denied the modification petitions.
attorney,michael bradfield,asked the court to identify adoption as permanency plan and continue the hearing for days under section,subdivision c bradfield argued the evidence was not clear the agency would be able to place the five siblings in an adoptive home,and it was premature to assess whether it would be detrimental to to terminate parental rights under an alternative plan.in view of strong feelings against adoption,bradfield recommended the court continue the proceedings to allow to complete a psychological evaluation,meet any prospective adoptive family and participate in therapy.
the court found that although the case was complicated by the number,ages and individual interests of the children,it was likely they would be adopted within a reasonable time.the court had no doubt adoption was the best permanency plan for the younger children.in view of love for his mother,the court stated that foster care might arguably be an appropriate option were he an only child.however,relationships with his siblings were exceptionally strong,and adoption would promote to a greater extent than would placement in foster care or severing his relationships with his siblings.
the court found that no exceptions to termination of parental rights outweighed the benefits that adoption would provide the children,even if they had to be separated into two sibling groups.the court terminated parental rights.
appellate proceedings 
in august counsel for,joanna,israel and eric minors counsel informed this court that his clients and were placed with a prospective adoptive family on july.
on september,this court augmented the record to include reports and court orders filed or lodged after january.this court asked the parties to submit simultaneous letter briefs addressing the following 
did the trial court err by not proceeding under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c if so,may this court consider the supplemental transcript here to determine whether error,if any,was harmless has the portion of the appeal challenging adoptability been rendered moot by subsequent proceedings 
discussion 
iintroduction 
marilyn contends the court abused its discretion when it denied her modification petitions to return the children to her care.she asserts insufficient evidence supports the finding the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.marilyn also argues termination of parental rights is detrimental to the children under section,subdivision c a and c e.
contends insufficient evidence supports the finding he was likely to be adopted,with his siblings or separately,within a reasonable time.he argues the court should have granted his request to continue the permanency plan hearing under section,subdivision c.asserts he may become adoptable if placed in an approved adoptive home with his siblings.
the agency maintains the court properly denied marilyn modification petitions and contends marilyn has not met her burden on appeal to show that no substantial evidence supports the court findings under section,subdivision c.minors counsel joins the agency opening brief.
the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied marilyn petitions for modification under section 
marilyn asserts the court abused its discretion when it denied her modification petitions.she contends she proved changed circumstances and new evidence that demonstrated the children return to her care was in their best interests.marilyn argues she satisfied all the conditions the agency imposed she severed her relationship with the perpetrator of domestic violence,completed a domestic violence program,was in a stable relationship with the father of her baby,visited the children regularly and had resumed therapy.marilyn also asserts she had appropriate housing and an adequate income for herself and the children,and her children longed to be with her.
the agency contends marilyn had not made substantive changes and therefore did not show a genuine change of circumstances.in re aaliyah th,d.it asserts the evidence shows that marilyn did not complete her case plan and lacked the maturity and insight to provide a stable home for her children and to meet their emotional,behavioral and developmental needs.
under section,a parent,interested person or the dependent child generically,petitioner may petition the court to change,modify or set aside a previous order on the grounds of changed circumstances or new evidence,subd.a.the petitioner has the burden to show a change of circumstances or new evidence and the proposed modification is in the child best interests.in re jasmon cal th,d.generally,the petitioner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the child welfare requires the modification sought.cal.rules of court,rule f.
we review the grant or denial of a petition for modification under section for an abuse of discretion.in re shirley th,d in re casey th,d.while the abuse of discretion standard gives the trial court substantial latitude,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.citation.city of sacramento drew d.
in evaluating whether the petitioner has met his or her burden to show changed circumstances,the trial court should consider the seriousness of the problem which led to the dependency,and the reason for any continuation of that problem the strength of relative bonds between the dependent children to both parent and caretakers and the degree to which the problem may be easily removed or ameliorated,and the degree to which it actually has been.in re kimberly th,d while this list is not meant to be exhaustive,it does provide a reasoned and principled basis on which to evaluate a section motion.
here,the children were removed from marilyn custody because of their exposure to domestic violence and physical abuse.the case continued because marilyn did not complete her case plan,relied on others for housing and support and was not able to place her children needs first.she stopped attending therapy in september,which was a prerequisite to participating in conjoint counseling with the children and understanding their needs.marilyn did not visit the children when she became upset with the social worker and caregivers.
social worker parker opined that the risk to the children in marilyn care continued to be high.after several years of services,marilyn did not understand the impact that her inability to provide structure,stability and consistency had on the children.during visits,marilyn was unable to consistently discipline and control the children.parker did not believe marilyn had the ability to meet the children emotional,behavioral and developmental needs.
marilyn did not complete a psychological evaluation until the court terminated reunification services and set a section hearing.the evaluating psychologist reported that marilyn home had been one of transience and instability both financially and emotionally.marilyn was dependent on others.in the past,she was pathologically dependent on a man who had battered her.while in her care,the children received very poor structure and parenting and were not protected from violence and physical abuse.marilyn did not see the connection between the conditions in her home and the children problematic behaviors.
the psychologist concluded that marilyn goal of caring for the children was unrealistic in view of her lack of responsibility and independence,and her limited means to care for the children.further,marilyn passivity and dependency presented a risk of exposure to the children of domestic violence or physical or sexual abuse from others.
marilyn did not inform the psychologist that she was five months pregnant at the time of the evaluation or that the baby father was then incarcerated for assault with a firearm and had a recent history of methamphetamine use.thus,the court could conclude that the predictive risks noted by the psychologist in marilyn evaluation were present in her life and presented a serious,current risk to the children safety and.
the court reasonably determined marilyn circumstances were not sufficiently changed to permit the safe return of the children to her care.despite offered services,marilyn did not show she was able to offer the children a structured,secure and protective environment free from the risk of abuse and neglect.she did not understand the difficulty in caring and providing for children who had significant and varied emotional,behavioral and developmental needs.in re dakota th,d.marilyn was dependent for support on a person with a history of violence and substance abuse.thus,the problem that initially brought the children within the dependency system had not been removed or ameliorated.in re kimberly,supra,th at,d.
in view of the children needs and marilyn current circumstances,the court reasonably found that it was not in the children best interests to be returned to marilyn care.we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied marilyn petitions to return the children to her care.
section,subdivision c introduction 
marilyn contends the court finding the children were likely to be adopted within a reasonable time adoptability finding is not supported by substantial evidence.she argues the children are strongly bonded to each other and need to retain their sibling ties,thus the size of the sibling group and the children emotional,developmental and behavioral problems belie a finding that they are specifically or generally adoptable.marilyn further contends substantial evidence does not support a finding that was adoptable because he consistently and adamantly opposed adoption.
argues the court finding that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to him was premised on the condition that he would be adopted with his siblings.contends the court erred when it terminated parental rights in the absence of clear and convincing evidence the agency would be able to meet this condition.he argues the children proposed adoptive placement with a family not yet screened for factors required in the assessment report under section,subdivision b does not constitute substantial evidence that,as a member of a bonded sibling group,would be adopted within a reasonable time.in re th,d.also asserts he was not generally adoptable in view of his unequivocal opposition to losing his relationship with his mother.
the agency argues the children are generally and specifically adoptable based on the number of families interested in adopting the children individually and in groups and the existence of a family interested in adopting all five children.
statutory framework 
at a section hearing,the court may terminate parental rights and free the child for adoption,identify adoption as the permanency plan goal and continue the hearing for no more than days to locate an appropriate adoptive home for the child,appoint a legal guardian,or order the child placement in foster care,subd.b.at all proceedings under section,the court must consider the wishes of the child and act in the best interests of the child,subd.h.
to select adoption as the permanency plan,the court must find by clear and convincing evidence the child is likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.the fact that the child is not yet placed with a family prepared to adopt the child,shall not constitute a basis for the court to conclude that it is not likely the child will be adopted,subd.c.if the court finds that the child is likely to be adopted,it must order adoption unless termination of parental rights would cause serious detriment to a child under one or more specific statutory exceptions.in re autumn th,d.
adoptability 
a finding of adoptability requires clear and convincing evidence of the likelihood that adoption will be realized within a reasonable time.in re zeth cal th,d,zeth.the question of adoptability usually focuses on whether the child age,physical condition and emotional health make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt that child.in re sarah th,d.
if the child is considered generally adoptable,we do not examine the suitability of the prospective adoptive home.in re scott th,d.when the child is deemed adoptable based solely on a particular family willingness to adopt the child,the trial court must determine whether there is a legal impediment to adoption.in re carl th,d.the juvenile court should also explore a child feelings toward his or her parents,foster parents and prospective adoptive family.in re amanda th,d in re christopher th,d see,subd.h.
on review,we determine whether the record contains substantial evidence from which the court could find clear and convincing evidence that the child was likely to be adopted within a reasonable time.in re gregory th,d see also zeth,supra,cal th at,d.the evidence must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.in re jerome th,d.we give the court adoptability finding the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolve any evidentiary conflicts in favor of the judgment of the trial court.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.
here,social worker parker opined that the children were adoptable.although,joanne and israel had problems,they had made progress.parker acknowledged and wanted to return to marilyn care,and would require a long therapeutic process before he would accept adoption.because of his opposition,the agency would take a transition more slowly.in discussing need for a carefully structured transition,parker stated,the transition period is going to be very big in this case in making sure we are not moving too quickly.
parker strongly believed the children should be placed for adoption as a sibling group of five,and stated,i am passionate about doing everything in my power as a social worker to place the kids together.parker testified if the agency could not find an adoptive home for the sibling group of five,it would place eric and joanne in one adoptive home,and,and israel in another.
in the general database of families interested in adopting a child or a sibling group,parker found seven families that had expressed interest in adopting a child with characteristics,families interested in a child like,in a child like joanna,in a child like israel and in a child with eric characteristics.eight or nine families were interested in adopting a sibling pair like and israel,and the same number had expressed an interest in a adopting a sibling pair like joanna and eric.parker also found on the database five approved families that were interested in adopting a sibling group like the children.
we are not persuaded by the agency argument that the number of families interested in adopting the children individually and in groups supports a finding the children are generally and specifically adoptable.see,in re asia th,d children emotional and psychological development present a potential obstacle to adoption and required a specialized placement in re amelia d.reports indicating a few families were considering adoption does not constitute clear and convincing evidence to establish the likelihood of adoption in re brian th,d a social worker conclusion alone is insufficient to support an adoptability finding.
parker was not considering homes that only wanted a single child.she acknowledged that it would not be easy to find a suitable adoptive home for the sibling group.parker testified if the agency efforts to place the children together were not successful,then the agency would separate the children into two groups after it had exhausted placement possibilities for the adoption of the five children as a sibling group.we note there is no evidence in the record to support a finding that,and israel were likely to be adopted as a sibling group within a reasonable time.
the agency contends the presence of one family that had expressed an interest in adopting a sibling group constitutes substantial evidence of the children adoptability.we are not persuaded by this contention.the record shows the family did not have a foster care license or an approved adoptive home study.because of their status,parker could not provide specific information to the family about the children and spoke to them in hypotheticals about more extreme behaviors.parker hoped the family would be approved for foster care licensing in february,but declined to speculate on when the family adoptive home study would be completed.
although the foster care and adoptive home studies for the family were in progress,we believe the absence of a foster care license or a preliminary assessment constitutes a legal impediment to adoption it prevents a social worker from providing information about the children to the family,facilitating contact between the children and the family and placing the children in a preadoptive placement with the family.thus,here,there was a legal impediment to adoption by the only family that had expressed a specific interest in adopting the children at the time of the section hearing.in re carl,supra,th at,d.
in addition,this is not a case in which the children had any previous relationship with a family interested in adopting them.the record shows that once an approved prospective adoptive parent was identified,the transition process would be lengthy,especially with respect to and parker voiced concern about proceeding too quickly for and opined that adoption would require a long therapeutic process.therapy was discontinued in august due to a change in placement and had not been rescheduled.psychological evaluation,authorized by the court in september,had not been scheduled at the time of the section hearing.thus,the record does not indicate the therapeutic issues would be resolved,or that a transition to an approved adoptive placement would be completed,within a reasonable time.
beneficial relationship exception 
marilyn asserts the court erred when it determined the beneficial relationship exception under section,subdivision c a did not apply to preclude termination of parental rights.she contends she maintained consistent and regular visitation with the children and had strong and close relationships with the children,particularly with,and joanna.
section,subdivision c a provides an exception to termination of parental rights when t he parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.we recognize that interaction between parent and child will usually confer some incidental benefit to the child.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.to overcome the statutory preference for adoption,the parent must prove he or she occupies a parental role in the child life resulting in a significant,positive emotional attachment of the child to the parent.in re derek th,d in re elizabeth th,d.
when applying the beneficial relationship exception,the court balances the strength and quality of the relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and sense of belonging that a stable family would confer on the child.if severing the existing parental relationship would deprive the child of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed,the preference for adoption is overcome and the natural parent rights are not terminated.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.
we determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the court ruling by reviewing the evidence most favorably to the prevailing party and indulging in all legitimate and reasonable inferences to uphold the court ruling.in re misako th,d.the reviewing court must affirm a trial court rejection of these exceptions if the ruling is supported by substantial evidence.in re autumn,supra,th at,d in re zachary th,d.
marilyn does not meet her burden on appeal to show there is insufficient evidence to support the court determination that the relationship was outweighed by the security and sense that adoption would confer on each child.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.when the children were in marilyn care,they were subjected to physical abuse and exposed to domestic violence.israel and eric were less than two years old when removed from her care,and joanna had just turned three.they spent a significant portion of their lives with other caregivers.although and lived with marilyn for a substantial period of their lives and wanted to return to her care,parker believed they were seeking a protective,nurturing parent who would be able to provide the security of a safe and stable home and were too young to realize that marilyn could not meet their needs.
parker opined marilyn was more like an older sibling to her children than a parent.marilyn therapist reported that marilyn was immature in her parenting skills.examples of marilyn immaturity included having men in her home during the children unsupervised visits,not visiting the children because she was upset with the social worker and caregivers,lying to and the social worker about the birth of her youngest child and becoming dependent on a man who had a criminal and substance abuse history.
the children had emotional,developmental and behavioral needs that required stability,consistency and structure.after several years of services,marilyn did not understand the impact of her lack of consistent parenting on the children and her inability to meet their special needs.in re dakota,supra,th at,d.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the court finding that the security of a permanent home with committed,capable and loving adoptive parents outweighed the children interest in continuing their relationships with marilyn.in re autumn,supra,th at,d.
sibling relationship exception 
marilyn contends the court erred when it did not apply the sibling relationship exception under section,subdivision c e.she argues the agency plan to find an adoptive home for the sibling group was speculative,and therefore the court could not have properly found the exception did not apply.
the agency maintains substantial evidence supports a finding that adoption would not substantially interfere with the siblings relationships under the alternative plans approved by the court and,to the extent it did,the children individual interests in adoption outweighed their interests in maintaining their sibling relationships.
an exception to termination of parental rights exists when termination of parental rights would cause substantial interference with a child sibling relationship,taking into consideration the nature and extent of the relationship,subd.c e.here,the record leaves no doubt the nature and extent of the children sibling relationships were strong and important,and the parties and the court believed that maintaining the sibling relationships were crucial.
the sibling relationships were the basic foundation of the proposed permanency plan.parker was passionate about doing everything within her power to keep the children together.marilyn believed relationships with his siblings were more important than was his relationship with her.the court found that what ties everything together then is the connection between the siblings and how important it is.these kids know each other and love each other.
in view of our previous discussion about the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding the children were likely to be adopted as a sibling group,we agree with marilyn assertion the determination of the sibling relationship exception was premature.this court has previously held that where there are tentative alternative plans for adoption and one plan may substantially interfere with the sibling relationship,the better approach is to continue the hearing until the uncertainty has been resolved.in re salvador th,d.however,as we discuss post at pages,the postjudgment evidence shows the children have been placed together in an adoptive home therefore the contention that termination of parental rights would cause substantial interference with the sibling relationships has been rendered moot by subsequent proceedings.ibid.
