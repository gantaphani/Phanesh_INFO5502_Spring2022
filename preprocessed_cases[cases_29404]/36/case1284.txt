appellant james,the stepfather of angela,appeals from the juvenile court order denying his motion for presumed father status.because we find that the conclusive presumption of the biological father paternity under family code section should not preclude consideration of appellant motion for presumed father status under section,subdivision d under the circumstances presented here,we reverse the juvenile court order and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
minor angela,born in october,is the biological child of angela mother and dario,who were married and living together at the time of her birth.dario is named on angela birth certificate as her father.mother and dario separated when angela was a year and a half and divorced when she was two.following the separation,dario kept bothering mother,and she sent angela to live with relatives in venezuela for a few months when angela was approximately two and a half.while angela was away,mother met appellant and the three have lived together since angela was three years old.mother and appellant married when angela was five.
according to mother,angela knew that dario was her biological father,but this was never discussed in the family.angela,on the other hand,thought that appellant was her biological father until these dependency proceedings commenced.for the past years,angela has lived with mother and appellant in a family unit.angela calls appellant dad,and uses his last name.appellant stated that when he first met angela,it was a real blessing to have her as a daughter,that she was a treasure growing up and a daddy girl who helped him around the house.
according to appellant and mother,they began to have trouble with angela after she entered high school and became more rebellious.mother discovered that angela was missing from her bed one night and called the police.angela claimed that she was out looking for her cat.a few weeks later,mother discovered letters in angela backpack suggesting that she had been sneaking out of the house to see boys.mother and appellant became very upset and appellant,with mother encouragement,grabbed angela by her neck,banged her head against a wall,punched her in the eye,and kicked her on the ground.after angela reported the incident at school,mother and appellant were arrested and angela was detained in foster care by the los angeles county department of children and family services department.the department then filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section against mother and appellant,who was identified as angela father.
appellant subsequently admitted that he was not angela biological father and that he had not adopted her.angela had had no contact with her biological father since she was approximately two years old,but when he received notice of the dependency hearings,he called mother to express concern about angela and said that he would like to try to build a relationship with angela.after mother gave him the phone number for angela foster home,dario called angela,who tearfully reported to her foster mother that dario had threatened to kidnap her.angela reported that she told dario she did not want to talk to him again,and she informed the social worker that she does not know dario and does not wish to reside with a virtual stranger.although he was given notice of the dependency proceedings,dario has never appeared.
shortly thereafter,appellant filed a motion seeking presumed father status de facto parent status,which mother joined.although appellant did not specify the statutory provision upon which his motion was based,it is apparent that the motion was based on the facts that he had received angela into his home and openly held her out as his own child,and thus came within the provisions of section,subdivision d.nonetheless,in an unsigned declaration attached to the motion,appellant requested only that he be granted de facto status.the department had no objection to appellant proceeding as a de facto parent but opposed the request for presumed father status on the ground that dario was conclusively presumed to be angela father under section because he was married to and cohabiting with mother when angela was born.at the hearing on the motion,angela counsel stated that she did not believe there was any legal basis for granting appellant presumed father status.the court agreed and,without making any factual findings,denied the request for presumed father status.the court deferred determination of the issue of de facto status until the disposition hearing,finding appellant to be a prospective de facto parent awaiting disposition.in the meantime,over the department objection,the court allowed appellant to participate in the proceedings because allegations were pending against him in the petition and denied the department request for a stay on the issue of whether appellant had standing to participate.
one day after the court ruling,the department filed an amended petition adding an allegation against dario,whom it identified as angela father,for his failure to support her since the age of one and a half,and identifying appellant as angela stepfather.
the department then filed a petition for rehearing challenging appellant standing to participate in the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings,which the court denied.thereafter,the department filed a petition for extraordinary writ with the appellate court and sought an immediate stay of the juvenile court prior order setting the matter for adjudication on the ground that appellant had no standing to participate.a stay was granted to allow the juvenile court to determine whether appellant qualified as a de facto parent.the court subsequently granted appellant de facto parent status pursuant to the department stipulation.
the court conducted a combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing and sustained the allegations in the amended petition pertaining to physical abuse of angela by mother and appellant and their failure to protect her,and dario failure to provide support to angela.the court declared angela to be a dependent child and ordered that she remain in the care and custody of the department.the court also ordered that reunification services be provided to mother and appellant in the form of parent education,conjoint counseling with angela when appropriate,and individual counseling to address the case issues,including anger management.both mother and appellant were allowed monitored visits with angela.the court noted that both mother and appellant were in compliance with the case plan and appellant counsel represented that appellant had nearly completed his parent education.the court denied reunification services for dario.appellant filed a notice of appeal on september,from the denial of his motion for presumed father status 
discussion 
appellant contends the juvenile court erred in denying his request for presumed father status because the policies underlying the conclusive presumption of dario paternity under section would not be advanced by application of the presumption under the factual circumstances here.he argues that while both he and dario qualify as presumed fathers under section,appellant status is grounded on stronger considerations of policy and logic.
in dependency proceedings,fathers are divided into four categories de facto fathers,alleged fathers,natural fathers and presumed fathers.a man,such as a stepfather,who has assumed the role of parent is a de facto father.a man who may be the father of the dependent child but has not been established to be the natural or presumed father is an alleged father.a man who has been established to be the biological father is a natural father.a man who has held the child out as his own and received the child into his home is a presumed father.a natural father can be,but is not necessarily,a presumed father and a presumed father can be,but is not necessarily,a natural father.in re jerry th,d,fns.omitted.the extent to which a father may participate in dependency proceedings and his rights in those proceedings are dependent on his paternal status.in re christopher th,d.presumed father status ranks highest.in r
