the domestic violence prevention act,family code section et dvpa authorizes the trial court to make an ex parte order determining the temporary custody and visitation of a minor child,subd.a,provided the party seeking the temporary order has established a relationship by one of the means specified in the dvpa,which includes proof the party gave birth to the child,subd.a b i.section,in turn,authorizes the court,after notice to the party to be restrained and a hearing,to issue any of the orders described in sections through and directs the court,when determining whether to do so,to consider whether failure to make any of these orders may jeopardize the safety of the petitioner and the children for whom the custody or visitation orders are sought,subd.a.
at the request of maria elena gonzalez,the trial court in this case granted ex parte a temporary restraining order to protect gonzalez and her daughter from maurelio francisco munoz,issued personal conduct and orders and granted temporary physical and legal custody of the child to gonzalez with no visitation to munoz until the next court hearing.following notice to munoz and a hearing,the court extended for a period of one year the personal conduct and restraining orders.apparently concerned by section,subdivision b,which prohibits the court from making a paternity determination in a dvpa proceeding and provides dvpa orders are without prejudice in any other action brought to establish a parent and child relationship,and notwithstanding the express language in section,the court concluded it lacked the authority to also extend its temporary child custody order.
according to gonzalez counsel and the amici curiae who have filed a brief on her behalf,the trial court decision to decline to issue custody and visitation orders following a hearing in this case was not an isolated event,but rather represents a common misunderstanding by bench officers handling dvpa proceedings in the los angeles superior court.as a result,although subsequent proceedings have mooted the custody and visitation questions in this case,because of the significant public issue involved,capable of repetition yet evading review,we consider the appeal,explain the nature and scope of the authority of the trial court to issue custody and visitation orders in dvpa cases and reverse the order to the extent the court declined to exercise its discretion to award custody to gonzalez.
factual and procedural background 
on january,gonzalez filed a request in propria persona under the dvpa for a temporary restraining order against munoz,whom she identified as the father of her daughter,flor.on the form required to initiate this proceeding,gonzalez checked a box indicating she and munoz used to live together but did not check either of the boxes used to indicate she and munoz are now or used to be married.she also checked boxes requesting personal conduct orders barring him from harassing and contacting her and a order requiring him to stay at least yards away from gonzalez herself,her daughter,her home,job and workplace and her daughter school or childcare.finally,she checked boxes asking the court to order child custody,visitation,child support and spousal support,even though the last item is expressly restricted to marital or registered domestic partner relationships.to document her entitlement to the requested orders,she attached a page stating in part,munoz has been violent throughout the relationship.he has hit me with his fists in the face,splitting my lip open and breaking my nose.he has strangled me forcefully so that i could not breathe.he has been arrested for domestic violence in august of and again in april of.in may of he burned my hand with hot grease and hit my year old daughter yesterday he showed up at my house and told me he was taking my daughter.i told him he could not take her and he became furious and started trying to strangle me again.i had my daughter in my arm and i was able to get away from him.i was terrified and my daughter was screaming.then he said to me i going to fuck you up good i called the police and they came but he had already left.as a result of this conduct,gonzalez stated she was terrified that he will hurt me again h e has never cared for our daughter alone and is an alcoholic and i know my daughter is not safe with him.
the bench officer granted gonzalez request for a temporary restraining order,including the personal conduct and orders she sought,as well as an order granting her sole legal and physical custody of flor and directing that munoz have no visitation until the next court hearing.the court set a hearing on a permanent up to five years order for january.
munoz was served with the temporary restraining order on january.on january,he filed an answer in propria persona agreeing to the order but refusing to agree to the personal conduct or child custody and visitation orders.although he checked a box indicating he is not the parent of flor and objected to any order requiring him to pay child support,he asked for reasonable visitation on weekends.
both gonzalez and munoz appeared at the january,hearing in propria persona and spoke to the court through an interpreter.the court began the hearing by informing the parties it could make some temporary orders under certain circumstances regarding custody and visitation but was forbidden from making a judgment of paternity.what that means is that i can not make a legal ruling or a legal finding that you are in fact the parents of this child.in order for you to legally establish that you are the parents of this child,it will be necessary for you to file a separate civil lawsuit,which we refer to as a paternity case that is the legal method that is used for folks who are in your situation who are not legally married to each other,but have a child together.the court then asked gonzalez if she had filed a paternity case.obviously confused by the question,gonzalez initially asked if the court meant t he one right now the bench officer asked her again whether she had filed a separate petition to establish the relationship,to which gonzalez answered,what would that be the bench officer explained again he was speaking of a separate lawsuit to establish that you are the mother and that munoz is the father of this particular child and renewed his question.this time,gonzalez answered,not right now.when munoz also confirmed he had not filed a paternity suit,the court stated,i would certainly recommend to you both that you do so,because once you legally establish that you are the parents of this child,then for all time your child will be able to receive benefits from you and to inherit from you i think it would benefit your child,and i think it would make life easier for you as well.
having offered this advice,the court turned to the restraining orders.munoz agreed to stay away from gonzalez and not to harass or otherwise bother her.the court then asked gonzalez if she believed this agreement would be sufficient to protect her,to which gonzalez replied,yes.the court agreed to keep the order in effect for a year,which he said ought to give each of you ample opportunity to file your paternity case to discuss the issues of custody,visitation and support,all the while making sure everybody stays safe.as the hearing concluded,gonzalez asked the court about child support,plainly not having understood the significance of the court discussion about a paternity proceeding.the court explained once more she needed to file a paternity action to obtain child support,and the hearing adjourned.the restraining order issued by the court included the personal conduct and orders discussed,but did not name flor as a person protected by the order,as had the temporary restraining order,and did not address custody or visitation.
on february,gonzalez filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court,which was denied,and on march,a notice of appeal.soon thereafter,munoz sought issuance of an order to show cause for custody and visitation in an action brought against him by the county of los angeles for child support.a hearing on the order to show cause was held on april,at which c
