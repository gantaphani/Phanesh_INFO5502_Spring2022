defendant and appellant mother appeals from a juvenile court order entered at a welfare and institutions code section permanent plan hearing.the juvenile court ordered visits between mother and her daughter,to be determined by the legal guardians.under our interpretation of section,subdivision c,and the constitutional prohibition against delegating judicial duties,the juvenile court could not delegate to the legal guardians the decision whether visits would occur or the complete discretion to determine the time,place,and manner of any visits.accordingly,we reverse the visitation order.
factual background 
and her brother were detained pursuant to a petition filed in november by the department of children and family services the department over approximately the next two years,mother,who suffered from a psychiatric disorder,did not maintain the visitation schedule ordered by the juvenile court.mother reportedly verbally abused,and foster mother said that the less sees her mother the better off is.
the juvenile court terminated family reunification services for mother on july.at the november,section hearing,the juvenile court did not terminate mother parental rights.it established a permanent plan by which the juvenile court appointed legal guardians for counsel requested that visitation with her mother be left up to and the legal guardian.
the juvenile court minute order stated,visitation between mother and to be determined by the legal guardians.a contemporaneous written order stated that v isitation between the child and mother s hall be may have visitation with her mother as deemed by the legal guardian to be in her best interest.there was no objection to the visitation order.although mother was present in the courthouse,she failed to appear when called,and mother counsel did not assert any objection.guardians signed a form acknowledgment of power and duties of legal guardian juvenile that stated they would make all decisions concerning parental visits with the minor including promoting or limiting such visitation according to the best interests of the minor or as ordered by the court.
on appeal,mother contends that the juvenile court visitation order fails to comply with section,subdivision c,because that subdivision specifies that a court must make a visitation order when it selects a permanent plan of legal guardianship unless visitation would be detrimental to the child physical or emotional.
discussion 
this court may consider the issues raised on appeal.
the issues mother raises on appeal concern the interpretation and application of statutory and constitutional issues of law.we may address such issues notwithstanding the mother failure to object below.the rule is generally not applied when the alleged error involves a pure question of law,which can be resolved on appeal without reference to a record developed below.people williams th,d.an appellant may be permitted to change his theory when a question of law alone is presented on the facts appearing in the record.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
in addition,r eviewing courts have traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence.people welch cal th,d.at the time of the section hearing,division three of this court had issued its opinion in in re jasmine th,d jasmine,holding that the juvenile court does not have to make a visitation order when a child has been placed in a guardianship.mother counsel may have relied on that which we not objecting to the juvenile court order regarding visitation.
finally,a ppellate courts are more inclined to consider such tardily raised legal issues where the public interest or public policy is involved.bayside timber board of supervisors d.in this case,a determination of visitation rights with respect to dependent children involves such a public interest and public policy.for these reasons,we consider the legal issues mother raises.
section,subdivision c,requires a juvenile court to make a visitation order when the permanent plan is legal guardianship.
the juvenile court ordered a permanent plan of legal guardianship,and,therefore,section,subdivision c,required the court to make either an order for visitation or a finding that visitation would be detrimental to the child.the juvenile court did not comply with that subdivision.
section requires a juvenile court to choose a permanent plan of adoption,legal guardianship,or foster care for a child.if adoption is likely,parental rights shall be terminated,subd.c.but if a parent has maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship,the juvenile court will not terminate parental rights and shall order a plan of either legal guardianship or foster care,subd.c a.as noted,the court of appeal in jasmine,supra,th at page,d,held that if the juvenile court selects legal guardianship as a permanent plan,the court need not make a visitation order.
interpreting section,subdivision c the court of appeal in jasmine held that the juvenile court must make a visitation order only if the child is placed in foster care.the court of appeal interpreted the last sentence of subdivision c requiring the juvenile court to determine visitation as applying only to foster care referred to in the preceding sentence.the court of appeal said that the reference in the last sentence to visitation with the parents or guardians supported its interpretation of the visitation provision because the statute would not require a juvenile court to order visitation with a guardian when the child is already in a guardian custody.the court of appeal reasoned that the visitation provision only applies when a child is in the custody of foster parents and the child would,in that situation,visit with the parents or guardians.
we disagree with the jasmine court interpretation of section,subdivision c.subdivision c requires a court to make two orders.the subdivision initial sentence requires a court to determine whether the child should be placed in either foster care or legal guardianship.there is no other provision for an order until the section last sentence requiring a court to make an additional order for visitation.that sentence provides the court shall also make an order for visitation with the parents or guardians unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child,subd.c,italics added.this second order required by the statute is not dependent on whether the child is placed in foster care or in legal guardianship.the order must be made in both circumstances.in re randalynne th,d,fn.randalynne disagreeing with the jasmine court interpretation of subdivision c see also cal.rules of court,rules d,d.the reference to visitation with parent or guardian in the last sentence of subdivision c acknowledges that a child can be removed from a parent or from a guardian see,subd.a,and that it may be desirable that the guardian from whom a child was removed be entitled to visitation with that child placed with another guardian.
to find that an order of visitation must be made only when a child has been placed in foster care would render meaningless the showing a parent might make under subdivision c a namely,a showing that the parent or guardian visited the child regularly and that the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.under the result in jasmine,a court could find,under subdivision c a,that parental rights should not be terminated because the parent has maintained regular visits,the continuance of which would benefit the child but,then,the court could refuse to order visits because the child has been placed in a legal the court conclusion that visits would be beneficial to the child.
there is no apparent reason why visitation would be ordered when a child is placed in foster care,but not when a child is placed with a legal guardian.continuing contact with a child former caretaker,whether parent or guardian,may be as beneficial to a child placed with a legal guardian as it is to a child placed in foster care.thus,section,subdivision c,imposes a duty on a court to make an order for visitation in cases in which a minor has been placed in either foster care or legal guardianship,unless the court finds that visitation would be detrimental to the child physical or emotional.the juvenile court order here did not comply with that duty.
the juvenile court order was not a proper visitation order because the juvenile court delegated to legal guardians its duty to determine visitation rights of parents or guardians.
the juvenile court order that visitation between mother and to be determined by the legal guardians improperly delegated to legal guardians both the decisions of whether visits would take place and,if so,the time,place,and manner of visits.randalynne,supra,th,d.
the california constitution prohibits delegation of judicial duties other than subordinate ones.cal,art.vi,in re donnovan th,d.d elegations to private persons to control visitations have not generally been upheld because such persons are not as accountable to the court as a child protective services agency and they lack the government imprimatur that tends to validate administration of a visitation order by the department.randalynne,su pra,th at,d in re donnovan,supra,th at,d court improperly delegated full discretion to therapist regarding father visitation in re danielle,supra,d at.proper to delegate control over administration of the details of visitation to the department.
thus,a juvenile court must decide whether visitation will occur.randalynne,supra,th,d in re jennifer d.there is no question but that the power to regulate visitation between dependent children citation and their parents rests in the judiciary in re danielle d.order granting the department the complete and total discretion to determine whether or not visitation occurs would be invalid.a juvenile court does not fulfill its duty of determining whether visitation will occur when it orders that visitation shall be as directed by the legal guardian s.randalynne,supra,th at,d in re jennifer,supra,d at.order stating that visitation with parents be under the direction of the department social services was improper because order did not specify whether parents had visitation rights or,if so,frequency and length of visits in re moriah th,d order that did not give child protective services power to determine whether visits occurred was proper,although juvenile court may delegate to social worker responsibility to manage details of visitation.
the juvenile court here did not decide whether visits with mother would occur.instead,the juvenile court written orders state that visits shall be as deemed by the legal guardians in her best interest and are to be determined by the legal guardians.at the section hearing,counsel said she was just asking for,visitation with her mother be left up to and the legal guardian,to which the juvenile court responded,okay.the legal guardians acknowledged they would make all decisions concerning parental visits with the minor including promoting or limiting such visitation according to the best interests of the minor or as ordered by the court.
the juvenile court order thus improperly gave total discretion to legal guardians to decide whether there were to be visits and to control the time,place,and manner of visits,if any.it is the juvenile court that must decide whether there is to be visitation with a dependent child.the last sentence of section,subdivision c,specifies that the juvenile court shall also make an order for visitation.italics added.it does not say an order regarding or concerning visitation.because the juvenile court is required to order visitation unless it finds that visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child,subd.c,the responsibility for visitation can not be assigned to guardians who could eliminate or undermine any visitation.some may believe that giving a guardian total control over visitation would be beneficial.the legislature did not.instead,the legislature determined that in the absence of a showing of detriment to the child,such visitation by a parent or prior guardian is desirable.we may not disregard this legislative determination.
the legislature conclusion is justified because delegating total discretion to legal guardians to determine all aspects of visitation,including the time,place,and manner of visitation,is the equivalent of making no visitation order and can result in the elimination of any visitation.legal guardians often have positions and interests adverse to the parent from whom the child has been removed,a situation that existed here.the department noted that legal guardians had not always cooperated with the visitation plan.by setting no parameters on the legal guardians discretion to control visitation between and her mother,the legal guardians could decide that no visits were in best interests.in re jennifer,supra,d at.it certainly would be improper to permit an adversary to adjudicate the rights of a parent citation.thus,the legal guardians,and not the juvenile court,would be making the determination required by section,subdivision c,as to whether visitation will or will not occur.
although it was improper for the juvenile court to issue an order permitting the legal guardians to determine whether or not visitation would occur and in what manner it would occur,we do not suggest that legal guardians can play no role in deciding the time,place,and manner of visitation.rather,we hold only that discretion to make those determinations may not be left entirely to legal guardians.on remand,if the juvenile court does not find that visitation with mother would be detrimental to physical or emotional,then it is to make an order for visitation,including some guidance on the time,place,and manner of visitation.
because the juvenile court made the visitation order approximately ten months ago and circumstances may have changed in the interim,the court should consider mother and current circumstances in crafting any new visitation order.
disposition 
the juvenile court visitation order is reversed,and this matter is remanded to the juvenile court to make a visitation order unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child.if the juvenile court orders visitation,then it shall give guidance as to the time,place,and manner of visits.
i respectfully dissent from the reversal of the visitation order on the ground that welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c prohibits a dependency court judge from allowing a guardian to determine the extent of visitation of a dependent child with a biological parent.first,the question as to whether the issue of visitation should be left up to the guardians,raised for the first time on appeal,has been waived.both the guardians testified at the welfare and institutions code section hearing where the guardianship permanent plan was selected.both guardians testified they understood that they would make decisions including promoting or limiting visitation as was in the child best interests.no concerning the visitation issue was conducted by the mother counsel.the mother counsel interposed no objection to that portion of the examination of the guardians concerning their responsibility to control visitation.after the examination was completed,the child counsel asked that visitation be left up to the guardians.again,the mother counsel interposed no objection.the trial court ordered that the guardians determine the timing of visitation.for a third time when the subject was raised at the selection and implementation hearing,the mother counsel did not object.
under these circumstances,any objections to the trial court visitation order have been waived.the california supreme court has held an appellate court will ordinarily not consider procedural defects or erroneous rulings,in connection with relief sought or defenses asserted,where an objection could have been but was not presented to the trial court by some appropriate method the circumstances may involve such intentional acts or acquiescence as to be appropriately classified under the headings of estoppel or waiver often,however,the explanation is simply that it is unfair to the trial judge and to the adverse party to take advantage of an error on appeal when it could easily have been corrected at the trial.citation.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d,fn,original italics accord,people saunders cal th,d,citing united states olano,d no procedural principle is more familiar to this court than that a constitutional right,or a right of any other sort,may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.citation.
the application of these fundamental principles of appellate litigation to dependency proceedings was explained by presiding justice arthur scotland in the decision of in re dakota th,d as follows appellate courts have applied the waiver doctrine in dependency proceedings in a wide variety of contexts,including cases involving failures to obtain various reports required by statute.for example,in holding an appellant could not assert error in the failure of the juvenile court to conduct a bonding study where no objection had been made in the juvenile court,in re lorenzo th,d stated many dependency cases have held that a parent failure to object or raise certain issues in the juvenile court prevents the parent from presenting the issue to the appellate court.see in re aaron th d failure to object to adequacy of adoption assessment in re kevin th,d failure to challenge juvenile court ability to set a section hearing when it determined reasonable reunification efforts were not made in re anthony th,d failure to request sibling visitation as part of a permanent plan in re daniel th,d failure to request alternative placement in re crystal th,d failure to object to adequacy of adoption assessment in re jennilee th,d failure to object to qualifications of psychologists regarding,subd.b in re riva d.failure to object to noncompliance with indian child welfare act in re daniel d.failure to object to juvenile court amendment of pleading to conform to proof.as some of these courts have noted,any other rule would permit a party to deliberately stand by in silence and thereby permit the proceedings to reach a conclusion in which the party could acquiesce if favorable and avoid if unfavorable.in re riva,supra,d at,citing in re christian d.
other decisions support presiding justice scotland waiver analysis.in re troy cal th,d,plea of no contest to petition foreclosed appellate challenge to sufficiency of the evidence in re christopher th,d forum non conveniens contention waived because it was not raised in the trial court steve superior court th,d department of social services failure to dispute father right to reunification services in trial court waives the issue in re mark th,d father failure to pursue issue waived claim expert psychological testimony should have been admitted at dispositional proceeding in re richard d.parent waived right to raise timeliness issues by failing to assert error in trial court in re katrina d.parent failure to object to adequacy of oath waived issue in re heidi d.failure to object in superior court waived issue of right to separate counsel for minors.presiding justice scotland analysis is controlling in this case.the visitation issue has been waived.
second,even if the visitation issue were not waived,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c does not require that the court set the parameters of parental visitation.one court of appeal,in a case where no petition for review was filed,has held the issue of the post welfare and institutions code section hearing visitation may not be delegated to a guardian.in re randalynne th,d.in the decision of in re jasmine th,d,a case where a review petition was filed and denied,our colleague associate justice walter croskey held that in the absence of a request by the mother,the juvenile court need not order visitation as part of a legal guardianship permanent plan order.although the question is far from doubt,the dependency court,in a case where jurisdiction has not been terminated,may permit the guardian to control the time,place,and manner of visitation.
this is an issue of statutory interpretation.the statutory language is the best indication of the legislature intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d,people jones cal th,d.the last sentence of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c states,the court shall also make an order for visitation with the parents or guardians unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the visitation would be detrimental to the physical or emotional of the child.the statutory language makes no reference to the type of visitation order that must be formulated all that must be issued is an order.further,rule d of the california rules of court merely states,the court may issue orders regarding visitation to the child by a parent or other relative.as can be noted,the rule permits the juvenile court to issue orders regarding visitation.
corroborating this analysis,the visitation language in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c was adopted in.stats,ch.the legislative counsel digest for senate bill in merely indicates the court is to make orders for visitation nothing more.legis.counsel,bill,stats.reg.sess.summary.now it may be the legislature has it the juvenile court should specifically control visitation with biological parents in the context of guardianship permanent plans.but the statutory language in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c only requires the issuance of an order and in this case the trial court did that.
moreover,the guardian authority is essentially the same as a biological parent and vesting discretion in a party assuming the parental role makes good sense.the dependency law provides that a guardian powers are those specified in probate code section et.welf,probate code section,subdivision a describes in relevant part the powers of a guardian as follows t he guardian has the care,custody,and control of,and has charge of the education of,the ward see guardianship of zachary th,d it is the guardian,not the parent,who has the care,custody,and control of the child witkin,summary of cal.law ed.a guardian selects the residence of the ward,subd.a a guardian can move a ward to any place in california without court permission,subd.a.in selecting a residence,the guardian must exercise discretion based on the best interests of the ward,subdivision a see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.further,medical decisions for a ward are made by a guardian,subd.a see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.no doubt,the juvenile court retains the power to regulate guardianship matters relating to visitation.guardianship of zachary,supra,th at,d guardianship of kaylee th,d.but common sense suggests that a trial judge does not abuse discretion when allowing a guardian,who is vested with parental powers,to exercise discretion in controlling visitation with a biological parent.pursuant to welfare and institutions code sections and,the juvenile court retains jurisdiction in the event problems with the guardian management of visitation develop.in re marilyn cal th,fn,d,in re heraclio th,d.
finally,there are good reasons in this case to allow the guardians to control visitation.visitation issues are examined for an abuse of discretion.in re stephanie cal th,d,in re jasmine th,d.court ordered visitation to date,with its specified time frames,has caused substantial hardship to the child.several examples will suffice to demonstrate why the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the guardians to control visitation.
