background 
jorge,an immigrant from the state of michoac√°n,mexico,lived in the united states and sought legal residence here.his mother was a permanent resident and sponsored jorge in his application for that status.he began his application process in or but because his mother was not a citizen herself,the process took many years.
in,jorge and lilia were married in a religious ceremony in moreno valley,california.the ceremony was performed by a priest or other official from the state of jalisco,mexico,and an acta de matrimonia was issued.no marriage license was issued by the state of california.in,jorge and lilia became aware that the marriage was invalid because lilia prior divorce had not been final for days prior to the marriage.additionally,because it was made to look as though the parties were married in mexico,the mexican marriage certificate would prevent jorge from getting his green card because it would make it appear that he had not been in continuous residence in the united states.
the parties were remarried in and obtained a confidential marriage license.after the death of jorge mother,lilia assumed the position as jorge sponsor to pursue his application for permanent residence and citizenship.in,after she signed a document related to his immigration status,jorge informed lilia that it would be the last one.two weeks later,in may,he took lilia out to dinner and asked for a divorce because he was in love with someone else and always had been.in june,jorge moved out.
that same month,lilia found out who the other woman was when she overheard a conversation between jorge and lilia sister blanca.jorge had begun an affair with blanca prior to the marriage,and it lasted until.the intercepted conversation occurred in.lilia asked her teenaged son victor to call blanca,who babysat for jorge and lilia daughter,on her cell phone to inquire if she would be joining them for lunch with the child.blanca,at a restaurant with jorge,had the cell phone in her purse.instead of pressing the stop key,she pressed the button to answer the call,so the conversation she was having with jorge was overheard on victor cell phone,which lilia and victor listened to by activating the loudspeaker.in this conversation,jorge professed his love for blanca,assured her that they would be together once he got his share of money and property from lilia,and told her that he had only married lilia to gain permanent residence status.this conversation occurred after jorge had moved out.
shortly after the parties separated,an attempt was made to reach an agreement with jorge as to the disposition of assets.lilia has a real estate broker license and she and jorge had worked together in the realty business during their marriage.lilia attorney prepared a proposed settlement agreement listing five parcels of real property as community property,and three as lilia separate property.lilia offered jorge one of the properties,but he declined.he then filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage on april.
on june,lilia filed a response to the petition and a request for a judgment of nullity of marriage.at the court trial on the bifurcated trial relating to the status of the marriage,jorge demonstrated he had obtained his permanent resident status in.he denied having a relationship with blanca,although several telephone messages left on blanca cell phone and retrieved by a close family friend of blanca and addition to the conversation overheard by his protestations.
the trial court concluded the marriage was void under the laws of mexico and neither spouse was a putative spouse since neither acted in good faith.although lilia denied it,the court found she was likely the party who made the wedding arrangements since her family is from jalisco,the ceremony was performed by an official from jalisco,and the marriage certificate was issued by the state of jalisco.
the court also found the second marriage was void because jorge perpetrated a fraud on lilia by carrying on an extramarital affair with blanca.the court found that jorge did not marry lilia because he was worried about his immigration or work status instead,the court found jorge made false statements to blanca about his reasons for marrying lilia,including a need for a green card to string her along and to delay having to make a commitment to her.thus,the fraud related to jorge marrying lilia while carrying on a sexual relationship with blanca which he intended to maintain.the court concluded jorge wanted to have his cake and eat it too by carrying on sexual relationships with both women at the same time.
the trial court held that this kind of fraud goes to the heart of the marital relationship and declared the marriage void on the ground of fraud,subd.d.the court also found lilia was a putative spouse,for purposes of making a division of property at a subsequent proceeding.jorge appeals.
discussion 
jorge contends that he held a good faith belief in the validity of the marriage and should have been deemed a putative spouse of that marriage,and his extramarital affair did not constitute fraud such as would render the marriage void.we review the judgment of nullity or a decision regarding the validity of a marriage under the substantial evidence standard of review.in re marriage of liu d.
a.the marriage 
first we address jorge contention that he should have been deemed a putative spouse of the marriage.an innocent party to an invalid marriage may obtain relief as a putative spouse if the party believed in good faith that the marriage was valid.estate of depasse th,d see also code civ,subd.a.a putative spouse is entitled to the division of property acquired during the union as community property or property.depasse,supra,at,d code civ,subd.a.the determination of the party good faith is tested by an objective standard.depasse,supra,at,d centinela hospital medical center superior court d.a subjective good faith belief alone,even by a party that is found credible and sympathetic,is insufficient.welch state of california th,d.instead,under an objective standard,a claim of putative spouse status must be based on facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe in good faith that he or she was married and that the marriage was valid under california law.depasse,supra,at,d in re marriage of vryonis d.
here,regardless of whether jorge subjectively believed the marriage was valid,a reasonable person would not have.the marriage was performed in moreno valley,california,by a priest or other official from the state of jalisco,mexico.the official issued an acta de matrimonio,a marriage license,stating that the wedding was performed in jalisco.this in itself is enough to put a reasonable person on notice that the marriage license,and hence the marriage itself,was not valid.thus,we hold that jorge was not a putative spouse as to the marriage.
b.the marriage 
a marriage is voidable and may be adjudged a nullity if the consent of either party was obtained by fraud,subd.d.a marriage may be annulled for fraud only in an extreme case where the particular fraud goes to the very essence of the marriage relation.in re marriage of meagher and maleki th,d meagher.the fact represented or suppressed to induce consent to marriage will be deemed material if it relates to a matter of substance and directly affects the purpose of the party deceived in entering the marital contract.handley handley d.in other words,the fraud relied upon must be such as directly defeats the marriage relationship and not merely such
