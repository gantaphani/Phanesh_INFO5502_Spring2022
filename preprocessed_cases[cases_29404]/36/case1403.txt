wife is a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust of which her father is trustee.she made contributions from her salary towards the trust and inherited other property placed into it as well.during the marriage,the parties obtained a percent ownership interest in their residence at gwyne avenue in santa barbara.wife explained that,in,her father gave the couple a percent interest in the equity in the residence.in december of,the couple deeded their percent interest in the property to wife trust.thereafter,her father gave the couple the remaining percent of the equity in the house.in february of,the couple executed a deed transferring the percent interest in the residence to her trust as well.
prior to trial,husband filed a motion to join robert maahs,wife father and trustee of her trust,as a party to the dissolution proceeding.in his motion,husband claimed a community property interest in the gwyne avenue residence.husband contended that in order to establish and enforce the community property claim to the residence,it was necessary to join the trustee as a party to the action.husband stated the community transferred the property into the trust for no consideration,and with the understanding that husband was not surrendering his interest in the property.on the morning of trial,the parties reached an agreement that the trust would be dismissed from the action with prejudice.husband agreed to waive any claim against the trust in exchange for.
at trial,husband testified that at the time the couple signed the deed granting percent of the equity in the residence to wife trust,wife agreed she would waive any claim to his retirement funds or gumball business in the event they were to divorce.he stated he was adamant that he did not want to transfer his community property interest in the residence to her separate property trust but,after months of persuasion,agreed to do so only on the condition that she would waive her interest in his retirement funds in the event of a divorce.he testified that,although they had issues,they were not planning on getting a divorce at that time,and she agreed to sign a document waiving her interest in these items at a later date.he testified that he never sought a writing memorializing the agreement because she had assured him she would sign such an agreement and he trusted her as his wife.
wife testified that she did not recall any conversation between her and husband wherein they agreed that,in exchange for waiving his community interest in the residence,she would waive her community interest in his retirement funds.
the trial court found husband testimony credible,ruling that husband agreed to sign the deeds transferring the parties residence to wife trust only after wife agreed in return that she would not make any claim to his retirement benefits and gumball business if the marriage failed.the court stated that,in doing so,husband gave up his interest in a to home at values in return for retirement assets valued at at the date of separation,may of.
in its written statement of decision,the trial court reasoned,when spouses enter into an interspousal transaction or agreement which works a change in the character of the property,a transmutation of that property has occurred the agreement to transfer any of her community property interest in husband esop and k was not in writing.transmutation agreements must be made in writing a,but if an oral agreement is sufficiently performed,it may be taken out of the statute of frauds husband substantially changed his position by transferring any interest he may have had in the residence in reliance on the oral agreement with wife that the esop and k would be his separate property.this transfer of his property interest is substantial performance of the parties oral agreement which satisfies the proof element otherwise reflected in the requirement of a writing.further,relief because of the partial or full performance of the contract may be granted in equity on the ground that the party who has so performed has been induced by the other party to irretrievably change his position and that to refuse relief according to the terms of the contract would otherwise amount to a fraud upon his rights.moreover,equity principles such as estoppel and detrimental reliance are applicable here.equitable estoppel is a firmly rooted legal principle in this state which generally applies to all statute of frauds.also,the comment to family code section,which requires transmutations to be in writing,states the ordinary rules and formalities applicable to real property transfers apply also to transmutations of real property between the spouses hence,wife is estopped from asserting that the transmutation is invalid due to a lack of writing,especially since she had benefited from the oral agreement by receiving husband community property interest in the residence.citations and emphasis omitted.
accordingly,the court ruled that husband shall have no community property interest in the residence and wife shall have no community property interest in his retirement funds.the court ordered husband to pay wife per month in child support,per month in spousal support,and to pay wife an equalizing payment of to offset community debts.noting that wife was the current beneficiary of a trust with more than in assets,she was living in a home owned by the trust costing only per month while husband was renting at market rates,the court ordered the parties to bear their own attorney fees.
discussion 
wife contends the trial court erred in allowing husband to present extrinsic evidence of the parties oral agreement relinquishing her community property interest in his retirement funds,and awarding him the funds as his separate property based on a disputed oral transmutation agreement.she argues that any agreement on her part to relinquish her community property interest in husband retirement funds is invalid because it was not made in writing accompanied by an express declaration of her intent to transmute the property.she asks that we reverse the judgment and remand with instructions that she be awarded of husband retirement funds.
