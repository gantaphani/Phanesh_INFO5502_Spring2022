temiga,mother of the minor,appeals from orders of the juvenile court terminating her parental rights and freeing the minor for adoption.welf,further undesignated statutory references are to this code.appellant contends all orders of the juvenile court are void because the court failed to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor.we affirm.
the sacramento county department of health and human services dhhs removed the minor from appellant custody in july,soon after his birth,because both the minor and appellant tested positive for cocaine.dhhs also was aware appellant had a substance abuse problem and twice before had given birth to children who tested positive for drugs.
at the detention hearing,the court appointed counsel for the minor but did not appoint a guardian ad litem.appellant did not object.
dhhs recommended services be denied based upon appellant chronic substance abuse and her failure to reunify with the minor siblings.at the hearing,the court adopted this recommendation and set a section hearing.again,no guardian ad litem was appointed and appellant did not object.
the assessment for the section hearing stated the minor no longer showed physical or behavioral problems associated with drug exposure,but it cautioned that there could still be problems as the minor developed.the minor was assessed as generally adoptable and had been placed in a prospective adoptive home.at the hearing,the court terminated parental rights and selected a permanent plan of adoption.no guardian ad litem was appointed and although appellant addressed the court,she did not object.
discussion 
appellant contends the failure by the juvenile court to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor pursuant to recently enacted section requires reversal of the order terminating parental rights.according to appellant,the new law requires appointment of an attorney or a special advocate casa in addition to counsel appointed to represent the minor.appellant also argues all the juvenile court orders entered in this case after july,the effective date of the statute,are void.
respondent asserts appellant lacks standing and has waived the issues.we disagree.
appellant has standing to raise the guardian ad litem issue since lack of an independent individual protecting and asserting the minor interests has an impact on the relationship at stake in dependency proceedings.in re patricia d.however,failure to appoint a guardian ad litem is not jurisdictional and is subject to waiver if not raised in the trial court.johnston southern pacific cal,in re christopher th,d.nonetheless,we exercise our discretion to address the merits because of the importance of the effect of the federal and state statutes,regulations,and rules relating to appointment of a guardian ad litem in dependency proceedings.people williams cal th,fn,d.
prior to,there was no statutory requirement that a dependent minor be afforded separate counsel or be otherwise represented by the appointment of a guardian ad litem.that year,congress enacted public law,the child abuse prevention and treatment act,hereinafter capta et.the purpose of the law was to provide federal funds to the states to identify,prevent,and treat child abuse and neglect.one of the criteria for a state to qualify for this funding was that the state was to provide that in every case involving an abused or neglected child which results in a judicial proceeding a guardian ad litem shall be appointed to represent the child in such proceedings.former b.
california promptly passed laws to establish programs which would permit the state to qualify for this funding.stats,ch.however,due to an oversight,the requirement for a guardian ad litem was not included in the original legislation and had to be added later.stats,ch,see ways means,staff analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.off.of research,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.the new provision stated for the purposes of child abuse prevention and treatment act grants to the states public law,in all cases in which there is filed a petition based upon alleged neglect or abuse of the minor,a social worker who files a petition under this chapter shall be the guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the minor in proceedings under this chapter,unless the court shall appoint another adult as guardian ad litem.former stats,ch.this statute was later amended to bar the attorney responsible for presenting evidence alleging child abuse or neglect from acting as the guardian ad litem.stats,ch.
in,congress amended capta to refine the guardian ad litem requirement and permit funding only when the state plan for addressing child abuse contained provisions and procedures requiring that in every case involving an abused or neglected child which results in a judicial proceeding,a guardian ad litem,who may be an attorney or a court appointed special advocate or both,shall be appointed to represent the child in such proceedings i to obtain,a clear understanding of the situation and needs of the child and ii to make recommendations to the court concerning the best interests of the child.b a ix.
the relevant federal regulation intended to guide the states in complying with this statute provides in every case involving an abused or neglected child which results in a judicial proceeding,the state must insure the appointment of a guardian ad litem or other individual whom the state recognizes as fulfilling the same functions as a guardian ad litem,to represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child.this requirement may be satisfied by a statute mandating the appointments however,the guardian ad litem shall not be the attorney responsible for presenting the evidence alleging child abuse or neglect.g.
while it was possible to interpret the then current versions of section and capta to permit the social worker to continue to act as guardian ad litem,the federal government evidently did not do so and apparently required an independent representative for a child before disbursing federal funds under capta.rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.june,in re mark th,d in re kristine th,d.accordingly,in,effective july,the legislature enacted section which states the judicial council shall adopt a rule of court effective july,that complies with the requirement of the federal child abuse prevention and treatment act public law for the appointment of a guardian ad litem,who may be an attorney or a special advocate,for a child in cases in which a petition is filed based upon neglect or abuse of the child or in which a prosecution is initiated under the penal code arising from neglect or abuse of the child.the rule of court may include guidelines to the courts for determining when an attorney should be appointed rather than a court appointed special advocate,and caseload standards for guardians ad litem.
in compliance with this directive,the judicial council amended california rules of court,rule.discussions of the judicial council indicate that the amended rule was designed to guide the trial courts in accordance with the intent of the legislature that all children must be represented either by counsel or by a guardian ad litem.judicial council meeting minutes,item.members of the judicial council were also concerned about distinguish ing the role of the guardian ad litem in a dependency versus a civil context.id.at.the rule eventually adopted by the judicial council requires that counsel be appointed for the minor,unless specific criteria are met which obviates the requirement,and further specifies that,in those cases where counsel is not appointed to represent the minor,the juvenile court is required to appoint a casa as a guardian ad litem.cal.rules of court,rule b,e.thus,the current approach of the state in its ongoing attempt to qualify for federal funding under capta is to appoint either independent legal counsel or,if legal counsel is not required,a casa as a guardian ad litem,but not both.we turn now to the question of whether this approach is valid.
