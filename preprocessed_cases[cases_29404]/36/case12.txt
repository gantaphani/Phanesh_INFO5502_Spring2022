after a south carolina family court ordered petitioner turner to pay per week to respondent rogers to help support their child,turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in contempt five times.for the first four,he was sentenced to days imprisonment,but he ultimately paid what he owed twice without being jailed,twice after spending a few days in custody.the fifth time he did not pay but completed a sentence.after his release,the family court clerk issued a new show cause order against turner because he was in arrears.both he and rogers were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.the judge found turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to make support payments.after turner completed his sentence,the south carolina supreme court rejected his claim that the federal constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing,declaring that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safeguards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.

the fourteenth amendment due process clause does not automatically require the state to provide counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child support order,even if that individual faces incarceration.in particular,that clause does not require that counsel be provided where the opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and the state provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay,a fair opportunity to present,and to dispute,relevant information,and express court findings as to the supporting parent ability to comply with the support order.
a this court precedents provide no definitive answer to the question whether counsel must be provided.the sixth amendment grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel,see,united states dixon,but does not govern civil cases.civil and criminal contempt differ.a court may not impose punishment in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.hicks feiock.and once a civil contemnor complies with the underlying order,he is purged of the contempt and is free,at.the due process clause allows a state to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt proceedings than in a criminal case,at.cases directly concerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of such a right only in cases involving incarceration,but have not held that a right to counsel exists in all such cases.see in re gault,vitek jones,and lassiter department of social servs.of durham.
b because a contempt proceeding to compel support payments is civil,the question whether the specific dictates of due process require appointed counsel is determined by examining the distinct factors this court has used to decide what specific safeguards are needed to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair.mathews eldridge.as relevant here those factors include the nature of the private interest that will be affected,the comparative risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest with and without additional or substitute procedural safeguards,and the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not providing additional or substitute procedural requirement s.ibid.
the private interest that will be affected argues strongly for the right to counsel here.that interest consists of an indigent defendant loss of personal liberty through imprisonment.freedom from bodily restraint lies at the core of the liberty protected by the due process clause.foucha louisiana.thus,accurate decisionmaking as to the ability to pay which marks a dividing line between civil and criminal contempt,hicks,supra,at,must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a wrongful incarceration.and because ability to comply divides civil and criminal contempt proceedings,an erroneous determination would also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a criminal proceeding would demand.questions about ability to pay are likely to arise frequently in child custody cases.on the other hand,due process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings where incarceration is threatened.see gagnon scarpelli.to determine whether a right to counsel is required here,opposing interests and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards must be taken into account.mathews,supra,at.
doing so reveals three related considerations that,taken together,argue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the present kind.first,the likely critical question in these cases is the defendant ability to pay,which is often closely related to his indigence and relatively straightforward.second,sometimes,as here,the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented by counsel.a requirement that the state provide counsel to the noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation that would alter significantly the nature of the proceeding,gagnon,supra,at,creating a degree of formality or delay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and make the proceedings less fair overall.third,as the federal government points out,an available set of substitute procedural safeguards,mathews,supra,at,if employed together,can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.these include notice to the defendant that his ability to pay is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding the use of a form or the equivalent to elicit relevant financial information from him an opportunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions about his financial status and an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.
this decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where the underlying support payment is owed to the state,for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent,or the question what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a defendant can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,gagnon,supra,at.
under the circumstances,turner incarceration violated due process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those the court describes.he did not have clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his civil contempt proceeding.no one provided him with a form or the equivalent designed to elicit information about his financial circumstances.and the trial court did not find that he was able to pay his arrearage,but nonetheless found him in civil contempt and ordered him incarcerated.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
south carolina family court enforces its child support orders by threatening with incarceration for civil contempt those who are subject to a child support order,able to comply with that order,but fail to do so.we must decide whether the fourteenth amendment due process clause requires the state to provide counsel at a civil contempt hearing to an indigent person potentially faced with such incarceration.we conclude that where as here the custodial parent entitled to receive the support is unrepresented by counsel,the state need not provide counsel to the noncustodial parent required to provide the support.but we attach an important caveat,namely,that the state must nonetheless have in place alternative procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determination of the critical question,whether the supporting parent is able to comply with the support order.
south carolina family courts enforce their child support orders in part through civil contempt proceedings.each month the family court clerk reviews outstanding child support orders,identifies those in which the supporting parent has fallen more than five days behind,and sends that parent an order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.rule family.the show cause order and attached affidavit refer to the relevant child support order,identify the amount of the arrearage,and set a date for a court hearing.at the hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt,say,by showing that he is not able to make the required payments.see moseley mosier,when the parent is unable to make the required payments,he is not in contempt if he fails to make the required showing,the court may hold him in civil contempt.and it may require that he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself of contempt by making the required child support payments but not for more than one year regardless.see code ann.supp.imprisonment for up to one year of adult who wilfully violates a court order price turner,civil contempt order must permit purging of contempt through compliance.
in june a south carolina family court entered an order,which as amended required petitioner,michael turner,to pay per week to respondent,rebecca rogers,to help support their child.rogers father,larry price,currently has custody of the child and is also a respondent before this court.over the next three years,turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in contempt on five occasions.the first four times he was sentenced to days imprisonment,but he ultimately paid the amount due twice without being jailed,twice after spending two or three days in custody.the fifth time he did not pay but completed a sentence.
after his release in turner remained in arrears.on march,the clerk issued a new show cause order.and after an initial postponement due to turner failure to appear,turner civil contempt hearing took place on january.turner and rogers were present,each without representation by counsel.
the hearing was brief.the court clerk said that turner was behind in his payments.the judge asked turner if there was anything you want to say.turner replied,
well,when i first got out,i got back on dope.i done meth,smoked pot and everything else,and i paid a little bit here and there.and,when i finally did get to working,i broke my back,back in september.i filed for disability and ssi.and,i did get straightened out off the dope until i broke my back and laid up for two months.and,now i off the dope and everything.i just hope that you give me a chance.i do know what else to say.i mean,i know i done wrong,and i should have been paying and helping her,and i sorry.i mean,dope had a hold to me.app.to pet.for cert.
the judge then said,o kay,and asked rogers if she had anything to say.ibid.after a brief discussion of federal benefits,the judge stated,
if there nothing else,this will be the order of the court.i find the defendant in willful contempt.i going to sentence him to twelve months in the oconee county detention center.he may purge himself of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having a zero balance on or before his release.i also placed a lien on any ssi or other benefits.at.
the judge added that turner would not receive or work credits,but i f you got a job,i make you eligible for work release.ibid.when turner asked why he could not receive or work credits,the judge said,b ecause that my ruling.ibid.
the court made no express finding concerning turner ability to pay his arrearage though turner wife had voluntarily submitted a copy of turner application for disability benefits,post,at,thomas,dissenting app.nor did the judge ask any followup questions or otherwise address the issue.after the hearing,the judge filled out a prewritten form titled order for contempt of court,which included the statement 
defendant was was not gainfully employed had did not have the ability to make these support payments when due.at.
but the judge left this statement as is without indicating whether turner was able to make support payments.
while serving his sentence,turner,with the help of pro bono counsel,appealed.he claimed that the federal constitution entitled him to counsel at his con tempt hearing.the south carolina supreme court decided turner appeal after he had completed his sentence.and it rejected his right to counsel claim.the court pointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from criminal contempt.the former does not require all the constitutional safeguards applicable in criminal proceedings,at,at.and the right to counsel,the supreme court held,was one of the safeguards not required.ibid.
turner sought certiorari.in light of differences among state courts and some federal courts on the applicability of a right to counsel in civil contempt proceedings enforcing child support orders,we granted the writ.compare,pasqua council,black division of child support enforcement,mead batchlor,ridgway baker,all finding a federal constitutional right to counsel for indigents facing imprisonment in a child support civil contempt proceeding,with rodriguez eighth judicial dist,county of clark,no right to counsel in civil contempt hearing for nonsupport,except in rarest of cases andrews walton,so,no circumstances in which a parent is entitled to counsel in a civil contempt proceeding for failure to pay child support compare also in re grand jury proceedings,per curiam general right to counsel in civil contempt proceedings,with duval duval,no general right,but counsel may be required on basis.
respondents argue that this case is moot.see massachusetts mellon,article iii judicial power extends only to actual cases and controversies alvarez smith,slip,at an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review internal quotation marks omitted.they point out that turner completed his prison sentence in.and they add that there are no collateral consequences of that particular contempt determination that might keep the dispute alive.compare sibron new york,release from prison does not moot a criminal case because collateral consequences are presumed to continue,with spencer kemna,declining to extend the presumption to parole revocation.
the short,conclusive answer to respondents mootness claim,however,is that this case is not moot because it falls within a special category of disputes that are capable of repetition while evading review.southern pacific terminal icc.a dispute falls into that category,and a case based on that dispute remains live,if the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.weinstein bradford,per curiam.
our precedent makes clear that the challenged action,turner imprisonment for up to months,is in its duration too short to be fully litigated through the state courts and arrive here prior to its expiration.see,first nat.bank of boston bellotti,internal quotation marks omitted period too short southern pacific terminal,supra,at period too short.at the same time,there is a more than reasonable likelihood that turner will again be subjected to the same action.as we have pointed out,supra,at,turner has frequently failed to make his child support payments.he has been the subject of several civil contempt proceedings.he has been imprisoned on several of those occasions.within months of his release from the imprisonment here at issue he was again the subject of civil contempt proceedings.and he was again imprisoned,this time for six months.as of december,turner was in arrears,and another contempt hearing was scheduled for may.app.reply brief for petitioner.these facts bring this case squarely within the special category of cases that are not moot because the underlying dispute is capable of repetition,yet evading review.see,nebraska press stuart,internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the underlying facts make this case unlike defunis odegaard,per curiam,and pierre united states,per curiam,two cases that respondents believe require us to find this case moot regardless.defunis was moot,but that is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again suffer the conduct of which he complained and others likely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own lawsuits.here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future imprisonment.
pierre was moot because the petitioner a witness held in contempt and sentenced to five months imprisonment had failed to apply to this court for a stay of the order imposing imprisonment,at.and,like the witness in pierre,turner did not seek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprisonment.but this case,unlike pierre,arises out of a proceeding.and respondents give us no reason to believe that we would have or that we could have granted a timely request for a stay had one been made.granting this court jurisdiction to review final judgments.in sibron,we rejected a similar mootness argument for just that reason,at.and we find this case similar in this respect to sibron,not to pierre.
we must decide whether the due process clause grants an indigent defendant,such as turner,a right to counsel at a civil contempt proceeding,which may lead to his incarceration.this court precedents provide no definitive answer to that question.this court has long held that the sixth amendment grants an indigent defendant the right to counsel in a criminal case.gideon wainwright.and we have held that this same rule applies to criminal contempt proceedings other than summary proceedings.united states dixon,cooke united states.
but the sixth amendment does not govern civil cases.civil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it seeks only to coerc e the defendant to do what a court had previously ordered him to do.gompers bucks stove range.a court may not impose punishment in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.hicks feiock.and once a civil contemnor complies with the underlying order,he is purged of the contempt and is free,at he carr ies the keys of his prison in his own pockets internal quotation marks omitted.
consequently,the court has made clear in a case not involving the right to counsel that,where civil contempt is at issue,the fourteenth amendment due process clause allows a state to provide fewer procedural protections than in a criminal case,at state may place the burden of proving inability to pay on the defendant.
this court has decided only a handful of cases that more directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.and the application of those decisions to the present case is not clear.on the one hand,the court has held that the fourteenth amendment requires the state to pay for representation by counsel in a civil juvenile delinquency proceeding which could lead to incarceration.in re gault.moreover,in vitek jones,a plurality of four members of this court would have held that the fourteenth amendment requires representation by counsel in a proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital for the mentally ill.further,in lassiter department of social servs.of durham,a case that focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of parental rights,the court wrote that the 
generalization that emerges from this court precedents on an indigent right to appointed counsel is that such a right has been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.at.
and the court then drew from these precedents the presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when,if he loses,he may be deprived of his physical liberty.at.
on the other hand,the court has held that a criminal offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment does not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation revocation hearing.gagnon scarpelli,see also middendorf henry,no due process right to counsel in summary proceedings.and,at the same time,gault,vitek,and lassiter are readily distinguishable.the civil juvenile delinquency proceeding at issue in gault was little different from,and comparable in seriousness to,a criminal prosecution,at.in vitek,the controlling opinion found no right to counsel,at powell,concurring in part assistance of mental health professionals sufficient.and the court statements in lassiter constitute part of its rationale for denying a right to counsel in that case.we believe those statements are best read as pointing out that the court previously had found a right to counsel only in cases involving incarceration,not that a right to counsel exists in all such cases a position that would have been difficult to reconcile with gagnon.
civil contempt proceedings in child support cases constitute one part of a highly complex system designed to assure a noncustodial parent regular payment of funds typically necessary for the support of his children.often the family receives welfare support from a federal program,and the state then seeks reimbursement from the noncustodial parent.see a,supp.iii,a ed.code ann.a,cum.supp.other times the custodial parent often the mother,but sometimes the father,a grandparent,or another person with custody does not receive government benefits and is entitled to receive the support payments herself.
the federal government has created an elaborate procedural mechanism designed to help both the government and custodial parents to secure the payments to which they are entitled.see generally blessing freestone,describing the interlocking set of cooperative welfare programs as they relate to child support enforcement cfr pt.prescribing standards for state child support agencies.these systems often rely upon wage withholding,expedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child support orders,and automated data processing.a,b.but sometimes states will use contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent receives support payments or the government receives reimbursement.although some experts have criticized this procedure,and the federal government believes that the routine use of contempt for of child support is likely to be an ineffective strategy,the government also tells us that coercive enforcement remedies,such as contempt,have a role to play.brief for united states as amicus curiae,and citing of health and human services,national child support enforcement,strategic plan fy.south carolina,which relies heavily on contempt proceedings,agrees that they are an important tool.
we here consider an indigent right to paid counsel at such a contempt proceeding.it is a civil proceeding.and we consequently determine the specific dictates of due process by examining the distinct factors that this court has previously found useful in deciding what specific safeguards the constitution due process clause in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair.mathews eldridge,considering fairness of an administrative proceeding.as relevant here those factors include the nature of the private interest that will be affected,the comparative risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest with and without additional or substitute procedural safeguards,and the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not providing additional or substitute procedural requirement s.ibid.see also lassiter,at applying the mathews framework.
the private interest that will be affected argues strongly for the right to counsel that turner advocates.that interest consists of an indigent defendant loss of personal liberty through imprisonment.the interest in securing that freedom,the freedom from bodily restraint,lies at the core of the liberty protected by the due process clause.foucha louisiana.and we have made clear that its threatened loss through legal proceedings demands due process protection.addington texas.
given the importance of the interest at stake,it is important to assure accurate decisionmaking in respect to the key ability to pay question.moreover,the fact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between civil and criminal contempt,hicks,at,reinforces the need for accuracy.that is because an incorrect decision wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding as civil can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by depriving the defendant of the procedural protections including counsel that the constitution would demand in a criminal proceeding.see,dixon,at proof beyond a reasonable doubt,protection from double jeopardy codispoti pennsylvania,jury trial where the result is more than six months imprisonment.and since of child support arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either no reported income or income of per year or less,the issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often.see sorensen,sousa,schaner,assessing child support arrears in nine large states and the nation prepared by the urban institute,online at as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file,at research suggests that many obligors who do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively limited resources patterson,civil contempt and the indigent child support obligor the silent return of debtor prison,cornell pub.pol y.see also,mcbride mcbride,surveying north carolina contempt orders and finding that the failure of trial courts to make a determination of a contemnor ability to comply is not altogether infrequent 
on the other hand,the due process clause does not always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings where incarceration is threatened.see gagnon.and in determining whether the clause requires a right to counsel here,we must take account of opposing interests,as well as consider the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.mathews,supra,at.
doing so,we find three related considerations that,when taken together,argue strongly against the due process clause requiring the state to provide indigents with counsel in every proceeding of the kind before us.
first,the critical question likely at issue in these cases concerns,as we have said,the defendant ability to pay.that question is often closely related to the question of the defendant indigence.but when the right procedures are in place,indigence can be a question that in many but not all cases is sufficiently straightforward to warrant determination prior to providing a defendant with counsel,even in a criminal case.federal law,for example,requires a criminal defendant to provide information showing that he is indigent,and therefore entitled to counsel,before he can receive that assistance.see b.
second,sometimes,as here,the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by counsel but the custodial parent unrepresented by counsel.see of health and human services,office of child support enforcement,understanding child support debt a guide to exploring child support debt in your state,of nationwide arrears,and in south carolina,are not owed to the government.the custodial parent,perhaps a woman with custody of one or more children,may be relatively poor,unemployed,and unable to afford counsel.yet she may have encouraged the court to enforce its order through contempt.tr.contempt proceedings,app.rogers asks court,in light of pattern of nonpayment,to confine turner.she may be able to provide the court with significant information,at rogers describes where turner lived and worked.and the proceeding is ultimately for her benefit.
a requirement that the state provide counsel to the noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation that would alter significantly the nature of the proceeding.gagnon,supra,at.doing so could mean a degree of formality or delay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need.and,perhaps more important for present purposes,doing so could make the proceedings less fair overall,increasing the risk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family of the support it is entitled to receive.the needs of such families play an important role in our analysis.post,at opinion of thomas.
third,as the solicitor general points out,there is available a set of substitute procedural safeguards,mathews,at,which,if employed together,can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.they can do so,moreover,without incurring some of the drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right to counsel.those safeguards include notice to the that his ability to pay is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding the use of a form or the equivalent to elicit relevant financial information an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to statements and questions about his financial status,those triggered by his responses on the form and an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.see tr.of oral arg.brief for united states as amicus curiae.in presenting these alternatives,the government draws upon considerable experience in helping to manage statutorily mandated efforts to enforce child support orders.see supra,at.it does not claim that they are the only possible alternatives,and this court cases suggest,for example,that sometimes assistance other than purely legal assistance here,say,that of a neutral social worker can prove constitutionally sufficient.vitek,at powell,concurring in part provision of mental health professional.but the government does claim that these alternatives can assure the fundamental fairness of the proceeding even where the state does not pay for counsel for an indigent defendant.
while recognizing the strength of turner arguments,we ultimately believe that the three considerations we have just discussed must carry the day.in our view,a categorical right to counsel in proceedings of the kind before us would carry with it disadvantages in the form of unfairness and delay that,in terms of ultimate fairness,would deprive it of significant superiority over the alternatives that we have mentioned.we consequently hold that the due process clause does not automatically require the provision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent individual who is subject to a child support order,even if that individual faces incarceration for up to a year.in particular,that clause does not require the provision of counsel where the opposing parent or other custodian to whom support funds are owed is not represented by counsel and the state provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to those we have mentioned adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay,fair opportunity to present,and to dispute,relevant information,and court findings.
we do not address civil contempt proceedings where the underlying child support payment is owed to the state,for example,for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the parent with custody.see supra,at.those proceedings more closely resemble proceedings.the government is likely to have counsel or some other competent representative.johnson zerbst,t he average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty,wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel emphasis added.and this kind of proceeding is not before us.neither do we address what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a defendant can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate.gagnon,at see also reply brief for petitioner not claiming that turner case is especially complex.
the record indicates that turner received neither counsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those we have described.he did not receive clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his civil contempt proceeding.no one provided him with a form or the equivalent designed to elicit information about his financial circumstances.the court did not find that turner was able to pay his arrearage,but instead left the relevant finding section of the contempt order blank.the court nonetheless found turner in contempt and ordered him incarcerated.under these circumstances turner incarceration violated the due process clause.
we vacate the judgment of the south carolina supreme court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment does not provide a right to appointed counsel for indigent defendants facing incarceration in civil contempt ceedings.therefore,i would affirm.although the court agrees that appointed counsel was not required in this case,it nevertheless vacates the judgment of the south carolina supreme court on a different ground,which the parties have never raised.solely at the invitation of the united states as amicus curiae,the majority decides that turner contempt proceeding violated due process be cause it did not include alternative procedural safeguards.ante,at.consistent with this court longstanding practice,i would not reach that question 
the only question raised in this case is whether the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment creates a right to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants facing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings.it does not.
under an original understanding of the constitution,there is no basis for concluding that the guarantee of due process secures a right to appointed counsel in civil contempt proceedings.it certainly does not do so to the extent that the due process clause requires that our government must proceed according to the law of the land that is,according to written constitutional and statutory provisions.hamdi rumsfeld,thomas,dissenting quoting in re winship,black,dissenting.no one contends that south carolina law entitles turner to appointed counsel.nor does any federal statute or constitutional provision so provide.although the sixth amendment secures a right to the assistance of counsel,it does not apply here because civil contempt proceedings are not criminal prosecutions.amdt.see ante,at.moreover,as originally understood,the sixth amendment guaranteed only the right to employ counsel,or to use volunteered services of counsel it did not require the court to appoint counsel in any circumstance.padilla kentucky,scalia,dissenting slip,at see also united states van duzee,beaney,the right to counsel in american courts,heller,the sixth amendment to the constitution of the united states.
appointed counsel is also not required in civil contempt proceedings under a somewhat broader reading of the due process clause,which takes it to approve a process of law,which is not otherwise forbidden,that can show the sanction of settled usage.weiss united states,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment quoting hurtado california.despite a long history of courts exercising contempt authority,turner has not identified any evidence that courts appointed counsel in those proceedings.see mine workers bagwell,describing courts traditional assumption of inherent contempt authority see also blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england describing the summary proceedings used to adjudicate contempt.indeed,turner concedes that contempt proceedings without appointed counsel have the blessing of history.see tr.of oral arg.admitting that there is no historical support for turner rule see also brief for respondents.
even under the court modern interpretation of the constitution,the due process clause does not provide a right to appointed counsel for all indigent defendants facing incarceration in civil contempt proceedings.such a reading would render the sixth amendment right to counsel as it is currently understood superfluous.moreover,it appears that even cases applying the court modern interpretation of due process have not understood it to categorically require appointed counsel in circumstances outside those otherwise covered by the sixth amendment.
under the court current jurisprudence,the sixth amendment entitles indigent defendants to appointed coun sel in felony cases and other criminal cases resulting in a sentence of imprisonment.see gideon wainwright,argersinger hamlin,scott illinois,alabama shelton.turner concedes that,even under these cases,the sixth amendment does not entitle him to appointed counsel.see reply brief for petitioner acknowledging that civil contempt is not a criminal prosecution within the meaning of the sixth amendment he argues instead that the right to the assistance of counsel for persons facing incarceration arises not only from the sixth amendment,but also from the requirement of fundamental fairness under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.brief for petitioner.in his view,this court has relied on due process to rejec t formalistic distinctions between criminal and civil proceedings,instead concluding that incarceration or other confinement triggers the right to counsel.at.
but if the due process clause created a right to appointed counsel in all proceedings with the potential for detention,then the sixth amendment right to appointed counsel would be unnecessary.under turner theory,every instance in which the sixth amendment guarantees a right to appointed counsel is covered also by the due process clause.the sixth amendment,however,is the only constitutional provision that even mentions the assistance of counsel the due process clause says nothing about counsel.ordinarily,we do not read a general provision to render a specific one superfluous.morales trans world airlines,i t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general the fact that one constitutional provision expressly provides a right to appointed counsel in specific circumstances indicates that the constitution does not also sub silentio provide that right far more broadly in another,more general,provision.albright oliver,plurality opinion where a particular amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior,that amendment,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing these claims internal quotation marks omitted,at kennedy,concurring in judgment i agree with the plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the fourth amendment without reference to more general considerations of due process stop the beach renourishment,florida of environmental protection,opinion of scalia,slip,at applying albright to the takings clause.
moreover,contrary to turner assertions,the holdings in this court due process decisions regarding the right to counsel are actually quite narrow.the court has never found in the due process clause a categorical right to appointed counsel outside of criminal prosecutions or proceedings functionally akin to a criminal trial.scarpelli,in re gault.this is consistent with the conclusion that the due process clause does not expand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by the sixth amendment.
