meanwhile,after meeting at an adoption fair,prospective adoptive parents began the process of being matched with,and.the three children were placed with the family in early,and dcfs reported on april,that the placement was going well.mother had not visited regularly,and father had not responded to dcfs efforts to set a visitation schedule.maternal grandmother,however,visited regularly and had overnight visits once a month.she continued to express interest in caring for the children,but dcfs continued to oppose placement with maternal grandmother,as her history of sustained allegations with dcfs was removed from her record only because of the age of the allegations.

on april,dcfs reported that a dcfs worker went to the address on march,with a notice of april,section hearing.the worker spoke to father uncle,who verified that father lived at that address,but the worker had just missed him and the uncle did not know when father would return.the uncle refused to accept service because he does want to get into father business,but remembered the worker from a prior service attempt.the worker gave the uncle a business card and asked him to have father call.the court then continued hearing to june,the same day as hearing,and dcfs personally served father attorney on behalf of father,whose whereabouts were unknown.

discussion 
father appeal from the march,order terminating parental rights was untimely,and we have no jurisdiction to review the order.
father argues that he did not receive notice of the march,hearing terminating his parental rights,and so the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the termination order.he also argues that the court should have granted his counsel request for a further continuation of the hearing.the obstacle to father arguments is that his notice of appeal from the march,order was untimely.the order in this case was by a referee,and therefore father was required to file a written notice of appeal within days after the order became final under california rules of court rule c.cal.rules of court,rule a.rule c provides that an order of a referee becomes final calendar days after service of a copy of the order and findings under rule,which in turn provides that the referee must serve the parent by mail to the last known address and is deemed complete at the time of mailing.cal.rules of court,rule b.the clerk served father by mail on march,to father last known address,the address,meaning that the order became final days later,on march.father was required to file his notice of appeal within days of that date,by may.he did not file the notice of appeal until may,nine days late.
father argues that the court sent the march,minute order to a nonexistent address,and so we must first address the confusion,largely created by father briefing,regarding father address at the times relevant to this appeal.father opening brief argues that the address was invalid and nonexistent,and that the paternal grandparents address the whitney way address was the proper address for all service,while the address was father residence.while the initial petition in april designated father address as the whitney way address,the dcfs detention report also provides the address likely a typographical error,as does a investigation report dated a week after the filing of the petition as to and.there are instances of the use of the whitney way address and the address,but at all times relevant to this appeal,father was provided with notice at the address.as respondent brief points out,father had received personal service at the address three times the first on june,when the words jonathan lives at this address appear over jonathan signature father uncle who also lived there confirmed that father lived there the clerk served jonathan with his writ rights by mail at the address and father used the address on his notice of intent to file a writ petition.
in partial response,father reply brief abandons the argument that father ever lived at the address,and continues to assert that only the whitney way address was the proper address for service,without citing to any references to the whitney way address after april.father subsequently filed a notice of errata stating that further investigation of this issue has revealed that the address is not the incorrect address.rather,the east avenue is the incorrect address.
father has abandoned his initial argument that the address was incorrect.father argues in his reply brief that his last known address at the time of the march,hearing was his place of incarceration.we reject this argument.no place of incarceration was provided to the court at the time of the hearing,and father acknowledges that the court was not required to conduct a prison search for father address in custody.father alternatively argues that the court should have sent notice of the termination order to his designated address presumably the whitney way address,or to the last place it believed jonathan lived.california rules of court,rule b requires that the court serve the parent by mail at the last known address,which at the time of the section hearing in march was the address.we conclude that the court properly served father with the section order by mail at the address.
the filing of the notice of appeal was untimely,and therefore we lack jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the termination of father parental rights.t aking of the appeal is not merely procedural it vests jurisdiction in the appellate court and terminates the jurisdiction of the lower court.in re frederick d.the consequences of an untimely notice of appeal are not remediable.in the absence of statutory authorization,neither the trial nor appellate courts may extend or shorten the time for appeal citation,even to relieve against mistake,inadvertence,accident,or misfortune citations if it appears that the appeal was not taken within the day period,the court has no discretion but must dismiss the appeal of its own motion even if no objection is made.citations.ibid.
ii.the doctrine of constructive filing does not apply.
father requests that we apply the doctrine of constructive filing,which considers a late notice of appeal to be timely filed if the appellant is incarcerated,and the lateness of the notice of appeal is the result of negligence by prison officials relied upon by the appellant and not due to the fault of the incarcerated prisoner.in re benoit cal d.numerous cases have held that constructive filing,which can be applied in criminal cases,does not apply in termination of parental rights proceedings citations.these cases have determined that the special need for finality in parental termination cases and the danger of imperiling adoption proceedings prevails over the policy considerations in favor of constructive filing.in re alyssa th.further,father makes no showing in the record that his late notice of appeal was the result of negligence by prison officials,and the mere fact of his incarceration does not suffice to excuse him from timely filing.
iii.father can not collaterally attack the march,order terminating parental rights by noticing an appeal from the september order finalizing the adoptions.
father also argues that his notice of appeal from the september adoption orders is a permissible collateral attack on the march order terminating his parental rights.father is wrong.dependency appeals are governed by s ection,which provides in relevant part a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment this statute makes the dispositional order in a dependency proceeding the appealable judgment.citation.therefore,all subsequent orders are directly appealable without limitation citations.a consequence of section is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.in re meranda th.this waiver rule holds that an appellate court in a dependency proceeding may not inquire into the merits of a prior final appealable order,even when the issues raised involve important constitutional and statutory rights.id.at.we therefore can not inquire into the merits of the unappealed order terminating father parental rights.
collateral attack of a termination order is expressly prohibited in section,subdivision i,subdivision any order of the court permanently terminating parental rights under this section shall be conclusive and binding upon the child,upon the parent or parents and upon all other persons who have been served with citation by publication or otherwise as provided in this chapter.after making the order,the juvenile court shall have no power to set aside,change,or modify it,but nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right to appeal the order.this statute forbids alteration or revocation of an order terminating parental rights except by means of a direct appeal from the order.in re meranda,supra,th at.further,habeas corpus may not be used to collaterally attack a final nonmodifiable judgment in an action where the trial court had jurisdiction to render the final judgment.adoption of alexander cal d,see in re issac th.this action is,as father appeals from the adoption order,and the court had jurisdiction to terminate parental rights under section.he may not use this appeal to mount a collateral attack on the section order.
father attempts to avoid this bar by arguing that errors in notice of the termination hearing rendered the dependency court without jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights at the hearing on march.even if notice to father were deficient,however,that would not constitute a lack of fundamental jurisdiction,which refers to a court power over persons and subject matter.in re angel th.in a less fundamental sense,jurisdiction refers to a court authority to act with respect to persons and subject matter within its power.citation.issues relating to jurisdiction in its fundamental sense indeed may be raised at any time.citations.by contrast,issues relating to jurisdiction in its less fundamental sense may be subject to bars including waiver citation and forfeiture citation.ibid.when a court with fundamental jurisdiction over the persons and subject matter in question acts contrary to a statutory procedure or applicable rules,it does not act without jurisdiction,but rather in excess of jurisdiction.ibid.acts in excess of jurisdiction are not void in any fundamental sense but are,at most,voidable if properly raised by an interested party.ibid.here,the children were the subject of a dependency petition,and the juvenile court had fundamental jurisdiction to exercise its power to terminate parental rights.see.a failure to follow mandated statutory procedures such as service of notice to father at his last known address is an act in excess of jurisdiction which,even had it occurred,father can not challenge via a collateral attack.
father also argues that collateral attack is permissible because his appeal of the termination order is pending and therefore the order is not final.see in re darlice th.as we explain above,however,no appeal of the termination order is pending as father did not file a timely appeal,and collateral relief is unavailable where the claimed errors could have been,but
