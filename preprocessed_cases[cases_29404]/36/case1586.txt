this third in this marital dissolution a dispute over the appropriate amount of child support due a child of a wealthy parent.consistent with the principle that child support must be measured by the standard of living attainable by the parent income,we conclude the trial court must be presented with sufficient information on which to properly assess the child needs.such information includes the amount of the supporting parent actual income where that amount is disputed.the action is remanded to enable the court to obtain reliable information as to the supporting parent income,and to make a guideline child support calculation based thereon.
both parties also contend the trial court erred in setting child support at per month.the mother contends the amount is too low in light of the father extraordinarily high income,while the father insists it is too high and exceeds the child needs.in light of flaws in the trial court methodology for calculating child support,we conclude this portion of the appeal is not yet ripe for review and must be dismissed.
finally,we conclude the trial court erred in suspending the father obligation to pay child support during the period in which his child was participating in a high school foreign exchange program in japan.
factual and procedural background 
after a marriage of about four years,william and ursula hubner separated in october.their son,ryan,with whom william has never had any contact,was born march.from ryan birth until early,william paid per month in child support.in,in response to ursula petition for increased child support,william was ordered to pay child support of per month,retroactive to march.that order was based on the trial court finding that,among other things,ursula had sole legal and physical custody of ryan,and william stipulation that he had a net disposable income of at least million per year and the ability to pay any reasonable child support order.
in october,ursula filed an order to show cause osc requesting modification of the existing order to increase ryan child support to the guideline level.ryan was approximately years old when the petition was filed.
in a declaration in support of her petition for modification,ursula stated that a number of events had occurred since the support order was made,any one of which constituted a changed circumstance warranting an increase in child support.ursula first noted that the manner and presumptions regarding the calculation of child support under the statewide uniform guidelines had changed since the previous support order.she argued that in contrast to the family court procedures followed in,the statutory changes placed a burden on william to prove he was an extraordinarily high earner,and that the child support presumptively awarded under a guideline calculation would exceed ryan needs.
in support of her request for an increased child support order,ursula also noted ryan desire to participate in an american field service afs academic foreign exchange program in japan during the school year.ursula anticipated the expenses for ryan participation in the afs program would exceed.in addition,ursula noted ryan needed funds for a car,car insurance,gasoline and repairs,a personal computer and software,participation in sports and social activities,and medical and mental health care.ursula also said that after graduation ryan anticipated attending a private college at an expense of approximately.
ursula conceded she should not have waited until ryan was almost years old to seek a modification of the child support order.she said,she had known for some time the award was inadequate,but,anticipating william argument,had been unable to summon the psychological stamina necessary to face another battle with bill.ursula declared that she suffered from debilitating migraine headaches and severe depression.she also declared she had only a high school education and that because of her limited education and training and the fact that she had devoted herself to raising ryan,she was unable to earn more than a minimal,sporadic income.
the income and expense declaration which accompanied the petition listed ursula monthly expenses at,her gross annual earnings for at,and her net monthly disposable income at.
in november,ursula noticed william deposition and served him with a request to produce detailed financial documentation.william moved for a protective order to quash the subpoena issued for his deposition and document production.he argued that discovery of his personal financial information was an impermissible invasion of his right of privacy,and was irrelevant to the matters at issue.in support of his motion,william submitted an admission,signed only by his counsel,stating his annual earned income is at least,he lives a lifestyle commensurate with a person earning per year,and,he has the ability to pay any reasonable and lawful child support order made by the court.william argued his admission established his status as an extraordinarily high income earner,subd.b,and relieved him from the obligation to comply with ursula discovery requests.
ursula moved to compel william deposition and document production.she also made an alternative request that,in the event the court declined to order william to appear for deposition or to produce the requested financial information,the court find william annual net income available to pay child support was at least million.
the motion for a protective order and the motion to compel were heard together on december.the court granted william request for a protective order and denied ursula motion to compel.however,william was ordered to bring to the osc hearing for court review the following week,a completed income and expense declaration,his recent tax returns,and any other information required by the local rules or the california rules of court.william was also ordered to provide copies of his tax returns to ursula counsel and her forensic accountants in advance of the osc hearing,subject to a confidentiality order.
william subsequently filed a response to ursula petition to modify child support in which he objected to any increased child support for ryan,and objected to any requirement to pay child support during ryan participation in the afs program.
ursula then sought reconsideration of the ruling granting william request for a protective order.she argued that william opposition to any increase in his child support obligation evidenced a wrongful attempt on his part to obtain the discovery protection available to an extraordinarily high earner who had agreed to pay any support award based on an assumed income.the court partially granted ursula motion and ordered william to submit to a limited deposition regarding the general attributes of his lifestyle.the court also reaffirmed the earlier order requiring william to provide copies of various financial documents.
the hearing on ursula modification petition was convened on february.at the outset,william counsel revealed that contrary to court order,william had not provided any financial information to ursula or to the court.william counsel reported william had decline d to produce his tax returns,and informed the court it should simply proceed from there.ursula counsel argued a guideline child support calculation could not be made in the absence of information about william actual gross income.concluding it might not be productive to enforce its earlier order,the court stated its intention to proceed without the financial information.it noted it was not inconceivable that,based on an assessment of ryan needs,it would order an amount that fell below the guideline even at william admitted income.however,the court stated it intended to assume the worst possible tax situation for william,by basing its calculation on an annual income,which is an annual income of roughly million in pretax dollars.
at the conclusion of the hearing,william was ordered to pay child support of per month from november through march,when ryan turned years of age.however,william child support payments were ordered suspended during ryan participation in the afs program in japan.however,the support was ordered reinstated in february and march,following ryan return from japan and in high school,until his birthday.
at a subsequent hearing,the court set forth the findings that formed the bases of the support order,subds.a,b.it found william was an extraordinarily high earner within the meaning of family code section,subdivision b,with an annual income of at least.it also stated it had indulged in all the worst findings it could make with respect to tax consequences to william.indulging in slightly higher findings than william admitted income,the court found william had a monthly income of approximately per month,but failed to state the precise guideline amount of child support the income figure would yield.without identifying specific past or projected future expenditures,the court found that monthly child support of would enable ryan to share in william standard of living,but anything over would be excessive and not consistent with ryan reasonable needs.the court emphasized that although its conclusion as to the appropriate amount of support was not based solely on ryan actual historical expenses or the mere necessities of life,it was not,in essence,creating a college fund.support payments were ordered suspended while ryan was in the afs program in japan because during that period he would not be a student working towards a high school diploma.ursula requested reconsideration of the order based on evidence she received after the osc hearing that showed ryan would receive credit on his home transcript for courses taken at his host high school in japan.ursula request was denied.
an order modifying child support was entered in april.these appeals followed.
discussion 
ursula argues the trial court erred in basing the child support order on william admitted income,when the appropriate amount of child support remained in dispute.ursula also contends the monthly child support awarded was deficient and was based on an erroneous interpretation of ryan reasonable needs.finally,she argues the suspension of child support payments while ryan participated in the afs program in japan was erroneous.
in his appeal,william insists the monthly support order was excessive by a factor of.
the guideline child support calculation must be tethered to the supporting parent actual income.
family code section sets forth a statewide uniform guideline for determining the appropriate amount of child support.the term guideline,however,is a euphemism.the support amount rendered under the guideline algebraic formula is intended to be presumptively correct in all cases,and only under special circumstances should child support orders fall below the child support mandated by the guideline formula,subd.k see also,subd.a.one special circumstance involves cases where evidence shows that the application of the formula is unjust or inappropriate under the circumstances because t he parent being ordered to pay child support has an extraordinarily high income and the amount determined under the formula would exceed the needs of the children,subd.b.
even under such circumstances,however,t o comply with federal law,the court shall state whenever it is ordering an amount for support that differs from the statewide uniform guideline formula the amount of support that would have been ordered under the guideline formula the reasons the amount of support ordered differs from the guideline formula amount and the reasons the amount of support ordered is consistent with the best interests of the children,subd.a.the statutory findings are mandatory.the failure to make them precludes effective appellate review and may constitute reversible error if the missing information is not otherwise discernible from the record.see in re marriage of hall th,d rojas mitchell th,d.
the supporting parent who seeks to rebut the statutory formula and gain protection from disclosure of detailed financial information as an extraordinarily high earner must show he or she has an extraordinarily high income,and the guideline support amount exceeds the child needs.when the extraordinarily high earning supporting parent seeks a downward departure from a presumptively correct guideline amount,it is that parent burden to establish application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate,and the lower award would be consistent with the child best interests.county of stanislaus gibbs th,d,subd.k,subd.b,and,subd.a.
william status as an extraordinarily high earner is conceded.thus,the issue we address is whether william,as an extraordinarily high earner who admits an ability to pay any amount of child support,may refuse to reveal his actual income where the appropriate amount of child support remains disputed.
an award of child support rests in the court sound discretion and can not be overturned absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.an appellate court does not substitute its own judgment rather it interferes only if no judge could reasonably have made the order under the circumstances.in re marriage of catalano d.however,before a court may exercise its discretion to determine that a deviation from the guideline is warranted under the circumstances,it must first calculate the amount of support required by strict adherence to the guideline.in other words,only after the guideline formula is computed on a legitimate evidentiary basis as to the supporting parent income may a court conclude that the guideline amount exceeds the child reasonable needs.in re marriage of whealon th,d johnson superior court th,d.the family code similarly supports such a conclusion.under section,if the amount of support ordered differs from the statutory formula,the court shall state,in writing or on the record,the amount of support that would have been ordered under the guideline formula,subd.a.
accordingly,we agree with ursula contention that,absent a stipulation between the parties as to the appropriate amount of support,she and the court are entitled to know william actual income,regardless of his admission he can pay any reasonable child support ordered.concluding to the contrary,the court relied heavily on estevez superior court th,d,decided not long after the enactment of the mandatory child support guideline formula.that reliance was misplaced.
in estevez,the noncustodial supporting parent estevez resisted disclosing specific information about his lifestyle and financial status.instead,he unilaterally stipulated his gross income was not less than million per year.estevez,supra,th at,d.estevez also stipulated he could pay any reasonable child support award,and told the court he would willingly accede to any order it might make,even one in excess of the amount called for by the guideline formula,so long as the award addresse d the reasonable needs of the children commensurate with his status as an extraordinarily high earner.id.at,d.in that case,the custodial parent salley conceded estevez had an extraordinarily high income,and she was not dissatisfied with the amount of the total support package,which exceeded per month for two children.rather,salley took issue with the manner in which the child support was disbursed id.at,d.under the circumstances,the reviewing court held detailed financial discovery was irrelevant to a determination of a child support amount paid by an extraordinarily high earner who stipulated he could and would pay any reasonable amount of child support id.at,d.estevez finessed the issue of the statutorily required findings by concluding if the extraordinarily high earning parent challenged the amount of child support as unreasonable he would be required to disclose the necessary financial data required to enable the court to apply the guideline formula.id.at,fn,d.alternatively,the court of appeal concluded the judicial findings required by section could be satisfied if the trial court simply made the least beneficial assumptions as to the high earner net disposable income,federal status,and deductions from gross income.id.at,d.
estevez did not resolve the conflict presented here between the custodial parent right to discovery and the noncustodial supporting parent right to privacy,where a discrepancy e
