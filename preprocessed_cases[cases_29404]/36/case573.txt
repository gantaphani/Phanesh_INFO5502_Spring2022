appellant annemarie schilders appeals several orders made by the family court about a year after the entry of a stipulated judgment of dissolution of her marriage to respondent steven stupp.schilders challenges orders giving stupp temporary sole legal custody of the parties child,requiring that only the parents transport the child to his therapy appointments,continuing a custody trial,requiring schilders to undergo a vocational evaluation,and reserving jurisdiction over the allocation of the cost of the evaluation.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the family court abused its discretion in ordering the vocational evaluation when there was no support motion pending,and we will reverse that order.consequently,we need not reach the issue of allocating the evaluation cost.we will dismiss the appeal as to the remaining orders because they are not appealable.
factual and procedural background 
in september,stupp filed a petition for the dissolution of his marriage to schilders.ever since,the parties have been involved in contentious legal proceedings a stipulated judgment of dissolution was entered on march,but custody of the parties child,who was just a few months old when the original petition was filed,remains subject to temporary orders.since june,when schilders appealed from the stipulated judgment see stupp schilders,nonpub.opn,she has initiated more than a dozen further appeals and submitted several writ petitions 
discussion 
a.the february,temporary custody orders are not.additional factual and procedural background 
the march stipulated judgment of dismissal incorporated a july temporary custody order under which stupp and schilders shared joint legal and physical custody of their child.except in case of emergency,stupp had sole authority to schedule the child medical appointments.the child was to reside with stupp,and a schedule was established for schilders to have visits with the child on an increasing basis.by,schilders would be with the child on tuesdays during the day,and on alternating weekends from friday morning to monday morning,with thursday overnights in the weeks preceding stupp weekends.the goal of the schedule was to move toward a schedule of more equal joint custody in the future.
on november,after providing the required notice,stupp submitted an ex parte request for an order awarding him temporary sole legal custody of the child the request was supported by declarations from stupp and his attorney,and by a declaration from an attorney for the san carlos school district who described difficulties in scheduling meetings about the child individualized education plan iep.on november,the family court filed an order granting stupp temporary sole legal custody of the child,and scheduling a hearing for december,in advance of the december hearing,schilders filed a responsive declaration objecting to stupp request and requesting an evidentiary hearing,and also filed a declaration from one of her friends in support of her objections.
at the december,hearing,the family court agreed to set an evidentiary hearing,and pronounced a temporary order granting sole legal custody to stupp,with the condition that stupp enroll the child in the san carlos school district within the next two to four weeks.the court explained that the purpose of the order was so that stupp can arrange to get the minor child enrolled in school,deal with the iep process and continue to deal with weiss as to therapy for the minor child.the family court also stated that t he amount of difficulty and the obstruction of virtually every request of stupp that is in the best interest of the minor child by schilders has been outrageous frankly and that the basis for this court ruling.the court ordered that stupp or schilders transport the child to therapy appointments with weiss.the evidentiary hearing,for which schilders requested six days,was set for april,in consultation with the parties.a written version of the court orders was filed on february.
schilders argues that the family court erred in awarding stupp temporary sole legal custody and in ordering that only the parents transport the child to his therapy appointments.she argues that these custody orders are appealable as postjudgment orders pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.after she filed her opening brief,stupp filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as to those orders,arguing that because they are interlocutory,temporary orders they are not appealable.we took the motion under submission for determination with the merits,and we now grant it.
as we have stated previously in this matter code of civil procedure section,subdivision a permits the immediate appeal of postjudgment orders,but this does not literally mean that any order after a previous judgment is appealable.to be appealable,a postjudgment order must meet certain requirements.citation.some postjudgment orders are not appealable because,although following an earlier judgment,they are more accurately understood as being preliminary to a later judgment,at which time they will become ripe for appeal.such postjudgment orders lack finality in that they are also preparatory to later proceedings.in re marriage of ellis th,citing and quoting lakin watkins associated industries cal th.furthermore,it is that temporary custody orders are not appealable.lester lennane th,lester.
here,the family court stated on the record that it was making temporary orders with respect to custody of the party child,pending an evidentiary hearing that was scheduled for april.because these are temporary custody orders preliminary to a later determination of custody,the orders are not appealable.
schilders argues that the orders here are appealable as postjudgment orders modifying custody.we are not persuaded.relying primarily on enrique angelina th,a case in which the court of appeal ruled that a postjudgment custody order was appealable,she argues that because the february,order was made after contested hearings on custody,which were held in july and july,it is an appealable modification of a final judgment.enrique,however,is distinguishable,because the orders appealed in that case were not temporary.id.at.the court in enrique distinguished lester as a case concluding a temporary custody order is not appealable.ibid.because the orders here are temporary,they are like the orders in lester and unlike the orders in enrique 
schilders argues that public policy favors appealability of an order for legal custody of a child.she fails to support this argument with any authority,and she fails to acknowledge authority to the contrary i f the law left any room for doubt whether temporary custody orders are appealable,policy considerations would resolve the doubt.the very nature of such orders compels the swiftest possible review of any challenge.the writ process,not the appeal process,is the way to get that review.lester,supra,th at.
schilders contends that the orders here are neither temporary nor preliminary,but these contentions lack merit.schilders contends that the orders are not temporary because they are not pending anything,and that the orders are not preliminary to anything.stupp is granted sole custody,and then he just gets to keep it indefinitely.that as permanent as all child custody orders get.schilders contentions are belied by the family court statement that stupp was granted sole legal custody of the child on a temporary basis,pending an evidentiary hearing.
in her opposition to the motion to dismiss,and also in her reply brief on appeal,schilders argues that the orders are appealable because they are void.we are not persuaded.schilders provides no authority to support her contention that an order that is not otherwise appealable becomes appealable because it is claimed to be void.see varian medical systems,delfino cal th,a void judgment or order is appealable if that judgment or order is otherwise appealable italics added witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,i f a judgment or order meets the statutory test of appealability,final judgment,or order expressly made appealable,an appeal lies even though it is void italics added.
schilders claims for the first time in her reply brief that the orders are void because they were made by a disqualified judge,because they are based on no substantial evidence and upon denial of schilders right to a fair and full opportunity to present evidence.we will not consider points raised for the first time in a reply brief absent a showing of good cause for the failure to present them earlier.allen city of sacramento th,allen.schilders contends that when the record in this appeal was filed it was not known that judge susan greenberg,who decided the appealed orders was disqualified at the time she held the hearings and made the decisions signed into the orders that are appealed.but contrary to schilders contentions,it has not been established that judge greenberg was disqualified furthermore,schilders offers no justification for her delay in arguing that the order is void for lack of substantial evidence.even if we were to consider schilders arguments,we would find them unpersuasive in view of schilders failure to provide authority that an otherwise nonappealable order becomes appealable because it is void.
accordingly,we will dismiss schilders appeal of the february,orders granting stupp sole legal custody and requiring only the parents to transport the child to therapy.as temporary custody orders,preliminary to further proceedings at which custody will be determined,the orders are not appealable even though they are postjudgment orders.
b.the april,order continuing the trial is not appealable 
additional factual and procedural background 
on january,stupp submitted a request for orders vacating the april,trial date,which had been set at the december,hearing,and resetting it after the resolution of schilders pending appeals of the stipulated judgment and other custody orders.stupp noted that although the court had ordered a custody evaluation to address issues of legal and physical custody,the court subsequently ordered that the evaluation not take place because of a pending appeal.stupp argued that since the evaluation had not occurred there was no updated expert report or testimony to present at a trial on the issue of legal custody,and he asked that a hearing on his request be set on shortened time.
the family court scheduled a february,hearing on stupp request,and in advance of the hearing,schilders filed a responsive declaration and memorandum of points and authorities in opposition.
at the beginning of the february,hearing,the family court judge said that she was inclined to vacate the trial date.schilders attorney argued against that,and said,what the court ought to do in my view,your honor,is to stay the trial or postpone the date to approximately when the court foresees a decision coming down from the court of appeal.schilders attorney pointed out that there were three appeals pending,and she was about to file a fourth.the family court judge agreed with schilders attorney so it would seem to me that vacating is probably not the right term for the trial.i agree it should be continued to a time after the appeal with regard to the issues of custody and visitation that has been completed.
after discussion about the amount of time it might take for the appeals to be resolved,schilders attorney said,i will suggest to the court to set a date that can always be changed.the judge agreed.stupp counsel suggested a date in october,schilders counsel said she did not know if the appeal would be completed by then,but we can always have a status conference and change the date.the family court then continued the trial to october.a written version of the court order was filed on april.
schilders argues that the family court erred in continuing the trial that was scheduled for april,while maintaining the temporary order granting sole legal custody of the child to stupp.she contends that by continuing the trial while maintaining the existing temporary custody order,the court was making a postjudgment custody order,and that the order is appealable as a postjudgment custody order.stupp argues that schilders lacks standing to appeal the order,claiming that she is not aggrieved by the order because she requested a continuance of the hearing and stipulated to the new date,and further argues that the order is not appealable because it is an interlocutory order,preliminary to holding an evidentiary hearing on custody.we agree with stupp,and therefore we will dismiss the appeal as to this order.
because she specifically urged the family court to stay the trial or postpone the date to approximately when the court foresees a decision coming down from the court of appeal,and stipulated to the new trial date of october,while stating that the family court can always have a status conference and change the date,schilders has no standing to appeal the order continuing the trial.see code civ.proc.aggrieved party has standing to appeal papadakis zelis d,party can not appeal from judgment to which he stipulated.schilders offers no legal authority that holds otherwise.standing to appeal is a jurisdictional matter sabi sterling th,and in the absence of jurisdiction over an appeal we must dismiss.
schilders argues that she did not request a continuance,claiming that the family court was initially inclined to take the trial off calendar,and then suggested waiting for a ruling from the court of appeal.in those circumstances,schilders says,her only options were to have the trial taken off calendar entirely or continued,and in those circumstances,of course she preferred a date on the calendar.this was not a choice,however.we disagree.at the hearing on april,schilders made a tactical choice to abandon the argument that the april trial had to go forward as scheduled,which she had advanced in papers filed with the family court on february.she chose instead to ask for a continuance.the family court made an order granting her request,and schilders can not now appeal that order.
schilders only response to stupp argument that the order is temporary and interlocutory lacks merit.citing no authority,schilders claims the order is not temporary in the sense of a definite end,a condition that would cause it to end,or a short duration.the trial is continued five months after the order for sole legal custody to stupp has already been in place since november.that is not a short duration.then,on june,the court took the matter entirely off calendar.we can,and do,treat arguments unsupported by legal authority as forfeited.allen,supra,th at.in any event,existing authority undermines schilders position an order granting or denying a continuance is not itself appealable,though it may be reviewed on appeal from a related judgment or order.see freeman sullivant th.
accordingly,we will dismiss the april,order continuing the trial,because schilders lacks standing to appeal it,and because the order is in any event a nonappealable interlocutory order.
c.the family court erred in ordering a vocational evaluation 
additional factual and procedural background 
in a written request for orders,stupp asked the family court to order schilders to undergo an immediate vocational evaluation pursuant to family code section.stupp argued that the vocational evaluation was appropriate because schilders had appealed the support orders incorporated in the stipulated judgment,including provisions imputing income to her schilders opposed the request,arguing that there was no legal or factual basis for ordering a vocational evaluation in view of the stay pending appeal of the stipulated judgment.
at the hearing,schilders counsel argued that the family court had no power to order a vocational assessment because there was no motion pending regarding spousal support or child support schilders counsel also argued that ordering a vocational evaluation would violate the existing stay arising from schilders appeal of the stipulated judgment insofar as the evaluation was relevant to spousal support,because the spousal support terms of the stipulated judgment were being appealed.the family court disagreed i do think ordering a vocational evaluation at this stage is a violation of the stay on appeal.there is a judgment from.the f
