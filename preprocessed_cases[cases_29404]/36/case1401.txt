in this grandparent visitation case,appellants james and sharon duckham together the duckhams are the paternal grandparents of cassandra,a minor,who lives with her father,russell ross father.after they joined father paternity action as third party claimants,the court issued an order granting the duckhams liberal visitation with cassandra under a stipulation they entered into with father and cassandra mother,rebecca kelley mother.
at a later hearing on an order to show cause osc to modify mother visitation rights,issued at father request,the court decided sua sponte that under recent case law rendered by the united states supreme court and this appellate court,it no longer had power to order grandparent visitation.the court terminated the duckhams visitation with cassandra without giving the parties an opportunity to brief the issue.father and the duckhams jointly filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order terminating the duckhams visitation.the court denied the motion.
the duckhams appeal from both the order terminating their visitation with cassandra and the order denying their motion for reconsideration.they contend the court had no jurisdiction to terminate their stipulated visitation rights without giving all parties notice and an opportunity to be heard the court belief that it had no power to order grandparent visitation,and the court order terminating their visitation,were contrary to law and the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.neither father nor mother has responded to this appeal,and counsel for cassandra urges that the orders in question be reversed.
we reverse the order terminating grandparent visitation and hold that the court abused its discretion by denying the duckhams stipulated grandparent visitation with cassandra based upon the erroneous legal conclusion that,under troxel granville,d troxel and this court decision in punsly ho th,d punsly,it had no power to order such visitation.the appeal from the denial of the motion for reconsideration is moot.
