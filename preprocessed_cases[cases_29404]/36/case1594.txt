this is a dependency appeal by hermila,the mother of the two minor dependents in the case,jessica and maria g.we follow the recent decision of the fifth district court of appeal in in re sara th,d,and conclude that mother due process rights were violated by the trial court appointment of a guardian ad litem.we reverse.
factual and procedural summary 
the appeal is taken from an order terminating parental rights,made under section of the welfare and institutions code.further statutory citations are to that code unless another is indicated.two children are involved.
the initial petition was filed under section,in june.it asked the court to assert dependency jurisdiction over two children,jessica and jc.at the time,the children were,respectively,years and years old.the petition alleged that both were exposed to violent confrontations and other domestic disturbance between mother and juan,the man with whom she was living.juan is the father of jc.there were allegations of sexual abuse and threats by juan against jessica.it also was alleged that jc suffered from myoclonic encephalopathy which requires medical treatment,and that mother was neglecting his needs by failing to the child prescriptions.his status is not before the court in this appeal.
the initial dependency hearing was conducted the day after filing.counsel was appointed for mother at the proceeding.mother was assisted then,and at all court proceedings,by a qualified spanish language interpreter.the court asserted jurisdiction,and gave temporary custody of the children to the los angeles department of children and family services the department,which was authorized to release them to mother provided she obtain a new residence that was confidential as to juan g.after that,the case followed the familiar course of dependency proceedings,at which periodic reviews are prepared and hearings held as the case proceeds slowly toward resolution.
a second dependency petition was filed later in june,upon the birth of maria,the third child born to mother,and the second dependent in this appeal.the allegations were similar to those in the previous petition,except that it added that maria was born with a positive toxicology screen.the court asserted dependency jurisdiction over this child as well.a few months later,specialized medical treatment was ordered for jc.
the social study reports and other information periodically given to the court displayed efforts by mother to comply with plans and programs designated for her by the department.her compliance generally was less than satisfactory.she enrolled in programs but did not complete them she tested negative for narcotics,but did not always test.she had difficulty finding a suitable residence.and she reported continual physical abuse by juan,with attendant fear.there were reports that juan resumed living with mother at times.mother was afraid of notifying authorities of his presence because he hurt her and carried a knife.jessica confirmed juan violent attacks on mother.juan also was a drug user.on one occasion,mother stood on railroad tracks,refusing to move,and suffered injuries when struck by an oncoming train.mother kept her visitation appointments with the children,except when she was hospitalized as a result of injuries suffered from the train incident.she was affectionate and concerned about their welfare.
a report prepared for the review hearing in march stated that mother intended to enroll in parenting classes had not enrolled in domestic violence classes because of lack of funds had tested negative for drugs and was dedicated to regaining custody of her children,with whom she continued to visit.shortly after that,it was reported that she had returned to a cruelty prevention program,and had enrolled in parenting,individual therapy and domestic violence classes,as well as a drug awareness program.a psychological evaluation reported that she cared deeply about her children.it recommended that she have continued monitored visitation with them,although reunification was considered unlikely.the court found that return of the children to mother would be detrimental,that mother was not complying with the reunification plan,and that there was no substantial probability that the minors would be returned to her if she were given an additional six months of reunification services.the court terminated reunification services,and scheduled a permanency planning hearing for july.
the report prepared for that hearing stated that jessica remained at the foster home where she had resided since becoming a dependent,that maria was at another home,and jc at still another.mother continued her visitations,but her program attendance was irregular.she had been hospitalized for fainting and bronchitis.the social worker believed jessica to be adoptable,although jessica did not want to be adopted and her foster parents did not want to adopt her.maria foster parents were interested in adopting her.the social worker recommended foster care for all three children,and monitored visitation by mother.
at the july hearing,the matter was put over until january due to lack of notice to the fathers.the department was ordered to try to find an adoptive home for jessica and maria,and monitored visits by mother were to continue.mother kept those visits,and jessica was now more attached to her than before.but jessica still did not want to live with mother because she was afraid of juan by then,jessica and maria were in the same foster home.mother had been hospitalized twice in december,once for depression and again for breathing problems.her class attendance was sporadic,but marginal progress was noted.she received a certificate for attending a year of parenting classes.when she visited the children she was loving toward them and brought small gifts.jessica would play with her,but maria ignored her.
mother appeared at the january,hearing,as she had at the other hearings.the court put the section hearing over until march and later,to april.it was at the january hearing that a guardian ad litem was appointed for mother.mother appeared at the april hearing,with both her attorney and the guardian ad litem.testimony was taken,after which the court made a section order terminating mother parental rights.she filed a notice of appeal from that order on april.
discussion 
on appeal,mother argues that the appointment of a guardian ad litem violated her constitutional due process rights that it was not supported by substantial evidence and,on the merits,that the trial court erred in failing to find a benefit exception under section,subdivision c a.only the first of these claims requires discussion,since it is dispositive.
there is very little case law on appointment of a guardian ad litem for an adult parent in the context of dependency proceedings.in re sara,supra,th,d sara is an exception.we follow the thorough and persuasive analysis of that case.
sara arose out of a guardian ad litem appointment made at a dispositional hearing.sara,supra,th at,d.the need for an appointment had been discussed between the court and counsel in chambers,outside the mother presence,and almost nothing beyond the bare appointment order occurred in open court.id.at,d.as we shall discuss,the circumstances of sara differ from the case before us only in form.
the general authority for appointment of a guardian ad litem is code of civil procedure section.that statute does not explicitly discuss the grounds for appointment,beyond a requirement that it be expedient.instead,the provision concentrates on the kinds of persons for whom a guardian may be appointed minors,incompetents,conservatees,and the authority of the guardian.the bases for appointment are treated in two other statutes,probate code section and penal code section.
the sara court concluded that either of these laws may apply to dependency proceedings.th at,d.whichever is used,the basis for appointment is incompetence of the parent for whose benefit it is to be made.the test for incompetence in this context is whether the party has the capacity to understand the nature or consequences of the proceeding,and is able to assist counsel in preparation of t
