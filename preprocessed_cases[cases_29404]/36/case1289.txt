introduction 
carlos legal guardian,barbara,has petitioned for extraordinary relief pursuant to california rules of court,rule.she seeks review of the juvenile court order terminating reunification services and setting a permanency planning hearing under welfare and institutions code section barbara contends the juvenile court abused its discretion when it found that,although the alameda county social services agency agency failed to provide her with reasonable reunification services,no further services would be provided.she also argues that the juvenile court erred in finding the return of carlos to her would create a substantial risk of detriment to his safety,protection,or physical or emotional.we conclude that the termination of barbara status as carlos legal guardian is not governed by section and she is not entitled to reunification services.we,therefore,deny the writ.
ii.factual and procedural background 
we are familiar with this matter because in case no.we considered the agency appeal challenging the juvenile court finding,made at the review hearing stage,that the agency failed to provide barbara,with reasonable services 
carlos is now seven years old.he was born with multiple birth defects resulting in abnormal intestines and the absence of an anus.as a result of this condition,when he was an infant he required a colostomy bag,a feeding tube connected to his stomach,and an iv line to his head.his early daily care was extraordinarily complex and taxing.because his parents were unable to provide him with the care he required,carlos was detained when he was four months old.
the agency filed a petition under section and carlos was declared a dependent of the court.his parents were provided with reunification services and carlos was placed in foster care.barbara and her partner,ruth,were carlos foster parents.
at the review hearing,carlos mother was still unable to perform all the procedures necessary to care for him and the court granted another six months of services.ultimately,reunification services to carlos parents were terminated.at an uncontested section hearing,the court appointed barbara and her partner as carlos legal guardians.the court did not terminate carlos parents parental rights.the court dismissed the dependency,and retained jurisdiction of the guardianship under section.letters of guardianship were issued on september.
by all accounts,carlos required full time physical care in his early years.barbara is a retired pediatric nurse and cared for carlos with some assistance from others.in and,barbara experienced a series of physical and psychological difficulties,including the loss of leg function which resulted in paraplegia,as well as diabetes,high blood pressure,a brain surgery that led to her becoming legally blind,depression,anxiety and suicidality.she also obtained a restraining order against her partner after she was verbally and physically abused by her.in,the agency filed and then dismissed a dependency petition.the agency thereafter offered barbara informal supervision.
in july,barbara admitted herself to the hospital.she reported that she had been without any nursing assistance for several weeks and had been caring for carlos around the clock.as a result,both she and carlos were suffering emotionally.carlos was detained and the agency filed a section petition.carlos was placed in the home of marie apparently because of the rigor of caring for him,carlos also lived in the home of another foster parent,several days a week.
barbara stipulated to jurisdiction in october.the court found that there was clear and convincing evidence that placement with barbara would be detrimental to carlos safety,protection and.the court ordered visitation and reunification services be provided to barbara.
a review hearing was held beginning on january.after many continuances and extensive testimony,this hearing concluded on september.on that day,the juvenile court found that reasonable services had not been provided to barbara.specifically,the court found that the agency had departed from the court visitation order without seeking any modification of that order.the court ordered six more months of reunification services.
at the review period,the agency reported that barbara had not made substantial progress in complying with her case plan and had not alleviated or mitigated the causes necessitating placement.the agency recommended that barbara guardianship be set aside and that she not be provided with any further reunification services.the agency also recommended that carlos be permanently placed with his current foster parents,marie and her husband.
however,no review hearing was held.instead,barbara and the agency stipulated that barbara would be provided with further reunification services.the parties agreed that their goal would be to return carlos to barbara before the review hearing.carlos foster parents and barbara were ordered to engage in mediation with a focus of rebuilding their relationship and to discuss issues of boundaries and,if and when appropriate.
the agency filed an review hearing report on december.in this report,the agency recommended that carlos remain in his placement and that barbara receive six more months of reunification services.the agency asked the court to make the findings typically made prior to a permanency planning hearing including findings that carlos return to barbara would create a risk of detriment to his safety and that barbara had been provided with reasonable reunification services.
in an addendum report filed on january,the agency recommended for the first time that a permanent planned living arrangement be approved in which carlos foster parents be appointed to serve as his legal guardians.the agency continued to recommend that barbara receive six additional months of services,pursuant to e.the agency noted that t he minor has a significant relationship with barbara a.it is in the best interest of carlos that develop a workable relationship with the foster parents the proposed future legal guardians.continuation of services to will enable the child welfare worker and dependency mediators among others to continue to address issues of visitation and future involvement with carlos once her guardianship is set aside.
the contested hearing began on february,and took place over the next seven months.during that time,the juvenile court heard extensive testimony,including medical testimony about barbara mental health.the matter was submitted on september.on december,the trial court found that carlos could not be returned to barbara because to do so would present a substantial risk of detriment to him.
in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that carlos is stable in his placement and his health in the care of his current foster parents.he is no longer chronically anxious and has displayed minimal to no anxiety during the past six months.he is mainstreamed in school and is doing well academically.the court also noted that the minor is growing older and maturing.he was approximately years old when removed from legal guardian care he is now seven years old.the court took note of the minor important attachments to both his foster parents and to 
the court described an evaluation of barbara and carlos conducted by a social worker at children hospital.this social worker concluded that while was making valiant efforts to recover from her profound and pervasive history that underlies unconscious processes,her decision to voluntarily place carlos should not be rescinded.the anxiety that carlos exhibits around barbara a in the playroom is indicative of risk that is still present in the relationship and that may become overwhelming once again if external circumstances deteriorate.the court also described other testimony that indicated that legal guardian physical,psychological and emotional condition has likewise stabilized.
the court concluded as follows in answering the question of whether there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the minor if returned to care the only conclusion that i could reach based on the record and the state of the evidence is,yes,there is.i can only answer yes because it is unknown to the court just what ability is to care for the minor.while i have a hunch that she might be able to adequately care for the minor,i do know,in fact,if she able to do so.there are still issues regarding her ability to refrain from discussing matters with carlos that make him anxious regarding her medical issues and his medical issues,as well as concerns about her ability to adequately provide for his care with the assistance of attendants,in addition to concerns about her ability to keep an alternate personality under check with carlos.thus,given these concerns raised by the evidence,i believe that the agency has met its burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence.
the court also found that the agency had failed to provide barbara with reasonable reunification services.the court took the agency to task for failing to do its job to actively assist and follow through during the reunification process.in particular,the court pointed out that the agency had not facilitated visitation and had not initiated meaningful contact with barbara therapists to determine her progress and her ability to care for carlos.although the court recognized that it had the discretion to continue services,it refused to do so because almost months has now elapsed since the minor was removed from care,the minor is truly thriving in the home of the de facto parents,his anxiety has stabilized significantly decreased while i could extend this matter further and i certainly understand that i have the discretion to do so,i do not believe prolonging the matter is in carlos best interest.
the court set the matter for a permanency planning hearing under section with legal guardianship by carlos foster parents as the permanent goal.
this timely writ petition followed.
iii.discussion 
request for supplemental briefing 
in her writ petition,barbara challenges the juvenile court setting of this matter for a permanency planning hearing under section.she contends the juvenile court erred in doing so because substantial evidence does not support its finding that return of carlos to her presents a risk of harm.she also argues the court abused its discretion when it found she had not been provided with adequate reunification services and nevertheless refused to extend further services to her.
at no point in the extensive history of this case have the parties considered the implications of barbara status as carlos legal guardian.therefore,we asked the parties to brief the question of whether a legal guardian appointed by the juvenile court is entitled to reunification services and to discuss the procedure for terminating such a legal guardianship.they have done so.
we now conclude that barbara writ must be denied because,as carlos legal guardian,she has no right to reunification services and,therefore,can not challenge the adequacy of these services.similarly,we conclude that the juvenile court is not required to find that the return of a child to a legal guardian presents a risk of harm to the child before it terminates the legal guardianship and,therefore,barbara challenge to this finding is without merit.
creation and termination of legal guardianship by juvenile court 
barbara was appointed carlos legal guardian by the juvenile court at an uncontested permanency planning hearing set pursuant to section after reunification services to carlos parents were terminated.the court did not terminate carlos parents parental rights.the court dismissed the dependency,and retained jurisdiction of the guardianship under section.letters of guardianship were issued on september.the most fundamental question before the question the agency failed to answer correctly at the outset of this what route it should have taken once it understood,in,that barbara could not safely care for carlos.to answer this question,we must consider how a legal guardianship is created and terminated under the dependency statutes.
the juvenile court power to appoint a guardian for a child who has been detained is governed by sections and.under section,a legal guardianship may be ordered by the court if a dependent child parent or parents waive reunification or family maintenance services and agree to the guardianship.a legal guardianship may also be created following a parent failure to reunify with a child.when this occurs,section,subdivision a,provides that,as one of several options for permanency planning,the juvenile court may appoint a guardian for a dependent child and order that letters of guardianship issue.this is what happened in this case.
section provides that when a juvenile court orders a permanent plan of legal guardianship under either section or,the court retains jurisdiction over the child.after the legal guardianship is established,the court either continues jurisdiction over the child as a dependent child of the juvenile court or terminates the dependency and retains jurisdiction over the child as a ward of the legal guardianship.similarly,section provides that any minor for whom a guardianship has been established resulting from the selection of implementation of a permanency plan pursuant to section is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
sections and and california rules of court,rule c,describe the procedure for terminating a legal guardianship.most basically,a proceeding to terminate a legal guardianship created under section or section must be held in the juvenile court,unless the termination is due to an adoption or to the child emancipation,subd.b.an application to terminate a guardianship created by the juvenile court is governed by section.section provides that a juvenile court may change an earlier issued order,such as an order creating a legal guardianship,i f it appears that the best interests of the child may be promoted by the proposed change of order,subd.c.california rules of court,rule c,provides that the juvenile court has three options in ruling on a petition to terminate a guardianship it may grant the petition,deny the petition or d eny the petition and request the county welfare department to provide services to the guardian and the ward for the purpose of maintaining the guardianship,consistent with section.cal.rules of court,rule c b.california rules of court,rule f,provides that the petitioner requesting the modification under section has the burden of proof.
section also provides that,before the juvenile court may hold a hearing on a petition to terminate a legal guardianship,it shall order the county department of social services to prepare a report for the court consideration that shall include an evaluation of whether the child could safely remain in the legal guardian home,without terminating the legal guardianship,if services were provided to the child or legal guardian.if applicable,the report shall also identify recommended services to maintain the legal guardianship and set forth a plan for providing those services,subd.b.
should the court terminate the legal guardianship,it may resume dependency jurisdiction over the child and order the county department of social services to develop a new permanent plan,to be presented to the court within days of the termination.if parental rights to the child have not been terminated,the child parents shall be given notice of the new permanency planning hearing,subd.b.
nowhere in the statutory guidelines related to the creation and termination of a legal guardianship in the juvenile court is there any requirement that a county department of social services provide reunification services before a legal guardianship is terminated.nor is there any requirement that the juvenile court make a finding that adequate reunification services were offered.in fact,as one court has pointed out,there is no requirement for reunification services anywhere in this statutory scheme.in re alicia th,d.at most,the juvenile court may order informal supervision of the legal guardian in order to assist in ameliorating the conditions that led to the request to terminate the legal guardianship 
thus,had the agency proceeded as the legislature intended under the dependency statutes after it detained carlos in it should have fi
