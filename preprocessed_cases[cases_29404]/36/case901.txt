this case requires us to construe family code section subject to the requirements of that provision,a marriage that is invalid due to a legal infirmity may be recognized as a putative marriage.property acquired during a putative marriage property is divided as if it were community property.
in this case,the parties marriage was invalid because respondent already had a wife when he married appellant.the trial court declared appellant a putative spouse.she appeals the judgment of nullity,challenging the determination that property acquired in her name during the union is property.
applying the unambiguous language of section,we conclude that the parties union is a putative marriage and that the property acquired during that union is property subject to division as community property.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual background 
in,appellant petra tejeda petra and respondent pablo tejeda pablo were married in las vegas.at the time of the marriage ceremony,and unbeknownst to petra,pablo was married to margarita rivera tejeda margarita.in,pablo petitioned to dissolve his marriage to margarita,and a judgment of dissolution was entered the following year.in,pablo and petra participated in a marriage ceremony in a mexican church,unaccompanied by any civil formalities.
the parties union lasted more than thirty years.during this time,petra and pablo had five children together.petra began acquiring real property in,taking title in her name,together with other relatives,but not with pablo.
procedural history 
in march,pablo filed an action to end his union with petra,petitioning for dissolution in san benito county.in a response filed in may,petra likewise requested dissolution of marriage.thereafter,she amended her response to seek a judgment of nullity of marriage.in october,after the action had been transferred to santa cruz county,petra filed another amended response.as before,petra requested a judgment of nullity.petra also requested that all property in her possession be confirmed as her separate property.
in january,the court conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine the validity of the marriage.
prior to the hearing,the attorneys for both parties submitted written briefing,which included both exhibits and arguments.petra argued that the union was bigamous and thus void under section.she asserted that pablo could not demonstrate the requisite reasonable good faith belief in the validity of the marriage required for putative spouse status under section.petra clarified that she was not seeking putative spouse status for herself.in his trial brief,pablo asserted his belief that he and petra were married.in any event,pablo maintained,fault is irrelevant in a putative marriage.
at the hearing,only petra testified at the time of her las vegas wedding,petra stated,she did not know that pablo was still married to margarita.pablo told petra that he was divorced.petra did not discover the truth until.up until then,petra testified,i thought i was married.
following petra testimony,the trial court made an oral finding that the marriage is either void or voidable because tejeda was already married.the court also found that at all times,tejeda believe d that she was married to someone who at the time of their marriage ceremony was single.that belief,the court said,was reaffirmed by her actions over some period of time such as filing joint tax returns,confirming her marital status for immigration purposes,taking pablo name,and using medical benefits under his insurance,social security benefits under his name.
given these factual findings,the court concluded,the matter was governed by section,which required the court to declare the party or parties to have the status of a putative spouse.the property thus was property.the court did not divide the property,observing that there might be defenses to the presumption of equal division,or tracing issues,or other questions concerning characterization.
in june,the court entered a judgment of nullity,which incorporated its earlier determinations.the court found that since either party here,specifically petra tejeda or both parties believed in good faith that the marriage was valid,the court was statutorily required to declare the party or parties to have a status of putative spouse.under the mandatory language of section,the court stated,it was obligated to find that the property of the parties is property.
this appeal ensued 
contentions 
petra asserts that the plain language of section is ambiguous,to the extent it is susceptible to the interpretation applied by the trial court.as a matter of legislative intent,she argues,the statute should only be applied at the request of the putative innocent spouse.
pablo disagrees,arguing that the statutory language is clear if either party or both parties have the status of a putative spouse,community property principles apply to the division of any property at issue.
discussion 
as a framework for our discussion,we begin by setting forth the legal principles that govern our analysis.we then apply them to this case.
legal principles 
putative marriages 
where a marriage is invalid due to some legal infirmity,an innocent party may be entitled to relief under the putative spouse doctrine.estate of depasse th,d accord,in re marriage of ramirez th,d.
legal infirmity 
invalid marriages include those that are void or voidable.in re marriage of vryonis d.bigamy renders the later marriage either void or voidable,depending on the circumstances,subd.a.one may never legally remarry prior to dissolution of his or her existing marriage.in re marriage of campbell th,d.
putative spouse doctrine 
under the equitable putative spouse doctrine,a person reasonable,good faith belief that his or her marriage is valid entitles that person to the benefits of marriage,even if the marriage is not,in fact,valid.in re domestic partnership of ellis th,d.
the putative spouse doctrine is an equitable doctrine first recognized by the judiciary,and later codified by the legislature.in re domestic partnership of ellis,supra,th at,d.in,the legislature codified the putative spouse doctrine in former civil code section as part of the family law act.ibid.prior to the enactment of the family law act,no statute granted rights to a putative spouse.the courts accordingly fashioned a variety of remedies by judicial decision.marvin marvin,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.some decisions affirmed the power of a court to employ equitable principles to achieve a fair division of property acquired during putative marriage.id.at.
codification was not intended to narrow the application of the doctrine only to parties to a void or voidable marriage.instead,the legislature contemplated the continued protection of innocent parties who believe they were validly married.in re marriage of vryonis,supra,d at.accord,in re domestic partnership of ellis,supra,th at,d estate of depasse,supra,th at,d.
the current version of the putative spouse doctrine is contained in section,subdivision a,which provides in relevant part if a determination is made that a marriage is void or voidable and the court finds that either party or both parties believed in good faith that the marriage was valid,the court shall declare the party or parties to have the status of a putative spouse.the language of this provision is almost identical to that of its predecessor,former civil code section,the original provision in the family law act.in re domestic partnership of ellis,supra,th at,d.
property is property acquired during the union which would have been community property or property if the union had not been void or voidable,subd.a see estate of leslie cal d,fn,estate of hafner d,fn.the theory of property equates property rights acquired during a putative marriage with community property rights acquired during a legal marriage.estate of vargas d.
upon declaration of putative spouse status,the court is required to divide the property as if it were community property,subd.a marvin marvin,supra,cal d at,fn,in re marriage of ramirez,supra,th at,d.thus,the share to which the putative spouse is entitled is the same share of the property as the spouse would
