introduction 
in this marital dissolution action,appellant michael carrasco challenges the trial court december,order directing respondent lily lim to pay him monthly temporary spousal support of and monthly child support of,based on lim earnings of per month while working an percent schedule as an attorney.carrasco contends that the trial court abused its discretion in calculating support on lim actual income of from her reduced work schedule,rather than her earnings capacity of approximately per month when employed as a attorney.
for reasons that we will explain,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in calculating lim support obligations on the basis of her reduced income and we will affirm the december,order.
ii.factual and procedural background 
lim and carrasco were married in and separated in.they have two children who were both under the age of five when carrasco filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on august.carrasco dismissed the petition without prejudice on august.the record reflects that after an attempt at reconciliation failed,lim filed a petition for dissolution of marriage on september.at the time lim petition was filed,carrasco was employed as a college professor with average monthly earnings of.lim was a partner in a law firm,where her monthly earnings averaged.
carrasco requests for support 
on september,carrasco filed an ex parte request for child custody,child support,visitation,and temporary spousal support.relevant to support issues,carrasco stated in his supporting declaration that he is a college professor who has a flexible work schedule and was generally responsible for the children care,such as feeding them their meals,bathing them,and putting them to bed.carrasco also stated that although lim is a practicing attorney able to work from home occasionally,her job still requires her to work extensive hours,and bill more than hours annually.the trial court set a hearing on an order to show cause why the relief sought by carrasco should not be granted.
in her responsive declaration filed in opposition to carrasco request,lim stated,with respect to support issues,that she agreed to pay guideline temporary child support in the amount of per month.lim also stated that she had been on a medical leave of absence from her job and intended to return to work on october,at employment,to allow her to care for the children during this difficult transition.due to her percent work schedule,lim gross monthly income would be reduced from approximately,to and she would no longer be eligible for a bonus.she sought an order denying temporary spousal support as a result of carrasco perpetrating acts of domestic violence against me,as well as violent behavior toward our children.
hearing on order to show cause 
at the hearing on the order to show cause held on november,the parties advised the trial court that they had resolved all issues with one exception.they requested that the court determine whether the award of temporary child and spousal support from november,forward should be based on lim salary or her reduced salary from her percent work schedule.
the trial court accepted lim offer of proof,as follows so if miss lim were to testify this afternoon,she would testify that she has been on medical leave since the domestic violence incident occurred at the end of september.she is scheduled to return to work on november at an percent reduced schedule.it was actually effective october,but her leave was extended to november s he employed as a lawyer partner her reduced schedule would result in an annual salary of.lim then introduced into a evidence a letter from her law firm,which the record reflects included an agreement between lim and her partners that her percent reduced schedule was effective november,
lim offer of proof also stated and she would testify that her reduction in her work schedule would be in her children best interests as it would allow lim a reasonable work schedule to care for their young children,who are ages and.she would testify that for the last fiscal year at her firm that was during the time their youngest child was adopted and brought to this country from china,she was only able to bill hours for that year.that was percent of the hour annual goal that required for partners.on,lim stated that she was only able to bill hours due to being off work for weeks,having a second child,and not having support from her spouse.when questioned by the court,lim made a further offer of proof that she would testify that to bill hours per year,she would have to work hours per week.
carrasco attorney stated in turn that the only offer of proof i have is my client maintains employment,just like he supposed to under the statute.i think that if the court were to allow lim to work less than her earning capacity,that would start a very dangerous precedent,and that would not be supported by the scope of the statutory law on this topic.
after hearing argument,the trial court ruled that it had the discretion to determine whether to apply actual income or whether to apply some kind of imputed income.the court further stated,it common knowledge among lawyers that the big firms generally require a lot of hours and that my questions of lim really were trying to get to that,as to what is full time work full time work is not a hour work week.full time work is a certain number of billable hours per year which a full time employee is required to work regardless of the number of hours that day and it does appear from the testimony today that an percent work load,which would be billable hours,really is going to take full time hours even working at percent time is going to be working a substantial amount of the time.so i do find that it in the best interests of the children that she work an percent work week,given that that is work at a big law firm so then the child support should be based on her actual income at a month 
support order 
the trial court issued its findings and order after hearing on december.regarding support issues,the order states child support and spousal support shall be calculated based on lim employment schedule,with earnings of per month commencing december,child support shall be paid from lim to carrasco in the amount of per month and temporary spousal support shall be paid by lim to carrasco in the amount of per month,for a total of per month,as shown in the dissomaster attached hereto as exhibit 
carrasco subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal from the december,order.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,carrasco chief contention is that the trial court erred by calculating lim temporary spousal support and child support obligations on the basis of her voluntarily reduced income from her percent work schedule.we will begin our evaluation with the applicable standard of review.
standard of review 
the standard of review that applies to an order for temporary spousal support is abuse of discretion.in re marriage of wittgrove th,d.i n exercising its broad discretion,the court may properly consider the big picture concerning the parties assets and income available for support in light of the marriage standard of living.citation.subject only to the general need and the ability to pay,the amount of a temporary spousal support award lies within the court sound discretion,which will only be reversed on appeal on a showing of clear abuse of discretion.citation.ibid.
child support awards are also reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton th,d cheriton.we observe,however,that the trial court has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation citation.furthermore,in reviewing child support orders we must also recognize that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.citations.citation.ibid.
this court has explained that t he abuse of discretion standard is not a unified standard the deference it calls for varies according to the aspect of a trial court ruling under review.the trial court findin
