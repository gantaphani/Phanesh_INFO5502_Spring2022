yelena choin choin,a native and citizen of russia,petitions this court for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia that denied her application for adjustment of status and ordered her removed.we have jurisdiction under.we grant choin petition and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are not in dispute.on december,choin arrived in the united states with her two children on a k visa as the fiancée of citizen albert tapia choin and tapia were married on february.on april,choin filed an application to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident.on april,five days short of two years from the date choin filed her application,and while she was still waiting to have an interview with the immigration and naturalization service ins on her application,choin and tapia were divorced.
on august,the ins denied choin application for adjustment of status because of her divorce.the department of homeland security subsequently began removal proceedings against choin.after a brief hearing,an immigration judge ordered choin removed.choin appealed to the bia,which dismissed her appeal.choin filed a motion for reconsideration,which the bia also denied.choin now petitions for review of both the original bia decision and the denial of her motion for reconsideration 
ii.discussion 
the government contends that a k visaholder is ineligible to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident if her marriage ends before the agency adjudicates her application for adjustment of status.to become a lawful permanent resident,the fiancée of a citizen must go through four steps.
first,the must obtain a k visa through a visa petition filed by her citizen fiancé.d.to obtain the visa,the couple must have met in person within two years of the filing of the petition and must have a bona fide intention to marry within ninety days of the arrival.d.
the second step towards permanent residency is marriage to the citizen.once the k visa is approved,the can legally enter the united states to get married.id.if the couple does not marry within ninety days of the entry,the is required to depart from the united states.id.
if the couple is married within ninety days,the spouse can take the third step and apply to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident.c.before,this application for adjustment of status was automatic.see matter of dixon,bia.in,however,in response to certain marriage fraud concerns,congress enacted the immigration marriage fraud amendments imfa.the imfa deleted the language that made adjustment of status for k visaholders automatic,and therefore required k visaholders,like other nonimmigrants,to adjust their status through the immigration and nationality act ina.see.congress also added ina d,which provided that k visaholders could adjust to permanent resident status only as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant to the citizen who filed the k visa petition.d.this means that an immigrant entering the country on a k visa can not adjust her status to that of a permanent resident based on a marriage to a person other than her original fiancé,or on any other basis.
the imfa also added a new fourth step to the process.now,k visaholders can first adjust only to conditional permanent resident status.d.section of the ina now provides that,for the first two years of permanent resident status,spouses of citizens are only conditional permanent residents.upon the anniversary of gaining conditional permanent resident status,the couple can jointly petition to have the conditional tag removed.c a.in the joint petition,the couple must affirm that they are still married and that they did not enter into marriage for immigration purposes.d.they must also provide information about their place of residence and their employment history over the previous two years.id.if the is unable to file the joint petition because her marriage has ended,she may apply for a waiver of the petition requirement by attesting that her marriage was entered into in good faith.c b.
choin eligibility 
choin complied with the statutory framework described above.based on a petition from her fiancé,choin successfully obtained a k visa.she entered the united states and married her fiancé within ninety days of her arrival.she filed the form to adjust her status to conditional permanent resident.the ins,however,did nothing about her application for almost two and a half years,and thus she never became a conditional permanent resident and never reached the fourth stage of the process.at issue is whether choin divorce after over two years of marriage made her ineligible to adjust to conditional permanent resident.
both the immigration judge ij and the bia found choin ineligible for adjustment of status under ina d because of her divorce.section d provides as follows 
the attorney general may not adjust the status of a k visaholder except to that of an alien lawfully admitted to the united states on a conditional basis under section of this title as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant to the citizen who filed the k visa petition.
d emphasis added.
this case thus turns on whether the ij and bia properly interpreted the as a result of the marriage of the nonimmigrant language in ina d.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,then the plain meaning of the statute controls.chevron natural res.def.council,d.both parties contend that the plain meaning of the statute supports their interpretation.we disagree,and conclude that the plain language of is ambiguous.nothing in the text of the statute definitively resolves the eligibility of a petitioner in choin circumstances the language of ina specifying that a nonimmigrant may adjust status as a result of the marriage can plausibly be interpreted in two ways.as the government argues,it could be interpreted to exclude those petitioners whose marriages no longer exist on the date of adjudication.on the other hand,as choin argues,it could also be interpreted to mean that the application must be based on the fact of the marriage.
the government contends that if the statute is ambiguous,we must defer to the agency interpretation under chevron.we disagree.when the bia advances its interpretation of an ambiguous statute in an unpublished decision,that interpretation is not entitled to chevron deference.see gonzales,cir.unpublished bia decisions are instead given skidmore deference,entitling the interpretation to a respect proportional to its power to persuade,at applying the deference scheme laid out in skidmore swift.under skidmore,our deference to the agency position is proportionate to the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,at.the bia decision here does not evidence significant consideration or thoroughness.the relevant analysis consists of two paragraphs that offer little explanation for why the bia reached its conclusion.our deference to the bia here is therefore based only on the inherent strength of the agency interpretation.
in weighing the strength of the parties competing interpretations,we consider the meaning of in light of the purpose of the statute and its context in the statutory scheme.see dolan postal,d interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.we conclude that the purpose and context of d do not support the government interpretation.
the purpose of the imfa was to deter marriage fraud and other immigration fraud.these amendments were necessary because,prior to enactment of the imfa,even a sham marriage to a united states citizen provided a ready and immediate path to lawful permanent resident status.see charles gordon,stanley mailman stephen,immigration law and procedure.congress therefore limited the path to permanent residency by providing that k visaholders
