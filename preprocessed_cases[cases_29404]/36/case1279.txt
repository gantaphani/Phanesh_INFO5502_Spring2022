hugo hugo,the boyfriend of rosa mother,mother of minors ashley and april,appeals orders declaring the minors to be dependents of the juvenile court and denying him reunification services.hugo contends the juvenile court erred in admitting the hearsay statements of april accusing him of sexually molesting her.he asserts that pursuant to the united states supreme court opinion in crawford washington,d,the admission of april testimony deprived him of his due process right to confrontation,and without the hearsay statements,the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he sexually molested april.hugo also challenges the denial of reunification services with regard to ashley,who is his biological child.he contends that the juvenile court erroneously determined that he was an alleged father,rather than a presumed father,and therefore erred in denying him reunification services.mother separately appeals,contending that substantial evidence did not support the juvenile court jurisdictional findings based on her conduct.
we affirm.the united states supreme court decision in crawford has no application here because the sixth amendment right of a criminal defendant to confrontation under the united states constitution does not extend to parents in state dependency proceedings.
in an unpublished part of this opinion,we find that the court did not err in denying hugo reunification services,as there was no evidence that hugo sought to take ashley into his home or was prevented from satisfying the requirements for presumed father status.as an alleged father,hugo was not entitled to reunification services.we also find that as to mother claim,substantial evidence supports the juvenile court jurisdictional findings based on hugo sexual abuse of april and mother failure to protect the children.
factual and procedural background 
rosa is the mother of april,born in april,and ashley,born in march.hugo is ashley father,and enrique is april father.the children came to the attention of the juvenile court on july,when the los angeles county department of children and family services the department filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section on their behalf based on allegations that hugo sexually abused april.
