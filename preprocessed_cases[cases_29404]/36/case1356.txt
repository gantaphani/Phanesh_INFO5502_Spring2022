under california law unmarried cohabiting couples who qualify as domestic partners are afforded rights and benefits not afforded to other unmarried couples including the right of the surviving partner to sue for the wrongful death of the other partner.an adult couple living together may qualify as a domestic partnership if they are of the same sex or one of them is at least years of age and eligible for benefits under the social security act based on age plaintiff,the surviving member of a cohabiting unmarried couple of opposite sex,neither of whom was over age,sued for wrongful death of his female partner.the trial court dismissed the suit because plaintiff lacked standing to sue under the wrongful death statute.
plaintiff appeal raises the following question if the state grants the right to sue for wrongful death to the surviving member of a domestic partnership may it constitutionally deny the same right to the surviving member of an unmarried cohabiting couple of opposite sex 
we hold the legislature had rational bases for extending the right to sue for wrongful death to survivors of registered domestic partnerships but not to cohabiting unmarried couples in general.therefore we affirm the judgment.
facts and proceedings below 
plaintiff verified complaint alleges the following facts which we accept as true for purposes of this appeal 
jack holguin and tamara booth were an unmarried couple who had lived together for three years at the time of booth death.during those three years they shared an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.they were jointly responsible for each other basic living expenses.neither holguin nor booth were married or a member of a domestic partnership or related by blood.each was over the age of and mentally competent.
booth was killed in a traffic accident when a big rig truck driven by defendant flores sideswiped booth car sending it spinning out of control and crushing it under the truck back wheels.
holguin seeks damages for booth death in this action for negligence against flores and the owner of the truck.
defendants demurred to holguin complaint solely on the ground he lacked standing to sue for booth wrongful death because he and booth were not married and were not domestic partners as the term is defined in section.
holguin alleges he and booth met all the statutory requirements necessary to register as a domestic partnership under section except the requirements related to gender and age.he contends extending the right to sue for wrongful death to some unmarried cohabiting couples but denying it to others solely on the basis of the couples gender or age denies the excluded couples the equal protection of the law guaranteed under the united states and california constitutions.
the trial court disagreed with this argument.it sustained the defendants demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment for defendants dismissing the complaint.holguin filed a timely appeal.
we affirm the judgment.the fact domestic partners are legally or practically prevented from marrying,while cohabiting couples of the opposite sex are not,provides a rational basis for extending the right to sue for wrongful death to the former but not the latter.in addition,married couples and domestic partners have publicly registered their legal relationship while cohabiting couples of the opposite sex have not,thereby providing an additional basis for recognizing the economic loss to the survivors of the former but not the latter.
discussion 
under current law holguin lacks standing to sue for booth wrongful death.
before turning to holguin constitutional arguments we look to see whether the trial court correctly held holguin lacks standing to sue for booth wrongful death under code of civil procedure section.the question arises because of ambiguities in the language used in that section and section pertaining to domestic partners and domestic partnerships.
california domestic partnership law.
in the year california became one of the first states to allow cohabiting adults of the same sex to establish a domestic partnership in lieu of the right to marry the statute also authorized domestic partnerships on the part of couples whose social security or supplemental security income benefits might be reduced or eliminated if they were to marry 
in creating the new status of domestic partnerships the legislature declared domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one another lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.to establish a domestic partnership both partners must meet the following qualifications share a common residence agree to be jointly responsible for each other basic living expenses incurred during the partnership not be married or a member of another domestic partnership not be related by blood in a way which would prevent them from being married under state law be at least years of age be of the same sex or one partner be over age and eligible for benefits under the social security act based on age be capable of consenting to a domestic partnership not have previously filed a declaration of domestic partnership which has not been terminated file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state 
persons desiring to become domestic partners must file a declaration of partnership with the secretary of state declaring they meet the criteria described in the preceding paragraph.upon receipt of a properly completed form the secretary is to register the declaration of domestic partnership in a registry of those partnerships 
a domestic partnership may be terminated if one partner mails a notice of termination to the other and is automatically terminated if one of the partners dies or marries or the partners no longer share a common residence.upon termination at least one partner is required to give notice to the secretary of state and to certain third parties.a former partner can not enter into a new domestic partnership until six months after the notice of termination is filed unless the partnership ended because of the death or marriage of a partner 
the domestic partnership law,as originally enacted,conferred few rights or benefits on the domestic partners other than the right to register as a domestic partnership it did not address discrimination against same sex couples or impose any new obligations on public or private entities except for the secretary of state duty to register the partnerships and their terminations.
effective in the year,the legislature amended the domestic partnership law to add a substantial number of new rights and obligations bringing domestic partnerships much closer to marriages.among other things the amendments enabled domestic partners to make medical decisions for each other,adopt their partner child,use sick leave to care for an ailing partner and participate in their partner conservatorship 
for our purposes,the significant amendment was the expansion of the categories of persons authorized to sue for wrongful death to include the surviving member of a domestic partnership we discuss that amendment in detail below.
to be entitled to sue for wrongful death as a surviving domestic partner the partners must have been a registered domestic partnership at the time of the decedent death.
code of civil procedure section states in relevant part a cause of action for the death of a person by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by t he decedent surviving domestic partner.for the purpose of this section,domestic partners has the meaning provided in section of the family code.section states in subdivision a domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one another lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.subdivision a does not say domestic partners must be of the same sex or one of them must be at least age and eligible for social security benefits.those criteria are contained in subdivision b of the statute which describes how a domestic partnership can be established and registered with the secretary of state 
the language of section,subdivision a appears definitional,domestic partners are and is separate from subdivision b definition of a domestic partnership which includes criteria of age and gender.it could be argued,therefore,the meaning of the term domestic partners for purposes of the wrongful death statute is any two adults who have chosen to share their lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.holguin complaint alleges he and booth had lived together for three years under just such a commitment.
on further analysis,however,we conclude that in order to be a domestic partner entitled to sue for wrongful death an individual must meet the criteria of subdivisions a and b.
the language of section unambiguously states its provisions are not to be interpreted as applying to unmarried cohabiting couples generally notwithstanding any other provision of this section,persons of opposite sexes may not constitute a domestic partnership unless one or both of the persons are over the age of.
the amendment which allowed a surviving domestic partner to sue for wrongful death was part of a series of statutory amendments in assembly bill number regular session enlarging the definition of a domestic partnership and expanding the rights and benefits of its members as previously explained,in order to qualify as a domestic partnership both partners must be of the same sex or one of them must be at least years of age and eligible for benefits under the social security act based on age the evidence is overwhelming that in adopting assembly bill number the legislature only intended to extend the rights and benefits of members of domestic partnerships as defined in section,not to create new rights and benefits for unmarried cohabiting couples in general.
the amendment to section,subdivision a made this intent plain.there the legislature stated registration as a domestic partner under this division shall not be evidence of,or establish,any rights existing under law other than those expressly provided to domestic partners in this division and any provision of law specifically referring to domestic partners.the legislative counsel restated this sentence in the positive this bill would expand the legal effect of the registration of a domestic partnership to any provision of law specifically referring to domestic partners.the wrongful death statute is a provision of law specifically referring to domestic partners.therefore,in order to sue under the statute the plaintiff must be a registered domestic partner of the decedent.the plaintiff can only be a registered domestic partner if he or she was of the same sex as the deceased partner or one of them was at least years of age and eligible for benefits under the social security act based on age.
the legislative history of assembly bill number also clearly reflects the legislature intent to confer additional rights and benefits only on members of registered domestic partnerships.
the assembly judiciary committee described the bill as seek ing to confer various new legal rights on registered domestic partners including rights to bring an action and recover damages for wrongful death and emotional distress.
the senate committee report on the bill explained that existing law defines domestic partners as two adults having a committed relationship and who file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state.the report goes on to note the bill would confer on couples most of the rights recognized under the law that pertain to married couples but that unmarried cohabitants would remain without any rights.according to the report the amendment to the wrongful death statute was triggered in part by the death of a san francisco woman mauled by two large dogs.the report noted the woman domestic partner has no right under existing law to assert a wrongful death claim against the owners of the vicious dogs that killed her partner.under this bill that domestic partner would be able to assert a wrongful death action.
for the reasons stated above we agree with the trial court conclusion holguin and booth fell in the category of unmarried cohabitants without any rights.therefore holguin does not have standing to sue for wrongful death under current law.
ii.excluding the surviving member of an unmarried cohabiting couple of opposite sex from the class of persons entitled to sue for wrongful death does not deny the survivor equal protection of the law.
as defendants correctly observe,the issue in this case is not the constitutionality of section limitation of domestic partnerships to same sex couples or couples in which at least one member is over age and eligible for social security act benefits.nothing in section prevents holguin from suing for booth wrongful death.furthermore,even if the legislature extended domestic partnerships to all cohabiting couples regardless of gender or age this would not entitle holguin to sue for booth wrongful death.the legislature could decide not to incorporate the broadened definition of domestic partners into the wrongful death statute.thus,the classification holguin objects to is the one made by code of civil procedure section which grants the right to sue for wrongful death to surviving spouses,surviving putative spouses and surviving domestic partners but not to surviving members of unmarried couples of opposite sex.
it is well settled under california law recovery for wrongful death is a legislatively created right and in creating such a right the legislature is not required to extend it to every conceivable class of persons who might suffer injury from the death of another the decision of the legislature as to just how far to extend a statutorily created right of action is conclusive,unless it appears beyond rational doubt that an arbitrary discrimination between persons or classes similarly situated has been made without any reasonable cause therefor.citations.thus california courts have found the equal protection clause does not stand in the legislature way if it wants to deny a cause of action for wrongful death to the parent of a stillborn fetus to a stepchild to a spouse whose marriage to the decedent has been dissolved or to an adopted child for the wrongful death of her natural mother 
not every restriction on the right to sue for wrongful death has passed constitutional muster,however.in levy louisiana the united states supreme court held a statute which allowed legitimate children to sue for the wrongful death of their mothers but denied that right to illegitimate children constituted an invidious discrimination against the latter when no action,conduct,or demeanor of theirs is possibly relevant to the harm that was done the mother.in glona american guarantee the court considered the of levy.it concluded there was no possible rational basis for allowing a mother to sue for the wrongful death of her legitimate child but not allowing her to sue for the wrongful death of her illegitimate child 
applying a rational basis test,california courts have consistently held it is not a violation of the right to equal protection to bar the surviving member of an unmarried cohabiting couple of opposite sex from asserting a cause of action for the wrongful death of the other member the last such case,however,was decided more than years ago thus we will revisit the question to determine whether,given subsequent developments,what was rational in is still rational today.
initially holguin contends he is being discriminated against because of his gender and age.therefore,we should not be inquiring whether denying him the right to sue for wrongful death has a rational basis but whether denying him that right is necessary to further a compelling,or at least substantial,state interest.we conclude the rational basis test is the proper test to apply.
as a general rule,the state may place persons in different classes and treat those classes differently so long as the classification and treatment are not arbitrary and rest on some ground of difference having a rational relationship to the object of the legislation some classifications,however,because of their very nature or effect are subjected to a higher level of scrutiny,requiring they be justif
