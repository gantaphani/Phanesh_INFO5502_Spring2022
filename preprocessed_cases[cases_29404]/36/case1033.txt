in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that a parent has a duty to protect his or her young child and may be criminally culpable on an aider and abettor theory for an assault causing death and on an implied malice theory for murder where the parent fails to take reasonably necessary steps for the child protection,so long as the parent,with ability to do so,fails to take those steps with the intent of facilitating the perpetrator assaultive offense.we hold that the evidence in this case was sufficient to support guilt for the child death on either theory.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we hold that the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on the defense of duress.we affirm.
factual and procedural summary 
anthony bill lopez was the father of six of appellant seven children,including her son isaac.although a court order prohibited appellant from allowing lopez to visit or stay at her apartment,he had stayed there for about a week before the homicide in this case.the court order also forbade any unmonitored contact between lopez and appellant children,and appellant was not permitted to act as the monitor.
on april,a social worker made an unannounced visit to the apartment.lopez hid in a bedroom closet,and appellant told the social worker that he was not in the home.the social worker did not notice any injuries on isaac during the visit.
on april,at about or,lopez immersed isaac in a tub of water and unspecified chemicals.lopez then threw him against a wall,in appellant presence.isaac had been crying,but stopped after he hit the wall.lopez went to sleep at about midnight that night,while appellant stayed up to watch isaac.
appellant described the events that followed during three interviews with police investigators.at trial,tapes and written transcripts of the interviews were presented to the jury without objection.at about on april,lopez woke to the sound of isaac crying.lopez said isaac might be hungry and asked appellant son christian to heat some food for him.isaac continued to cry after being fed.lopez punched isaac in the chest.appellant told lopez to leave isaac alone,and lopez told her to shut up and not get involved.
appellant neighbor kristal cardenas shared a wall with appellant.in the early morning hours of april,she heard a screaming child in appellant apartment and a series of thumps against the wall that lasted for three minutes.the thumps and the screams ceased simultaneously.
at about that morning,lopez said he would take care of isaac and told appellant to go to bed,which she did.isaac was strapped into a car seat at that point.an hour later,lopez woke appellant and told her isaac was not breathing.she got up and saw lopez administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation to isaac,who was lying on a towel.lopez told her he had wrapped a stuffed toy and a jacket around isaac because he would not stop crying.he told her not to use the phone and asked her to help him revive isaac,because otherwise,t hey going to take all the kids away.appellant and lopez immersed isaac in a bathtub filled with water.when that failed to wake isaac,lopez attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation again.isaac did not respond.lopez then poured rubbing alcohol on isaac body.he then wrapped isaac in a blanket and put him in a crib.
that day,appellant and lopez kept the other children in the apartment,telling them that isaac was at the hospital.at about that night,lopez left the apartment with christian to purchase gasoline.when lopez returned,he instructed appellant and the children to go to bed.appellant rose around the following morning and saw lopez in the kitchen.lopez said he was going to erase isaac identifying features,and he took isaac into the bathroom with the gasoline,a chair and a bucket.appellant stood outside the bathroom while lopez burned isaac body in the bucket.lopez brought the body out of the bathroom and began wrapping it in plastic,instructing appellant not to look.at around,he left the house with the body,the bucket and the chair.police officers subsequently arrested lopez and discovered isaac body in his van.
an autopsy revealed that isaac suffered blunt force injuries before he died,four of which were inflicted near the time of death and the remainder of which were inflicted no more than one day before death.the tissue connecting his upper lip to his gum was torn,and one of his teeth was chipped.the pathologist who conducted the autopsy concluded that all of the injuries,with the possible exception of one bruise on isaac back,were nonaccidental.
isaac lungs were blotchy and blood had pooled in them,indicating that he suffocated.his blood and stomach contained ethanol drinking alcohol,isopropanol rubbing alcohol,brompheniramine an antihistamine,and pseudoephedrine a decongestant.the pseudoephedrine was present in levels indicating that isaac had been fed between to milligrams of children medicine,which was between five to times the normal dosage for a child.in the opinion of the pathologist who conducted the autopsy,isaac had a lethal amount of pseudoephedrine in his system when he died.the pathologist concluded that isaac death was probably caused by a combination of suffocation,the pseudoephedrine overdose and his injuries.
on march,an information was filed charging appellant with one count of assault on a child under eight years of age resulting in death,one count of second degree murder and one count of willfully causing a child to suffer under circumstances likely to result in death,subd.a with an enhancement because death actually resulted.on june,a separate jury convicted lopez of one count of assault on a child under eight years of age resulting in death,one count of first degree murder during the commission of torture,subd.a,and one count of willfully causing a child to suffer under circumstances likely to result in death,subd.a with an enhancement for actually resulting in death.
at trial,the people theory was that lopez killed isaac and that appellant aided and abetted lopez by failing to perform her parental duty to protect isaac.over appellant objection,the court instructed the jury that appellant had a duty to take all steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to protect isaac from harm.also over objection,the court gave modified versions of caljic,and,to the effect that appellant failure to perform her duty would be the equivalent of an affirmative act for the purposes of finding aiding and abetting,implied malice and second degree murder.appellant requested that the court instruct the jury according to caljic the defense of duress,but the court refused.on january,the jury convicted appellant on all counts.this is a timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
appellant argues that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that a parent may be liable for aiding and abetting a crime and for second degree murder on an implied malice theory by intentionally failing to act to protect his or her child from harm.we review de novo whether jury instructions given correctly state the law on this issue.see people posey cal th,d.
a person who aids and abets the commission of a crime is a principal to that crime.p roof of aider and abettor liability requires proof in three distinct areas a the direct perpetrator actus crime committed by the direct perpetrator,b the aider and abettor mens of the direct perpetrator unlawful intent and an intent to assist in achieving those unlawful ends,and c the aider and abettor actus by the aider and abettor that in fact assists the achievement of the crime.citation.people perez cal th,d.a person who aids and abets a crime may be liable for any other offense that was a natural and probable consequence of the crime aided and abetted.citation.people mccoy cal th,d.w hen an individual criminal liability is based on the failure to act,it is well established that he or she must first be under an existing legal duty to take positive action.citations.people heitzman cal th,d,heitzman.
in people th,d swanson,the defendant was charged with committing a lewd or lascivious act on a child under.on two occasions,she stood by and said nothing while her boyfriend sexually fondled her daughter.the court extensively quoted state walden,in which the supreme court of north carolina held that a parent who is present while his or her child is being attacked,and who fails to take all steps reasonably possible to protect the child,commits an act of omission showing the parent consent and contribution to the crime being committed.swanson,supra,th at,d.citing section,subdivision a,the swanson court held that i n california,parents have a duty to exercise reasonable care,supervision,protection,and control over their minor child ren.swanson,at,d.the court concluded that there was probable cause for the charges against the defendant because her failure to perform that duty aided the crime by encouraging its commission.ibid.
based on swanson,the trial court gave the following special instruction to the jury 
the word act as used in these instructions includes an omission or failure to act in those situations where a person is under a legal duty to act.
a parent has a legal duty to his or her minor child to take every step reasonably necessary under the circumstances in a given situation to exercise reasonable care for the child,to protect the child from harm,and to obtain reasonable medical attention for the child.
the trial court also gave the following instruction based on caljic we have italicized the trial court additions 
a person aids and abets the commission of a crime when he or she 
with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator,and 
with the intent or purpose of committing or encouraging or facilitating the commission of the crime,and 
by act or advice or by omitting or failing to act in those situations where a person is under a legal duty to act,aids,promotes,encourages,or instigates the commission of the crime.
mere presence at the scene of a crime which does not itself assist the commission of the crime does not amount to aiding and abetting.
mere knowledge that a crime is being committed,and,in the absence of a legal duty,the failure to prevent it does not amount to aiding and abetting.
the trial court gave the following instruction based on caljic,which states in relevant part additions italicized 
malice is implied when 
the killing resulted from an intentional act or an intentional omission or intentional failure to act in those situations where a person is under a legal duty to act 
the natural consequences of the act or omission or failure to act are dangerous to human life and 
the act or omission or failure to act was deliberately performed with knowledge of the danger to,and with conscious disregard for,human life.
when it is shown that a killing resulted from the intentional doing of an act or the intentional omission or intentional failure to act with implied malice,no other mental state need be shown to establish the mental state of implied malice aforethought.
the trial court also gave the following instruction based on caljic additions italicized 
murder in the second degree is the unlawful killing of a human being when 
the killing resulted from an intentional act or an intentional omission or intentional failure to act in those situations where a person is under a legal duty to act 
the natural consequences of the act or omission or failure to act are dangerous to human life,and 
the act or omission or failure to act was deliberately performed with knowledge of the danger to,and with conscious disregard for,human life.
when the killing is the direct result of such an act or omission or failure to act,it is not necessary to prove that the defendant intended that the act or omission or failure to act would result in the death of a human being.
appellant argues these instructions are erroneous to the extent they provide for aider and abettor liability based on failure to act because the discussion in swanson is dictum on that issue.but the swanson court held not only that the evidence supported the inference that appellant affirmatively acted to aid her daughter molestation,but also,as an alternative basis for its conclusion,that her failure to act was a sufficient actus reus for this crime.swanson,supra,th at,d.when an appellate court bases its decision on alternative grounds,none is dictum.citation.people minor d.
appellant also argues that swanson was wrongly decided.she contends,first,that section,subdivision a is not authority for the conclusion reached because it states only a limited parental duty.we agree with her premise.subdivision a provides for purposes of this subdivision,a parent or legal guardian to any person under the age of years shall have the duty to exercise reasonable care,supervision,protection,and control over their minor child.i f the statutory language is not ambiguous,then we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statutory language governs.citations.people walker cal th,d.the phrase,f or purposes of this subdivision,limits the effect of the following language to section,subdivision a.section,subdivision a provides,in relevant part,misdemeanor liability for a failure to act causing a child to come within the provisions of welfare and institutions code sections,or section,subdivision a applies to criminal liability for contributing to the dependency or delinquency of a minor.because we agree with appellant on this issue,we do not consider her argument that the instruction inaccurately reflected the duty provided by section,subdivision a.
but section is not the exclusive source of the parental duty to protect,because parents are under a common law duty to protect their children.when a criminal statute does not set forth a legal duty to act by its express terms,liability for a failure to act must be premised on the existence of a duty found elsewhere.heitzman,supra,cal th at,d.a criminal statute may incorporate a duty imposed by another criminal or civil statute,and may also embody a common law duty based on the legal relationship between the defendant and the victim,such as that imposed on parents to care for and protect their minor children.citations.ibid.the common law imposes affirmative duties upon persons standing in certain personal relationships to other parents to aid their small children a mother may be guilty of criminal homicide for failure to prevent the fatal beating of her baby by her lover lafave,substantive criminal law ed a.even accomplice liability may be grounded in an omission to act.id.at.
appellant argues that while,under heitzman,the common law may inform the scope and nature of a duty to act,it does not permit criminal liability to flow from the common law where no statute imposes liability.appellant misreads heitzman.that case does not say that the common law may only inform an existing statutory duty it says that a criminal statute may embody a common law duty.heitzman,supra,cal th at,d.as an example,heitzman cites people burden d,in which a father who willfully withheld food from his child,resulting in the child starving to death,was liable for murder based on his failure to perform his common law duty to care for his child.heitzman,supra,cal th at,d.to recognize that a criminal statute may embody a common law duty to act,as heitzman does,is not to impose criminal liability without a statute.the statute is still the source of liability the common law only provides the rationale that failure to act can be equivalent to an affirmative act in some situations.
appellant argues that common law does not impose criminal liability on parents who fail to act to protect their children.swanson does not explicitly discuss common law parental liability,though it quotes extensively from state walden,supra,in which the north carolina court reasoned that parents duty to protect their children is inherent in their common law duty to provide for their children safety.swanson,supra,th at,d state walden,supra,at.swanson also parenthetically cites people stanciel,stanciel,for its holding that in light of the common law duty of parents to protect their children,the defendants could be liable for their children murders,as aiders and abettors,based on their failure to protect the children from abusive boyfrien
