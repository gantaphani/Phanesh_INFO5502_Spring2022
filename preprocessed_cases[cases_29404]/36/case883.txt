mother appeals from an order terminating parental rights welf,to two of her children,and she contends the court erroneously barred evidence on whether the children prospective adoptive parent was eligible to adopt and improperly failed to consider whether there was a legal impediment to adoption by the prospective adoptive parent.mother also argues the court erred by rejecting her claim that termination would be detrimental to the children.on review,we disagree with each of mother contentions and affirm.
in the published portion of our opinion,we hold evidence of a legal impediment to adoption,by an identified prospective adoptive parent is relevant and therefore admissible when a social worker opinion that a child is likely to be adopted is based in part on the prospective adoptive parent willingness to adopt.on the record before us,however,we conclude the trial court neither barred such evidence nor was compelled to consider whether there was or could be a legal impediment to adoption by the children prospective adoptive parent in evaluating whether it was likely the children would be adopted.
procedural and factual history 
and have been in and out of foster care since,due in large part to mother substance abuse and resulting inability to provide adequate and appropriate care.most recently,in august,the fresno county superior court adjudged,and their other siblings juvenile dependents and removed them from parental custody.because reunification was not possible,the court in january conducted its first section hearing for the children and their siblings.
respondent fresno county department of children and family services department offered no assessment of the likelihood of any of the children adoption.instead,it determined foster care was the most appropriate plan at the time because,in relevant part,and care provider was able to commit to foster care.and care provider was their aunt.they had been placed with her since august.the court ordered foster care as the appropriate plan for all of mother children.as the court explained,there was a compelling reason that termination of parental rights would be detrimental.
mother h as maintained regular visitation and contact with the children and at this point the children do benefit from continuing that relationship.additionally,the older children object to the termination of parental rights,and additionally termination of parental rights would interfere with the children relationship with each other.
months later,the department petitioned to set a new section hearing for and l.a department panel determined it would be in the children best interest to assess them for a more permanent plan of adoption with their aunt because the children wished to be adopted by her and she wished to adopt them.in late,the court granted the department petition and set a second section hearing for and 
in advance of the hearing,the department prepared a new wic report for and l.in its report,the department recommended adoption with termination of parental rights as the most appropriate permanent plan for and,who were nine and eight years old respectively.it no longer appeared mother had a strong relationship or a bond with the children.in addition,and had unremarkable visits with their siblings twice a month.only their oldest sibling objected to and being adopted.
under a heading of analysis of the likelihood of adoption and proposed permanent plan department social worker,manuel alcaraz,wrote 
and are generally adoptable in that they are both healthy,happy and have a strong attachment to the prospective adoptive parent.they do not have developmental or physical concern they are healthy children who appear to be developmentally on target.the prospective adoptive parent has had a placement of the children for almost two years and is very committed to providing and with the most appropriate permanent plan through adoption,with termination of parental rights.the prospective adoptive parent has adequate support system of family and friends.it would not be detrimental to and to terminate parental rights due to the positive relationship and share with their prospective adoptive parent.the children have a strong and loving bond with the current care provider.the children are eight and nine years of age and have expressed that they want to be adopted by their current care provider and already feel that they are part of the family.both and have a strong attachment to their care provider and the children would benefit from continuing the relationship that has been established with the current care provider.it is in the children best interest to have a stable and permanent home through adoption with their current care provider.
furthermore,while in assessment this social worker has observed one visit between the children and their mother father has not made himself available to the department to request visits.it does not appear that it would be detrimental to and to terminate parental rights because the lack of relationship they have with their biological parents.
alcaraz also included an assessment of the aunt as the children prospective adoptive parent as required by statute,subd.g d,subd.i d,subd.c d.relevant to this appeal,alcaraz reported the aunt explained that she has been married once and is now separated.
mother filed a written statement of contested issues prior to the section hearing.in it,she objected to adoption as a permanent plan and asked the court to continue foster care as the children permanent plan.she cited as a contested issue that the department has not properly evaluated the prospective adoptive parent lifestyle,and the department should not have recommended adoption by this care provider.
at the start of the section hearing,the department argued mother contest over the aunt lifestyle was not a proper issue for trial.the court agreed.the department in turn asked that no questions on the issue be permitted.the court again agreed.
mother counsel called social worker alcaraz as her first witness.relevant to this appeal,counsel asked had the aunt been married but then got divorced during the time that she was the care provider for the children.the children attorney objected on relevance grounds and the department counsel joined.the court overruled the objection.
alcaraz testified in turn that the aunt separated from her husband.the witness was unsure whether the separation occurred while the aunt cared for the children.she told alcaraz she was separated from her husband but not legally divorced.alcaraz believed the aunt was married in the catholic church and she was not divorced.he relied on what she told him and did not confirm her marital status through any official documentation or court records.
later,mother testified and expressed concern that the department had not checked out the aunt husband because he did live with her.the court responded,what mother replied,her husband does live there with her.and i tried to get her husband to get.the court interrupted,at this point in time we already ruled upon that.i striking that.
in her closing argument,mother counsel claimed the theme of the department recommendation was stability for the children and y et the children have been placed with someone who says she is separated but not divorced.there is no confirmation of this.there is no official documentation that shows that there is a separation or that the spouse does not continue to be involved or does not disrupt the family life.the court responded,t hat really speculation,counsel.counsel submitted the matter.
having found clear and convincing evidence that it was likely the children would be adopted,the court selected adoption as the appropriate permanent plan and terminated parental rights.
