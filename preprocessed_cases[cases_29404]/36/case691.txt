appellant raphael metzger raphael,former husband of respondent tammy metzger tammy,appeals from an order appointing counsel to represent the parties minor daughter,in the parties custody dispute on appeal,raphael contends that the order appointing minor counsel violated his constitutional rights and was an abuse of discretion.we disagree and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
tammy and raphael were married on november,and their daughter,was born the following year.on july,tammy filed a petition to dissolve her marriage with raphael.the court ordered a separate trial on child custody issues and scheduled trial for may.
on april,tammy requested a trial continuance in order to give her time to have evaluated for developmental delays.tammy stated that she had only recently become aware that her daughter might have autism.raphael opposed the request for a continuance.he argued that tammy had already obstructed the progress of the proceedings by refusing to stipulate to a separate trial on child custody issues,failing to appear for her deposition,and refusing to agree to alternate dates for her deposition,among other actions.raphael also argued that tammy new concern about developmental delay has no basis in reality,wa s a stall tactic,and fail ed to justify a continuance of the trial.
it appears that the court granted multiple trial continuances on january,the court entered a judgment of dissolution as to marital status only.the trial on custody issues appears to have begun in early and was eventually continued to october.in or around august,it appears that tammy filed a request for an order for an autism evaluation of raphael opposed the request,arguing that had already undergone such evaluation sessions.
the court denied tammy request and issued an order to show cause as to why eve lopez should not be appointed as minor counsel for,and why raphael should not advance to minor counsel as a retainer for her services,of which would be chargeable to each party against their share of community property.lopez has a master degree in forensic psychology as well as a juris doctor degree,and has been appointed as minor counsel in dozens of cases involving a child with special needs.
tammy filed a notice of to the appointment of minor counsel.raphael opposed the order to show cause on the grounds that the appointment of minor counsel violated his constitutional right to determine his daughter needs and represent her interests,among other arguments.at the hearing on september,the court noted that the issue of whether had autism would affect the court custody award because,if did not have autism,her mom wants to subject her to a lot of stuff she should not be subjected to,and if did have autism,then i need to make sure that she gets the resources that she needs.the court further indicated that he fe lt that needs someone to speak for her.
raphael argued that lopez was unfairly biased because she has an autistic child.the court responded that t here no evidence but speculation that lopez would be inclined to be biased.and i think what she might be more inclined to be is knowledgeable i see that she may have more knowledge than the average family law lawyer about matters related to autism spectrum disorder.that,frankly,why i chose her the court issued an order appointing lopez as minor counsel t o assist the court in determining the best interests of the child.
raphael moved ex parte for the revocation of the appointment of eve lopez as minor counsel,and the court denied the request.raphael then appealed the order appointing minor counsel.lopez filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to have the appeal dismissed,and tammy filed a joinder.on november,we issued an order consolidating the appeal and petition for purposes of review by this court.
contentions 
raphael contends that the court violated his constitutional rights and abused its discretion by appointing minor counsel and ordering raphael to pay counsel fees.
discussion 
the role of minor counsel in custody disputes 
family code section,subdivision a provides that i f the court determines that it would be in the best interest of the minor child,the court may appoint private counsel to represent the interests of the child in a custody or visitation proceeding,provided that the court and counsel comply with the requirements set forth in rules,and of the california rules of court crc rules.
crc rule sets forth specific factors the court should take into account in determining whether to appoint minor counsel,including whether the issue of child custody is highly contested or protracted,minor counsel would be likely to provide the court with relevant information not otherwise readily available,knowledgeable counsel is available for appointment,and the best interest of the child appears to require independent representation.crc rule addresses the proper payment of minor counsel,and crc rule addresses the qualifications,rights and responsibilities of minor counsel.
family code section,subdivision a provides that t he child counsel appointed under this chapter is charged with the representation of the child best interests.the role of the child counsel is to gather evidence that bears on the best interests of the child,and present that admissible evidence to the court the counsel duties include interviewing the child,reviewing the court files and all accessible relevant records available to both parties,and making any further investigations as the counsel considers necessary to ascertain evidence relevant to the custody or visitation hearings.
the court did not violate raphael right to advance his daughter best interests 
raphael contends that the order appointing minor counsel deprived him of his right as a fit father to determine and advance best interests because minor counsel was tasked with representing the child best interests.however,the court order only appointed minor counsel for the purpose of providing the court with additional information it did not preclude the parties from also informing the court what they believe best interests to be 
raphael also argues that the court substituted its own judgment of best interests for that of raphael when it ordered him to pay to minor counsel instead of allowing raphael to use that money for other purposes.raphael states that he would prefer to use this money for college education pursuant to his constitutional right to direct and provide for his child education.in support of this argument,he cites to meyer nebraska and pierce society of sisters,two cases holding that the application of statutes limiting the kinds of education a child may receive unreasonably interfered with a parent right to direct the education of his child.the reasoning of those cases does not apply here.the payment of minor counsel fees in a custody dispute does not in any way restrict the kind of education a child may receive or affect a parent right to direct that education.
raphael right to decide with whom his daughter associates does not trump the court authority to act in best interests 
raphael argues that the court order would force him to provide minor counsel with access to his daughter and,therefore,violated his right to determine with whom his daughter associates.it appears that he is raising an as applied challenge to family code section which gives minor counsel the right to r easonable access to the child.family code,subd.c.he argues that this statute infringes on his constitutional right as a fit parent to determine with whom his daughter may associate.in determining a statute constitutionality,we start from the premise that it is valid,we resolve all doubts in favor of its constitutionality,and we uphold it unless it is in clear and unquestionable conflict with the state or federal constitutions.citation.rupf yan th.
a parent right to control with whom his child associates stems from the fourteenth amendment provision that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.troxel granville,troxel.the substantive component of this due process clause provides heightened protection against government interference with cer
