in response to the growing problem of interstate enforcement of child support,congress passed the child support recovery act of csra,a,stat.codified at,to punish certain persons who intentionally fail to pay their child support obligations,at.this case presents the question whether the csra is a valid exercise of congress commerce clause power under article i,cl.of the constitution.timothy gordon faasse pleaded guilty to violating the csra,which criminalizes the willful failure to pay child support for a child who resides in another state.he was sentenced by the district court to serve a term of imprisonment and ordered to pay full restitution for support payments.he now challenges the constitutionality of the statute as well as the legality of the district court restitution order.all ten of our sister circuits that have considered the constitutionality of the csra in commerce clause challenges after united states lopez,d,have upheld the statute.we now join them in concluding that the csra is an appropriate exercise of congress power under the commerce clause.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court as to the constitutionality of the statute we also affirm the district court order of restitution.
timothy gordon faasse and sandra bowman had a child,noelle alexandria faasse,on december.the couple resided in lansing,michigan for the first several months of noelle life.in june,faasse moved to california bowman chose to remain in michigan with noelle.in june,faasse filed a petition in state court to establish his paternity of noelle as well as visitation rights.the circuit court in kent county,michigan adjudged faasse to be noelle father on january,it also ordered faasse to pay child support in the amount of per week the child support order was made retroactive to december.as a result of the retroactive nature of the award,faasse found himself in arrears on child support.
faasse was intermittently employed in california and his child support payments were sporadic in,faasse made four payments to bowman totaling in,he sent ten payments in the amount of in,faasse provided payments of in,faasse sent seven payments totaling and in,faasse made one payment of.
on july,the government filed a criminal complaint against faasse in the united states district court for the western district of michigan alleging that faasse was in violation of the child support recovery act for failure to pay child support from january to july.on june,faasse pleaded guilty before a magistrate judge to one count of violating the csra.the csra at that time provided w hoever willfully fails to pay a past due support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state shall be punished as provided in subsection b.a subsection b stated that punishment for a first offense under subsection a was a fine,imprisonment for not more than months,or both and for a subsequent offense,a fine,imprisonment for not more than two years,or both.id.b.the term past due support obligation was defined as any amount 
a determined under a court order or an order of an administrative process pursuant to the law of a state to be due from a person for the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living and 
b that has remained unpaid for a period longer than one year,or is greater than 
id.d.faasse was subsequently sentenced by a magistrate judge to a term of months imprisonment and ordered to pay full restitution,in the amount of,for child support arrearage.
faasse timely appealed his conviction and sentence to this court he first challenges the constitutionality of the csra as an improper exercise of congress commerce clause authority.faasse attacks the statute nexus to interstate commerce,asserting that the csra creates a federal criminal enforcement mechanism for pure state law child support obligations whose only link to interstate commerce is the requirement that parent and child reside in different states.appellant br.at.according to faasse,this link is insufficient to establish a constitutional basis for congressional regulation.faasse also challenges the district court order requiring him to pay restitution as an abuse of the district court discretion.a panel of this court initially accepted faasse arguments and reversed the district court judgment.united states faasse,cir.we granted rehearing en banc,vacated the panel opinion,cir,and now affirm the judgment of the district court.
ii.analysis 
the constitution grants congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.relying on united states lopez,d,faasse urges us to fashion a narrow and technical definition of commerce that turns on whether the transaction at issue involves trade and is reciprocal in nature.we firmly decline faasse invitation to impose heretofore unknown constraints on congress commerce clause power as unsupportable by either supreme court or our own precedent.indeed,we believe that,pursuant to our de novo review of the constitutionality of a statute,united states napier,cir,the csra easily passes constitutional muster.
commerce clause 
in one of the supreme court earliest expositions on the commerce clause,chief justice marshall rejected the notion that commerce,as utilized in the constitution,is limited to traffic,to buying and selling,or the interchange of commodities gibbons ogden,wheat.the chief justice noted that c ommerce,undoubtedly,is traffic,but it is something more it is intercourse.it describes the commercial intercourse between nations,and parts of nations,in all its branches,and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.id.at.although the supreme court reliance on this early understanding of commerce has waxed and waned in the course of this nation development,it remains the principal standard by which we evaluate commerce clause challenges.while we must remain vigilant to ensure that a federal statute does not trench upon purely local activity,we may only invalidate a congressional enactment passed pursuant to the commerce clause if it bears no rational relation to interstate commerce.hodel virginia surface mining reclamation ass n,d.
in united states lopez the supreme court revealed its concern that congress had so expanded its authority to regulate intra state activity under the guise of its commerce clause power that congress was in danger of effectually obliterat ing the distinction between what is national and what is local and creat ing a completely centralized government.lopez,at.quoting nlrb jones laughlin steel.summarizing its prior commerce clause jurisprudence,the court articulated three broad categories of activity that congress may regulate under its commerce power first,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.id.at.internal citations omitted.this category includes an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce.id.at.second,congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.id.at.third,congress may regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.id.at.although these broad categories may not satisfy those who seek mathematical or rigid formulas,they are consistent with the modern court practical conception of commercial regulation,id.at.kennedy,concurring,which continues to guide the court resolution of commerce clause challenges to federal statutes.
according to faasse,congress lacks the power under all three lopez categories to enact the csra.we disagree.the csra regulates exclusively interstate cases involving a debtor parent obligation to send payments through interstate channels of commerce for a child residing in another state.we believe that,at the very least,the csra falls within congress power to regulate a thing in interstate commerce.nine of the ten circuits to have upheld the csra have held similarly see united states bongiorno,cir upholding statute under lopez category two united states sage,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under category two united states johnson,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under category two united states bailey,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under categories one and two united states black,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under category two united states crawford,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under all three categories united states mussari,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under category two united states hampshire,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under categories two and three united states williams,cir,cert.denied,d upholding statute under category two.lopez and its progeny simply do not cabin congress authority to prevent the obstruction of things in interstate commerce.
lopez involved a challenge to the school zones act of gfsza,q,which prohibited the knowing possession of a gun within feet of a school.the court quickly rejected the first two categories of authority as possible constitutional bases for congress enactment of the statute.turning to the third category,the court concluded that because the gfsza was a criminal statute that by its terms ha d nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms,the statute could not stand as a valid regulation under the commerce clause.lopez,at.the court evaluated several factors in its assessment whether the gfsza substantially affected interstate commerce despite the fact that no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye first,whether the statute was part of a larger regulation of economic activity in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated second,whether the statute contained a jurisdiction element which would ensure,through inquiry that each firearm possession affected or had an explicit connection to interstate commerce and third,whether the statute or its legislative history contained congressional findings regarding whether gun possession in a school zone affected interstate commerce.id.at.answering all three inquiries in the negative,the court struck down the statute as an impermissible exercise of congress commerce clause authority.
in united states morrison,d,the supreme court elaborated upon the lopez court analysis in its review of the constitutionality of,the violence against women act of civil remedy provision.section provided a federal civil remedy for the victims of a crime of violence motivated by gender.b.the morrison court first noted that a fair reading of lopez shows that the noneconomic,criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case.morrison.at.the court then stated that lopez review of commerce clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity substantial effects on interstate commerce,the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor.id.in striking down the statute,the court noted that,similar to possession of a gun within feet of a school zone,g crimes of violence are not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.id.at.although the court ostensibly eschewed the creation of a rule,the court holding implied that for a statute which regulates intrastate activity to be upheld under category three,it must be economic in nature 
to the extent that faasse relies on lopez and morrison as support for his argument,he reveals a serious misunderstanding of these precedents.undoubtedly,lopez and morrison provide lower courts with significant guidance in their review of federal statutes regulating exclusively intrastate activity.united states robertson,d explaining that the category three substantially affects test need only be applied to intrastate commercial activity that has interstate effects.neither lopez nor morrison,however,speaks in much detail to the first or second categories of activity that congress may validly regulate under its commerce clause power.at oral argument,counsel for faasse stated that morrison was aspirational in nature and that its reasoning should be extended to the other categories of regulation.it is not our practice to decide cases based on a hunch that a decision by the supreme court is aspirational.we do know that the instant case indisputably involves the regulation of exclusively interstate transactions and that,as such,it does not implicate the supreme court preeminent concern in lopez and morrison,namely that congress commerce clause power,taken too far,will erase the distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.morrison.at.the csra is,in fine,no different from myriad other acts of congress that the supreme court has routinely upheld.
thing in commerce 
as the supreme court has repeatedly made clear,congress power to regulate things in interstate commerce is plenary see gibbons,wheat.at,explaining that the commerce clause comprehend s every species of commercial intercourse among the several states and that congress commerce clause power is complete in itself,may be exercised to its utmost extent,and acknowledges no limitations,other than are prescribed in the constitution.among the reasons the nation founders imbued the national legislature with an explicit grant of power in article i,cl.was to ensure that the congress could regulate commerce that extended beyond an individual state borders.see camps,town of harrison,d explaining,with respect to a dormant commerce clause challenge to a state statute,that i f there was any one object riding over every other in the adoption of the constitution,it was to keep the commercial intercourse among the states free from all invidious and partial restraints quoting gibbons,wheat.at lopez,at.kennedy,concurring congress can regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national economy.indeed,the founders recognized that commerce that crossed state lines could exceed the states capacity to regulate such commerce uniformly or to enforce the states own laws.in united states underwriters ass n,the supreme court observed 
the power confined to congress by the commerce clause is declared in the federalist to be for the purpose of securing the maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the states.it is the power to legislate concerning transactions which,reaching across state boundaries,affect the people of more states than one to govern affairs which the individual states,with their limited territorial jurisdictions,are not fully capable of governing.
united states underwriters ass n.footnotes omitted.
in exercising its positive commerce clause power,congress has often passed legislation to help the states solve problems that defy local solution.sage,at.thus,in perez united states,d,the supreme court noted that legislative history for the consumer credit protection act,et,which makes intrastate loan sharking activities a federal crime,reflected congress concern that loan sharking,a significant component of organized crime,was a national affliction and required a federal antidote because t he problem simply could not be solved by the states alone.earlier,in united states sheridan,the supreme court explained that congress passed the national stolen property act,to assist the states in detecting and punishing criminals whose offenses are complete under state law,but who utilize the channels of interstate commerce to make a successful get away and thus make the state detecting and punitive processes impotent.
when congress enacted the csra in,legislative history reveals that it did so in response to a dilemma it considered national in scope and whose resolution had defied the authority of the individual states.the house judiciary committee,which authored a report accompanying the bill that became,stated that the committee had found that interstate collection of child support was the most difficult to enforce and accounted for an unacceptably high deficit in child support payments,at.according to the report,approximately of child support cases involve children whose parent lives in a state different from the child and whose custodial parent must therefore rely on interstate payments of child support.among this group relying on interstate payment,percent of the custodial parents reported receiving child support payments only occasionally,seldom or never.id.at.after noting that at least states have made willful failure to pay child support a crime,the report concluded that the ability of those states to enforce such laws outside their own boundaries is severely limited.id.at.indeed,the report found that even though most states had adopted the uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act,which was designed to deal with the extradition of defendants who failed to pay interstate child support,interstate extradition and enforcement in fact remains a tedious,cumbersome and slow method of collection.id.at.
as this report makes plain,congress enactment of the csra was premised upon a paradigmatic use of its commerce clause power over things in commerce to regulate national problems that confound solution.as the second circuit noted 
all the act does is enable the united states to help the state do what it could not do on its own,namely,enforce the defendant obligation to send money from one state to another.congress was not impotent to overcome the obstacles inherent in our federal system to the enforcement of that obligation.
therefore,pursuant to its authority to regulate things in interstate commerce,be they commercial or not,we believe that congress may properly prohibit a spouse from refusing to pay child support when the child lives in another state.the csra is explicitly premised upon the parent unfulfilled obligation to make an interstate money payment to the custodial parent.importantly,p ayments stemming from a support obligation will usually travel in interstate commerce by mail,wire,or electronic transfer.black,at united states owens,cir upholding money laundering conviction under and finding statute valid exercise of congress commerce clause authority under category two because use of federally insured banks the transport of monies across state borders to facilitate the money laundering create a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to allow application of.the money payment,or its absence,which would travel through interstate commerce,is the thing which congress may validly regulate.
it matters not,for purposes of the constitution,whether the child support payment is a tangible thing.in underwriters ass n,at,in which the supreme court upheld congress authority to regulate interstate insurance contracts,the court made clear that congress can regulate traffic though it consist of intangibles.the court also noted that transactions may be commerce though they may be commerce though illegal and sporadic,and though they do not utilize common carriers or concern the flow of anything more tangible than electrons and information.id.at.see also reno condon,d upholding driver privacy protection act,which forbids the states from selling or releasing drivers personal,identifying information,as valid regulation of thing in interstate commerce.
moreover,it is immaterial that the csra regulates a defendant failure to put a thing in commerce it is true that many federal statutes prohibit,rather than seek to compel,goods or services from passing through interstate commerce.see,united states darby.upholding criminal provision of fair labor standards act proscribing interstate shipment of goods produced by employees whose wages and hours of employment did not conform to the act.as the fifth circuit noted,however,t he supreme court has often held,in several contexts,that the defendant nonuse of interstate channels alone does not shield him from federal purview under the commerce clause.bailey,at see also sage,at rejecting argument that failure to send money does not invoke commerce clause power because i f congress can take measures under the commerce clause to foster potential interstate commerce,it surely has power to prevent the frustration of an obligation to engage in commerce.thus,in heart of atlanta motel,united states,d,the supreme court upheld title ii of the civil rights act of,which provides for equal access to places of public accommodation without regard to race,explaining that the heart of atlanta motel refusal to accommodate blacks was an impermissible obstruction to interstate commerce because it deterred blacks from engaging in interstate travel in united states green,the supreme court upheld the hobbs act,which makes illegal robbery or extortion that in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce and thus removes obstacles to interstate commerce and in standard oil united states,the supreme court upheld the sherman antitrust act,which makes illegal every contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states and thereby furthers interstate commerce that otherwise would have been stifled.if congress may validly restrict one industry restraint on trade or prevent intrastate extortion because it obstructs the flow of interstate commerce,certainly congress may regulate faasse failure to send payments from california to michigan as a similar obstruction of interstate commerce 
the dissent contention that faasse passively failed to engage in commerce,instead of actively obstructed commerce,and that these precedents therefore do not apply to him,is not well taken.faasse failure to act was not passive in this case,it was willful,as he was under a state court order to pay child support which he deliberately disobeyed.indeed,we note that the scienter element in the csra requires willfulness the statute may only be invoked if a defendant willfully fails to pay a past due support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state.a.when faasse pleaded guilty,he acknowledged his guilt as to each and every element of the offense.thus,by virtue of his guilty plea,faasse conceded that his failure to pay child support was willful.we conclude that the distinction between active obstruction and passive failure is,in this case,illusory and we reject any attempt to hide behind it.
we are also nonplused by the assertion that,in some hypothetical situations,a debtor parent and the custodial parent may reside in one state while the minor child resides in another,thereby undermining the rationale for federal regulation.although such a scenario is unlikely,we note that the debtor parent payment must still travel through interstate commerce,thereby making use of the channels of commerce,to reach the child.moreover,we do not strike down a statute facially because there are hypothetical situations in which the act interstate commerce connection may conceivably be tenuous see united states valenzeno,cir.
finally,we wish to make clear that this statute does not,as faasse and the dissent would have us believe,regulate a traditional area of family law best left to the states.in both lopez and morrison,the supreme court noted that should the substantial effects and aggregation principles for intra state activity be extended too far,it would provide congress with authority to regulate family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage,divorce,and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant.morrison.at.first,the csra does not rely exclusively upon either the substantial effects or aggregation principle for its constitutionality as noted above,it regulates inter,not economic activity.moreover,the statute does not purport to regulate the activities associated with marriage,divorce,or childrearing under the guise that,in the aggregate,such activities substantially affect interstate commerce.as a regulation of debtors who owe payments,the csra deals exclusively with interstate economic transactions.united states napier,cir upholding g,criminalizing possession of a weapon that has traveled interstate while defendant is subject to domestic violence order,against claim that statute regulates traditional area of family law,because statute jurisdictional element ensures it was enacted pursuant to congress power to regulate interstate commerce in firearms.therefore,we are confident that the statute does not implicate the court concern that congress may attempt to create federal family law under the pretext of its commerce clause power.
second,the statute does not supplant traditional state statutory enforcement mechanisms.in this case,michigan remains the exclusive regulator and enforcer of all unpaid child support obligations in its state unless the parent or the child both lives out of state and the parent fails to make payments.in such a situation,congress made express findings that collection of debts had grown beyond the enforcement capacities of the states.the csra does not supplant or preempt state law because it does not implicate the states ability or authority to order child support payments,nor does it compel states to enforce such orders instead,the csra merely reinforces state laws which the states were unable to enforce themselves this is a most appropriate use of federal power see underwriters ass n,at.noting that commerce clause power is a positive power to govern affairs which the individual states,with their limited territorial jurisdictions,are not fully capable of governing.
an interstate child support payment clearly is a thing in interstate commerce.see bailey,at the csra seeks to prevent the frustration of an interstate commercial transaction that otherwise would have occurred absent the defendant dereliction.it is thus subject to federal control under category two for that reason.crawford,at finding that payments of child support on behalf of an child,or the debts resulting from nonpayment,are things in interstate commerce bongiorno,at holding that b ecause child support orders that require a parent in one state to make payments to a person in another state are functionally equivalent to interstate contracts,such obligations are things in interstate commerce internal citation omitted mussari,at the obligation of a parent in one state to provide support for a child in a different state is an obligation to be met by a payment that will normally move in interstate mail,by wire,or by the electronic transfer of funds.that obligation is,therefore,a thing in interstate commerce and falls within the power of congress to regulate.therefore,the congress may freely regulate the interstate child support payment,provided we find that the statute means are rationally related to its ends,which we do.thus,we conclude that the csra represents an appropriate exercise of congress commerce clause power.
c.other categories of regulation 
although we have determined that the csra validly regulates a thing in commerce within lopez category two,we also believe that the statute is a constitutional regulation of the channels of interstate commerce accord crawford,at finding csra valid regulation under category one because payment of child support on behalf of an child requires the use of channels of interstate commerce bailey,at concluding that csra is valid regulation under category one because the child support interstate in nature as a direct consequence of the diversity requirement imposed upon the obligor and the be satisfied normally by a payment that necessarily must move in interstate commerce.
in lopez,the court stated that there are two kinds of permissible regulation under the first category of activity regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce and an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce.lopez,at.as the court references to united states darby,at.upholding criminal prosecution under the fair labor standards act for interstate shipment of lumber which was manufactured intrastate by employees whose wages and hours did not conform with act and heart of atlanta motel,united states,at.upholding title ii of the civil rights act of forbidding public accommodations from refusing to serve customers based on race and noting that the authority of congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained,and is no longer open to question illustrate,permissible category one regulation encompasses more than simple regulation of the nation highways,railroads,or other literal channels of commerce.lopez,at.these cases teach that congress has the power,under category one,to regulate or exclude certain categories of goods from flowing across state lines through the channels of commerce.our case law is in harmony with the supreme court in united states beuckelaere,at,we upheld,as a category one regulation,o,a statute criminalizing the possession or transfer of a machinegun because the illegal possession of a machinegun can not occur without an illegal transfer,which given the national marketplace for machineguns,involves the channels of interstate commerce.we therefore conclude that,based upon its power to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce,the csra was validly enacted under lopez category one.
finally,we also believe that,although not necessary to our holding today,we could find the csra a valid regulation under lopez category three.the statute regulates financial obligations which must move in interstate commerce,via mail,wire,or electronic transfer it has an explicit jurisdictional nexus to interstate child and parent must reside in different states and it is supported by congressional findings explaining the effect on interstate commerce of the failure to make child support payments.accord parker,at crawford,at hampshire,at all upholding csra under lopez category three.congress clearly had a rational basis for enacting the csra under its category three commerce clause power.in sum,we believe that the csra is valid under each of the three lopez categories.
iii.order of restitution 
having rejected faasse constitutional challenge to the csra,we now turn to his challenge to the district court order requiring him to pay in restitution we review the district court decision to order a specific amount of restitution for an abuse of discretion.united states adams,cir noting also that the legal issue of whether restitution is permitted under law is reviewed de novo.
the csra requires a court,upon a conviction under the act,to order restitution under in an amount equal to the past due support obligation as it exists at the time of sentencing.c.section a b i requires courts to consider,when determining the amount of restitution to be ordered,i the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense and ii the financial resources of the defendant,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.a b i.
faasse sole argument is that the magistrate judge abused his discretion by failing to consider the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant when fashioning the restitution order.specifically,faasse argues that the magistrate judge did not adequately consider the effect of faasse term of imprisonment and the consequent loss of his job on his earning ability.according to faasse,f ailure to reduce the restitution award in light of faasse circumstances constitutes an abuse of discretion that warrants remand for reconsideration of an appropriate restitution award.appellant br.at.
in support of his position,faasse cites to this court decision in united states dunigan,cir,in which a panel of this court reversed the district court imposition of a restitution order on a defendant sentenced to months in prison.the dunigan court determined that the district court had failed to consider,pursuant to the statute,dunigan ability to pay,in light of the defendant extremely meager financial assets and the lack of any evidence in the record that the defendant could pay what amounted to dollars per month every month for three years during his supervised release.
we have held that the district court must consider each of the statutory factors in when determining the specific amount ordered as restitution.united states sanders,cir.the district court is not,however,required to make explicit findings about each statutory factor,although we held in dunigan that a district court must have,at a minimum,some indication that a defendant will be able to pay the amount of restitution ordered dunigan,at.thus,we noted that a district court abuses its discretion when it orders restitution in an amount that it finds the defendant is not likely to be able to pay.id.quoting united states fuentes,cir.
in faasse case,we believe that the district court adequately considered the appropriate statutory factors,including the defendant financial status.the magistrate judge stated at the sentencing hearing 
i do see any resolution of this case other than the one i going to impose,and that is the statutory maximum here is six months and i going to impose the sentence.if i thought obviously i know that this means the defendant going to lose his job.if i thought that letting him keep his job would mean that he would start supporting his child,it the last thing in the world i do is take his job away from him,but i do believe for a moment that getting this particular job at a year plus commissions is going to do anything for this child.
the defendant has a long track record here of not supporting the child so what i going to do is incarcerate the defendant,make a lesson of him for himself and for others,and at the end of six months then he can decide whether he wants to continue in his obstructionist fashion.
i think the defendant has had means and methods to pay this money all along,he just will not,and in a case where the court decides that it the defendant will and not his inability that the problem i think this is what the court ought to do.
at.the transcript makes clear that the magistrate judge did not ignore the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant when ordering restitution.the magistrate judge explicitly contemplated that faasse would lose his job when sentencing him but believed that,employed or not,faasse was not likely willingly to support his daughter.the magistrate judge attributed faasse failure to make child support payments to his lack of will to pay,not to his financial inability.thus,unlike the situation in dunigan,in which the district court expressed considerable doubt that dunigan ever would be able to pay,dunigan,at,the magistrate judge in this case believed that faasse could pay the child support should he so choose.
having determined that the magistrate judge did not ignore the appropriate statutory factors,we must consider whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the amount of restitution ordered,or whether the restitution order constituted an abuse of the magistrate judge discretion.according to a,the probation officer should include in the presentence report information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order including information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant.the presentence report in this case reflects that faasse has never earned a consistent livelihood.according to the probation officer report,faasse was in an automobile accident in february.faasse asserted that this accident prohibited him from working from to the middle of.at.the probation officer learned from social security administration records that faasse earned in but had no reported income in.at.the probation officer noted that she encountered difficulty establishing the defendant source s of subsistence in.at.social security administration records reflected that faasse earned in,although he maintained an apartment with a monthly rent of,apparently with financial assistance from his family.from july to august,faasse earned approximately every two weeks.id.according to social security administration records,faasse earned approximately in.at.from august to february,faasse worked for a different employer and earned commissions of unknown sums.thereafter,faasse was basically unemployed from february to september,when he was convicted of the present offense,and his income for that period is also unknown.id.
based on faasse earnings detailed in the presentence report,it first appears that the magistrate judge had no indication that the defendant w ould be able to pay the amount of restitution ordered,dunigan,at,particularly in one lump sum payable immediately,as was ordered by the district court.at.as is clear from the above recitation of faasse employment record,however,the presentence report is substantially incomplete.faasse probation officer reported that faasse views and beliefs regarding the federal criminal justice system made him uncooperative in the gathering of facts and material relevant to the preparation of the presentence report.at.the probation officer also found that faasse was evasive regarding his personal background,employment,and criminal histories.id.in the section on the defendant employment record,the presentence report states that the probation officer encountered difficulty identifying and verifying the defendant employment history.the defendant presented false and misleading information to this officer on many occasions.at.the probation officer concluded 
i t is difficult to gauge the defendant ability to pay.if his most recent employment works out,he should have the ability to pay restitution at a rate deemed reasonable by the court.after no less than five requests,the defendant has failed to return his personal financial statement to this office.
at emphasis added.because faasse refused to cooperate with the probation officer by providing a personal financial statement,see d each defendant shall prepare and file with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources of the defendant,including a complete listing of all assets owned or controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was arrested,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and such other information that the court requires,we do not know whether the presentence report accurately reflects his earnings for the years.we also can not know whether faasse has undisclosed assets or liabilities.
to the extent that the presentence report is incomplete,we note that the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that a restitution order far exceeds his resources and earning potential.adams,at see also e the burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant shall be on the defendant.we believe that faasse unwillingness to provide the probation officer with complete financial and employment information has effectively constrained our with regard to the amount of restitution.we are,therefore,compelled to conclude that he has not met his burden of persuasion to prove that the restitution order exceeds his earning potential or his financial resources.we note,moreover,that even if faasse does lack the present ability to pay,this court has previously held that a defendant indigency is not a bar to an order of restitution because ability to pay is but one factor for the court to consider united states bondurant,cir noting relevance of other factors including defendant intelligence,academic background,and likely ability to obtain a job.
because the district court did not fail to consider any of the statutory factors and did not order an amount of restitution in excess of what is required by statute,we must conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding faasse responsible for restitution of the full amount of unpaid child support.we also believe that the district court order to pay the restitution in a lump sum is not an abuse of discretion.see f a noting that a restitution order may direct the defendant to make single,payment or partial payments at specified intervals.although the probation officer advised that faasse could pay restitution at a rate deemed reasonable by the court,at,the magistrate judge explicitly declined to devise a payment plan for the restitution order.at.he based his decision on his belief that faasse has had means and methods to pay this money all along,he just will not id.because faasse was evasive and recalcitrant in providing financial information to the court,and the burden was his to demonstrate his inability to pay,we can not conclude that the magistrate judge finding is an abuse of discretion.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.
because my view of the commerce clause fundamentally differs from that of the majority,i respectfully dissent.in united states lopez,d,and united states morrison,d,the supreme court made clear that some matters are simply outside of the scope of congressional regulation under the commerce clause.i think that criminalizing the failure to pay child support pursuant to a state court order is one of those matters.in the original panel decision,we noted that the framers of our constitution drafted the interstate commerce clause,not the interstate clause.the majority construction renders the commerce component meaningless.such a reading violates the intent of the framers,and transforms the commerce measure drafted to prevent state interference in the economic affairs of the a virtually limitless federal police power,contrary to the supreme court recent holdings in lopez and morrison.
in determining the scope of congressional power under the commerce clause,a brief review of the historical roots of this power is instructive.as the supreme court has noted,the sole purpose for which virginia initiated the movement which ultimately produced the constitution was to take into consideration the trade of the united states to examine the relative situations and trade of the said states to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulation may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony.documents,formation of the union.hood sons,du mond.james madison,chief architect of our federal system,stated that the union required a power to regulate commercial activity,because want of a general power over commerce led to an exercise of this power separately,by the states,which not only proved abortive,but engendered rival,conflicting and angry regulations.the records of the federal convention max farrand.
this power to prevent states from establishing parochial barriers to national trade,and the resulting injuries to the national economic health,was so universally assumed to be necessary,no other state power was so readily relinquished.hood sons,at.justice jackson noted this need for uniformity as the framer primary objective and recognized their intent to limit the commerce power to the protection of the free flow of commerce commenting,t here was no desire to authorize federal interference with social conditions or legal institutions of the states.id.in fact,the arguments made in favor of the constitution ratification generally,and the commerce clause specifically,highlighted the need for a federal commerce power in order to navigate successfully the rough waters of the developing transatlantic economy.so vital was this american common market to the former colonies participation in international trade,that constitutional supporters exhorted 
t here is no object,either as it respects the interests of trade or finance,that more strongly demands a federal superintendence.the want of a federal commerce power has already operated as a bar to the formation of beneficial treaties with foreign powers,and has given occasions of dissatisfaction between the states.no nation acquainted with the nature of our political association would be unwise enough to enter into stipulations with the united states,by which they conceded privileges of any importance to them,while they were apprised that the engagements on the part of the union might at any moment be violated by its members,and while they found from experience that they might enjoy every advantage they desired in our markets,without granting us any return but such as their momentary convenience might suggest.

the most widely accepted general description of commerce,and the one cited by the majority,is given in gibbons ogden commerce,undoubtedly,is traffic,but it is something is intercourse.it describes the commercial intercourse between nations,and parts of nations in all its branches gibbons,wheat.however,as judge jerry smith has pointed out,intercourse has as its distinguishing feature a notion of reciprocity.united states bailey,cir smith,dissenting see also webster new world dictionary of the american language,ed defining intercourse as communication or dealings between or among people,countries,interchange of products,services,ideas,feelings,and interchange as to give and take mutually exchange to put each of two things in the other place.this element of mutual exchange of value motivated by economic the marketplace which fosters social wealth.see michael klausner,corporations,corporate law,and networks of contracts.rev,noting the basic precept of welfare economics that competitive market forces optimize social wealth.and it is the aspect of markets that justifies a national commerce power in our federal system as the supreme court reminds us,the overriding requirement of the commerce clause is a national common market.hunt washington state adver.comm n,d see also hughes alexandria scrap,d noting the premise,well established by the history of the commerce clause,that this nation is a common market.
the failure to obey a state court order,of course,lacks this essential feature of reciprocity.this is so even where the order mandates a transfer of wealth,as do child support orders.p ayment of child support is not conditioned on the performance of a reciprocal duty by the obligee,nor does it benefit the obligor.bailey,at smith,dissenting.due to this unilateral,redistributive character,support obligations can influence the national common market only at the margins,if at all.indeed,the right to support payments is not freely alienable and,in some instances,the payments must be made to the state rather than directly to the ultimate beneficiary,further depriving these payments of the potential to affect the market.see.comp.laws ann.west providing for payment of support to the office of the michigan friend of the court.because of their nature,wealth transfers to or from michigan residents are not per se a fit object of the federal commerce power.
the majority seeks to put to rest the notion that interstate commerce requires reciprocity,attributing to this dissent the premise that because payment of a debt is not reciprocal,it is not subject to congress commerce power.the majority next cites united states simpson,hoke united states,and pensacola.western union,otto,for the proposition that the mere transport of people or information across state lines gives congress authority to regulate them.the majority then reasons that a debt,or the support order enforcing it,is a thing in interstate commerce and therefore subject to congressional regulation.but although debts are typically reciprocal in the sense that payment is being sought for something of value given earlier,it does not follow that all debts are commercial in nature,such that they are properly the subject of the commerce power and the cases cited by the majority do not deal with congress authority to regulate things in interstate commerce.neither do these cases hold that commerce need not involve an element of reciprocity.rather,these cases deal with regulating the channels of interstate commerce by keeping them open and free from immoral uses.
the csra does not regulate within any of the categories permitted by lopez,namely,the channels of interstate commerce,things that travel in these channels,or intrastate activity that substantially affects commerce.rather,the act regulates,through the imposition of criminal sanctions,obligations owed by one family member to another,using diversity of residence as a jurisdictional hook.this is particularly troubling because the states possess primary authority for defining and enforcing both the criminal law and the law of domestic relations.as thomas jefferson wrote 
t he constitution of the united states,having delegated to congress the power to punish treason,counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the united states,piracies,and felonies committed on the high seas,and offenses against the law of nations,and no other crimes whatsoever and it being true as a general principle,and one of the amendments to the constitution having also declared,that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the states,are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people,therefore all their other acts which assume to create,define,or punish crimes,other than those so enumerated in the constitution,are altogether void,and of no force and that the power to create,define,and punish such other crimes is reserved,and,of right appertains solely and exclusively to the respective states,each within its own territory.
kentucky resolutions,resolved cl,reprinted in the portable thomas jefferson,merrill peterson,see also patterson new york,d stating that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the states than it is of the federal government.in a like vein,the courts have consistently recognized that t he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife,parent and child,belongs to the laws of the states,and not the laws of the united states.ex parte burrus.see also sosna iowa,d stating that the regulation of domestic relations has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the states ankenbrandt richards,d recognizing a domestic relations exception to the diversity jurisdiction of federal courts in view of understandings and sound policy considerations.
in lopez,the supreme court addressed the reach of congress commerce power.the court struck down the gun free school zones act,q a,which prohibited any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place he knows is a school zone,as an unconstitutional exercise of congress power under the commerce clause.lopez,at.that power,the court observed,extends to only three types of activity the use of the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,namely,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.id.at.since q a did not involve channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,the court reasoned that the statute would be constitutional only if it qualified under the third category,as a statute that regulated an activity which substantially affected interstate commerce.id.at.
in considering that question,the court recognized that its case law had not always been clear as to whether an activity must affect or substantially affect interstate commerce.the court then explained that consistent with the great weight of our case law the proper test requires an analysis of whether the regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce.id.having clarified that point,the court concluded that several critical factors prevented q a from qualifying as a valid exercise of congressional authority under the third category.first,since q a did not regulate a commercial activity,the statute could not be upheld as regulating activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,which viewed in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.id.at.further,the statute contained no jurisdictional element which would ensure,through inquiry,that the activity in question affects interstate commerce.id.finally,the statute was not supported by specific congressional findings that would enable the court to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce,even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.id.at.
the majority in the case before us today says that the csra falls within category i,and perhaps category ii,of lopez.because payment of child support on behalf of an child will normally require the use of channels of interstate commerce,the majority argues,the csra is constitutional under the first lopez category.see also united states crawford,cir.the majority apparently also embraces the thesis that likens child support obligations to interstate debts or contracts,and asserts that congress authority to prevent obstruction of interstate commerce empowers it to criminalize nonpayment of such obligations.see united states bongiorno,cir united states sage,cir.the majority also suggests that because the obligations covered by the csra,in the aggregate,total billions of dollars,the act might pass muster under lopez as a regulation of an intrastate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.see,united states parker,cir.any of these theories however,would permit the creation of a federal law of ordinary private debt,whenever one party moved out of state after the debt was created.for the reasons set forth below,these arguments are unpersuasive.
i admit to some confusion with respect to the notion that the csra regulates the use of the channels of interstate commerce.the term channel of interstate commerce refers to,inter alia,navigable rivers,lakes,and canals of the united states the interstate railroad track system the interstate highway system interstate telephone and telegraph lines air traffic routes television and radio broadcast frequencies.gibbs babbitt,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.congress has broad authority with respect to these channels not only may the legislature regulate them directly,it may act to keep them free from immoral and injurious uses.caminetti united states.but congress does not act pursuant to this authority when it regulates an activity that merely implicates or invokes the use of the channels of interstate commerce.bailey,at.thus,this court held in united states abdullah that the ban on trafficking in contraband cigarettes found at does not fall within the first lopez category because the purpose of the ban is not to keep open the very avenues by which interstate commerce is transacted.united states abdullah,cir.indeed,to hold otherwise would be to collapse the first and second lopez categories any regulation of a thing in interstate commerce would necessarily be a regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce.the failure to place a payment in the channels of interstate commerce does not corrupt those channels,put them to immoral uses,or in any way threaten to close or impede them.assuming that the supreme court did not idly draw the distinctions that it did,i can not agree that the csra regulates the channels of interstate commerce merely by criminalizing the failure to make support payments which,if made,would normally enter the flow of interstate commerce.
similarly unpersuasive is the argument that the csra regulates a thing in interstate commerce.this contention relies on an analogy between child support obligations and interstate debts,and on the further supposition that congress may compel payment of debts through its power to prevent obstruction of interstate commerce.accepting for the moment the rickety analogy between support obligations and debts,although,as noted above,i do not believe support obligations in fact have any commercial character at all i know of no case that holds that congress has plenary authority to regulate a debt merely because the obligor and obligee reside in different states.this theory relies upon such cases as milling bondurant,and allenberg cotton pittman,d.in these cases,the parties executed contracts for the sale of goods that were to be performed within the territorial limits of a particular state,but which contemplated that the goods would enter the flow of interstate commerce.when these contracts were breached,the defendants asserted as a defense state laws prescribing conditions on which foreign corporations might do business in the state in which the contract was to be performed.the supreme court held that these business qualification laws,as applied,violated the dormant commerce clause,saying we think the transaction was in interstate commerce,at.tempting though it may be to apply this snippet in an analysis under lopez second category,the supreme court itself has acknowledged that the clear import of and allenberg cotton is that a state has no power to prevent an engagement in interstate commerce within her limits,except by her leave.sonneborn cureton.these cases support the traditional view that the federal power to regulate commerce prevents states from impeding the flow of goods and services across state lines,and in no way suggest that the federal legislature has regulatory jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of contracting parties on the basis of mere diversity of residency.see united states underwriters ass n.emphasizing that legal formulae devised to assess state power can not uncritically be accepted as trustworthy guides to determine congressional power under the commerce clause.
even if they did so suggest,still another obstacle stands in the way of the hypothesis that the csra regulates a thing in interstate commerce.simply put,defendants in csra cases do not put something into the flow of interstate commerce rather,they are being prosecuted for failing to do so.it has been argued that this failure amounts to an obstruction of interstate commerce,which congress has authority to prevent.see,united states mussari,cir.i agree that congress has power to remove impediments to interstate commerce.thus,congress may prohibit racial discrimination that obstructs the flow of interstate commerce,see heart of atlanta motel united states,d upholding the civil rights act of,prohibit violent actions that interfere with interstate commerce,see united states green.upholding the hobbs act,and prohibit restraints of trade that obstruct interstate commerce,see standard oil united states.upholding the sherman act.but this line of cases deals with active obstruction of the flow of interstate commerce it does not stand for the more radical proposition that congress is empowered to regulate the passive failure of individuals to engage in interstate commerce.see bailey,at smith,dissenting.more importantly,the obstruction argument conflates the lopez categories.a prohibition on obstruction of commerce does not regulate a thing in commerce,nor does obstruction constitute a use of the channels of interstate commerce under the common meaning of use.id.rather,congress has authority to prohibit activities that interfere with commerce because those activities,taken in the aggregate,substantially affect commerce.the csra must therefore stand or fall,like the gun free school zones act,as a regulation under lopez final category.
most significantly,by effectively predicating jurisdiction on mere diversity of residency,the act regulates every interstate obligation,without exception.bailey,at smith,dissenting.but,as i have already shown,child support obligations are not commercial in character.in the absence of a mechanism that would link particular support obligations to some sort of economic enterprise,sustaining the constitutionality of the csra on the basis of this purported jurisdictional nexus requires the excising of the element of commerce from the commerce clause.see id.
as discussed earlier,the gun free school zones act could not be sustained as a regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce for three reasons.section q was a criminal statute that,by its terms,had nothing to do with any sort of economic enterprise it contained no jurisdictional element that would have ensured,through case by case inquiry,that the activity in question affected interstate commerce and it was passed without findings elaborating the link between the activity criminalized and interstate commerce.lopez,at.the csra fails constitutional muster for precisely these same reasons.
the manner in which the activity regulated by the csra substantially affects interstate commerce is unclear.t o the extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the failure to satisfy child support obligations substantially affected interstate commerce,even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye,they are lacking here.lopez,at.it is possible to infer from the legislative history that approximately billion in interstate child support obligations go unpaid annually,and that congress believed that some families were driven to federal public assistance as a result of unpaid child support.see,at observing that billion in support obligations are not met each year,and that approximately of child support cases concern children whose fathers live in a different state.these observations do not amount to a congressional conclusion that unpaid child support substantially affects interstate commerce,however,and courts would not simply accept that conclusion based on such findings in any event.see united states morrison.at noting that whether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question.
first,the mere fact that the aggregate social costs of an activity amount to a large dollar figure can not,without more,satisfy the jurisdictional requirement that the activity have a substantial relationship to interstate commerce.see id.at.the notion that the commerce power includes regulation of activities that are connected with a commercial transaction which,viewed in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce stems from wickard filburn,perhaps the most far reaching example of commerce clause authority.lopez,at.but the supreme court has made clear that wickard applies to laws that are an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity,in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.id.at.such is not the case here.the csra does not address a situation involving the aggregate effect of potential market participants refusal to participate in no small part because child support orders are not commercial.moreover,i have considerable doubt that,as a factual matter,transfers of wealth from one state to another affect interstate commerce.in the aggregate,any given state should have about as much money from support payments leaving its borders as entering.see recent case,harv.thus,the amount of goods bought in each state relative to other states should be basically unchanged,and interstate commerce left unaffected.id.
likewise,federal regulatory jurisdiction can not be founded on the possibility that nonpayment of support orders might cause individual citizens to become dependent on programs funded with federal money.taken to its logical conclusion,this reasoning would allow congress to regulate activity of any person that depletes another person assets and,at bottom,is no different from the costs of crime and national productivity arguments already rejected by the supreme court.see lopez,at.what the court said in lopez holds true here as well to uphold the se contentions,we would have to pile inference upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the commerce clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the states.id.at.accordingly,i conclude that the csra is not a valid regulation of interstate commerce under lopez third and final category.
the majority discusses at length the pervasive and interstate nature of the child support delinquency problem and recognizes that throughout its history,congress has exercised its positive power under the commerce clause to enact legislation to help the states solve problems that defy local solution.however,the majority fails to note that the authority to enact these laws flowed from the relationship between the proposed regulation and interstate commerce,clearly ascertainable under one of the lopez categories,and not the difficulty or interstate nature of the problem.for example,federal laws prohibiting loan sharking were held permissible because loan sharking and the attendant organized crime interferes with interstate commercial activity,not merely because the problem defied state solutions.see perez united states,d.the other instances cited by the majority,where the courts have upheld congressional authority to regulate the channels of interstate commerce,fall into the category of regulations to prevent the federally maintained channels from being used for immoral or illegal purposes.the national stolen property act,cited by the majority,provides an example of regulation designed to prevent criminals from profiting from the open channels of interstate commerce.further,courts have upheld regulations,such as the hobbs act,aimed at protecting commerce itself.these regulations defend the integrity and reliability of the channels of interstate commerce,and congressional authority to enact them flows from the constitutional charge to regulate commerce among the several states.
it might in fact be more convenient in the context of today highly mobile society and shifting mores if congress enacted uniform laws for child support,child custody and spousal support that could be universally applied and easily enforced without regard to state boundaries.that federal solutions to various social problems might prove efficacious and convenient,however,does not confer upon congress the constitutional authority to regulate relationships.here,the majority wrongly focuses on the pervasiveness of parents failure to obey child support orders,the difficulty states have in enforcing such obligations,and the unhappy consequences to a child when his parent is derelict in his or her parental duties.there is no question that the of is a problem of national proportions.to the extent that state boundaries make recovery more difficult,it is an interstate problem.
however,as lopez and morrison make clear,congress jurisdiction is not premised on the severity of a problem,its susceptibility to a federal solution,or the fact that a federal solution might be more convenient.the failure of a parent to comply with a order does not burden commerce among the states in any way.it does not erect the barriers to trade that the founders so feared.nor does the failure to comply with a state support order allow the channels of interstate commerce to be used for some nefarious or dangerous purpose.moreover,the failure to pay child support interstate has no effect on any national scheme of economic regulation and does not substantially affect interstate commerce.in fact,the economic impact of failure to pay intrastate is indistinguishable from the failure to pay after one has moved.
it is beyond dispute that willful with support orders has a detrimental,often devastating effect on single parents who depend on the payments to make ends meat.likewise,a victim of crime,such as the plaintiff in morrison,suffers psychological and emotional scars beyond calculation,but which,for purposes of the justice we are able to provide,might be converted into dollars and cents.however,the supreme court has refused to construe these individual losses,even when they are aggregated into terms such as costs of crime and lost productivity,as offenses against the american commercial system.see lopez,at.
in this case,the csra encroachment on these traditional preserves of state authority does considerable damage to michigan system for regulating child support,which was enacted by its legislature and applied by its elected judges.in light of the traditional notions of federalism and in the wake of lopez,i can not conclude that the commerce clause countenances such damage.the supreme court has observed that when congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the states,it effects a change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.united states lopez,quoting united states enmons,d.ironically,it may be that state power suffers greater disruption when congress criminalizes conduct that the states have chosen not to criminalize but to regulate in a different fashion,for the federal law assigns to the conduct new costs that differ not just in quantum,but in kind,from the costs defined by the state.such is the case here.
this federal legislative choice is particularly unsettling given that congressional power to disturb state regulatory programs has customarily been thought to fall into three categories,into none of which the csra comfortably fits.congress may,pursuant to its spending power,influence a state regulatory decisions by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal funds.see south dakota dole,d.congress may also craft programs of cooperative federalism that offer a state the choice of regulating according to national standards or having state law by federal regulation.see hodel virginia surface mining reclamation ass n,d.finally,congress may,of course,preempt outright state laws regulating private activity that is within the enumerated powers of the constitution.see rice santa fe elevator.
in enacting the csra,congress has followed none of these paths.although the act does authorize grants to states to coordinate interstate child support enforcement efforts,see,these monies are not tethered to the criminal provisions of the legislation.the act emasculates the states ability to assign social and other costs to the disobedience of child support orders regardless of whether the states accept federal funds.and,unlike the federal government use of highway funds to force the states to make changes in their laws governing the consumption of alcoholic beverages,the csra does not offer the states the choice between devising remedies within minimum federal standards and having federal funds withheld.indeed,the csra creates no issue the act is founded on the existence of state court orders,not their displacement.by piggybacking a criminal sanction on the states child support orders,the csra recognizes the primacy of the states laws at the same time that it expressly overrides portions of those laws.
the constitution diffuses power to protect the citizenry against just such attempts to fragment official action from political accountability.see the federalist,at james madison clinton rossiter,in the compound republic of america,the power surrendered by the people is first divided between two distinct governments,and then the portion allotted to each subdivided among distinct and separate departments.hence a double security arises to the rights of the people.the different governments control each other,at the same time that each is controlled by itself.among the structural protections of the constitution is the doctrine of enumerated powers,and the commerce clause figures prominently among these.although judicial efforts to maintain the federal balance through exposition of the commerce clause have taken some turns,oklahoma tax comm jefferson lines,d,the supreme court reaffirmed in united states lopez that there are some activities that states may regulate but congress may not.
although michigan has a felony desertion statute on its books,it is rarely enforced and,in any case,it does not link criminal liability to judicial child support orders.see.comp.laws ann.west providing liability for refusing to provide necessary and proper shelter,food,care,and clothing for his or her children under years of age.civil child support enforcement methods account for virtually all enforcement activity in michigan.scott bassett,family law,annual survey of michigan law june,may,wayne.michigan law commits to the discretion of state judges the means by which to to deter failure to support order.a circuit court judge may incarcerate a person for child nonsupport,but this remedy is civil in nature.see.comp.laws ann.west mead batchlor,clearly,it was intended that the michigan statutory procedure authorizing incarceration for child nonsupport should be regarded as civil in nature.furthermore,the judge discretion in this regard is carefully cabined an order of incarceration may be entered only if other as income withholding,interception of tax refunds,and property liens appear unlikely to correct the payer failure or refusal to pay support.comp.laws ann.west.
the csra disrupts the state scheme.by creating a federal criminal penalty as a deterrent for disobedience of support orders in some circumstances,the act renders nugatory the discretion invested in michigan circuit court judges.moreover,these judges are subject to election,see.const,and the contours of their discretion are determined by an elected legislature the csra thus prevents michigan officials from regulating in accordance with the views of the local electorate.see new york united states,d noting that where congress encourages state regulation rather than compelling it,state officials remain accountable to the people,but that accountability is diminished when,due to federal interference,elected state officials can not regulate in accordance with the view of the local electorate in matters not by federal regulation.in essence,the act carves up michigan law by predicating liability on violations of michigan court orders,but putting deterrence and penalty decisions into the hands of united states officials in that minority of cases in which the state of residence of the payer is different from that of the child.
in united states morrison the supreme court warned against overly elastic conceptions of the commerce clause that would give congress authority over family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage,divorce,and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant.morrison.at.mindful of this admonition,i would hold that the provisions of the child support recovery act of contained in,exceed congress authority under the constitution.it is important to note that such a ruling would not prevent congress from assisting the states in obtaining interstate enforcement of their courts orders.congress can do so and has done so pursuant to the full faith and credit clause.see full faith and credit for child support orders act,stat.codified as amended at.but congress may not,under the guise of the commerce power,criminalize the failure to obey a state court order when the state itself has declined to do so.such legislation does considerable violence to state regulation by fragmenting the state courts ability to announce judgments and their ability to determine the sanction that will attend disobedience of those judgments.absent a stronger connection with the commercial concerns that are central to the commerce clause,this intrusion disrupts the federal balance that the framers envisioned.see lopez,at.kennedy,concurring.

we do not believe,nor does morrison hold,that all activity regulated by the commerce clause must be economic in nature morrison spoke only to congressional regulation of exclusively intra state activities.pursuant to its category one and two power,congress may,for example,regulate the instrumentalities of commerce,such as automobiles or planes congress may regulate things in commerce that are,such as lottery tickets and congress may regulate the channels of interstate commerce by,prohibiting racial discrimination and thereby increasing the flow of traffic through interstate channels.
out of concern that other litigants will rely upon it,we must put to rest the dissent reliance on the notion that interstate commerce requires reciprocity,defined as the mutual exchange of value motivated by economic,post,and that,because payment of a debt is not reciprocal,it is not a proper subject for congress commerce clause power.we know of no court that has imposed such a restrictive notion of commerce upon the constitution.bailey,at rejecting dissent attempt to define commerce as bilateral commercial transaction and noting that such definition would require overruling numerous supreme court precedents citing hoke united states.holding that it is interstate commerce to transport a woman from one state to another in a common carrier united states simpson.holding that it is interstate commerce to carry across a state line in a private automobile five quarts of whiskey intended for personal consumption and pensacola.western union,otto.holding that it is interstate commerce to transmit information over interstate telegraph lines.indeed,the dissent in our case can only point to a dissent in the fifth circuit bailey decision to support its novel proposition,and even that dissent limited its requirement of reciprocity to things in commerce,see bailey,at smith,dissenting,whereas the dissent in our case would apply its narrow understanding of commerce to every conceivable category.in addition to overruling various supreme court precedents,the dissent definition of commerce would render unconstitutional innumerable federal statutes.for example,all federal statutes that criminalize the possession of drugs or weapons which have traveled interstate would,on the dissent view of commerce,have to be struck down because there is no reciprocity in possession,nor does possession of a contraband substance invoke the aspect of markets.post at.the same can be said of federal regulations of the air and water,of the highways and the nation airspace,and myriad safety regulations,none of which involve reciprocity.the most likely genesis for the dissent reasoning is that line of cases,such as hammer dagenhart,in which the supreme court relied on a narrow construction of the word commerce and attempted to craft rigid distinctions between manufacture,production,and mining,thought to be the province of the states,and actual interstate commerce.see wickard filburn.discussing development of commerce clause jurisprudence.the dagenhart line of cases was,of course,subsequently overruled and currently represents a completely discredited understanding of the commerce clause.in any event,we have no doubt that the supreme court contemporary understanding of commer
