introduction 
the marriage underlying this case was sadly overburdened and failed.unfortunately,the divorce is also problematic.essentially,a very high earner making million during the marriage agreed to a stipulated divorce judgment providing for child and spousal support.in this appeal from what was mostly the denial of the high earner postjudgment request for a reduction of his child support obligations to guideline and his request to terminate spousal support in the wake of the wife remarriage,he presents two issues of law.
there was a clause in the stipulated judgment to the effect that any future modification proceeding would be reviewed de novo.did that clause eliminate the usual rule that applies to postjudgment modifications we answer no.the law does not allow litigants to agree to what are in effect temporary judgments,revisable at will.
there was a clause in the stipulated judgment that said if the high earner remarried to a person making less than a year,the high earner would still keep paying her spousal support but at a reduced rate.did the remarriage terminate spousal support anyway,given that the clause did not expressly mention family code section the statute that makes spousal support terminable at remarriage again we answer no.the lack of an express reference to section did not function as a kind of king x to contradict the plain intent of the clause particularly since the parties modified the stipulated judgment in october to provide for continued spousal support after the wife imminent remarriage.
we thus conclude there is no error in the orders challenged here.the trial court correctly denied the high earner requests to modify the child support amounts down to a guideline amount and also correctly denied his request to terminate spousal support in the wake of the subsequent remarriage.
lauralin and richard cohen were married in and separated in.they had four children.lauralin then petitioned for dissolution of the marriage.a little less than five years later,the couple entered into a stipulated judgment for dissolution.
richard is a executive in the clothing industry who had earned about million a year during the marriage.but his income had gone down by.the stipulated judgment recites that richard income in march,was per month,which works out to annually.
the stipulated judgment provides for total monthly child support payments in excess of a month in computing that amount,richard is given credit for having a percent time share with one of the children,dean,and a percent time share with two of the other children,jason and skylar.the fourth child,daniel,is quadriplegic as a result of cerebal palsy,and requires continual nursing care there is no dispute that the child support order is higher than statutory legal guidelines see et require.
the judgment also has a provision stating that any future requests to modify support should be reviewed de novo by the court.the exact text of this provision is the allocations of support as set forth above are without prejudice to either party.in the event that either party seeks a modification of child support or dependant adult support in the future,said support amounts and the allocation of said support shall be reviewed de novo by the court.
it further provides for spousal support in the amount of about a month the judgment had this provision in regard to remarriage by lauralin in the event petitioner lauralin becomes remarried and petitioner new spouse income is less than,respondent richard total annual spousal support obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to of petitioner new spouse income.if lauralin new spouse income is greater than per year,richard spousal support obligation shall be reduced to zero.this provision shall not apply if lauralin remarries within months of entry of this judgment.in the event that lauralin remarries within months of entry of this judgment,spousal support payable to lauralin shall terminate.
in january,richard filed a request for order rfo seeking,among other things,a reduction in his child support obligation based on significant declines in his income incurred in the years and.clearly his income had declined in those two years however,by the time richard request was finally heard on february,the parties had achieved a stipulation which took care of all issues prior to january.thus richard rfo was based only on his income in going forward.
and by february,things had significantly turned around for richard.in may,richard had begun working for a hong kong based company,trinity limited.that month trinity began paying him a salary of a year a month.plus,it paid him a signing bonus,predicated on meeting certain targets over the course of the next two years.
three requests were presented to the court on richard motion reduction of child support to guideline level,particularly in light of the de novo clause in the stipulated judgment termination of lauralin spousal support based on a remarriage that occurred in october,and an increase of richard time share percentage re skylar to percent based on his payment of percent of the costs of skylar being in a school for mentally ill children.richard challenges the trial court decision as to issues and,which he lost except for a reduction for the first four months of.issue has been abandoned on appeal.
in regard to issue,the child support reduction,the trial judge noted that,considering richard new employment with trinity at a month plus proration of his bonus over the months from may another a month,and an ex pat benefit paid by trinity a month,richard was now making more money than he was making at the time of the may judgment at least month against the earlier on the other hand,if one were to take into account the first four lean months of in which richard had made per month the total average for the year would be,which,if our math is correct,would represent a roughly percent drop in income from the level provided for in the stipulated judgment.
the trial judge resolved these disparities by amortizing the bonus prospectively from may forward.in practical terms,that meant the court granted richard request to reduce child support for the first four months of prior to the trinity employment,but from may forward,there were no adverse changes of circumstance to justify modification.
as to issue,it turned out that lauralin had remarried on october,which was just a little more than months since the date of the march,stipulated judgment.had nothing been done,her remarriage,by the terms of the march judgment,would have terminated all spousal support.
however,on october,four days before her remarriage,she and richard,each now in propria persona entered into a stipulation which retroactively changed the period that began on march,to an period.the net effect of the stipulation allowed lauralin to remarry within the next few days and still continue receiving spousal support.
the stipulation of october,looks like a repeat of language already quoted on page supra,but the change is significant.the way the stipulation was structured,it was as if the march stipulated judgment was being modified nunc pro tunc.it said spousal support paragraph number shall be modified so the months is substituted for months at page,lines and.said paragraph shall now read as follows in the event lauralin becomes remarried and her new spouse income is less than,richard total annual spousal support obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to of lauralin new spouse income.if lauralin new spouse income is greater than per year,richard spousal support obligation shall be reduced to zero.this provision shall not apply if lauralin remarries within months of this judgment.in the event that lauralin remarries within months of entry of this judgment,spousal support payable to lauralin shall terminate.
in an income and expense declaration filed may,lauralin new spouse income is listed as a month or less than a year.percent of that amount is,which reduced richard obligation to.
as to richard request in regard to spousal support,the trial court ruled the stipulated judgment,particularly as modified on october,waived what would otherwise be the effect of section,which normally terminates spousal support on remarriage the court also ruled that the stipulated judgment waived what otherwise would be the rebuttable presumption set out in section of the decreased need for spousal support that occurs on a supported spouse cohabitation with a nonmarital partner the court further rejected richard request to reduce spousal support for the first four lean months of,ruling that richard had not shown a material change in the numerous factors that govern spousal support under section.the court reasoned his decline in income was only one such factor.
the court orders and reasoning were formally set out in a signed order filed april.richard timely filed a notice of appeal from the orders of april,on june.
iii.discussion 
a.the amortization issue 
we first deal with a relatively minor issue in richard appeal,which is his argument that if the trial court had used a calendar year average,the court would have recognized that richard had indeed shown a change of circumstances.that is,if one isolates the months of calendar and takes an average based on those particular months,exhibit showed an percent reduction in monthly income in comparison to march versus.
the issue implicates the body of law governing how fluctuating income is treated for child support.see generally definition of income includes bonuses court may adjust the child support as appropriate to accommodate the seasonal or fluctuating income of either parent in re marriage of mosley th mosley in re marriage of riddle th riddle in re marriage of rosen rosen th and hogoboom and king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
if we were to attempt to boil down the law involving how bonuses affect income calculations for purposes of child support determination,it would be,simply the treatment must be fair and representative.see riddle,supra,th at.thus,for example,in mosley,it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to predicate a support order on the assumption the payor parent would receive a huge bonus when in fact such a large bonus might never materialize.mosley,supra,th at.in riddle,the trial judge abused her discretion by taking just the two best months of the payor spouse most recent year of earnings to figure monthly income.that was,as the appellate court said,an embarrassingly short period on which to predict the annual income of a commissioned salesperson who works in the financial markets.riddle,supra,th at.and in rosen this court held it was error for the trial court to base a goodwill valuation on an abnormally good year which was not reasonably illustrative.rosen,supra,th at.
but in this case,the trial court decision to average out richard bonus over the two years prospectively may to may makes sense.this is the period the bonus was intended to cover.the trial court decision corresponds to the economic substance of that bonus,which was essentially paying richard for anticipated good results for the next two years going forward,and,more to the point,locked him into proverbial golden handcuffs to keep him so working for those years.conversely,the bonus was certainly not given in payment for any work done in the first four months of.
it is true that,generally speaking,as the court said in riddle,there is heavy emphasis in the law on the income tax calendar year as the basic unit on which to calculate income.see riddle,supra,th at,citing.but the court was also careful in riddle to point out that the relevant time period might be longer,or perhaps sometimes even somewhat shorter,than a year,depending on the nature of the payor parent income since section s and are framed in discretionary terms,it would be outside the proper province of an appellate court to prescribe a rule for the precise parameters of a proper sample after all,the whole point of discretion is a recognition that there are times when there should be a rule.id.at see contrasting various professions.in the present case,amortization over two years was the most reasonable way of treating richard may signing bonus.
b.the de novo issue 
this brings us to the main argument richard makes regarding his child support reduction request,namely that the court should have honored the de novo language in the modification paragraph of the stipulated judgment and looked at circumstances anew.the subtext of this argument is that the trial court,had it done so,would have reduced his current order down to guideline 
we dare say no family lawyer is unaware of the rule requiring a change of circumstances before a support order may be modified.the reason the rule is so ubiquitous in family practice has been explained in in re marriage of schaffer th because family law cases typically entail issues concerning an ongoing relationship rather than a distinct event child support,custody and visitation,for example the law builds in the necessary flexibility to accommodate changing circumstances by postjudgment orders to show cause hearings where the judgment has provided jurisdiction to do so.unlike an auto accident case which might end with a tidy final judgment for money damages,the successive modifications possible in a family law proceeding can make the case resemble an unruly desert caravan strung out upon the sands.id.at see,in re marriage of khera sameer th,overview of basic rule.
the precise issue thus becomes whether the parties could contract around the rule.in support of his theory richard points to a couple of cases,in re marriage of catalano d catalano and in re marriage of thomas d thomas from which one might extract the possibility of modification without a change of circumstances 
but reliance on catalano is misplaced.the only support for richard position in catalano is dicta because in catalano there was a change of circumstances justifying the modification in that case,upwards.see catalano,supra,d at noting increase in payor parent earnings.indeed,catalano is regularly cited for the proposition that a change of circumstances is required before a modification,bodo,supra,th at in re marriage of laudeman th.
moreover,the catalano dicta is merely a variant of the family law rule that child support obligations are as distinct from contractual,so the court always retains authority to assure a minimum level of adequate child support.indeed,from the very earliest days,california courts overrode stipulated support orders or the total lack of provision for them in the first place to impose or increase child support.see wilson wilson cal.wilson imposing child support where there was none in original divorce decree.as a late century case summarized the rule the authority of the court to modify the decree in a proper case,and to provide when necessary that the plaintiff shall discharge his paramount duty in caring for and defraying the expense of educating his children,is not doubted.the stipulation of the parents can not divest them,as against the children,of this duty.parkhurst parkhurst cal,parkhurst,italics added.
but the other authority catalano cited and one which richard also relies on directly thomas,can not be so readily distinguished.thomas,in fact,provides some real support for richard position.in thomas,a former husband sought and obtained a a month reduction in child support per child without proof or even allegation of change of circumstances.see thomas,supra,d at.we now explain why we decline to follow the thomas decision.
thomas was a bagatelle of a decision consisting of but four paragraphs,and one of those was merely a disposition.in thomas,a former husband sought a downward modification of his support obligation from to a month per child,but did not provide a court record of the parties circumstances at the time the original judgment was made.he got his downward modification in the trial court and the appellate court affirmed.the appellate court reasoned that,given the absence of any findings of financial circumstances,the modification proceeding itself was the first time the proper amount of child support was litigated,hence the court acted within its discretion in modifying the previous order based on the current evidence,and so affirmed the order.thomas,supra,d at.in the process,the thomas court articulated a rule allowing modification without changed circumstances in more terms than just a rule that allows courts to increase support upwards to assure that children are adequately supported the court may modify a child support order where the parties have stipulated to the amount of support modification does not always require a showing of changed circumstances and in certain cases may be justified by current circumstances.see moore moore d,moore.id.at.
moore,however,does not stand for the proposition that thomas cited it for.moore was simply one of the numerous california cases we have already mentioned allowing courts to modify stipulated judgments to assure adequate child support.modifications are needed in such cases,as the moore court put it,if only to prevent children becoming public charges.see moore,supra,d at.the moore case arose because of a change of custody of one child,and the parent with the new custody of that child simply did not have the income and resources to adequately provide for that child expenses.id.at,quoting levy levy d.
thomas was thus different from the situation in moore.had the thomas court followed the basic california rule,it would have analyzed the wife appeal in terms of whether the payor parent had met the burden he had to show a change of circumstances since the previous order,in re marriage of stephenson th,burden on party seeking modification,citing cases.under the facts as stated in thomas,the result would have been different.we need merely add such a burden on the payor father in thomas would have hardly been unreasonable surely he could have offered a declaration as to what he was making just four years earlier when he agreed to the per child support order.see thomas,supra,d at.in a word,thomas was wrongly decided.
the reason for the change of circumstances rule is the doctrine of res judicata.the first supreme court case to announce the rule in regard to modification requests was snyder snyder cal.snyder.there,in february,a trial court reduced the total support owing an and child when,just the previous october,the had made an identical application and it had been turned down.the february attempt,in fact,contained not a single new fact since the october effort.id.at.our supreme court flatly said the court in february had no authority to alter the judgment,and relied on a now treatise dating back to world war i,mckinney ruling case law after laying down the rule,the snyder court in fact quoted from page of the first volume of the ruling case law hornbook,in terms that make it clear res judicata is the animating principle behind the rule authority to modify the allowance,however,does not include the right to alter the award upon the state of case existing when the decree was entered,or to review the action of the chancellor therein.the parties had their day in court,with the right of appeal if the decree was deemed erroneous,and it can not be supposed that it was intended that the court should sit in review of its own decrees,or that the same or some succeeding chancellor presiding in the same court should,after the lapse of indefinite time,have power to reverse,alter or modify a decree for alimony upon the facts existing at the time of its entry.snyder,supra,cal.at,italics added.
as snyder makes clear,richard reliance on the de novo clause is untenable.his position would reduce family law orders and judgments to mere temporary placeholders in contravention of res judicata.
spousal support termination 
section provides that spousal support will automatically terminate e xcept as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.richard relies on two cases which took a relatively strict view of what it takes to agree otherwise,in re marriage of thornton th thornton and in re marriage of glasser glasser d.he argues the remarriage language in the stipulated judgment even as modified in october did not meet the requisite expressivity contemplated by the statute.we disagree.the language in this case shows a clear intent to waive the normal operation of section.
the case law on the topic of remarriage and waivers of section divides itself into two groups of cases first there are cases,like thornton and glasser,which involved boilerplate provisions that merely said spousal support was limited to a designated term and in those cases the requisite specificity was not attained,so the clause did not waive the effect of section or its predecessor that would otherwise terminate spousal support.and second,there are cases like in re marriage of cesnalis th cesnalis,steele langmuir d steele,and in re marriage of sherman d sherman which involved tailored language which would appear on their face to contemplate the possibility of remarriage 
here,arguably even more than in cesnalis,the stipulated judgment particularly as modified in october evidences an intention by richard to waive the termination of support that would normally have occurred on lauralin remarriage.the key fact one not highlighted by richard in his briefing is that under the plain terms of the original march judgment,lauralin october remarriage would have terminated support.period.the new language had the effect of eliminating the clear termination of support about to be triggered by lauralin imminent remarriage.it is hard to avoid the conclusion it reflects an intention to excuse a particular remarriage from any termination of support that might otherwise occur.
the focus on the upcoming october remarriage further disposes of richard argument ad horrendum to the effect that lauralin could keep divorcing and remarrying and richard would still have to keep paying support.at its best,richard argument is premature.we deal only with her october remarriage.as to that,there was a clear intention the remarriage not terminate support.
there is language in thornton which can be read to require there be an express mention of section if the parties wish to make a written agreement to waive the remarriage provision of section,they must at a minimum expressly state that the supported spouse remarriage will not terminate spousal support.thornton,supra,th at.that reading,however,has been convincingly debunked by the cesnalis court as going beyond what section actually requires taken literally,this statement quoted in the footnote above would mean that particular words are required to waive section,and that extrinsic evidence has no relevance in resolving whether a written agreement has waived the section remarriage provision.section does not go so far as to require a written agreement expressly stating that the supported spouse remarriage will not terminate spousal support.cesnalis,supra,th at.
richard argument that the trial court should have taken extrinsic evidence regarding the issue of remarriage was effectively waived at the trial level.the trial judge made it very clear that richard could have put on evidence in regard to his rfo,or his counsel could argue the nuances of the marriage clause,but not both.richard trial counsel chose argument.but even then,the trial court allowed each side to file an additional declaration,a procedure to which richard counsel expressly agreed.as it turned out,richard did not proffer any new facts concerning the surrounding circumstances of the october stipulation.he can not now complain about not having done so.
spousal support reduction 
finally,we reach the issue of those first four lean months in in which richard income was unquestionably lower than the march levels on which his support payments were at least in part predicated.the trial judge rejected that lowering,citing the point that income is only one of many factors under section.
the trial judge understanding of the law bearing on the modification request was spot on.the governing standard on the issue of whether support might or should have been modified is this whether to modify is a matter of broad discretion.in exercising that discretion the court must consider factors set out in section.the court has discretion as to how to weigh each factor.and failure to weigh the factors is an abuse.in re marriage of shimkus th.
