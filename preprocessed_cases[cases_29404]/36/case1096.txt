introduction 
this is one of a number of recent appeals brought by the children law center of los angeles the center or clc,all from orders of the juvenile court disqualifying the center from representing children in dependency proceedings because of purported conflicts of interest the center created separate to as clc unit,clc unit and clc unit provide,in the same proceeding,legal representation to multiple clients who might have conflicts of interest in in re jasmine july,th,d,wl jasmine,we reversed the juvenile court orders disqualifying the center in a case involving the concurrent representation of two clients with potentially adverse interests who were represented by two different units of the center because there was not an actual conflict of interest.
this case involves the concurrent representation by two of the center independent units of five siblings.in the published portion of this opinion,we affirm the juvenile court order disqualifying clc unit from representing four of the siblings because the record contains substantial evidence of an actual conflict among those four siblings.
the center is a publicly funded,nonprofit law office that represents parties in the los angeles county juvenile dependency court when legal services are required under welfare and institutions code section the center formerly was called dependency court legal services.pursuant to two agreements,first with the los angeles county board of supervisors and now with the administrative office of the courts,the center has been structured with three separate units,designated clc units,and,to permit the center to provide legal representation to multiple children in the same dependency proceeding,even if the children have conflicting interests 
this case involves five children collectively children,who lived with their mother mother and nah.nah.the children have three different fathers.joshua and justin,aged seven and four respectively,are the children of joshua,old zamer is the child of zack naes.naes.and nay.nay,aged one and four months respectively,are the children of nah.
on june,the los angeles police department and the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs responded to a report of child abuse at a motel room and found that zamer had suffered a fractured right femur falling in the bathtub.zamer was transported to the hospital.when interviewed,zamer said he was pushed,although he did not say by whom he later told a dcfs social worker that nah.hit him and he went into the tub.nah.stated that he had been giving zamer and justin a bath,and that he had taken justin out of the bath and into another room when zamer fell and injured himself trying to get out of the tub.justin,however,told a dcfs social worker that he was in the bathroom when zamer fell.the physicians who examined zamer opined that his injuries were not consistent with the explanation given by,and stated that zamer also exhibited bruising that did not look new and that had occurred prior to zamer fall.the physicians could not determine,however,whether the injuries were accidental or caused by abuse.
dcfs detained all of the children.on june,dcfs filed a petition pursuant to section with respect to all five children.the petition alleged,in essence,that zamer had been hospitalized due to physical abuse by mother and by,and that all of the children were at risk of severe harm.prior to the detention hearing,dcfs filed an addendum report recommending no reunification services for either mother or nah.the report recounted a social worker interview with justin,in which justin said that his daddy presumably referring to nah.had whopped his brother presumably zamer with a rolled towel because zamer had peed on himself.justin further stated that he,too,had been hit,and that he had seen his father hit his siblings and his mother.
at the detention hearing on june,the juvenile court stated its intention to appoint archana gupta of clc unit to represent all five of the children.gupta responded,this is a detention.i available to take zamer.i believe feldman of clc unit is taking the other children.the juvenile court appointed gupta of clc unit to represent zamer only,and appointed kevin feldman of clc unit to represent joshua,justin,naes.and nay.
of the children three fathers,only nah.attended the detention hearing.he requested and was granted status with respect to naes.and nay.dcfs did not then know the whereabouts of joshua,the father of joshua and justin zamer father,zack,was incarcerated in state prison.mother requested that the children be placed with her sister nah.requested that his children,naes.and,be placed with his mother.feldman requested that all five children be kept together.the juvenile court ordered dcfs to evaluate the homes of mother sister and of nah.mother,and whether it would be possible to keep the children together.
prior to the pretrial resolution conference prc on july,joshua was placed in a foster home justin,naes.and nay.were placed together in another foster home zamer remained hospitalized.dcfs submitted a report setting forth witness statements to substantiate the allegations in the petition.joshua and justin both stated that nah.had struck both of them and zamer.justin also stated,he do sock naes.because she a baby,but he pops her real hard.dcfs recommended that no family reunification services be provided to,but reported that mother could benefit from such services.
at the prc,gupta,zamer clc unit attorney,requested an evaluation of zamer paternal grandmother for potential placement for zamer only.the juvenile court granted gupta request.
dcfs filed an amended petition on august.the amended petition alleged that mother and nah.had physically abused joshua and justin in addition to abusing zamer.there were no allegations that naes.or nay.had been abused.prior to the prc on the amended petition,dcfs reported that,although zamer grandmother was not yet approved for placement,she was willing to care for zamer when he was released from the hospital.joshua foster parent was not willing to accept zamer the foster parent for justin,naes.and nay.was willing to accept joshua,but had not been consulted about accepting zamer.dcfs further reported that it could not make a definitive conclusion regarding the child zamer injuries,but believed it is likely that father nah.cause sic the injuries to this child.
at the prc,the juvenile court ordered dcfs to place zamer either with his siblings or with his paternal grandmother.the juvenile court set a contested hearing on the amended petition for september.
on september,dcfs submitted a packet of information to the juvenile court.among the documents submitted was a report from karen imagawa of children hospital los angeles,stating that zamer had described incidents of physical abuse inflicted on him by a person called.joshua and justin identified as nah.
prior to the september hearing,both joshua and zamer were placed in the same foster home at which their siblings had been placed.joshua,however,was subsequently removed due to behavioral problems and returned to his prior placement.at the september hearing,the juvenile court learned that joshua,the father of joshua and justin had been released from prison but had not received notice of the hearing.the court therefore continued the contested hearing on the petition to november,and ordered that notice be given to joshua.feldman the clc unit attorney for all the children except zamer raised the issue of joshua removal from the foster home,and requested that dcfs continue to seek a placement where all five children could be together.the juvenile court stated,i do know whether or not there a conflict if they like living where they are and they do want to get moved the juvenile court nevertheless ordered dcfs to explore placing all children together and whether be sic in the best interest.the juvenile court did not raise the issue of disqualification,nor did any of the attorneys or parties object to the center continued involvement in the matter.
the matter was called for the contested hearing on november.marc leftwich,the unit head of clc unit,appeared with gupta as for zamer.clc unit attorney,feldman,appeared for the other children.joshua,the father of joshua and justin,had received notice of the hearing and was present.panel attorney katie baca announced that she was seeking appointment on behalf of joshua.the juvenile court told her,you appointed to represent joshua.
although no motion or order to show cause had been made for the center disqualification,feldman began the hearing by stating,i know this court intends to remove us the center as counsel for the minors.i just want to state for the record that clc objects that there any actual or structural conflict and that if,your honor,wants to seek a waiver it is our position that 
the juvenile court interrupted,i do want to seek a waiver it not my business or job to resolve the conflict other than to make sure there is no conflict or whatever conflict exists i found that there was a structural conflict problem feldman requested that the juvenile court appoint a guardian ad litem for the minors to explore the possibility of waiving the structural conflict.the juvenile court denied feldman request,stating that appointing a guardian ad litem costs taxpayers more money my decision was not made,not consider the fiscal consideration,considered just the structure castro los angeles county bd.of supervisors d.and what castro required.italics added.leftwich the head of clc unit stated,we do not believe that there is a conflict,either actual or structural.and we do not believe that a waiver is required in this case or any other case of this nature.the juvenile court announced,your objection is noted.i am going to relieve clc.
after disqualifying clc unit,the juvenile court then asked,is there a conflict between the children,is that the basis for this problem feldman responded that there had been a conflict at the outset of the case between zamer,on the one hand,and his,on the other,because zamer had been injured.counsel for,however,stated her belief that there was a conflict between joshua and justin,on the one hand,and naes.and,on the other is,among the four children represented by clc unit joshua and justin allegedly had been abused by,the father of naes.and,and presumably would testify against nah.feldman,the clc unit attorney,volunteered that he had received confidential information from his two verbal clients presumably,joshua and justin.
the juvenile court reiterated that clc unit was relieved as counsel.leftwich reiterated that unit wanted to remain on the case.the juvenile court stated that it would think about whether clc unit would be disqualified from representing zamer.
the juvenile court then reversed its prior decision to appoint baca to represent joshua.instead,the juvenile court appointed baca to represent all four of the children formerly represented by clc unit,and appointed a new attorney to represent joshua.prior to issuing its minute order,however,the juvenile court reconsidered its decision yet again.the november minute order indicates that the juvenile court disqualified both clc unit and clc unit that baca was appointed to represent joshua and justin only even though baca had been representing joshua,whose interests were adverse to joshua and justin and that another panel attorney was appointed to represent naes.and nay.the center timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee oil see also city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,cal th,d.
b.the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying clc unit 
general principles 
a minor right to appointed counsel in dependency proceedings is guaranteed by section.section,subdivision c provides,in relevant part,that a child in dependency proceedings is entitled to appointed counsel unless the court finds that the child would not benefit from the appointment of counsel a primary responsibility of any counsel appointed to represent a child pursuant to this section shall be to advocate for the protection,safety,and physical and emotional of the child.counsel for the child may be a district attorney,public defender,or other member of the bar,provided that the counsel does not represent another party or county agency whose interests conflict with the child interests.once appointed,c ounsel shall continue to represent the child unless relieved by the court upon the substitution of other counsel or for cause,subd.d.
in in re celine cal th,d,the california supreme court construed the phrase whose interests conflict with the child interests in section,subdivision c to refer to an a of interest.id.at,d.the supreme court recognized that section appear s to differ slightly from the california rules of professional conduct crpc,rule c,governing the concurrent representation of conflicting interests.unlike section,crpc rule c prohibits a lawyer from representing clients with potential conflicts,as well clients with actual conflicts,without the clients informed written consent see in re celine,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court reconciled the two provisions,holding,when first appointing counsel for multiple siblings in a dependency matter,the court may generally appoint a single attorney to represent all the siblings.it would have to appoint separate attorneys if,but only if,there is an actual conflict among the siblings or if circumstances specific to the just the potential for conflict that inheres in all multisibling dependency a reasonable likelihood an actual conflict will arise.if these specific circumstances exist,the court should appoint separate counsel at the outset rather than await an actual conflict and the possible disruption a later reappointment may cause.after the initial appointment,the court will have to relieve counsel from multiple representation if,but only if,an actual conflict arises.id.at,d.
the holding of in re celine,supra,cal th,d,was codified and expanded upon in california rules of court,rule c,effective january,rule c is titled,conflict of interest guidelines for attorneys representing siblings.the rule,insofar as relevant here,provides that t he court may appoint a single attorney to represent a group of siblings involved in the same dependency proceeding.rule c a.the attorney has,however,an ongoing duty to evaluate the interests of each sibling to assess whether there is an actual conflict of interest.rule c a.further,i f the court determines that an actual conflict of interest exists,the court must relieve an attorney from representation of some or all of the siblings.rule c e.it is not necessary,however,for counsel to withdraw after appointment if there is merely a reasonable likelihood that an actual conflict of interest will develop.rule c c,italics added.accordingly,the juvenile court disqualification of the center in this case was proper only if an actual conflict existed between or among two or more of the children.
courts and dependency lawyers applying the standard set forth in rule c and in re celine,supra,cal th,d,confront two problems.the first is determining whether the circumstances in a particular dependency case give rise to a conflict.in civil or criminal cases involving multiple representation,a conflict typically arises when the circumstances of a particular case present a substantial risk that the lawyer representation of the client would be materially and adversely affected by the lawyer duties to another current client rest d of the law governing lawyers,italics added see jasmine,supra,th at,d at see also flatt superior court cal th,fn,d,a lawyer represents conflicting interests when,in behalf of one client,it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.the difficulty faced by counsel representing minors in dependency lawyers representing children who lack the maturity to understand the proceedings or to participate meaningfully in the that the paramount duty of counsel for minors is not zealously to advocate the client objectives,but to advocate for what the lawyer believes to be in the client best interests,even when the lawyer and the client disagree.see,subd.e counsel for the child shall not advocate for the return of the child if,to the best of his or her knowledge,that return conflicts with the protection and safety of the child in re josiah cal th,d,the best interests of the child are paramount in re alexis th,d the role of counsel for the child in dependency proceedings is not merely to act as a mouthpiece for the minor even were there no statutory or decisional precedent,we would find it counsel may not advocate a position he or she has reason to believe might endanger the child in re candida th,d the obligation of counsel for a dependent minor is to pursue whatever is in the minor best interest.this may or may not be what the minor wishes in re richard d.the preference of the minor is not determinative of his or her best interests in re david d.certainly,counsel for the minor must take into consideration the child wishes when determining what the child best interests are.this does not mean that,after independent consultation,reflection and study,counsel for the minor can not urge that the child best interests would be fostered by termination of parental rights,contrary to the stated desires of the child.the role of counsel for the child is not merely to act as a mouthpiece for the minor child.
that counsel paramount duty is to serve the minor best interests,rather than the minor wishes,is reinforced by the fact that appointed counsel for minors routinely serve in a dual role,as both the child legal counsel and the child guardian ad litem under the federal child abuse prevention and treatment act capta et see rule c an attorney appointed under rule will serve as the child capta guardian ad litem los angeles superior court local rules,rule b the court shall appoint counsel for each child who is the subject of any dependency petition who shall also serve in the capacity of a capta guardian ad litem for the child.t he capta guardian ad litem is a fiduciary whose role is to investigate the child circumstances and advocate for her best interests.in re josiah,supra,cal th at,d,see also g capta guardian ad litem to represent and protect the rights and best interests of the child rule d capta guardian ad litem duties are t o obtain firsthand a clear understanding of the situation and needs of the child and t o make recommendations to the court concerning the best interest of the child.
because the primary duty of a dependency lawyer representing minor siblings is to advocate for the minors best interests,it is conceivable that a dependency lawyer would not face a conflict in circumstances that would likely present a conflict in the civil or criminal context.for example,when two minor clients express different preferences regarding visitation,their joint attorney has a duty to consider their wishes and report their preferences to the juvenile court,subd.e,but the attorney has a duty zealously to advocate only the visitation policy that the attorney believes to be in both minors best interests.see in re candida,supra,th at,d.similarly,the fact that termination of parental rights and a permanent plan of adoption might have adverse financial consequences for one of two siblings does not present a conflict for the siblings joint attorney,if adoption is in the best interests of both children.see in re barbara th,d.
courts in other jurisdictions have held that,notwithstanding the conflicting views of the children,there is no conflict between them if their best interests do not conflict.thus,the iowa supreme court held that no conflict arose when a single lawyer a contested court a girl who opposed the termination of her mother parental rights,and her brother who favored termination and who implicated the mother in sexual abuse of the children.in the interest of iowa.t he very reason for contested custody proceedings,the court reasoned,is that the children involved are not yet mature enough to be.it is the best interests of these minor children,not their wishes,which determine the outcome of the case.in other words,their real interests are not inconsistent or mutually exclusive.id.at see also in re georgette,no actual conflict when jointly represented siblings expressed different custody preferences but one sibling decision to remain in foster care was not challenged by father see generally,sobie,the child client representing children in child protection proceedings touro,distinguishing between best interests and child wishes models of legal representation for minors patton,legislative regulation of dependency court attorneys public relations and separation of powers legis,section,subd.e is the first statute in american jurisprudence which forbids attorneys to argue their competent client stated preferences to the court wu,conflicts of interest in the representation of children in dependency cases fordham,attorney duty of loyalty can not be reconciled easily with the best interest model of advocacy and id.at contrasting view that would apply standard conflicts framework to cases of concurrent sibling representation with view that the court ultimate goal of determining the child best interests overrides those ethical mandates.
the second problem that arises in applying rule c and in re celine,supra,cal th,d,is determining when a merely potential conflict ripens into an actual conflict.neither of those authorities,nor the crpc see crpc rule c,attempt to draw the line demarking when potential becomes actual.one authority has opined that an actual conflict is nothing more than a potential conflict that has resulted in a breach of duty.freedman smith,understanding lawyers ethics ed.this is not the meaning of those terms as used in the california ethics rules or rule c.we believe that under rule c,a conflict becomes actual when an attorney duties of loyalty,confidentiality,and zealous advocacy require the attorney to take or to refrain from taking some action to serve the best interests of one minor client,but the attorney is unable to do so without violating a duty owed by the attorney to another client or when the attorney is unable independently to evaluate the best interests of each minor client because of the minors conflicting interests.see hazard hodes,the law of lawyering ed supp.conflicts of interest,terms potential and actual must have reference to the degree of likelihood that the ripen into adverse actuality mallen and smith,legal malpractice ed,an actual conflict exists when an attorney professional judgment for one client necessarily will be affected adversely because of the interests of another client.
rule c b gives guidance regarding the circumstances that constitute an actual conflict by specifying circumstances that,alone,do not give rise to an actual conflict.the following circumstances,standing alone,do not necessarily demonstrate an actual conflict of interest i the siblings are of different ages ii the siblings have different parents iii there is a purely theoretical or abstract conflict of interest among the siblings iv some of the siblings are more likely to be adopted than others v the siblings have different permanent plans vii the siblings express conflicting desires or objectives,but the issues involved are not material to the case or vii the siblings give different or contradictory accounts of the events,but the issues involved are not material to the case.
only one decision published since the january,effective date of rule c has addressed the circumstances that give rise to an actual conflict among multiple siblings in dependency proceedings.in in re barbara,supra,th,d,one attorney was appointed to represent two siblings.one of the siblings was a registered member of an indian tribe,subject to the indian child welfare act et,and entitled to receive significant benefits from the tribe,including a per month stipend in trust,free higher education,and housing on the reservation.id.at,d.the san diego county health and human services agency hsa recommended a permanent plan of adoption for both siblings with the child paternal grandparents.id.at,d.the indian child tribe objected to the adoption,and there was some indication that the indian child would lose her tribal benefits if parental rights were terminated.id.at,d.the juvenile court suggested that the parties provide an offer of proof specifying exactly what the indian child is entitled to.id.at,d.counsel for the children objected and refused to stipulate to such an offer of proof,contending that the existence of financial benefits was not relevant to the issues raised in a permanency hearing under section.ibid.the juvenile court adopted hsa recommendation of adoption and terminated the mother parental rights.ibid.the mother appealed,arguing,inter alia,that the children attorney was subject to a conflict.id.at,d.
the court of appeal held that there was no basis to allege a conflict of interest on the part of the minor counsel because the children did not have adverse interests.in re barbara,supra,th at,d.a conflict arises where minor counsel seeks a course of action for one child with adverse consequences to the other.here,no such conflict existed.ibid.the court reasoned that the grandparents were committed to adopting both children,both children had bonded with the grandparents,and the children would be lost without each other.ibid.a doption would ensure the children would be raised together and the sibling relationship would remain intact.id.at,d.thus,the court concluded,the children interests were not adversarial and minor counsel was not subject to conflict.id.at,d.
several cases predating both rule c and in re celine,supra,cal th,d,addressed actual conflicts in dependency proceedings in in re richard,supra,d,county counsel represented both the los angeles department of children services dcs as it was then called and two minor siblings.id.at.the minors father appealed the juvenile court order declaring the minors dependents of the court id.at,arguing,inter alia,that the juvenile court should have appointed separate counsel for the minors because dcs took a position contrary to the section presumption of family reunification,thereby creating an actual conflict between dcs and the minors id.at.the court of appeal disagreed.appellant provides no authority,the court reasoned,that a dependency petition which does not recommend family reunification automatically creates a conflict of interest on the basis that dcs position is against the presumed position of a minor.id.at.given the purpose of juvenile proceedings to look out for the best interests of the minor,we do not read into section a presumption that family reunification must always be recommended or an implication that the failure to recommend family reunification automatically creates a conflict between dcs and a minor best interests.after all,the preference of the minor is not determinative of his or her best interests.citation.see also in re mary th,d no actual conflict between minor and dcfs requiring appointment of separate counsel on appeal when minor expressed no preference concerning placement,appellate counsel position was that expressed by the minor separate attorney in the trial court,and appellate counsel for dcfs unequivocally indicated there is no conflict of interest.
in re candida,supra,th,d,involved four siblings,all represented by one attorney.id.at,d.the mother appealed the juvenile court orders at the review hearing,arguing,inter alia,that the juvenile court should have appointed separate counsel for each of the minors.the mother claimed that a conflict existed among the minors because some wanted to visit their siblings while others did not.id.at,d.the appellate court held that the minors different preferences relating to sibling visitation did not give rise to an actual conflict of interest requiring the appointment of separate counsel.the court stated,the only evidence presented here is that some of the children wanted visitation and others did not.however,the obligation of counsel for a dependent minor is to pursue whatever is in the minor best interest.this may or may not be what the minor wishes.nothing would preclude counsel from informing the court that one child wants visitation and another does not.it would then be up to the court to determine whether there should be any visitation and,if so,with whom,the frequency and length of visitation.citation.in the absence of any further facts,nothing in this record rises to the level of an actual conflict of interest requiring appointment of independent counsel.id.at,d.
in carroll superior court th,d,the court considered whether the then newly enacted exception to the statutory preference for adoption in section,subdivision c e created an actual conflict among siblings when fewer than all of the siblings were adoptable.in that case,one attorney was appointed to represent seven siblings,all of whom were the subject of section petitions filed by the san diego county health and human services agency hsa.hsa recommended adoption as the permanent plan for three of the siblings.hsa recommended guardianship for three other siblings,who hoped to reunify with their mother.the seventh child was significantly developmentally delayed,and the caretaker who was willing to act as guardian for three of her siblings asked that she be placed elsewhere.id.at,d.three of the children,including two who were to be adopted,expressed their desire to preserve their relationships with their siblings.id.at,d.the attorney sought to withdraw from representing the seven siblings,arguing that the siblings different interests would require her to counsel and advocate both against adoption as a permanent plan to preserve the siblings relationships and for adoption as a permanent plan to serve the best interests of some of her clients.ibid.the juvenile court denied the attorney motion to withdraw.
the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate,directing the juvenile court to grant the attorney motion to withdraw.the court held that an actual conflict of interest arose among at least some members of the client group.carroll superior court,supra,th at,d.t he same attorney could not pursue one sibling interests by opposing a permanent plan of adoption for his sister and simultaneously independently evaluate whether the sister best interests would be served by the stability provided by adoption.ibid.
the california authorities thus support our view of what qualifies as an actual conflict in dependency proceedings,and recognize that the conflicting preferences of minor clients do not necessarily give rise to a disqualifying conflict,for it is the attorney role to make a reasonable,independent determination of the minors best interests,notwithstanding the minors preferences.
evidence supports an actual conflict of interest 
the juvenile court initially disqualified clc unit on the basis of the systemic or structural conflict it perceived to be created by the center administrative reorganization,and stated its intention to appoint one lawyer to represent all four of clc unit former clients.counsel for nah.thereafter raised the issue of a conflict between joshua and justin,on the one hand,and naes.and,on the other hand.by the time the juvenile court issued its minute order,it changed its ruling to disqualify both clc units and,and to appoint separate counsel for joshua and justin,on the one hand,and naes.and,on the other hand.the trial court did not specify the reasons for its altered ruling.
on appeal,we must indulge a ll intendments and presumptions to support the lower court order on matters as to which
