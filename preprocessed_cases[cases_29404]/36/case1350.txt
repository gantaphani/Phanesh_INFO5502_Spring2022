the kern county department of human services department appeals from an order granting reunification services to carrie,claiming such services were not shown to be in her child best interest.we agree and reverse.
procedural and factual history 
ethan was named in a juvenile dependency petition filed september,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and j the petition alleged ethan was at risk of suffering physical harm or illness due to his mother involvement with illegal controlled substances,subd.b it also alleged,pursuant to section,subdivision j,that ethan half siblings,jacob and alexis,had been adjudged dependents of the court in july pursuant to section,subdivisions a,b,g and j that reunification services as to jacob and alexis had been provided but had been terminated in august and permanent legal guardianship had been ordered that a half sibling,justin,had been adjudged a dependent of the court in january pursuant to section,subdivisions a,b,d,f,and j that reunification services as to justin had been denied pursuant to section,subdivision b and,and parental rights as to justin had been terminated.a detentional social study report filed with the petition in the present case further stated that another son,charles,had been murdered by carrie husband,who had been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for the murder.ethan was detained based on the reasons set forth in the petition and the social study report.
an amended petition filed a month later alleged,pursuant to section,subdivision f,that ethan was at risk of suffering serious physical harm or injury from carrie,as her neglect had caused the death of ethan half sibling,charles,who died at one month of age in.the petition alleged charles died as the result of carrie neglect,in that he sustained injuries consisting of an obstruction of the esophagus,a contusion to the lower portion of the head,a contusion to the lower back,a burn on the buttocks,anal penetration,six broken ribs,and evidence of six prior broken ribs.
following a contested jurisdictional hearing,ethan was found to be a person described by section,subdivisions b,f and j in anticipation of the contested dispositional hearing,the social worker filed a social study and two supplemental reports chronicling the extensive services carrie had received for jacob,alexis,and justin,as well as numerous referrals received for abuse and neglect of those three children.the report also detailed the events of charles death.
specifically,the report stated jacob was born in with a positive toxicology screen for methamphetamine.following an investigation by the social worker,it was determined the home,which included jacob father,paul,was appropriate and the case was closed.
a half year later,in,a law enforcement referral was made alleging carrie and paul were unable to provide for jacob.an investigation revealed carrie and paul had recently used methamphetamine,and there were bruises on jacob forehead.jacob was taken into protective custody and adjudged a dependent child.reunification services were ordered.
in october,a referral was made alleging carrie was incapable of caring for jacob newborn sister,alexis.carrie admitted using drugs the day before alexis birth.carrie separated from paul for a short period,reportedly due to spousal abuse,but returned to the relationship.following reunification services,carrie regained custody of jacob and alexis in september.
a number of referrals were made in and early alleging various injuries to jacob and alexis,but the allegations were not found to be substantiated.a referral in april alleged carrie failed to protect jacob and alexis from physical abuse by christopher,carrie boyfriend,and that carrie failed to provide her children with medical care.as a result,the children again were adjudged dependents of the court and reunification services again were ordered,including counseling for substance abuse,child neglect,and parent training.carrie and christopher also were ordered to submit to random drug tests.carrie made only minimal progress with the case plan reunification services were terminated in august legal guardianship was ordered for both jacob and alexis.
in june,carrie delivered justin,whose father was christopher.a petition was filed on justin behalf,because carrie was incarcerated at the time and his half siblings were dependents of the juvenile court.the child was placed with christopher,but was later returned to both carrie and christopher after carrie completed reunification services.
in january of,a referral alleged severe neglect of another child,charles,whose father was christopher.at the age of days,charles was brought to the hospital by carrie and christopher with a golf wad of paper lodged deep in his esophagus.the child died as a result of cerebral hypoxia.at the time of his death,charles also had severe injuries to his rectum and anus,broken ribs in various stages of healing,injuries to his face,a torn frenulum,and a contusion to the back of the head.examining experts determined that charles had suffered repeated and extensive abuse.
during the investigation following charles death,carrie denied knowing how charles died.she had noticed a rash on the baby bottom,but had not taken him to the doctor because christopher told her the baby would be taken into protective custody.
as a result of charles death,justin was taken into protective custody and was found to be a dependent of the juvenile court.family reunification services were not provided because carrie had failed to unify with jacob and alexis,and because she had caused the death of charles through abuse or neglect.parental rights as to justin were terminated in february.
in the current action,the social worker recommended that carrie not be offered reunification services based on her failure to reunite with jacob,alexis,and justin,subd.b,and because carrie caused the death of charles through abuse or neglect,subd.b.
at the contested dispositional hearing,the social worker,cathy tessandori,testified that the initial plan established at the time of detention consisted of p arenting,child neglect,failure to protect,substance abuse counseling,and submitting to unannounced drug testing on a monthly basis.supervised visits were scheduled for one hour per week.tessandori testified that carrie had completed a parenting class.she was enrolled in a class addressing issues of parent training,child neglect and failure to protect,and had completed of the sessions at the time of the hearing.carrie had completed the substance abuse residential treatment program.she had provided eight drug tests since ethan had been detained,and all had been clean.
tessandori testified that carrie attended all visitations with ethan,except one,which she missed because of a dental appointment.tessandori supervised the visits and found carrie behavior toward ethan to be appropriate and their interaction normal.according to tessandori,all of the certificates and information she received from various agencies and programs showed carrie had made positive progress in each.according to tessandori,she demonstrating steady progress in her case plan.
carrie testified and acknowledged that her two oldest children had been removed from her as a result of her substance abuse and physical abuse by christopher.she explained that she had gone through reunification services,but had been unable to overcome her substance abuse problems at that time.she also acknowledged that her child justin,whose father was christopher,had been removed from her due to her substance abuse,the earlier dependency proceedings,and eventually due to charles death.carrie testified that her son charles was killed by his father christopher,and that she was not charged with any crime in connection with charles death.at the time justin was removed from carrie,she participated in additional substance abuse counseling,but did not complete the program because there was no possibility of reunification with justin.according to carrie,i gave up.i quit because i was getting anything so it would have been for nothing.
after charles death,carrie was convicted of possession of methamphetamine for sale and spent time in jail.following that conviction,carrie entered a substance abuse program,which she completed,and then entered an outpatient program as well as attending narcotics anonymous meetings.
carrie acknowledged that the court previously had found she had failed to protect her children from christopher.she also acknowledged that the court in justin case found either her active participation or neglect caused the death of charles.she testified that she thought she had made a lot of progress in the area of protecting her children from the conduct of others,but still had a little ways to go with it.she also opined that her previous attempts at drug treatment had not been successful because she had not accepted that she could never use drugs again.her current attempt was successful because she no longer had such reservations.she testified that she was enjoying her recovery and taking it very seriously,but also acknowledged that recovery was a lifetime process.
on,carrie acknowledged that her enrollment in the drug treatment programs were conditions of her probation.when asked if she accepted any responsibility for the death of charles,and if so,what,carrie stated,i do know.carrie was asked why she thought it would be in ethan best interest that she be provided reunification services,and she stated,because i his mother and i know people love him,but i can provide for him.i just need a chance to show everybody that i can.carrie stated she did not participate in any way,shape or form in causing the death of charles.
on redirect examination,carrie testified that her role in charles death was a failure to protect him but claimed the first time she was aware of any injuries to him was on the morning she took him to the hospital.
both the department and counsel for the minor asked that the court not provide carrie with reunification services.counsel for the minor cited carrie history of substance abuse,her failure to protect her children from abuse,and her failure to take responsibility for the death of charles.counsel for the department submitted on the points and authorities which requested that carrie not be provided reunification services.
the court ruled 
i do feel that carrie has made significant progress towards alleviating or mitigating the causes of the children placement in care,and i am inclined to and i would find by clear and convincing evidence that it would be in the best interest of the child that reunification services be offered,although by my calculation,unless there is some extension of time,that period would run rather quickly i would indicate as it relates to subsection of,that the parent has not able to make a finding that the parent has not made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to the removal of the sibling or and that child from a parent or guardian.
counsel for the department reminded the court that section,subdivision c states that the court may not order reunification services where the parent has been found to have caused the death of a sibling through abuse or neglect unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that reunification is in the best interest of the child.the court replied,which i did.so reunification services are to be provided to the mother 
discussion 
the trial court erred in granting reunification services 
the department contends the juvenile court order of reunification services to carrie was not supported by the evidence and constitutes an abuse of discretion.we agree.
section,subdivision a explicitly directs the juvenile court to order child welfare services for the child and the child parents whenever a child is removed from a parent custody.this requirement implements the law strong preference for maintaining the family relationship if at all possible.citation.in re baby boy th,d.limited exceptions to this rule are listed in section,subdivision b hereafter subdivision b.specifically,subparts,and of subdivision b provide,in pertinent part 
b reunification services need not be provided to a parent described in this subdivision when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,any of the following 
that the parent or guardian of the child has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect.
that the court ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings of the child because the parent failed to reunify with the sibling after the sibling had been removed from that parent and that parent has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling of that child from that parent 
that the parental rights of a parent over any sibling of the child had been permanently severed,and this parent has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling of that child from the parent.
once the juvenile court finds that one or more of these subparts of subdivision b applies,the court is prohibited from ordering reunification services unless the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interest of the child,subd.c.
here,the court appears to have determined that carrie was not a person described in subdivision b or of section.those two exceptions require a analysis.there is no dispute that the first prong is met as to each subpart the statute applies to carrie to the extent she failed to reunify with jacob and alexis,and parental rights were severed as to justin.the issue at the hearing was whether the second prong of subparts and of subdivision b kept carrie within the confines of those provisions.the court found it did not,as carrie had made reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of ethan siblings,subd.b.the department does not challenge this determination but,instead,argues the juvenile court abused its discretion when it found reunification would be in ethan best interest despite the fact that carrie was a person described in subdivision b.
when sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding is challenged on appeal,the appellate court determines if there is any substantial evidence to support the finding.in re jasmine th,d.moreover,the court can not reverse the juvenile court determination,reflected in the dispositional order,of what would best serve the child interest,absent an abuse of discretion.in re christopher th,d.in this case we conclude that the juvenile court finding that reunification services would be in ethan best interest is not supported by substantial evidence,and that the court did abuse its discretion in ordering those services be provided.
it has often been noted that f amily preservation,with the attendant reunification plan and reunification services,is the first priority when child dependency proceedings are commenced.in re elizabeth th,d.however,as we noted in in re baby boy,supra,th at page,d,once it is determined one of the situations outlined in subdivision b applies,the general rule favoring reunification is replaced by a legislative assumption that offering services would be an unwise use of governmental resources.citation.subdivision b of section evidences the legislature recognition that some situations are so extreme as to require extraordinary caution in recognizing and giving weight to the usually desirable objective of family preservation.as noted in in re alexis th,d,when child abuse results in the death of a child,such abuse is simply too shocking to ignore in determining whether the offending parent should be offered services aimed at reunification with a surviving child.the fact of a death and a subsequent petition arising out of that death simply obliterates almost any possibility of reunification id.at,fn,d.
the legislature has,nevertheless,left open a tiny crack to the parent who has been responsible for the death of his or her child.in re alexis,supra,th at,fn,d.subdivision b of section can be overcome by a showing,made with clear and convincing evidence,that reunification would be in a surviving child best interest,subd.c.
the lower court conclusion here that reunification would be in ethan best interest evidently wa
