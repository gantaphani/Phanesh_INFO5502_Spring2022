introduction 
michelle shaughnessy michelle appeals from a postjudgment order entered on april,modifying a judgment that required her former husband,greg shaughnessy greg,to pay her spousal support.michelle and greg were married for years and had no children.at the time they separated in march,michelle was years old.by,greg had been paying michelle spousal support for nearly years,supplementing her income as a florist.in the order modifying the judgment,the trial court ordered that the amount of spousal support be reduced from per month to per month beginning january,and that support terminate on june,unless michelle demonstrates a compelling reason to extend the period of support.
on appeal,michelle claims the trial court abused its discretion in ordering that spousal support be reduced and then terminated.specifically,michelle contends that there has been no material change in circumstances since the issuance of the prior spousal support award that would justify a change in the support order,and that the evidence did not support the court finding that michelle would be sufficiently by the dates the court set for the reduction and termination of support.michelle also claims that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering her support reduced and then terminated without first providing her with adequate warning of the court expectation that she become.
we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the prior spousal support award,based on the following changed circumstances michelle failed to diligently seek to become,as required by the terms of the prior spousal support award michelle was currently receiving per year from her parents and the trial court could now determine that michelle benign tumor would not affect her ability to become.we also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that michelle would be sufficiently by the dates the court set for the reduction and termination of support.finally,we conclude that the court provided michelle with adequate notice of her obligation to attempt to become.accordingly,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
greg and michelle married in november and separated in march.they had no children together.in august,greg filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage.in february,michelle filed an amended request for dissolution of the marriage in which she requested that greg pay her spousal support.
in february,the court held a hearing regarding michelle request for spousal support,among other issues.by that time,greg had been paying support for nearly eight years.in march,the court entered a judgment dissolving the parties marital status as of december,and reserving jurisdiction over other issues,including spousal support.on april,the court entered a partial judgment on the reserved issues.
in its april judgment,with respect to spousal support,the court stated 
the court finds that as of the date of separation the parties enjoyed an upper middle class lifestyle as evidenced by the fact that the parties traveled frequently and they owned two pieces of property.
the court finds that michelle earning capacity is not sufficient to meet her needs for the following reasons 
michelle does not possess marketable employment skills for the current job market.michelle has a journalism degree,however,she has been a florist during most of the marriage.michelle needs to be retrained and obtain computer skills.
greg earns a high wage and has the ability to pay a reasonable spousal support award.
based on michelle needs as established during the marriage michelle income and earning capacity are insufficient to meet her needs.michelle expenses are high as currently presented but even if the amount was reduced to a reasonable amount,michelle still needs spousal support.
michelle has significant separate property assets that produce income for the benefit of michelle.the rate of return on michelle investments is not enough to sustain her life expectancy since michelle is still a young woman.
e.the marriage was of long duration,lasting more than fifteen years.the support order is presumed to be open ended in marriages of long duration.
on the issue of health,the court finds there was significant evidence of michelle depression,however,this factor will not interfere with michelle ability to obtain employment.michelle is being treated for a benign tumor with medication.the court is unable to determine the effect of that medical condition on michelle in the future and on the issue of ongoing health insurance for michelle.greg appears to be in good health.
g.the court finds the evidence regarding the issue of domestic violence by michelle against greg to be situational.there was no documentation at the time of the alleged domestic violence.
h.there are no other tax consequences to the parties except those related to the sale of the parties rental property.the tax consequences are considered by the court in determining the spousal support award.
i.the balance of hardships weigh in favor of michelle.
j.the requirement that parties should be after the length of the marriage does not apply to a marriage of long duration.michelle began to realize one year ago she needs marketable skills and needs to look at retraining options.
greg will pay per month in spousal support to michelle effective january.greg will receive credit for any amount of support he paid to michelle in the months of january and february.
the court retains jurisdiction on the matter of spousal support.
in may,greg filed an application for an order to show cause osc seeking to require that michelle submit to a vocational examination and an independent medical examination.in a companion declaration filed with his application,greg requested that the court terminate spousal support,or in the alternative,modify the prior spousal support award.as a second alternative,greg requested that the court issue a jurisdictional order pertaining to spousal support.in july,the court ordered that michelle submit to a vocational examination and an independent medical examination,based on a stipulation between the parties.during december,michelle underwent the vocational and medical examinations.
in february,after the parties filed briefs with accompanying declarations,and lodged exhibits,the court held a hearing regarding greg request to terminate or modify spousal support.on april,the court entered an order that provided that the amount of spousal support would be reduced to per month beginning january.the court also ordered that spousal support terminate on june,unless michelle is able to demonstrate a compelling reason to extend the period of support.
the trial court april order states in relevant part 
the parties were married for years.
greg has been paying spousal support to michelle for almost years.
michelle was forewarned by the trial judge that she should be looking at seven years to begin to be.
michelle does have a benign tumor,but that does not affect her ability to become it only affects her higher health care premiums.
michelle is still relatively young at years of age.
michelle now has separate property investments in the amount of.
michelle has continued in her floral business despite the fact that she now claims she nets only around per month from the business.michelle should have been aware that if the above is true,the floral business is not the means for her continued long term economic well being.on the other hand,michelle stated to the vocational expert that she netted per month from the business.
michelle states she is gifted per year from her parents.
the court has considered the family law section factors and finds there has been a change in circumstances that warrants modification of spousal support.
greg shall continue to pay michelle spousal support in the amount of per month through december.
commencing january,spousal support shall be reduced to per month.
spousal support shall terminate on june,unless michelle can demonstrate in a motion filed prior to june,a compelling reason to extend the time period.

each party shall pay respective attorney fees in that each has sufficient liquid property assets.
michelle timely appeals.
discussionthe court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the april spousal support award 
michelle claims the trial court abused its discretion in modifying the april spousal support award.
standard of review 
in in re marriage of schmir th,d,the court noted that a trial court order modifying a spousal support award is reviewed for an abuse of discretion 
the modification of a spousal support order is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.in exercising its discretion the trial court must follow established legal principles and base its findings on substantial evidence.citation.if the trial court conforms to these requirements its order will be upheld whether or not the appellate court agrees with it or would make the same order if it were a trial court.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that changed circumstances warranted modifying the april spousal support award 
michelle claims the trial court abused its discretion in determining that changed circumstances supported modifying the april spousal support award.
the law governing a trial court exercise of its discretion to modify a spousal support order 
in exercising discretion whether to modify a spousal support order,the court considers the same criteria set forth in family code section as it considered when making the initial order citation.in re marriage of bower th,d.family code section provides 
in ordering spousal support under this part,the court shall consider all of the following circumstances 
a the extent to which the earning capacity of each party is sufficient to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage,taking into account all of the following 
the marketable skills of the supported party the job market for those skills the time and expenses required for the supported party to acquire the appropriate education or training to develop those skills and the possible need for retraining or education to acquire other,more marketable skills or employment.
the extent to which the supported party present or future earning capacity is impaired by periods of unemployment that were incurred during the marriage to permit the supported party to devote time to domestic duties.
b the extent to which the supported party contributed to the attainment of an education,training,a career position,or a license by the supporting party.
c the ability of the supporting party to pay spousal support,taking into account the supporting party earning capacity,earned and unearned income,assets,and standard of living.
d the needs of each party based on the standard of living established during the marriage.
e the obligations and assets,including the separate property,of each party.
f the duration of the marriage.
g the ability of the supported party to engage in gainful employment without unduly interfering with the interests of dependent children in the custody of the party.
h the age and health of the parties.
i documented evidence of any history of domestic violence,as defined in section,between the parties,including,but not limited to,consideration of emotional distress resulting from domestic violence perpetrated against the supported party by the supporting party,and consideration of any history of violence against the supporting party by the supported party.
j the immediate and specific tax consequences to each party.
k the balance of the hardships to each party.
l the goal that the supported party shall be within a reasonable period of time.except in the case of a marriage of long duration as described in section,a reasonable period of time for purposes of this section generally shall be the length of the marriage.however,nothing in this section is intended to limit the court discretion to order support for a greater or lesser length of time,based on any of the other factors listed in this section,section,and the circumstances of the parties.
m the criminal conviction of an abusive spouse shall be considered in making a reduction or elimination of a spousal support award in accordance with section.
n any other factors the court determines are just and equitable.
modification of spousal support requires a material change of circumstances since the last order.citations.in re marriage of bower,supra,th at,d.however,t he standard rule that modifications in support orders may only be granted if there has been a material change of circumstances since the last order citation was not designed to circumvent the goal that supported spouses become within a reasonable period of time.citation.in re marriage of schaffer th,d.
change of circumstances 
the trial court april order contained several findings relevant to whether changed circumstances warranted modification of the april award.
michelle failure to diligently seek to become constitutes a change in circumstances justifying a modification of the spousal support award 
michelle contends that she diligently sought to become through employment.
i applicable law 
section,subdivision a requires that in awarding spousal support,the court consider the extent to which the supported party possesses,or may come to possess,marketable employment skills sufficient to achieve the marital standard of living.section,subdivision l directs that the court also consider t he goal that the supported party shall be within a reasonable period of time.
a trial court acts within its discretion in denying spousal support where the supported spouse has failed to diligently seek employment sufficient to become.in re marriage of sheridan d.trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to continue spousal support after five years following a marriage,where supported spouse had done little to prepare herself for or to seek gainful employment in re marriage of rosan d.when evidence exists that the party to be supported has unreasonably delayed or refused to seek employment consistent with her or his ability that factor may be taken into consideration by the trial court in fixing the amount of support in the first instance or in modification proceedings.whether there has been such unreasonable delay is a question addressed peculiarly to the trial court which heard the party testimony and observed the party demeanor at trial.in re marriage of sheridan,supra,d at.there is no requirement that the failure to exercise diligence in seeking gainful employment has been in bad faith.ibid.
in in re marriage of schaffer,supra,th at page,d,in affirming the trial court refusal to continue spousal support after years of support,following a marriage,the schaffer court observed that the supporting spouse had been forced to pay for the supported spouse unwillingness to consider more suitable employment for a period of years.the schaffer court explained that a supported spouse can not make unwise decisions which have the effect of preventing him or her from becoming and expect the supporting spouse to pick up the tab.ibid.
further,a material change of circumstances warranting a modification of spousal support may stem from unrealized expectations embodied in the previous order.in re marriage of lautsbaugh th,d.specifically,changed expectations pertaining to the ability of a supported spouse to become may constitute a change of circumstances warranting a modification of spousal support.in re marriage of beust th,d.thus,if a court initial spousal support award contemplates that a supported spouse will take some action to decrease the need for spousal support following the issuance of the order and the supported spouse fails to take that action,the court may modify the award on the ground of changed circumstances.
ii factual background 
in its initial spousal support award,the trial court found that michelle did not possess marketable employment skills for the current job market.the court further found that michelle was a florist and that she would have to be retrained in order to find more lucrative employment.the court noted that michelle had begun to realize,a year earlier,that she would have to obtain marketable employment skills and consider employment retraining options.
what michelle income was,both at the time of the initial support award in,and in,when the trial court modified the award,is not entirely clear.in a february income and expense declaration,michelle stated that she earned an average of per month per year in net business income from her floral business.however,she submitted a profit and loss statement for her business that indicated that she had earned a total net profit for calendar year of only per month.the difference between the two net income figures appears to be attributable to the fact that the figure in the income and expense declaration was not a true net income figure because it did not include deductions for the expenses incurred in running the business,such as the cost of flowers and advertising.
in her february income and expense declaration,michelle stated that she had earned an average of per month in net income over the previous months per year from as a florist.michelle also filed a federal income tax profit statement for her floral business in which she reported gross receipts of and,after deducting for the costs of goods sold,gross income of.michelle profit statement indicated that she had net income of,after deducting from her gross income in car and truck expenses and for the business use of her home,among other items.in a vocational evaluation dated january,evaluator kathleen young stated that michelle had said that she nets approximately per year,from.
in a july,rebuttal declaration submitted in support of her order to show cause to increase spousal support,michelle stated to further increase my skills,next month i begin a computer instruction course designed toward developing an internet business.i am hoping that this venture may ultimately replace my floral income altogether.vocational evaluator young stated that michelle had informed her that her goal is to continue with her floral arranging business,and that she has considered starting some type of business,but currently,does not have any specific plan of action.young also stated that michelle had informed her that she is very confident she will continue earning a stable income,in her floral design business.young opined that michelle current earnings of per year is her maximum current wage earning capacity.with respect to future earning capacity,young stated that with retraining to become a graphic designer,which would take approximately two to three semesters to complete,michelle earnings would most likely start out close to per year,and increase with time on the job.
in its april order modifying spousal support,the trial court noted that michelle had continued in the floral business despite claiming to net only approximately per month.
iii michelle failed to diligently seek to become,as required by the terms of the prior spousal support award 
the trial court initial spousal support award was premised,in part,on the court stated expectation that michelle would obtain retraining in order to increase her income and become.however,by april,the evidence presented to the trial court indicated that michelle had done little,if anything,to obtain retraining to increase her income,and that she had not otherwise been diligent in attempting to become.
we conclude that michelle failure to diligently pursue retraining in order to attempt to become constituted a change in circumstances justifying a modification of the spousal support order.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the fact that michelle parents gave her monetary gifts in the amount of per year 
michelle contends that a trial court may not consider monetary gifts to a supported spouse in considering whether to modify a spousal support award.
in april,the trial court made no findings pertaining to any monetary gifts to michelle.in,the trial court found that michelle parents gave her per year 
there is no provision in the family code that expressly addresses whether a trial court may consider monetary gifts in awarding spousal support however,section,subdivision n,directs trial courts to consider any other factors the court determines are just and equitable in awarding spousal support.
in in re marriage of smith d,the court explained that equitable considerations are paramount in fashioning spousal support awards 
some members of the bench and bar have been critical of the legislature,contending it has failed to specify the purpose of spousal support.this criticism is unjustified and demonstrates a lack of understanding about why the legislature and appellate decisions have vested trial courts with such broad discretion to decide this issue,whether at trial or upon a later request for modification or termination.the purposes of spousal support inevitably vary from case to case,depending upon the parties and the facts and circumstances of the case.
in other words,the purpose of spousal support can not be defined by the legislature it is a determination to be made by the trial court in each case before it,based upon the facts and equities of that case,weighing each of the circumstances or guidelines specified by the legislature in former section,subdivision a current section,which are applicable to that case,as well as those specified by appropriate appellate case law.in making its order on the issue of spousal support,it is essential that the trial court possess broad discretion in order to fairly exercise the weighing process contemplated by former section,subdivision a,with the goal of accomplishing substantial justice for the parties in the case before the court.the issue of spousal support,including its purpose,is one which is truly personal to the parties.
equitable considerations are the most significant factor in these cases.the legislature and the appellate courts specify guidelines which must be considered by trial courts in deciding spousal support issues,but in the final analysis trial courts must possess broad discretion to decide the applicability and weight of these guidelines as they apply to the facts and equities of each case.
the express provision in section,subdivision n that a trial court is to consider any factors the court determines are just and equitable in awarding spousal support,the underlying purpose of california spousal support statutes as outlined by the smith court,and the absence of a specific provision on the issue,all support the conclusion that there is no per se rule precluding a trial court considering monetary gifts a supported spouse may receive,in determining spousal support.
the parties have not cited,and our independent research has not uncovered,any california case that specifically addresses whether a trial court may consider monetary gifts to a supported spouse in determining spousal support.michelle relies on in re marriage of mcquoid th,d mcquoid for the proposition that t he court should not expect michelle parents to supplement her monthly living expenses as a replacement for spousal support.in mcquoid,the court addressed whether the trial court erred in determining the supported spouse needs for purposes of awarding spousal support when,in setting the amount of spousal support,it considered expenses that the supported spouse did not actually incur 
husband argues that wife nursing income is adequate to meet basic living costs.he maintains that her expense claim is inflated because it includes desirable costs as well as necessary ones.he apparently refers to the fact that wife expense declaration estimated rent payments of a month,although she was admittedly paying far less because she and her daughters were living in the home of wife mother who was also providing free child care.husband argument apparently is since his is subsidizing his wife and children living expenses he has no support obligation for the value of that subsidy.he misconstrues the law.
in awarding spousal support the court is obliged to consider a number of factors including t he needs of each party based on the standard of living established during the marriage.former current,subd.d.reasonable rent and child care costs were appropriately considered in determining wife monthly expenses.id.at.
the mcquoid court did not address the issue presented in this case,namely,whether a trial court is precluded from considering monetary gifts to the supported spouse in awarding spousal support.rather,the mcquoid court held that the trial court had not abused it discretion in considering certain expenses that the supported spouse had not actually incurred in determining one of the statutory factors,subd.d a trial court must consider in awarding spousal support.the mcquoid court did not address whether a trial court could properly consider the value of the in kind contributions pursuant to section,subdivision n requirement that a court consider a ny other factors the court determines are just and equitable.
in in re marriage of loh th,d loh,the court determined that a trial court could consider in kind contributions in setting child support pursuant to section,subdivision b,which authorizes a trial court to award an amount of child support other than that calculated by use of the guideline formula provided in section when a pplication of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate due to special circumstances in the particular case,subd.b see loh,supra,th at,d.both section,subdivision b and section,subdivision n are provisions that clarify the court authority to consider special circumstances in a particular case in determining child support,subd.b and spousal support,subd.n.hogoboom and king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group hereafter hogoboom and king,subd.b is a provision,subd.n is a provision.
there is more reason to conclude that a trial court may consider gifts in setting spousal support than in setting child support,because the purpose of spousal support varies on a case by case basis while t he overriding policy behind the child support statutes is to assure that children share in their parents standard of living and have adequate support.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.unlike child support,which courts generally calculate in accordance with the mathematical formula set forth in the mandatory guidelines id.at,d,in awarding spousal support,a trial court has broad discretion in weighing numerous statutory factors.id.at,d.if a trial court has the authority to consider gifts made to a spouse in determining child support,it follows that a trial court may consider gifts when exercising its broader discretion in fashioning an award of spousal support 
in holding that a trial court may exercise its discretion to consider third party gifts to a supported spouse in determining a spousal support award,we emphasize that we do not hold that the trial court must mechanically decrease a supported spouse award by the amount of any gifts received,or even that the trial court should in every case consider such gifts in determining the appropriate level of support.rather,we hold only that it is within the trial court broad discretion to consider evidence of monetary gifts as one factor,together with evidence pertaining to all of the other section factors,in determining the appropriate spousal support award 
c.the court determined that michelle benign tumor would not affect her ability to become 
new information concerning michelle health constituted a change of circumstances supporting the court modification of the spousal support award.
section,subdivision h provides that the court must consider the health of the parties in ordering spousal support.see,in re marriage of brantner d.concluding trial court abused its discretion in reducing spousal support in view of,among other factors,the possibility the former spouse might become blind in the near future.
in its original judgment,the trial court noted that michelle earning capacity was not sufficient to meet her needs because,among other reasons,the court was unable to determine the effect her health might have on her in the future.at the hearing on which the initial support order was based,the court stated 
as far as the age and health of the parties as far as michelle,there was significant evidence submitted that she has depression,which the court does not feel is going to interfere with her ability to gain employment.however,she does also have a benign tumor,which requires her to maintain medication.and that is health is an unknown factor,therefore,and as far as the effect it will have on her in the future and also the effect it will have on her ability to obtain health insurance to be insured.
in the april order modifying the original support order,the trial court concluded that michelle benign tumor did not affect her ability to become.this finding was supported by the findings of jeffrey sandler,who performed the independent medical examination of michelle.in a letter dated december,sandler stated that michelle was able to work on a full time basis and that she had no current work restrictions.sandler did not anticipate that there would be any change in michelle physical condition in the future that would affect her ability to work.
thus,while in,the court was unable to determine the effect the tumor would have on michelle ability to work,by april,the court had sufficient information to determine that michelle tumor would not affect her ability to become.the trial court april finding concerning michelle health constituted a change of circumstances supporting the court modification of spousal support.compare hogoboom and king,supra,at,it may be error to set a fixed termination date where the supported party has unresolved medical or psychiatric problems requiring further treatment.
in view of the changed circumstances,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the section factors 
in weighing the section factors in light of the changed circumstances,the trial court could have reasonably concluded that a modification of the prior spousal support award was warranted.by the time of the hearing on greg osc,greg had been paying spousal support for nearly years.michelle was still relatively young at years of age,was working and continued to be employable,and was receiving per year from her parents.she had failed to diligently seek to obtain retraining or to otherwise become,as required by the terms of the prior spousal support award.in addition,michelle owned investments valued at.michelle notes that since the time of the initial support order,her yearly health care expenses had increased by approximately and greg yearly earnings had increased by approximately.however,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider these facts.rather,the court considered this information together with all of the other section factors in modifying the april spousal support award.this was not an abuse of discretion.
c.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that michelle would be sufficiently by the dates the court set for the reduction and termination of support 
michelle claims the trial court abused its discretion in finding that she would be sufficiently by the dates the court set for the reduction and termination of support.
applicable law 
in in re marriage of morrison cal d,morrison,the california supreme court held that courts should be reticent about terminating support in lengthy marriages 
a trial court should not terminate jurisdiction to extend a future support order after a lengthy marriage,unless the record clearly indicates that the supported spouse will be able to adequately meet his or her financial needs at the time selected for termination of jurisdiction.in making its decision concerning the retention of jurisdiction,the court must rely only on the evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.it must not engage in speculation.if the record does not contain evidence of the supported spouse ability to meet his or her future needs,the court should not burn its bridges and fail to retain jurisdiction.citation.
however,the morrison court emphasized that this standard does not require that a trial court retain jurisdiction in every case involving a lengthy marriage,particularly where the supported spouse is employed 
these standards w
