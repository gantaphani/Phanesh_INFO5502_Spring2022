in this juvenile dependency proceeding,we conclude the sustained allegations of the petition are insufficient to establish juvenile court jurisdiction.accordingly,we reverse the court jurisdiction and disposition orders and remand the matter to the juvenile court.
facts and proceedings below 
appellant tricia is the mother of six children.two of mother children are adults and live independently from mother.four of mother children are minors.when detained,janet was years old,donald was years old,dorothy was four years old,and tercel was then two years old.donald,who lives in the state of washington,is janet and donald father.tercel,who lives in san diego,is dorothy and tercel father.
in early june mother moved with the children from san diego to pasadena to be near her adult son and his family.on june,mother and her four minor children took up residence at the union station shelter in pasadena.a week later the shelter made a referral to the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs regarding mother and her children.the shelter referral alleged mother was neglecting her children by not watching them and failing to meet their medical needs.the two youngest children,tercel and dorothy had head lice and donald,appeared to be very depressed.the two older children,janet and donald,informed the shelter counselor they had not attended school for several months.
a social worker interviewed mother shortly thereafter.mother stated she and the children had been in numerous shelters since october when she was evicted from her apartment in san diego.in march mother and the children moved in with an acquaintance.she left the residence when she discovered her daughter dorothy had been molested by the acquaintance two young sons.mother also informed the social worker san diego children services had removed tercel for failure to thrive.he was returned to mother care four months later in april.
the dcfs offered mother family preservation and voluntary family maintenance services.mother appeared interested in receiving those services.however,she and her children left the union station shelter without informing the dcfs of her new location.
the dcfs in the meantime received information concerning mother history with san diego children services.a psychiatric evaluation report dated february,indicated mother suffered from schizoaffective disorder,bipolar type.according to this report,mother had been rescued in her efforts to take care of her children by the intervention of social services.the evaluator considered mother situation quite precarious in terms of uncertainty about her decision making and ability to consistently attend to the responsibility of caring for her children.the doctor suggested mother take medications to stabilize her moods and behavior.
between march and may,there were six referrals to san diego children services regarding mother and her children,involving the allegation dorothy had been molested an allegation by burger king employees they saw mother holding her two youngest children off the ground by their hair a shelter allegation of severe neglect because dorothy fell out of her stroller and suffered a skull fracture an allegation the children rarely attended school and an allegation of inappropriate discipline.after investigation,san diego children services closed each case finding each referral either inconclusive or unfounded.
nevertheless,san diego children services reported mother displayed a distinct lack of parenting skills.she appears to believe that everyone is out to get her and that nothing is her fault for example,mother insisted the children attended school regularly,despite documentary evidence to the contrary.in the san diego caseworker opinion,the children were dirty,uncared for,and without a change of clothes.despite her situation the worker reported mother was uncooperative and refused all offers of assistance.the san diego worker concluded her report with the suggestion all referrals on this family should be given a high priority as this family is at extremely high risk.
shortly thereafter,mother and the children moved to pasadena.
on june,the dcfs took the children into protective custody when mother called the dcfs to say mother and her children were at her residence but she was unable to care for them.mother told the dcfs mother had made no plans for the children care and had no resources to do so.mother adult son stated he loved his mother but was concerned for his siblings.he told the worker the children needed a permanent home so they could attend school and have a stable life.
the dcfs placed the children in foster care.a few days later the dcfs filed a welfare and institutions code section petition which,as amended,alleged mother had failed to ensure janet and donald school attendance this failure created a risk of physical and emotional harm for siblings dorothy and tercel and mother demonstrated numerous mental and emotional problems which endangered the children physical and emotional health 
at the detention hearing on july,mother entered a general denial to the allegations of the petition.the juvenile court found a prima facie case under section,subdivisions b,g and j for detaining the children.the court ordered monitored visits for mother,but gave the dcfs discretion to liberalize her visits.the court also gave the dcfs discretion to release the minors to an appropriate relative and directed the dcfs to explore the possibility of enrolling janet and donald in summer school.
the two oldest children provided statements for the report prepared for the jurisdiction hearing.donald stated he had head lice but some special shampoo had helped.donald explained why he did not attend school regularly.he said they did not have a permanent place to stay so they did not register for school.he figured he either missed half a semester or half of a school year.he stated he last attended the grade but did not complete the school year.janet was beginning the grade but could not recall how much school she had missed.janet confirmed she had not attended school for several months.a letter from a teacher at their elementary school indicated janet and donald had attended school half the time since their enrollment in december.the teacher observed janet and donald had developed a code of silence regarding the reason for their absences and about their life with mother.
both children stated they wished mother had a permanent home so they could all live together again.the two other children were too young to make any statement.
the dcfs interviewed mother.she denied her children had ever missed school.she claimed they attended some sort of classes offered by the various shelters.mother also characterized the allegations she had neglected her children medical care as lies.
mother acknowledged she was periodically depressed suffered from stress disorder.she attributed these emotional problems to being raped by her brothers when she was young.mother stated she does not take medications out of concern for the chemicals adverse side effects.she prefers taking the herb,john wort,which mother asserts has been effective in reducing symptoms of both her depression and.when asked what help mother felt she needed,mother stated she needed housing,medication for donald depression and help in getting him to his appointments,and help with dorothy who,according to mother,was acting out.
the dcfs contacted janet and donald father in washington state.he stated he loved his children but found it very difficult to keep track of them because mother moved so much.he explained he married mother in the when she became pregnant but stated mother moved out after a short time.in he learned mother had divorced him in.donald told the worker he had been making child support payments to the state of washington in the meantime.
dorothy and tercel father could not be located for an interview.
at the august,jurisdiction hearing mother counsel informed the court mother was ready,willing and able to resume custody of her children and argued the allegations of the petition,either singly or in combination,did not justify removing the children from her custody.counsel told the court,given the allegations that are before the would never allow the mother to voluntarily stipulate to the language that before the court.they are alleging that mother has demonstrated particular incapacities.and having made that allegation,it is will not enter a plea.she will not submit.she will not participate in any stipulation that she is incapable in any fashion.that the first issue.mother also challenged the legal adequacy of the factual allegations of the petition claiming she had failed to provide the children with basic necessities.finally,mother counsel argued,and her contention is that that standing alone,any one of those elements missing are or in conjunction together would not constitute grounds to deprive a parent of legal custody of the child.
the court thus scheduled a contested jurisdiction hearing for october.at its conclusion the court sustained the amended section petition under subdivisions b,g and j.these counts alleged mother had failed to protect her children because she had failed to ensure janet and donald school attendance,such conduct subjected their siblings to the risk of serious physical and emotional harm,and mother had demonstrated numerous mental and emotional problems.over mother counsel objections,the court ordered a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether mother suffered from any disorder which precludes proper parenting.the court scheduled a disposition hearing for november.
in late november the juvenile court received mother psychological evaluation prepared by michael ward.he found mother to be fully alert and oriented.he found no symptomatology or bizarre behavior.however,the doctor noted there were times when her thinking became a little tangential disorganized.he reported mother various test scores were unreliable because she had deliberately adjusted all her responses to present herself in the most positive light possible.the doctor opined,w hat this kind of marked defensiveness suggests is that she is probably also fairly lacking in insight and individuals who are this defensive are also described as being fairly rigid and inflexible.all of this could certainly have implications for the whole issue of their ability to respond to treatment,especially since such individuals frankly do not see themselves as having any problems and in need of any treatment which certainly appears to be the case here.indeed,mother had informed the doctor she had discontinued individual and group psychiatric sessions,claiming she had been too busy with court activities.
ward concluded mother would benefit from psychiatric treatment,including medication.he recommended proceeding in a conservative fashion.in the meantime,he saw no reason why mother could not have fairly frequent and somewhat extended visitation with her children,assuming she has an appropriate for such visitation.
the court received ward report but commented it was not very helpful.the court continued the disposition hearing to january.
the dcfs report for the january hearing stated mother had been in constant contact with the dcfs and had visited her children regularly on a weekly basis.however,the dcfs stated it was unclear what other reunification efforts mother had made.
the foster family agency reported janet was in counseling to address depression,loss issues,and daily life problems.she was attending high school,was on college track,and had received all as and bs on her most recent report card.she had purchased contact lenses out of her allowance and was very pleased not to be wearing glasses anymore.she had recently received the rest of her immunizations and had had cavities taken care of at a recent visit to the dentist.
donald was also doing well at the foster home.he told the worker he was excited about having his own bedroom and was enjoying his newfound privacy.he was attending school and had a b average.donald was also in counseling to address his depression and loss issues.at a recent visit to the dentist,he too had cavities which required fillings.
at the january,disposition hearing the court found by clear and convincing evidence there were no reasonable means to protect the children without removing them from mother custody.the court declared the children dependents of the juvenile court,removed them from mother custody and placed them under the supervision of the dcfs for suitable placement.the juvenile court ordered mother to participate in parenting classes,individual counseling with a dcfs approved psychiatrist,and conjoint counseling with the children when the therapists deemed it appropriate.the court ordered visits be monitored but gave the dcfs discretion to liberalize mother visits.the court ordered donald to participate in parenting classes in washington and directed the dcfs to initiate a home study with the state of washington regarding donald.
mother objected and told the court she was not accepting the disposition stage.mother stated the children were taken from her illegally for lack of emergency shelter mother also claimed the children were never out of school and the various children services departments had never provided her services.she told the court the intent of the law is not to take children unless it absolutely necessary it supposed to be the last resort.
the court continued the matter for a review hearing.
three days later mother filed two notices of appeal to challenge the court jurisdiction and disposition orders and its summary denials of her petitions to modify the court orders 
discussion 
the allegations of the petition do not state a basis for juvenile court jurisdiction.
mother renews her contention the petition lacked specific factual allegations to support the finding of jurisdiction under section,subdivision b.specifically,mother argues the petition pled no facts to show the children were at a substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness as this subdivision requires.mother also argues because the validity of the allegation of section,subdivision j for risk of abuse or neglect of a sibling is directly dependent on the invalid subdivision b allegation,the order sustaining the petition is not supported by the allegations and must therefore be reversed 
section subdivision b provides a child is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction if the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child,or the willful or negligent failure of the child parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child from the conduct of the custodian with whom the child has been left,or by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food,clothing,shelter,or medical treatment,or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse.no child shall be found to be a person described by this subdivision solely due to the lack of an emergency shelter for the family the child shall continue to be a dependent child pursuant to this subdivision only so long as is necessary to protect the child from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.italics added.
in this facial challenge to the petition we apply the rules akin to a demurrer we construe the facts in favor of the petition in order to determine whether the dcfs pleaded facts to establish mother failed to supervise or protect the children within the meaning of section,subdivision b.
section,subdivision f requires a dependency petition to contain a concise statement of facts,separately stated,to support the conclusion that the child upon whose behalf the petition is being brought is a person within the definition of each of the sections and subdivisions under which the proceedings are being instituted.the allegations of the petition sustained under section,subdivision b alleged the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent to supervise or protect the child adequately,by the inability of the parent to provide regular care for the child due to the parent mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse 
the facts in the petition offered in support of this allegation alleged 
the children janet,donald,dorothy and tercel mother,tricia has failed to ensure children janet and donald school attendance.such failure to ensure the children jane sic and donald school attendance deprives the children of an education and ongoing peer relationships conducive to the children normal growth and development.such conduct by the children mother endangers the children physical and emotional health and safety and places them and their siblings dorothy and tercel at risk of physical and emotional harm and damage.
the children janet,donald,dorothy and tercel mother,tricia has demonstrated numerous mental and emotional problems.such mental and emotional problems on the part of the children mother endangers the children physical and emotional health and safety and places the children at risk of physical and emotional harm and damage.
the predecessor statute to section required no separate showing of concrete harm or risk of physical harm to a child.a child could be declared a dependent if he or she was in need of proper and effective parental care or control and ha d no parent or guardian willing to exercise or capable of exercising such care or control.however,the revisions to section added this requirement,indicating a legislative intention to narrow the grounds on which juvenile court jurisdiction could be invoked now,before courts may exercise jurisdiction under section,subdivision b there must be evidence indicating the child is exposed to a substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness.
in determining what constitutes a substantial risk of serious physical harm,courts rely on subdivision a of section,which uses the same language to authorize jurisdiction where t he child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally upon the child by the child parent or guardian.for purposes of subdivision a a court may find there is a substantial risk of serious future injury based on the manner in which a less serious injury was inflicted,a history of repeated inflictions of injuries on the child or the child siblings,or a combination of these and other actions by the parent or guardian,which indicate the child is at risk of serious physical harm 
thus,evidence of past events may have some probative value in considering current conditions but under section,subdivision b this is only true if circumstances existing at the time of the hearing make it likely the children will suffer the same type of serious physical harm or illness in the future.this is so because under subdivision b a child may be considered dependent only so long as is necessary to protect the child from risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.for this reason,the past infliction of physical harm by a caretaker,standing alone,does not establish a substantial risk of physical harm,t here must be some reason to believe the acts may continue in the future.
sustained allegation stated mother had failed to ensure janet and donald school attendance.the worker reports and other documentary evidence confirm the truth of this allegation.it is also no doubt true failing to go to school regularly is very detrimental to the children.failing to attend school regularly not only deprives the children of an education,but also of the social interaction and peer relationships necessary for normal growth and development,as alleged in the petition.it is a very serious allegation and a factual circumstance which needed immediate correction.however,that is not the same as saying the failure to attend school created a substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness.the lack of education may well cause psychic or emotional or financial or social harm.but there are no facts alleged,or suggested by the supporting documentary evidence,to indicate mother failure to ensure the children regular school attendance subjected the children to physical injury or illness,serious or otherwise.we thus fail to see how this factual ground can support the court order sustaining the petition under section,subdivision b.
the other proposed ground stated in was based on the fact mother had demonstrated numerous mental and emotional problems.the petition alleged these problems endangered the children physical and emotional health and safety.the petition itself provided no other facts to suggest how mother mental health problems created a substantial risk her children would suffer serious physical injury or illness.it is true,the dcfs is not required to regurgitate the contents of the social worker report into a petition.however,a facially sufficient pleading is nevertheless necessary.the petition should present essential facts necessary to establish at least one valid ground for asserting juvenile court jurisdiction 
recognizing the inadequacies of the petition,the dcfs urges this court to go beyond the petition and consider facts in the social workers reports offered in support of the allegation regarding mother mental health problems.the department points to the fact tercel was removed from mother care for failure to thrive.however,he was returned to her care a few months later in april,and more than two years before the dcfs filed the current petition.this historical fact does not establish tercel is currently at risk of serious physical harm or illness.indeed,he was only a dependent child under section,subdivision b as long as was necessary to protect him from suffering this harm 
the department also points to the six referrals to san diego children services which occurred in the period before mother brought her family to pasadena.however,in each instance the cases were closed as unfounded or unsubstantiated.of the referrals,at least two were quite serious.mother claimed an acquaintance two young sons had molested dorothy while the family was staying in the acquaintance home.mother took dorothy for an exam at an emergency hospital and spoke to police officers there.neither the examination nor further investigation substantiated the molestation charge.nevertheless,mother immediately moved her family from this home.san diego children services found mother conduct appropriate.
next,employees at a fast food restaurant claimed they saw mother hold her two youngest children off the floor by their hair.mother denied the allegation.the two older children denied their mother would do such a thing.the investigating social worker examined the children heads to determine whether they experienced pain and found neither child head was sensitive enough to react to touch.the department dismissed the allegation as unsubstantiated.
the next serious incident was when dorothy fell from a stroller and suffered a fractured skull.ultimately,the department found the situation consistent with mother claim of accident and dismissed the case.
the pasadena shelter reported two of mother children suffered from head lice which the dcfs claimed demonstrated mother inability to provide medical care.however,head lice are a common affliction of children everywhere,including those only attending the most prestigious day camps and private schools.in any event,this temporary problem hardly amounts to a serious physical injury or illness as is required for a finding under section,subdivision b.this is especially true where the affliction was completely cured through the simple use of special shampoos and regular combing.
this is the sum total of the evidence in the documents supporting the petition which bear on physical injury.significantly,none of these conditions existed at the time of the hearing on the petition.in addition,none of the sustained allegations claimed these events were the result of,or were caused by,mother mental and emotional problems most importantly,however,neither the petition nor the rep
