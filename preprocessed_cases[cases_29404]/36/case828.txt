in the published portion of this decision,we address the primary issue in this a trust deed securing a promissory note issued in connection with a family law judgment may expire under provisions of the marketable record title act mrta,et despite family code section,which provides that a family law judgment is enforceable until paid in full.appellant betty louise stein argues the trial court erred in ruling that she could not enforce the trust deed under the mrta after more than years had elapsed since the note secured by the trust deed had matured.she contends that the purpose of the family code is thwarted by allowing the security for the family law judgment to expire under the mrta.
we conclude that the trial court properly harmonized the family code provision and the mrta by holding that the debt evidenced by the note and secured by the deed of trust is still owed even though the note had expired under the mrta and the deed of trust was no longer enforceable.we also reject respondent wayne schelb argument that the family law judgment should not be enforced under the terms of family code section,subdivision h.
in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that schelb argument that the trial court erred by failing to address his claim that a modification of the family law judgment constituted an accord and satisfaction is unsupported by the evidence and is contrary to the terms of the modification.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining there was no prevailing party to warrant an award of attorney fees.
factual and procedural summary 
the parties entered into a factual stipulation for trial from which we take portions of this summary.betty and wayne schelb,a married couple,were divorced in.the family court judgment of dissolution gave schelb the fee interest in two parcels of real property the maclay and glenoaks properties.stein relinquished her fee interest in these properties.to equalize the division of community property,schelb was ordered to give stein a note for,secured by deeds of trust on the maclay and glenoaks properties.schelb was to make monthly payments of from february,to february.at that point the balance was due with interest.
in,stein and schelb modified the deeds of trust and recorded the modification.the trial court ruled that this modification did not change either the maturity date of the note or the interest rate.as part of the modification,schelb paid a lump sum of to stein.in return,stein released the deed of trust on the glenoaks parcel and agreed to interest only payments of a month on the remaining principal balance of.
pursuant to the modification,schelb made the required payments from to.between and,he made only quarterly payments.the amount and purpose of those payments were disputed.he made no payments to stein after.
schelb and his current wife,janice bartholomew schelb,sued stein in december.a first amended complaint was filed in february.they alleged that their trust the wayne schelb and janice bartholomew trust owned the fee interest in the maclay property in they decided to refinance the maclay property to satisfy various debts,some of which were secured by the maclay property negotiations with stein about the family law judgment and the secured note to be paid by schelb were unsuccessful and the schelbs were unable to close the refinance of the property because of stein second trust deed.they alleged causes of action for cancellation of instruments,quiet title,injunction,declaratory judgment,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,and slander of title.stein responded with a against schelb and the title company for foreclosure of the deed of trust on the maclay property.the was amended to name interbay funding,the company through which the schelbs were refinancing,as a.
motions for summary judgment by the schelbs and interbay were denied.while the litigation was pending,interbay funded the schelbs refinance of the maclay property.encumbrances on the property other than that held by stein were paid off.interbay was aware of the promissory note and deed of trust in favor of stein when it made the loan to the schelbs.
the trial court issued a statement of decision following a court trial.it concluded that the mrta governs the deed and note,and that they had expired under its terms.but it also held that the family law judgment remains in full force and effect under family code section section.the schelbs were given judgment against stein on their first and second causes of action for cancellation of instrument and to quiet title.on their fourth cause of action for declaratory relief,the trial court declared that stein had no enforceable rights under the deed or note on the maclay property,but that schelb remains liable for the unpaid amount of the family court judgment under section,plus simple interest of percent per annum on the unpaid principal reduced by for quarterly payments made by schelb prior to.judgment against stein and in favor of schelb and interbay was entered on her.the court ruled that none of the parties was entitled to fees under a fee clause in the note.this timely appeal by stein followed entry of the judgment.schelb filed a from the judgment.
discussion 
we first dispose of a preliminary issue.schelb argues the trial court erred in not addressing his argument that the modification constituted an accord and satisfaction which replaced the original note.stein argues the issue was not preserved for appeal.there is an argument in schelb trial brief that the marital judgment had been satisfied.we turn to the merits of the argument.
the modification expressly states that the original note is hereby modified in the following particulars only.italics added.the modification repeated the maturity date of february,stated that the rate of interest was percent per annum the trial court found that to be the rate under the original note and that the note was to be payable interest only,or more,monthly with first payment due july,and to continue monthly thereafter to maturity.interest to accrue on the unpaid principal balance of note as of june.there is nothing in the modification to indicate that the original judgment amount had been satisfied.rather,the provision for interest on the unpaid balance demonstrates that the judgment had not been satisfied by the modification.
schelb argues the judgment was not a mere order for payment of a sum of money.he contends that if this had been the intent of the parties,the court would have ordered him to pay the forthwith.instead,the equalization award was structured as a string of payments yielding a total payout.schelb complains that the trial court failed to address his contention that the modification of the note constituted an accord and satisfaction.he asserts that stein has never contended that the original note and trust deed has continuing viability.
the original family court judgment directed schelb to provide security for performance of the note in favor of stein schelb is ordered to execute an appropriate trust deed or trust deeds to be secured against the real property awarded to him located on maclay and glenoaks streets.in its statement of decision in this case,the trial court referenced this order and found t here is no dispute as to the facts and it is clear that schelb did as he was ordered and signed and delivered the note and appropriate trust deed.the orders for execution of documents were fully complied with and have no continuing force.italics added.schelb appears to cite this language to support his argument that the original note was replaced by the modification.we disagree.a fair reading of the statement of decision is that schelb executed the note and trust deeds as originally ordered and no further steps were required to secure his obligation to stein.we find nothing in the statement of decision supporting schelb argument that there was an accord and satisfaction of the original note.
schelb accord and satisfaction argument also is contrary to the express language of the modification.it stated that the original note was modified in specific particulars only.as the trial court observed,the modification made no mention of schelb lump sum payment to stein,stein release of her claim to the glenoaks property,or the new principal amount due in light of payments made.
an accord and satisfaction is the substitution of a new agreement for and in satisfaction of a preexisting agreement between the same parties.the usual purpose is to settle a claim at a lesser amount.citations.the elements of an accord and satisfaction are a bona fide dispute between the parties,the debtor sends a certain sum on the express condition that acceptance of it will constitute full payment,and the creditor so understands the transaction and accepts the sum.citations.in re marriage of thompson th.
there is no evidence cited to us of a dispute between the parties as to the amount schelb owed stein under the original judgment or the modification.the stipulated facts for trial state that he had paid the original principal down to an agreed sum of.schelb makes factual assertions about the circumstances and intent of the parties when the modification was executed,without citation to the record as required by california rules of court,rule a c.it is his responsibility to support his claim by appropriate citation to the record,and we need not consider any statements and contentions made without proper citation.regents of university of california sheily th,fn.based on the express language of the modification,and lack of evidence of a dispute as to the amount owed,we find no merit in schelb argument that the modification constituted an accord and satisfaction of the original note.
the paramount issue in this case is whether mrta applies to family court money judgments governed by section.the parties have not cited and we have not found authority directly addressing this issue.we review the trial court interpretation of the two statutory schemes de novo.in re tobacco ii cases cal th.
following a study and recommendation of the california law revision commission,mrta was enacted in in order to make real property more freely alienable and marketable,subd.a.to further this goal the legislation sought to simplify and facilitate real property title transactions by enabling persons to determine the status and security of recorded real property titles from an examination of recent records,subds.a b worthington alcala th.miller provost th,see also severns union pacific railroad th.this statutory scheme limits the time for exercising the power of sale under a deed of trust.miller provost,supra,th at.
in enacting the recommendation of the law revision commission,the legislature declared interests in real property created at remote times,whether or not of record,often constitute unreasonable restraints on alienation and marketability of real property because the interests are no longer valid or have been abandoned or have otherwise become obsolete.such interests produce litigation to clear and quiet titles,cause delays in real property title transactions,and hinder marketability of real property.real property title transactions should be possible with economy and expediency.the status and security of recorded real property titles should be determinable to the extent practicable from an examination of recent records only,subd.a,italics added.severns union pacific railroad,supra,th at.the legislature expressly provided that mrta was to be liberally construed to effect the legislative purpose,subd.b.
civil code section,subdivision a,a mrta provision,states that where the final maturity date is ascertainable,a deed of trust,or other instrument that creates a security interest of record in real property to secure a debt expires years from the final maturity date.in this case,that date was february,the date stated in both the original note and the modification.it is undisputed that stein failed to avail herself of any of the remedies provided in mrta to extend her secured interest in the maclay property.
where a deed of trust or other security interest expires under the mrta,it is rendered unenforceable by any means commenced or asserted thereafter and is equivalent for all purposes to a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge of the security interest,and execution and recording of a certificate of satisfaction,reconveyance,release,or other discharge is not necessary to terminate or evidence the termination of the security interest.civil code section lists certain interests which are not subject to expiration under the mrta family law judgments are not among them 
family code section 
the present version of section,enacted in,also is the product of a report and recommendation by the california law revision commission.recommendation relating to enforcement of judgments under the family code cal.law revision com.hereafter law revision commission report.the law revision commission sought to reduce confusion created by three different rules governing the period for enforcement of a money judgment or judgment for possession of property under the family code.id.at.the three rules identified by the commission were a judgment for possession or sale of property is subject to the enforcement period and renewal procedure provided by general enforcement of judgments law former.a judgment for support is enforceable until paid in full and is not subject to the equitable defense of laches the judgment may be renewed to update the amount owed on the judgment former.a money judgment has no stated time period for enforcement and is not subject to the judgment renewal procedure or any exemption from laches code civ.id.at.
in adopting the recommendation of the law revision commission,the legislature repealed the former version of section and enacted the present version a a money judgment that is made or entered under this code,including a judgment for child,family,or spousal support,is enforceable until paid in full or otherwise satisfied.added by stats,ch.such family law judgments are expressly exempted from the requirement that a judgment be renewed,and failure to renew a judgment is declared to have no effect on the enforceability of the judgment,subd.b.although not required,a judgment may be renewed under section,subdivision c 
the legislature expressly acknowledged existing law regarding the enforcement of a judgment after the death of the judgment creditor or debtor,and provided nothing in this section supersedes the law governing enforcement of a judgment after the death of the judgment creditor or judgment debtor,subd.e.no similar provision relating to mrta was included in the legislation.
statutory interpretation 
established principles of statutory construction guide our analysis of the interaction of the mrta with section.when interpreting a statute,we endeavor to harmonize it with other enactments to the extent possible.marathon entertainment.blasi cal th,see department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,fn.lexin superior court cal th.the law shuns repeal by implication and,if possible,courts must maintain the integrity of both statutes.hughes electronics citibank delaware th.we presume that the legislature,when enacting a statute,was aware of existing related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of rules.citation.manhattan loft,llc mercury liquors,th.
in addition to these principles,we also apply the established rule that a specific statutory provision relating to a particular subject controls over a more general provision.that rule obtains even though the general provision standing alone is sufficiently broad to include the subject to which the specific statute relates.in the construction of a statute the intention of the legislature is to be pursued,if possible and when a general and particular provision are inconsistent,the latter is paramount to the former.so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.code civ.i t is settled that when a special and a general statute are in conflict,the former controls.code civ.hughes electronics citibank delaware,supra,th at.
