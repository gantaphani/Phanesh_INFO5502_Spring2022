appellant irwin siegel irwin and respondent linda siegel linda were divorced in they are now in their early.their marital termination agreement,which merged into a judgment,required irwin to establish a life insurance trust for linda,subject to certain terms.in,linda filed a request for order to disclose insurance information,asking for a court order requiring irwin to provide proof that the insurance policy was in existence.irwin filed a responsive declaration consenting to disclose information about his existing life insurance for linda benefit,attached some documents,and did not appear at the hearing.at the hearing,the family court judge construed the request for order to disclose insurance information as a motion to enforce the marital termination agreement,and issued an order after the hearing which,among other things,required irwin to establish a trust with linda as the beneficiary.irwin now appeals,arguing that he was denied due process because the trial court orders exceeded the relief requested by linda in the request for orders and he had inadequate notice of the relief,and that the family court impermissibly modified a judgment that was nonmodifiable on its terms.we agree that the trial court erred by issuing an order that far exceeded the relief requested by linda,and reverse.
background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute,and we summarize them briefly.
irwin and linda were married in.as of june,their marital status was terminated,and a judgment of dissolution was entered.they later entered into a marital termination agreement mta that was approved by the family court and incorporated into a further judgment on reserved issues,filed december,judgment.
the judgment and mta required irwin to pay linda per month spousal support,until such time as linda died or remarried a provision was made for support in the event that irwin predeceased her 
upon the death of husband,should husband predecease wife,any remaining spousal support obligation of husband to wife shall be satisfied as follows 
husband shall forthwith establish an insurance trust for the benefit of wife.
husband shall,during his life and for so long as he is insurable at reasonable cost,maintain a policy of insurance on his life in a sic amount not less than.
husband shall designate said insurance trust as the beneficiary of at least of insurance on his life.
said insurance trust shall provide that the trust shall,during wife life,pay monthly to wife in lieu of the spousal support payments she would have received had not husband predeceased her,an amount equal to the income of said trust,up to a maximum of per month.the principal of said trust may be invaded if necessary to make said payments.
upon wife death,the corpus of the trust shall be disbursed pursuant to the terms of husband will.
husband and wife understand that the aforementioned provisions concerning spousal support can not be changed or modified by the court,regardless of the financial or other circumstances of either party.
on august,linda filed a mandatory judicial council form fl request for order,checking the box at the top of the form marked other and seeking what she described on the form as an order to disclose insurance information.in the section entitled request for order and supporting declaration,linda checked box for other relief and specified husband was ordered to establish an insurance trust for the benefit of the wife in the amount of at least.husband has not ever and will not provide proof that this policy is or ever was in existance sic.wife has asked repeatedly for this proof and now prays that the court will insist on that proof.emphasis added.linda also checked box,where the petitioner was supposed to list the facts in support of orders requested,and restated verbatim what she had typed next to the relief sought in box.linda attached three pages from the mta,including the provisions from section support quoted above.
the order setting the hearing on the request for orders was signed by judge stephen pulido on august.box was checked,with the following form language you are ordered to appear in court at the date and time listed in item october,at to give any legal reason why the orders requested should not be granted.emphasis added.the form order also stated in bold text that if the recipient wished to respond to the request for order,he must file a responsive declaration to request for order form fl and serve it on the opposing party.
irwin,representing himself,filed a response on september,on the appropriate judicial council form.he checked box c other relief,which was next to the preprinted text i consent to the following order,and typed in for an order that petitioner disclose information about his existing life insurance for respondent.irwin provided the following supporting information called for by box 
on may,petitioner provided respondent information and documentation of his existing life insurance for respondent benefit,as attached hereto and marked as exhibits a and in addition,petitioner provides the pertinent portion of his will providing for a trust for respondent benefit,attached hereto as exhibit 
petitioner,who is now years of age and fully retired,does not believe he is insurable at any reasonable cost for life insurance in addition to the existing coverage of held for respondent.
irwin attached a letter to linda written may,exhibit a enclosing her usual monthly spousal support payment,and giving her an update about my current life insurance situation.the letter continued my life insurance is furnished by the permanente medical group term life insurance policy.that policy coverage automatically is reduced as the ages.it is now at its final nonreducible level of.i am no longer insurable and further additional life insurance is no longer available to me.this is all the life insurance i have.after my death the death benefit will be held in a trust which will pay you per month as long as you are alive and unmarried until the amount is used up.
irwin also attached exhibit b,a sheet entitled life insurance coverage for irwin siegel,retirement at september,which indicated that his coverage for october,and thereafter was.this sheet also reflected that his coverage has been reduced from retirement date at age to age,and stayed steady at.the source of exhibit b was not clear.
irwin attached exhibit c,which appeared to be a half page redacted from his will,and included a provision about a life insurance trust.it stated 
trust for benefit of linda suzanne siegel.my trustee shall hold,administer,and distribute any life insurance proceeds from my permanente medical group term life policy as a result of my death in a separate trust as set forth in this section.for so long as my former spouse,linda suzanne siegel,is living and unmarried,my trustee shall pay her the sum of per month from such proceeds.such payments shall continue until the death or remarriage of linda suzanne siegel,or until the trust is exhausted,whichever occurs first.
exhibit c also contained a provision that upon the death or remarriage of linda,irwin trustee was to distribute the remainder of the trust as set forth in section,as if it were part of the residue of my estate.section was not included in exhibit 
the hearing on linda request for order was held on october,before judge tara flanagan.irwin did not appear linda appeared and represented herself.
the family court judge acknowledged at the outset that linda request for orders was for the disclosure of financial insurance information,and that irwin says he done that.the judge then gave linda the option to turn the hearing into something else,asking her so is it really that you need him to disclose the financial information or that you feel he not in compliance with the settlement agreement of the dissolution linda replied that it was the latter.
the court then asked linda about the trust 
the court well,he says he did set one up,right 
linda well,if he did set up the trust for me 
the court he did not.he says he did do it.he says,i did do it.i uninsurable now because i retired.i ca do it at a reasonable cost.all i have is my life insurance policy.that what i understand his response is.
the court stated its view repeatedly that irwin did have a trust.i do think there is a trust there is one,so you ca have a copy of what does exist.
a discussion ensued,with linda contending that if irwin does have a trust,then he must set up something for me as the beneficiary.even this,i have no trust either.
the family court judge then advised linda,
the court well,usually when there a life insurance policy there is a trust set up,it just a life insurance policy,and then should the person pass away then the benefits go to the beneficiary,but i understand part of your assertion is that you do even have a copy of the policy and you do really have enough information.but that 
the court a separate issue from saying he did set up the trust in its entirety.he did set up whether you call it a trust or a life insurance policy.your settlement agreement in your dissolution,there supposed to be available to you,so that a little bit different issue i think we know where there is there is one.i think that abundantly clear to me.
linda replied that irwin should set up a trust as he was supposed to do when he was a young man,and started to explain why the trust fund was originally supposed to be established.the court interjected that i t does matter and i understand it was an important part of the dissolution and that it was negotiated for and part of the settlement agreement.from there,the court concluded s o it really is just an enforceability issue.you do need to convince me on the merits of it.the court then took up the question of remedy 
so the problem,or the one difficulty i wo say it a problem is the settlement agreement reads that husband shall during his life and for so long as he is insurable at reasonable costs maintain a policy on his life in an amount not less than.
so it that reasonableness language,at a reasonable cost,because now he asserting,well,now i and it not a reasonable cost because,basically,at it extraordinarily difficult to get a life insurance policy.
the court then observed that finding a remedy for this missing and some change,that is a little more difficult.i not saying that the court does find your argument persuasive.the court invited linda to tell the court what she would like the court order him to do,noting that it would probably cost tens of thousands of dollars to set up a policy.
when linda replied that irwin could well afford it,the court asked about irwin monthly income.linda replied that irwin had a very large keogh plan,a salary deferred plan,and owned property.she assured the court that i know that he well could do it.it a question of wanting to do it,that all it about.the court inquired how long linda and irwin had been married,whether they had children,and whether linda had worked outside the home when she was younger.linda replied that she had been a teacher.
eventually the court observed that irwin has chosen not to appear.he did file a response,i have read his response.i am going to take this under submission,meaning i going to make a submission,in full,in writing,within the next days.the court elaborated 
at this point i going to tell you that my order is going to include he provide you,within a certain time period,with a copy of the life insurance policy,with all information,true and actual copies of it,and that shows that you are the named beneficiary of the life insurance policy,and that the information he provides you includes the plan administrator information so that you may communicate directly with kaiser 
as for the balance of the trust that was negotiated for,i taking that under submission to consider what the best way would be to make up that balance.
i do understand your request.it valid on the four corners of the contract that is part of the marital settlement agreement.it very clear what he was to do 
on november,the court issued detailed written findings and orders.the court stated that the request for orders filed by linda is construed by the court as a request for orders to enforce the settlement agreement.the court found that irwin,b y his own admission as shown in his responsive pleading and attachments,had not established a life insurance trust in the amount of at least as required by the mta,but instead relies upon an alleged permanente medical group life insurance policy,and his purported will to meet this contractual spousal support obligation.the court further found that,other than the letter from irwin attached to his response filed with the court in connection with the motion,linda did not have documentation providing her with proof that the permanente medical group exists or that she is in fact the sole named beneficiary of the insurance policy,or that there was a life insurance trust established for her benefit.moving beyond the failure to provide sufficient documentation,the court then found that irwin had not complied with nor performed the terms of the judgment and marital termination agreement which he is and was legally obligated to do.the court made findings that irwin had not established an insurance trust,that there was no life insurance policy with death benefits of for linda benefit,there was no life trust instrument,and there was no safeguard or mechanism or instrument that e ns ures irwin future spousal support obligations to linda should irwin predecease her.with that,the court stated that linda request for orders filed is granted.
however,the page and a half of orders that followed were broad and went beyond linda simple request for disclosure of an insurance policy.among other things,irwin was ordered to name linda as the sole primary beneficiary of his insurance policy from permanente medical group in the event of his death and provide proof that he had done so within seven days of the date of the order.further,irwin was ordered,within seven days of the date of the order,to establish a separate trust instrument in an amount no less than established for the purpose of making monthly payments to linda in the amount of per month for spousal support,as ordered in the judgment.said payments from the trust shall begin upon either a should there be any delays in linda receiving the life insurance proceeds upon death of irwin or b exhaustion of the proceeds of the life insurance benefits paid to months per month.
this appeal by irwin followed.
discussion 
the heart of irwin appeal is that he was denied due process because the court held a hearing and made orders on issues about which he had no notice.the facts,as we have summarized them here,are undisputed.to the extent that irwin challenges the family court authority to issue orders beyond the scope of the notice,he has raised a question of law which we review de novo.herbst swan th,estate of wilson th,questions of law reviewed de novo radian guaranty,garamendi th,application of statutory standard to undisputed facts reviewed de novo.
it is a fundamental concept of due process that a judgment against a defendant can not be entered unless he was given proper notice and an opportunity to defend,amend.xiv in re marriage of lippel cal,lippel.a dissolution court can not grant unrequested relief against a party who appears without affording that party notice and an opportunity to respond.citations.due process requires affording a litigant a reasonable opportunity,by continuance or otherwise,to respond to evidence or argument that is new,surprising,and relevant.citations.in re marriage of th.
here,the written request for orders sought proof that this insurance policy is or ever was in existence,and an order that the court will insist on that proof.irwin filed a response which indicated his written consent to this order.the transcript of the brief hearing,which we have summarized above,speaks for itself.the court,on its own volition,chose to treat the request for orders as more than an order to disclose insurance information,and awarded relief far in excess of what was sought.
linda contends that the three sentences in her request for orders placed irwin on adequate and sufficient notice that the trial court would be hearing and considering whether he had complied with his obligations under
