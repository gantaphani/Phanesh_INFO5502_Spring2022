introduction 
this writ proceeding arises from a marital dissolution action brought by petitioner gilda lappe against her former husband and real party in interest murray lappe the parties agreed to resolve their property and support issues through mediation,during which they purportedly exchanged certain financial disclosure declarations that are mandated by the family code.they also executed a marital settlement agreement,which was incorporated into a stipulated judgment.shortly after entry of judgment,gilda learned that murray recently sold a company he founded during the marriage.in the settlement agreement,gilda relinquished her community share of the company for million.murray received approximately million from the sale.
following this revelation,gilda filed an application to set aside the judgment on grounds of fraud and duress.in connection with the application,gilda served discovery on murray requesting,among other things,the financial disclosure declarations that were exchanged prior to entry of judgment.murray refused to produce the declarations,asserting they were covered by the mediation confidentiality statutes,insofar as they constituted writings that were prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation,subd.b.gilda moved to compel production.the trial court denied the motion on mediation confidentiality grounds.
in her petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court order,gilda contends the mediation confidentiality statutes do not apply because the subject financial disclosure declarations were necessarily prepared pursuant to and for the purpose of complying with the family code statutory mandate,not because the parties participated in mediation.we agree,and grant gilda petition.
facts and procedural background 
gilda and murray were married for years and have two children together.gilda was a mother during their marriage.murray is trained as a medical doctor and is a successful businessman.
on february,gilda filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage.the parties agreed to settle their property and support issues through mediation without representation by counsel.during the mediation,gilda and murray signed declarations stating that service of the preliminary and final declarations of disclosure had been made on the other party as required by the family code.notwithstanding these declarations,gilda maintains that she did not serve murray with a preliminary or final declaration of disclosure,nor did she receive a preliminary or final declaration from murray.she avers the declaration regarding service was one of several documents that murray coerced her to sign while they were alone in the mediator office.murray denies the allegation 
during the mediation,the parties also executed a marital settlement agreement.as pertinent to the instant proceeding,the agreement provides that murray shall pay gilda a total of million in full satisfaction of her entire community interest in shares of escreen.with respect to the declarations of disclosure,the agreement also states the parties declarations of disclosure shall be inadmissible in a court of law,and otherwise protected from disclosure,pursuant to the provisions of section b of the california evidence code.evidence code section,subdivision b bars discovery or admissibility of writings prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation.on august,the trial court entered a stipulated judgment,which incorporated the marital settlement agreement.
on april,gilda filed an application to set aside the judgment on grounds of fraud,perjury,duress,and mistake.in her supporting declaration,gilda asserted that in january,less than five months after the judgment was entered,she learned murray was in the process of selling escreen and all equity shares he acquired in the company through the marital settlement agreement.as a result of the sale,murray received approximately million for the escreen shares.gilda averred that murray never disclosed he was shopping escreen for sale,and had she known as much,she would not have agreed to surrender her community interest in the company for only million.
in connection with her application to set aside the judgment,gilda served a request for production of documents on murray,which included a request for the declaration of disclosure that murray served upon gilda prior to entry of judgment.murray objected to the request and refused to produce the declaration on the ground that it was protected from disclosure by the mediation confidentiality statutes.gilda brought a motion to compel production.
the trial court appointed a referee to make recommendations regarding the discovery dispute.the referee concluded the declaration of disclosure was not subject to mediation confidentiality because the document had independent legal significance and the public policy declared by the family code favoring disclosure to ensure fair and equal property divisions overrides mediation confidentiality.gilda applied for an order confirming the referee recommendation and findings.murray objected to the recommendation.
in his objections,murray principally argued that the referee erred by relying on a nonstatutory exception for documents having independent legal significance in violation of the supreme court repeated instruction that courts may not craft judicial exceptions to mediation confidentiality.murray also argued the recommendation ignored the parties express agreement that the declarations of disclosure were to be deemed inadmissible and shielded from discovery under the mediation confidentiality provisions of the evidence code.
the trial court agreed with murray.in view of the supreme court authorities consistently rejecting judicially crafted exceptions to mediation confidentiality,and the parties stipulation in their marital settlement agreement that evidence code section applied to the declarations of disclosure,the court ruled the mediation confidentiality statutes barred compelled production of the disclosure declarations.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the order denying gilda motion to compel for an abuse of discretion.people ex rel.lockyer superior court th,d lockyer.under this standard,a trial court ruling on a discovery motion will be overturned upon a prerogative writ if there is no substantial basis for the manner in which the court exercised its discretion or if the court applied a patently improper standard for its decision.coriell superior court d,fn.where the propriety of a discovery order turns on statutory interpretation,we review the issue de novo,as a question of law.lockyer,at,d.
gilda contends the evidence code mediation confidentiality provisions can not be applied in a marital dissolution proceeding to bar the discovery and admissibility of financial disclosures mandated by the family code.to put the issue in context,we begin with a review of each statutory scheme.
family code disclosure requirements 
as codified in family code section et,california law recognizes the vital importance of full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities at the early stages of a marital dissolution proceeding to ensure fair and sufficient child and spousal support awards and to achieve a proper division of community and assets and liabilities,subds.a c hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.this includes a continuing duty on the part of each spouse to immediately,fully,and accurately update and augment that disclosure so both will have full and complete knowledge of the relevant underlying facts,subd.c.
to implement this policy,the family code mandates that each spouse shall serve on the other party a preliminary and final declaration of disclosure.the preliminary declaration of disclosure provides a general inventory of the parties respective assets at the outset of dissolution proceedings the final declaration requires far more extensive disclosures.
the family code mandates that the final declaration of disclosure shall include a ll material facts and information regarding the characterization of all assets and liabilities the valuation of all assets that are contended to be community property the amounts of all obligations that are contended to be community obligations and the earnings,accumulations,and expenses of each party,subd.b hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.the final declaration must also contain accurate and complete written disclosure of any investment opportunity,business opportunity,or other opportunity that presents itself after the date of separation,but that results from any investment,significant business activity outside the ordinary course of business,or other opportunity of either spouse from the date of marriage to the date of separation,inclusive,subd.a,subd.d.this written disclosure shall be made in sufficient time for the other spouse to make an informed decision as to whether he or she desires to participate in the investment opportunity,business,or other potential opportunity,and for the court to resolve any dispute regarding the right of the other spouse to participate in the opportunity.ibid.
because the family code extensive disclosure requirements could reveal sensitive financial information,the final declarations of disclosure,like the preliminary declarations,must be served on the other spouse,but are not to be filed with the court,subd.a,subd.b hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.however,unless there has been a valid waiver,the family code mandates that each party shall execute and file with the court a declaration signed under penalty of perjury stating that service of the final declaration of disclosure was made on the other party before judgment is entered.a judgment entered when the parties have failed to comply with the declaration of disclosure requirements is subject to set aside to the extent the nondisclosure materially affected the judgment,subd.c,subd.d see in re marriage of steiner hosseini th,d.upon a motion to set aside the judgment,the court may order the parties to provide the court with the preliminary and final declarations of disclosure that were exchanged between them,subd.e.
the mandatory declaration of disclosure requirements are subject to a few narrow statutory exemptions.under family code section,subdivision a,the court has discretion to excuse a party from serving a final declaration of disclosure upon a showing of good cause.additionally,on specified conditions,the parties may stipulate to a mutual waiver of the final declaration requirement,subd.d.unless the mandatory conditions specified in section are met,no purported waiver is effective to excuse exchange of the prescribed final declarations in re marriage of fell th,d where the legislature permits a particular,limited waiver of a right upon satisfaction of a set of conditions,it intends that no other related waivers be permitted.
notwithstanding the foregoing,courts have recognized that when parties to a marital dissolution agree to settle their property or support issues by nonjudicial arbitration or mediation,they may do so without strictly complying with the technical requirements of family code sections or.see elden superior court th,d elden husband and wife here could arbitrate to an award whether or not they had filed either preliminary declarations or final declarations in re marriage of woolsey th,d woolsey where parties agreed to mediation,strict compliance with the technical procedural requirements of sections and was not required.however,regardless of the procedures adopted in mediation or arbitration,the parties are nonetheless required to execute and serve final declarations of disclosure before the court may enter judgment.elden,at,d pursuant to section,the trial court could not grant husband motion and enter judgment unless both parties had first complied with section woolsey,at,d after a mediation in a marital dissolution case,parties must nonetheless comply with section prior to entry of judgment by the trial court.
evidence code mediation confidentiality provisions 
c onfidentiality is essential to effective mediation and,in some cases required by,the legislature.foxgate homeowners bramalea california,cal th,d,foxgate.t he mediation confidentiality provisions of the evidence code were enacted to encourage mediation by permitting the parties to frankly exchange views,without fear that disclosures might be used against them in later proceedings.fair bakhtiari cal th,d,fair.
mediation confidentiality is codified in evidence code section et.as delineated in evidence code section,mediation confidentiality applies to any oral or written communication made or prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation.section specifies that such evidence is neither subject to discovery nor admissible in any civil action or other noncriminal proceeding.even after mediation ends,communications and writings protected by the statutes are to remain confidential.
notwithstanding the statutes broad scope,the factual contents of a conversation or writing are not automatically deemed confidential simply because they are included in a mediation communication.under evidence code section,subdivision a,facts that constitute otherwise admissible evidence or are subject to discovery outside of a mediation do not become inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of their introduction or use in a mediation.likewise,otherwise admissible facts can not be shielded from disclosure simply because they have been placed in confidential mediation documents.wimsatt,supra,th at,d rojas superior court cal th,fn,d,rojas.
some mediation communications are admissible and subject to disclosure under statutorily defined exceptions.for example,the statutory scheme specifies when written and oral settlements resulting from the mediation process are admissible.additionally,mediation communications or writings may be admitted if there is consent for disclosure in accordance with the conditions set forth in evidence code section.
our supreme court has broadly applied the mediation confidentiality statutes and all but categorically prohibited judicially crafted exceptions,even in situations where justice seems to call for a different result.see wimsatt,supra,th at,d cataloguing supreme court cases.to carry out the purpose of encouraging mediation by ensuring confidentiality,the statutory scheme unqualifiedly bars disclosure of communications and writings made during mediation absent an express statutory exception.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted accord,rojas,supra,cal th at,d,fair,supra,cal th at,d.judicial construction,and judicially crafted exceptions,are permitted only where due process is implicated,or where literal construction would produce absurd results,thus clearly violating the legislature presumed intent.otherwise,the mediation confidentiality statutes must be applied in strict accordance with their plain terms.where competing policy concerns are present,it is for the legislature to resolve them.cassel,supra,cal th at,d,simmons ghaderi cal th,d,simmons.
evidence code section does not apply to disclosures made pursuant to and for the purpose of complying with the family code statutory mandate 
as the foregoing authorities make clear,courts must eschew judicially crafted exceptions to mediation confidentiality,unless due process is implicated or a literal construction would produce absurd results.cassel,supra,cal th at,d.however,manifest as this rule is,it does not answer the threshold question presented by this case that is,do the mediation confidentiality statutes apply in the first instance to statutorily mandated disclosures that must be made regardless of whether the parties participate in mediation we conclude the answer to this question is no.
to reiterate,under evidence code section,mediation confidentiality applies to any writing prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation the declarations of disclosure at issue in this case in particular the final declarations that must be exchanged before judgment can be entered,do not come within the categories delineated by section.these declarations were not prepared for the purpose of a mediation rath
