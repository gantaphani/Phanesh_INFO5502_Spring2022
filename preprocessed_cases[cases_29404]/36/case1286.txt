jeannie mother appeals from an order terminating parental rights to her daughter.at the preceding hearing,at which the juvenile court set the termination hearing,the social worker learned for the first time that had indian ancestry.at that point,the social worker attempted to give notice pursuant to the indian child welfare act et the icwa.although the notice did not comply fully with all applicable requirements,it did reach the cherokee nation the tribe,and the tribe did respond.as a result,the mother and became members of the tribe the tribe intervened and,with the tribe approval,was placed with indian foster parents who wanted to adopt her.
in the published portion of this opinion,we consider the mother contention that the juvenile court and the social worker complied only belatedly with their duty under the icwa to inquire into indian ancestry.we will reject this contention for three reasons.first,the mother waived it by failing to raise it at the first opportunity although a parent can not waive an indian tribe rights under the icwa,the parent can waive his or her own rights.second,the fact that the social worker reports stated that the icwa did not apply,along with the fact that the icwa check boxes on the petition were left blank,constituted sufficient evidence that an inquiry was made.third,at least as to the mother,the asserted error was harmless.the detention hearing did not involve a foster care placement within the meaning of the icwa hence,the substantive provisions of the icwa did not apply.the hearing did involve a foster care placement,and we may assume the review hearings did as well,but there is no reasonable probability that,if the substantive provisions of the icwa had been applied,the mother would have enjoyed a more favorable result.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we find no other error.accordingly,we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
when this dependency proceeding was originally filed,was two,going on three.she is now five.
on november,because both of her parents were found to be under the influence of drugs,and because of hazardous conditions in the home,was detained.on november,the san bernardino county department of children services the department filed a dependency petition concerning her.initially,she was placed in a group foster home.within weeks,however,she was moved to a foster family home.
both the report for the detention hearing and the report for the hearing stated,the indian child welfare act does not apply.
on december,at the hearing,the parents submitted on the social worker reports.the juvenile court found jurisdiction based on failure to protect.welf,subd.b.it ordered reunification services.
on january,at the review hearing,the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set a hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section section hearing.at that same hearing,however,the social worker learned apparently from the mother,but possibly from the maternal grandmother,who was at the hearing that had indian heritage.
on february,after obtaining the necessary information from the maternal grandmother,the social worker mailed a form soc to the bureau of indian affairs the bia.that form would have provided information about ancestry.there is no indication,however,that the social worker sent a form soc,which would have provided notice of the dependency proceeding.see in re th,d.
on february,the juvenile court held a notice review hearing.the maternal grandmother appeared and stated that she was a member of the tribe.counsel for the department indicated that it was going to give notice pursuant to the icwa.
meanwhile,the tribe responded to the notice already sent to the bia.in a letter dated february,it confirmed that the maternal grandmother was a member of the tribe and that was eligible for membership.a membership application was enclosed.the letter also stated the cherokee nation is not empowered to intervene in this matter unless the or eligible parent s apply and receive membership.
on june,the mother filed a motion to invalidate jurisdictional,dispositional,e and f findings and orders for failure to comply with the indian child welfare act and welfare section.capitalization altered.
on july,the prospective adoptive parents indicated that they had changed their minds about adoption they asked that be removed from their home.
on or about july,both the mother and became members of the tribe.on july or,the tribe filed a notice of intervention.capitalization altered.
on august,was placed with a family that wanted to adopt her.the prospective adoptive mother had both cherokee and navajo ancestry the prospective adoptive father had both cherokee and cheyenne ancestry.although not members of any tribe,they were actively involved in cultural events such as powwows.the tribe took the position that,although it would have preferred a placement in the home of members of the cherokee nation,current placement was in her best interest because she has adjusted to her community and school environment,and she will be raised attending cultural events with her parents 
on august,the juvenile court denied the mother motion to invalidate prior orders.it then proceeded to hold a contested section hearing.for purposes of the icwa,it specifically found,beyond a reasonable doubt,that continued custody of the child by the parents was likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage to the child see f and,by clear and convincing evidence,that active efforts had been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family see d.it also found that was adoptable and that none of the exceptions to termination of parental rights applied.it therefore terminated parental rights.
the mother filed a timely notice of appeal.the tribe has been given notice of the appeal,including copies of all of the briefs.it has notified us,however,that it does not wish to participate in the appeal.
failure to inquire into indian ancestry 
the mother contends the juvenile court should have granted her motion to invalidate previous findings and orders because the juvenile court and the department had failed to inquire into whether was an indian child.
statutory background.
among the stated purposes of the icwa are to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture.
in general,the icwa applies to any state court proceeding involving the foster care or adoptive placement of,or the termination of parental rights to,an indian child.indian child is defined as a child who is either a member of an indian tribe or eligible for membership in an indian tribe and the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.
we are concerned with three types of icwa provisions,which we will call the notice provisions,the substantive provisions,and the enforcement provision.
first,under the notice provisions,if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the social services agency must notify the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.if the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined,the notice need only be given to the bia.ibid.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the tribe or the bia.ibid.
second,under the substantive provisions,the indian child tribe has a right to intervene at any point in the proceeding.c.as a condition of any foster care placement or termination of parental rights,the court must find that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.d.the court also must find,based at least in part on the testimony of qualified expert witnesses,that the continued custody of the child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.e,f.for a foster care placement,this must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.e.for termination of parental rights,it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.f.
third and finally,under the enforcement provision,on the petition of the indian child,a parent from whose custody an indian child has been removed,or the indian child tribe,any court of competent jurisdiction must invalidate any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights that violated the notice provision or any of the substantive provisions.
a host of subsidiary requirements have been adopted to implement,interpret,and enlarge upon this statutory language.these requirements are embodied in federal regulations et,which are binding in all federal and state courts by virtue of the supremacy clause see olszewski scripps health cal th,d,federal guidelines for state courts guidelines,which by their terms are not intended to have binding legislative effect ibid.a state rule of court cal.rules of court,rule several mandatory state judicial council forms,see also,and sections and of the state child welfare services manual of policies and procedures cws manual see in re asia th,d.
for example,the icwa notice provisions,by their terms,apply if the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved a.the icwa does not define reason to know.neither do the controlling federal regulations.see a.the guidelines,however,require the state court to make inquiries to determine if the child involved is a member of an indian tribe or if a parent of the child is a member of an indian tribe and the child is eligible for membership in an indian tribe.guidelines.a,italics added.the state rule of court provides that t he court and the county welfare department have an affirmative duty to inquire whether a child for whom a dependency petition is to be,or has been,filed is or may be an indian child.cal.rules of court,rule d.judicial council form,effective january,provides for a parent to indicate whether the child is or might be an indian child.
the cws manual,finally,provides that the social worker shall i dentify in the petition that the child is or may be an indian child as defined by the icwa.cws manual.to make such a determination,the social worker shall ask the child,his parent or custodian whether the child is or may be a member of an indian tribe,or whether the child identifies as a member of a particular indian organization.cws manual.if the child indian status can not be determined before the first hearing,the social worker must a dvise the court of all information which indicates that the child may be an indian child,a dvise the court of all efforts made to establish the child status as an indian child,and c ontinue contacts with the bia until the question of the child status as an indian child has been resolved and the resolution is documented in the case record for future reference.cws manual.
the icwa expressly permits s tate or f ederal law to provide a higher standard of protection than the rights provided under the icwa.this simply means,however,that the icwa does not preempt such higher state standards.it does not incorporate such higher state standards into the icwa itself.the enforcement provision,by its terms,applies only to violations of sections,and of this title it does not purport to address the penalty for other violations of federal or state law.
as a general rule,a party is precluded from urging on appeal any point not raised in the trial court.any other rule would permit a party to play fast and loose with the administration of justice by deliberately standing by without making an objection of which he is aware.citation.in re richard th,d.similar principles apply to a belated attempt to raise a point in the trial court.for example,t he rule is well settled that when at any time during trial a party or his counsel becomes aware of facts constituting misconduct or irregularity in the proceedings of the jury,he must promptly bring such matters to the attention of the court,if he desires to object to it,or he will be deemed to have waived the point as a ground for a motion for a new trial.citations.weathers kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.
here,the mother raised her present contention for the first time by filing a motion to invalidate prior orders pursuant to the enforcement provision of the icwa.previously,she had appeared or waived her appearance at every hearing that she now claims was held without the notice required by the icwa.nevertheless,she failed to object on icwa grounds until those hearings were over and the section hearing loomed.she does not offer any excuse for her previous failure to object for example,she does not claim that she was unaware of her own indian ancestry.we conclude that she thereby forfeited any right she might otherwise have had to invoke the enforcement provision.
admittedly,it has been by this a parent does not necessarily waive an icwa notice issue by failing to raise it below.in re suzanna th,d fourth,div.two in re jennifer th,d dwayne superior court th,d in re samuel th,d in re marinna th,d in re desiree th,d.these cases,however,reason that t he notice requirements serve the interests of the indian tribes irrespective of the position of the parents and can not be waived by the parent.citation.citation.suzanna,at,d,quoting samuel,at,d,quoting in re kahlen d.
once the child tribe has appeared and has not asked,on its own behalf,that any prior actions be invalidated,this rationale does not apply.the parent has an independent right to invalidate prior actions,but there is every reason to hold that this can be waived.as in other cases,i t would seem intolerable to permit a party to play fast and loose with the administration of justice by deliberately standing by without making an objection of which he is aware and thereby permitting the proceedings to go to a conclusion which he may acquiesce in,if favorable,and which he may avoid,if not.caminetti pac.mutual ins.of california cal d,quoting irr.dist.superior court of tulare county cal,conc.opn.of onley.
while the social worker and the trial court have a duty to inquire into the child indian ancestry,a parent has superior access to this information.moreover,a parent has a right to counsel,including appointed counsel,if necessary,subds.a,b,who has not only the ability but also the duty to protect the parent rights under the icwa.as the trial court in this case observed,if a parent has indian ancestry,i would think as officers of the court,counsel for parents would have a similar interest in bring ing that information forward at the earliest possible time.
we recognize that,in a proceeding for foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child,a parent failure to object does not waive the substantive provisions as opposed to the notice provisions of the icwa unless the court is satisfied that the parent has been fully advised of the requirements of the act,and has knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waived them.cal.rules of court,rule i,j,m,see in re jennifer,supra,th at,d.here,however,was not yet an indian child.the substantive provisions of the icwa did not yet apply.there is no state rule of court similarly restricting waiver of the notice provisions,which are the source of the duty of inquiry.
accordingly,the mother could and did waive the supposed failure to inquire concerning indian ancestry.
the sufficiency of the evidence.
separately and alternatively,the record indicates that the department did inquire as to whether was an indian child.in re aaliyah th,d is practically on point.there,the petition application was marked no to indicate that the child did not have indian heritage.all subsequent reports stated that the icwa did not apply.id.at,d.on appeal,the father argued that the juvenile court and the social services agency had failed to satisfy their affirmative duty to inquire as to icwa applicability.id.at,d.the appellate court disagreed checking the no
