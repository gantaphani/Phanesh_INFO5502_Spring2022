this habeas petition presents an unusual question of collateral estoppel.in,kip antonio smith was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor child.but only fourteen months earlier,in a civil action,a jury had rejected the state allegations that he had sexually abused a child in a manner that was shocking and heinous or which caused severe harm or injury.in his state appeal,smith unsuccessfully argued that the jury findings in the earlier civil proceeding precluded a contrary finding in his criminal case.see smith oklahoma.
smith petitioned for habeas corpus relief pursuant to.the district court denied smith petition,finding that the decision of the oklahoma court of criminal appeals occa in the state appellate proceedings was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
we agree and therefore affirm the district court denial of smith application for a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
on november,the state of oklahoma filed a petition to terminate kip smith parental rights over his two daughters,and,following allegations he had sexually molested their,and.at the time,smith was divorced from and mother,but had retained custody.
under oklahoma law,proceedings are designed to establish the status of children and their parents.in particular,the proceedings answer whether a child is deprived and whether the parents should retain the right to care for them.oklahoma defines a deprived child as destitute,homeless or abandoned lacking proper parental care or guardianship or living in an unfit place by reason of neglect,cruelty,or depravity.stat.tit,a,b.if the child is found to be deprived and an aggravating factor is present,parental rights may be terminated,a.one aggravating factor is a finding the parent has physically or sexually abused the child or the child sibling in a manner that is heinous or shocking to the court or that caused severe harm or injury to the child,a.
the action against smith went to trial in juvenile court on january.the state called five witnesses,a police detective,a social worker,and a nurse practitioner.the thrust of the state case was smith had sexually abused and while they were under his care.the state sought a jury verdict that and were deprived children and should be removed from smith custody.smith testified in his defense,claiming had previously alleged he abused her,only to later recant.he also said he thought had been coached to give certain testimony by her mother,smith.
during deliberations,the jury sent two notes to the judge.the first asked,if we feel that was abused,but not by kip smith,should we still consider that and are deprived since kip smith has no control over transcript of proceedings,case no.dist.tulsa.the court told the jury to refer to the instructions it had already issued the jury second note to the judge read,we are close.please reaffirm the following.if we say the children are deprived,are we in any way implicating kip smith in sexual abuse and altering his parental rights or are we only moving on to possibly more evidence regarding his actual actions id.the court responded to this note by again referring the jury to the instructions.
the jury then returned a general verdict finding that and were deprived.but the jury also answered no to four special interrogatories regarding sexual abuse since the jury found smith conduct did not match the allegations in the interrogatories despite a general verdict that the children were deprived,the court did not reach the issue of whether smith parental rights should be immediately terminated.as the court explained to the jury 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,you reached a verdict finding that the two minor children in this case were deprived children.you,also,came to the conclusion that based on the evidence presented at trial,that they were not deprived based on sexual or physical abuse of a shocking and heinous nature.that is one of the requirements under the law in order for the state of oklahoma to proceed with immediate termination,which would have been the second part of this trial.based on your answers to those questions,the state of oklahoma is not going to be able to proceed with immediate termination.
transcript of proceedings,case no.dist.tulsa.nevertheless,the finding allowed the court to terminate,at a later time,smith parental rights if the court subsequently found termination was in the best interests of the children.ultimately,the court made this determination and awarded sole custody of and to their natural mother.
while this civil action was pending,prosecutors charged smith with criminal child sexual abuse of in violation of.stat.tit,several months later,after the action had concluded,the state was ready to begin the criminal trial.smith moved to dismiss the charges against him based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel.he argued the civil court jury had found he did not sexually abuse and,therefore,the state was barred from proceeding with its criminal case.
the criminal court denied the motion,concluding that the ultimate facts in the case were different than those in the criminal case.in the criminal proceeding,the state was not required to prove smith sexually abused in a manner that was shocking and heinous or that caused her severe harm or injury,as had been the case in the deprivation action.rather,it had to prove only that smith had sexually abused further proof of aggravating factors.a jury trial began on march,and smith was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.
smith appealed his sentence directly to the occa.in rejecting his collateral estoppel argument,the occa agreed with the trial court that the two proceedings sought to prove different ultimate facts.smith,at.the occa determined the special interrogatories permitted a finding that smith had sexually abused in a manner that was not shocking and heinous and did not cause severe harm or injury to the child.id.at.one judge dissented,arguing every act of child sexual abuse was heinous and shocking and necessarily caused severe harm or injury.id.at.

ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.relief is permissible only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.see generally maynard boone,cir.
for a decision to be contrary to clearly established federal law,
a petitioner could show that the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or that the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from their precedent.
maynard,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.for a decision to involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,a petitioner must show the state court application of federal law was objectively unreasonable,which means most reasonable jurists exercising their independent judgment would conclude the state court misapplied supreme court law.id.at.it is not enough that the decision is clearly wrong or that the reviewing court would have reached a contrary decision t he state court decision must be at such tension with governing supreme court precedents,or so inadequately supported by
