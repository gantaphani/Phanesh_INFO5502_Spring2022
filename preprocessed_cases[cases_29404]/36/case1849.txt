background 
catherine filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in july.the circuit court granted catherine custody of the parties child,subject to michael reasonable visitation,and ordered michael to pay per month in child support,as well as to maintain medical insurance for the child and pay his tuition and fees for a parochial school education.the court also divided the marital assets,the largest of which was a personal injury settlement resulting from an incident in which michael was shot and permanently paralyzed from the chest down.the settlement consisted of a lump sum payment and guaranteed annual future payments.the court awarded catherine the marital residence and a lump sum of,but awarded all future payments under the settlement to michael as marital property.catherine appealed,and the appellate court affirmed the circuit court order of dissolution.in re marriage of murphy,d.
in january catherine filed a motion to modify child support,alleging michael salary had increased.in november the court entered an order increasing michael child support obligation to per month,retroactive to january.catherine appealed this order,arguing that the trial court had erred by failing to award her attorney fees,and in its modification of the child support obligation.the latter contention actually was comprised of three specific alleged errors in the circuit court treatment of the case a the conclusion that the law of the case doctrine precluded the court from considering the annuity payments as part of michael net income for purposes of setting child support b the court downward departure from the statutory child support guidelines and c the court decision to make the modification retroactive only to january.the appellate court held that the circuit court erred in departing downward from the statutory guidelines and reversed and remanded on this issue,but affirmed the circuit court in all other respects.in re marriage of murphy,d,unpublished order under supreme court rule.
in september,catherine filed a motion requesting that michael reimburse her for attorney fees she incurred in prosecuting her appeal of the november order.in the motion,she contended that she engaged counsel for purposes of the appeal she successfully argued that the downward deviation was erroneous her income was significantly below michael michael was unrepresented on appeal and the amount her counsel charged was reasonable and customary for the preparation and argument of an appeal.the motion also stated that a multipage exhibit attached to the motion showed the time expended by counsel and his rate and expenses for the preparation and argument on the appeal.that attachment consists of an apparently timesheet,with an anonymous handwritten notation on the first page which states fees expenses incurred.
michael argued before the circuit court that catherine had prevailed only in minor part in her appeal,and further argued that catherine was well able to pay her own fees,in light of her net worth of approximately.he also noted that in the appeal of the november order the appellate court had rejected catherine argument that the circuit court had erred in failing to award her attorney fees for the prior circuit court litigation.he contended that catherine had alleged no change in circumstances since the entry of the appellate court order which might impact on the parties abilities to pay their own attorney fees.
in october,the circuit court held a hearing on this motion as well as catherine motion to implement the mandate of the appellate court.the following is the only testimony adduced regarding the motion for attorney fees 
state your name.
catherine madonia.
and now,miss madonia,when you prosecuted the appeal,did you incur attorney fees 
and have you paid those attorney fees 
no.i paid some of them,part of them.not all of them.
and you entered into an agreement with me for an hourly rate as set forth in our motion 
michael argued again at the hearing and in a motion that any award of attorney fees to catherine would be inappropriate because catherine had only prevailed in minor part in the prior appeal,and she had shown no change in her financial circumstances since the last hearing on attorney fees,when the court declined to award fees to catherine.at the hearing,counsel for catherine replied that this is a or case sic,presumably referring to and where you have to be the prevailing party.either party may seek to have the other party pay based upon the income,not based upon their assets.
the circuit court took the motion under advisement,and ultimately awarded catherine in attorney fees.no written order appears in the record,but the court docket entry states with respect to this issue that upon consideration of all relevant statutory factors,the court awards counsel for catherine the sum of for fees on appeal.
michael appealed,and the appellate court reversed,with one justice dissenting.d.the court reached only michael first argument,that catherine had not substantially prevailed in her earlier appeal.the court noted that interpretation of the phrase was a matter of first impression.after looking to other illinois statutes as well as federal law,the court demurred from issuing a definitive pronouncement as to what it would mean for a party to substantially prevail,but stated that whatever it means,catherine did not substantially prevail on her appeal.the court stated that the issue on which catherine obtained relief made only a relatively minor monetary difference,as compared to the relief potentially available if catherine had prevailed on the other issues she had raised.the court averred that its determination was not based merely on the numerical fact that she had prevailed on only one of the four issues she raised on appeal.however,the court went on to state that to substantially prevail did suggest that one has to obtain at least of the relief she seeks.
the dissent noted that section a of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act was added in,as part of a complete overhaul of the fee provisions of the act,intended to achieve substantial parity in parties access to funds for litigation costs.d at,cook,dissenting,quoting ilcs west.the dissent criticized the majority requirement that there be an overwhelming victory before attorney fees can be awarded as contrary to the spirit of the amendments,which sought to prevent the situation where an economically disadvantaged spouse is forced to cave in to a truly unfair settlement.the dissent contended that the majority new rule,that one has to obtain at least of the relief she seeks before attorney fees may be awarded was without support in the statute or case law and further was objectionable in that 
if a party has a legitimate basis for appeal we should not attempt to discourage that party from raising other issues as well,even though the party thereby risks obtaining less than of the relief sought.the appellate court should attempt to provide guidance on troublesome issues,not penalize parties for raising issues other than sure winners.d at,cook,dissenting.
finally,the dissent noted that the trial court determination regarding fees was entitled to deference and should not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.the dissent closed with the following observation 
the argument could be made that this court is as as the trial court to determine whether a party has substantially prevailed on appeal.however,we hav
