vi.additional reunification 
in july,the department reported there had been problems with the icpc evaluation of appellant home.
jacob and jeremy told the social worker they both wanted to visit appellant and spend the summer with her and would likely want to begin living with her.the department recommended a summer visit be authorized from august to september both boys were required to attend summer school.the court authorized the recommended visit.
in october,the department reported jacob and jeremy remained placed with their grandmother and the placement was stable.the boys were attending the same schools as before.jacob had been diagnosed with adhd and depression and was taking medication and attending therapy.jeremy was diagnosed as and was scheduled to begin individual counseling.
the summer visit had been successful both boys were excited to see appellant,liked her neighborhood and apartment,which had a room for them,and liked appellant friends and.immediately after the visit,jacob and jeremy stated they were looking forward to living with appellant soon.appellant was also excited about jacob and jeremy moving to colorado to live with her.in september,although jeremy said he still wanted to live with appellant,jacob expressed some reservations because he was not sure he wanted to leave his friends and family behind.the department recommended a continuance because appellant icpc evaluation was still pending final approval.
the court continued what it identified as a section review hearing to december.
in an addendum report,the department stated appellant icpc evaluation had been approved.when interviewed in september,october and november,jeremy remained consistent about wanting to live with appellant.in september,jacob stated he was unsure about wanting to live with appellant.in october and november,jacob stated he did not want to live with appellant because he did not want to leave his friends and family in california and because colorado was boring.jacob also stated he enjoyed the visits with appellant and felt safe with her.appellant stated she understood jacob wishes,but she did not believe it was a good reason not to be reunified with her because he would make new friends after the move and could visit family in california during vacations.the department agreed with appellant and recommended the court return jacob and jeremy to appellant custody.
appellant appeared at the december hearing.the court ordered jeremy placed with appellant under department supervision.at counsel request,the court set the hearing as to jacob for contest and continued it to january.the court stated it recognized that in order not to return jacob to appellant custody,it would have to find a substantial risk of detriment and informed counsel it was his burden of proof to show detriment.the court ordered jacob was allowed a holiday visit with appellant as worked out with the grandmother.
in january,children counsel asked to be relieved as to jeremy and new counsel was appointed to represent him.the court continued jacob contested hearing until february.the court noted,the issue is is there a risk to jacob to his mother.the issue is not what jacob,who is,wants.it is there a risk.that what has to be shown.otherwise the child will be returned to the mother.
on february,the court conducted the contested hearing.appellant was not present but was represented by counsel.the court announced all right.the matter is here for a hearing.the issue is whether jacob should return to his mother in colorado.the hearing was conducted by argument.
jacob counsel informed the court that jacob had told her he wanted to remain with his legal guardian,his grandmother,and his family in california.counsel argued that removing jacob from his grandmother would create a substantial risk of detriment to his emotional because jacob was bonded to his grandparents,had stability from family and friends,relied on his school counselors and psychiatrist,and his special needs were being met in california.counsel further argued that even though appellant was in compliance with her reunification plan,the totality of the facts showed that jacob should not be returned to appellant because she had abused and neglected him and he remembered it.
appellant argued via counsel she had worked very hard to turn her life around.appellant home had been approved by an icpc evaluation and she was aware of jacob special needs.jacob twin brother was in her care and the twins should be together.appellant understood jacob needed a relationship with his family,including his grandmother,and appellant intended to support continuance of that relationship.appellant argued that jacob wanting to remain in california was not a showing of a substantial risk of harm and requested he be immediately released to her.county counsel argued appellant had made a lot of effort to have jacob returned to her custody and the department was recommending his return.
the court opined,well,you know,there actually two things going on here.we have for the mother.but the child is in a legal guardianship.and for me to terminate that legal guardianship,i would have to proceed under i have to make findings of a substantial change of circumstances and what in the minors best interests.the court found appellant had accomplished a great deal and it could not make a finding that there a risk.the court noted it had granted appellant additional reunifications services after jacob had been in a permanent plan,but it did not terminate the guardianship.proceeding under the section standard,the court found the circumstances had changed,but it was not in jacob best interest to terminate the guardianship because of his expressed concerns and desires,which the court described as significant.the court found there was a continuing necessity for the current placement,terminated appellant reunification services,and ordered reasonable visitation for appellant and jacob.
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.
discussion 
i.the court applied the proper standard in determining whether to return jacob to appellant.
in ruling on appellant section petition,the court first granted appellant additional reunification services and basically indicated it would consider terminating the guardianship depending on the outcome.at a review hearing,after receiving proof appellant had complied with her case plan,the court ordered an icpc evaluation of appellant home and subsequently permitted the twins to have a one month summer visit with appellant in colorado.after the visit was successful,at another review hearing,the court addressed whether or not the twins should be returned to appellant custody.
with respect to jeremy,the court terminated its july placement order,placed him with appellant under a family maintenance plan,and set a review hearing pursuant to section.however,at jacob request,the court continued the hearing as to him for a contest.initially,the court indicated the issue was whether there was a risk in returning jacob to appellant,not what he wanted.subsequently,the court stated that to terminate the guardianship it would have to proceed under section.the court found there was no risk to jacob but determined it was not in his best interest to terminate the guardianship,place him with appellant.appellant opines that the proper procedure to follow was the one used with respect to jeremy.
appellant contends that once a parent of a child with a permanent plan of legal guardianship has a section petition for additional reunification services granted and has satisfactorily completed those services,when deciding whether the child should be returned to the parent custody,the court should apply the plan presumption of return set forth in sections and rather than the best interest standard of section.
at the dispositional hearing,and at each review hearing prior to permanency planning,there is a statutory presumption that the child will be returned to parental custody at,and review hearings the juvenile court must return the child to the custody of the parent unless it determines,by a preponderance of the evidence,that return of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the chil
