charles john myers appeals from multiple orders arising out of his attempt to set aside a default judgment establishing his parentage and ordering him to pay child support and retroactive support an order denying his request to set aside the default judgment and related orders,an order denying his motion for reconsideration of the first order,an order denying his motion to disqualify the commissioner who signed the first and second orders,and an order denying another motion to disqualify the commissioner and a motion for injunctive relief requesting that the court stop the collection of money until the case is resolved.myers arguments on appeal are the orders he appeals from are void due to bias on the part of the commissioner,he was not properly served in the underlying lawsuit because the process server made fraudulent statements in the proof of service and therefore myers motion to set aside the default judgment was not because he has established extrinsic fraud,the judge who signed the default judgment should have been disqualified,and myers was entitled to avail himself of a conclusive presumption under former evidence code section that he was not the father of the minor child.we affirm.the rulings on myers statutory motions to disqualify the commissioner are not appealable orders.to the extent he raises a due process challenge to the impartiality of the commissioner,we reject it.further,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to vacate the default judgment because he did not establish any grounds for invoking the court equitable power to vacate the judgment.myers did not demonstrate extrinsic fraud,or even that the judgment was void because of invalid substitute service or judicial disqualification.because we affirm the trial court denial of myers motion to set aside the default judgment,we need not address myers remaining contention regarding the applicability of former evidence code section.
background 
on may,the yolo county department of child support services dcss filed a summons and complaint to establish paternity,child support,retroactive support and the provision of medical insurance for a minor child against myers.a few weeks earlier,the united states postal service had verified for dcss that myers address was vienna avenue,carmichael,california carmichael address.a process server unsuccessfully attempted to personally serve myers on may and,at this address.on may,the process server effectuated substitute service on myers father at the carmichael address.three days later,myers met with an attorney to discuss whether service was proper.
myers did not answer the complaint and dcss obtained a default judgment that was filed on september,signed and ordered by judge stevens.myers did make subsequent appearances in the case.on september,myers appeared on his own behalf at a hearing on dcss motion to modify child support.on november,myers filed a motion to modify custody,visitation and child support.myers appeared at the hearing,again on his own behalf.
order denying myers request to vacate default judgment 
on august,myers filed a request to vacate the default judgment and all related orders,for return of all money collected with interest since september,for compensatory damages,for a letter to clear the debt from his credit report,and for a return of all fees and costs.the matter was heard before commissioner umanzio,sitting as judge pro tem.the trial court denied the request.the court order denying the request began by noting that myers agreed to have the matter heard before a commissioner.the court found that myers had produced insufficient evidence to establish that the original service was defective defendant statement that he was not living at the service address is and no evidence was provided to support it.and even if the service was defective,defendant subsequent actions have established the court jurisdiction in this matter and a request to set aside should have been made much sooner than the current request.the trial court also found that myers was estopped from objecting to service.
the trial court rejected myers argument that the default judgment was void because judge stevens should have disqualified himself.the court held that,even if judge stevens should have disqualified himself,he was still permitted to sign the default judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the court also found that myers was aware of this issue upon receiving a copy of the default judgment and never raised the issue until years later.
order denying myers motion to reconsider 
on october,myers filed a motion to reconsider the order denying his request to vacate the default judgment.myers attached exhibits to support his claim that he lived at a fair oaks address,not the carmichael address,at the time the summons and complaint were served.the trial court denied the motion because it did not specify any new or different facts,circumstances or law as required by code of civil procedure section.the court also reviewed myers response to dcss motion to modify child support in defendant did appear at that hearing,asked for visitation,said he did not consent to county request but was willing to pay.defendant also asked that the child be given the last name of myers.court also noted that in his response,defendant stated he was served with the county action.italics added.the order denying his request for reconsideration was issued by commissioner umanzio.
order denying myers request to disqualify the commissioner 
on november,myers filed a motion to disqualify commisioner umanzio.myers argued that commissioner umanzio should recuse himself because of the appearance of bias and prejudice.myers also alleged that the commissioner violated the code of judicial ethics,california trial rules,and the state and federal constitutions without specifying how the violations occurred.
commissioner umanzio issued an order denying the motion to disqualify,stating that he disputed all statements in the motion to disqualify and had no bias or prejudice in the matter.additionally,the commissioner noted he had previously decided contested matters of law and fact and had done so as a commissioner sitting as a temporary judge pursuant to family code section.
order denying myers request for injunctive relief and second motion to disqualify the commissioner 
on november,myers filed a motion for injunctive relief.he requested that the court restrain dcss from further collection of money and halt all garnishments until the matter was resolved.myers also asked the court to restrain dcss from calling him.at the hearing,myers made an oral motion to disqualify commissioner umanzio pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and.myers argued that the commissioner had demonstrated bias and had prior knowledge of the case from the hearings.myers also asserted that dcss lacked standing.the court denied the request to disqualify because there were no grounds and the request was untimely.as to the motion for injunctive relief,the court denied it and found dcss had standing because the mother had previously requested services and myers is the proper judgment debtor.
ii.discussion 
equitable authority to vacate default judgments 
myers did not seek relief pursuant to any particular statutory scheme and,on appeal,he relies entirely on gorham,supra,th and large excerpts therefrom as the basis for his assertion that the default judgment should have been set aside.he thus invokes the trial court equitable authority to vacate the default judgment as laid out in gorham.
because of the strong public policy in favor of the finality of judgments,equitable relief from a default judgment or order is available only in exceptional circumstances.citation we review the court denial of a motion for equitable relief to vacate a default judgment or order for an abuse of discretion,determining whether that decision exceeded the bounds of reason in light of the circumstances before the court.citation.in doing so,we determine whether the trial court factual findings are supported by substantial evidence citation and independently review its statutory interpretations
