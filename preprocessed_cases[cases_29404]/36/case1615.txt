christina the minor appeals from a juvenile court order adjudging her a dependent child and setting a status review hearing.welf,further section references are to this code unless otherwise specified.
her claim of error involves the timing of the review hearing after a dependent child under the age of three has been removed from parental custody and reunification services have been ordered,subd.a,subd.e.unfortunately,the applicable statutory language appears to lack consistency as a result of amendments made in 
section,subdivision e refers to the review hearing being held six months after the initial dispositional hearing italics added see also,subd.a the status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed no less frequently than once every six months,as calculated from the date of the original dispositional hearing,italics added.
but in section,subdivision a,the legislature has provided that,for a child who was under the age of three when the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent,services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care,from the earlier of the date of the jurisdictional hearing or the date that is days after the date on which the child was initially removed from the physical custody of his or her parent,subd.a,italics added.
although section,subdivision a speaks to the duration of services,it suggests a review hearing should be held no later than the date on which services must end,six months after the jurisdictional hearing,or earlier if the jurisdictional hearing was held over days after the child initially was removed from parental custody.otherwise,there would be needless delay between the end of services and the juvenile court review of the effectiveness of those services in order to determine whether the child should be returned to parental custody.
construing these statutes in light of the purpose of the amendments enacted in was to minimize delay in juvenile dependency proceedings and reduce the time that dependent children stay in temporary in view of section,subdivision a which contemplates that a review hearing may occur prior to six months from the date of the initial dispositional agree with the minor that the review hearing in her case should have been scheduled no later than six months from the date of the jurisdictional hearing rather than six months from the date of the dispositional hearing.
nevertheless,because the date of the review hearing has come and gone while this appeal was pending,we can not provide any meaningful relief.accordingly,we shall affirm the juvenile court order.
facts and procedural background 
after the minor was removed from parental custody on february,based on allegations of physical abuse and neglect by her mother,the sacramento county department of health and human services dhhs filed a petition alleging that the minor came within the provisions of section.
a detention hearing occurred on february,at which the juvenile court ordered dhhs to place the minor in temporary foster care.
at the jurisdictional hearing on march,the court found that the minor had suffered serious physical harm due to unreasonable acts or omissions by her mother and the mother psychiatric problems and substance abuse,subds.a,b.suspecting that the mother might have a mental disability which rendered her incapable of utilizing services,subd.b,the court continued the disposition hearing to allow dhhs to obtain two psychological evaluations of the mother.
when the mother failed to submit to two evaluations,the court proceeded with the dispositional hearing on july,adjudicated the minor a dependent child,found that it would be detrimental to the minor to return her to parental custody,and ordered dhhs to provide reunification services to the minor mother.
over objection by the minor counsel,the court scheduled the review hearing,subd.e for january.citing section,subdivision a,the minor counsel argued the review hearing should have been set within six months of the jurisdictional hearing,in september.
discussion 
we begin by deciding whether this appeal should be dismissed as moot.the date set for the review hearing passed soon after the appellate briefing was completed consequently,we are unable to provide the minor with the relief she seeks.
as a general rule,appellate courts decide only actual controversies.thus,it has been said that an action which originally was based upon a justiciable controversy can not be maintained on appeal if the questions raised therein have become moot by subsequent acts or events.finnie town of tiburon d.
an exception to this rule exists where the question to be decided is of continuing public importance and is one capable of repetition,yet evading review.superior court,d,state of cal.ex rel.state lands com.superior court cal th,d.accordingly,if a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur,the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.in re william cal d,accord,lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d.
this is such a case.the appropriate timing for the review hearing at issue in this case is a question likely to recur in other cases and involves an issue of broad public interest because it affects both reunification of families and permanent plans for dependent children.as in this case,due to the expedited nature of dependency proceedings,appellate courts may be unable to obtain the appellate record and briefing by the parties in time to decide this important issue before it becomes moot in a particular case.see,renee superior court th,d in re michelle th,d.therefore,we exercise our discretion to decide the issue.
prior to,section,subdivision a stated that,when a dependent child was removed from parental custody,services to facilitate reunification should be provided to parents for a period not to exceed six months if the child was under the age of three when initially removed from parental custody,or not to exceed months if the child was three years of age or older when initially removed from parental custody.the statute further provided that services could be extended up to a maximum time period not to exceed months if it can be shown that the objectives of the service plan can be achieved within the extended time period.stats,ch,see also stats,ch,ch,ch,ch.
because no other time limitations appeared in the statutes for such children,the assumption and practice was that the services described in former section commenced from the date of the initial dispositional hearing.a review hearing was scheduled at six months from the initial dispositional hearing to assess the parent progress toward reunification and determine whether the child should be returned to parental custody,subd.a the status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed periodically as determined by the court but no less frequently than once every six months,as calculated from the date of the original dispositional hearing former,subds.e,f.
