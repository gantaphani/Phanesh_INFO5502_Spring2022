section of the code of civil provides that a wrongful death action may be brought by a decedent putative spouse if he or she was dependent on the decedent,subd.b.the statute defines a putative spouse as the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the decedent was valid.ibid.italics added.in question here is the meaning of the phrase in italics.is the good faith inquiry a purely subjective one,or does the inquiry also require application of an objective test 
we conclude section contemplates a subjective standard that focuses on the alleged putative spouse state of mind to determine whether he or she maintained a genuine and honest belief in the validity of the marriage.good faith must be judged on a basis in light of all the relevant facts,such as the efforts made to create a valid marriage,the alleged putative spouse background and experience,and the circumstances surrounding the marriage,including any objective evidence of the marriage invalidity.under this standard,the reasonableness of the claimed belief is a factor properly considered along with all other circumstances in assessing the genuineness of that belief.the good faith inquiry,however,does not call for application of a reasonable person test,and a belief in the validity of a marriage need not be objectively reasonable.
factual and procedural background 
on september,robert ceja decedent was killed in an accident at a construction site.nancy ceja plaintiff filed this wrongful death action against rudolph sletten,defendant,claiming she was the putative spouse of decedent,subd.b.defendant filed an answer alleging multiple affirmative defenses,including one challenging plaintiff standing to bring this action as a putative spouse.the parties engaged in discovery,which produced the following evidence.
decedent and christina were wed in.when decedent met plaintiff in,he told plaintiff he was married but separated.in,decedent filed a petition for dissolution of his marriage to christina,and he started living with plaintiff.
in september,plaintiff and decedent filled out a license and certificate of marriage.the completed document was marked in the space for listing decedent number of previous marriages and was left blank in two other spaces asking how and when any previous marriage had been terminated.despite knowing of decedent marriage to christina,plaintiff signed the affidavit box in the document indicating its contents were correct and true to the best of our knowledge and belief.a license to marry was issued to plaintiff and decedent on september.
it turns out decedent was still married to christina when he and plaintiff held their wedding ceremony three days later,on september.on december,the santa clara county superior court filed a notice of entry of judgment and mailed it to the home of plaintiff and decedent.the notice stated that a judgment for dissolution of the marriage between decedent and christina had been entered on december,and that the judgment was effective as of the date the judgment was filed.the notice also contained a statement which appeared in a separate box and was printed in bold type warning that n either party may remarry until the effective date of the termination of marital status.in january,plaintiff faxed a copy of this court document to decedent ironworkers union so she could be added to decedent medical insurance.decedent fatal accident occurred over three years later.
as relevant here,defendant moved for summary judgment,contending plaintiff lacked standing to sue for wrongful death as a putative spouse because she did not have the requisite good faith belief that her marriage to decedent was valid.defendant motion was based on the following undisputed material facts plaintiff and decedent were married before the dissolution of his marriage to christina became final,rendering decedent marriage to plaintiff bigamous and void although plaintiff knew of decedent previous marriage,she signed a marriage license in which decedent falsely represented he had not been married before and the court document plaintiff faxed to decedent union clearly indicated his marriage to christina was not dissolved until after his wedding with plaintiff.
in opposing the motion,plaintiff argued there were triable issues of material fact regarding her status as a putative spouse.she submitted a declaration claiming,among other things,that she understood decedent had filed for divorce in but that she did not know what happened after that because decedent would never discuss the subject.plaintiff did not read the marriage certificate in any detail and simply signed the document.she recalled having subsequently faxed a copy of the final divorce papers to the ironworkers union to confirm decedent final dissolution of marriage,but she did not recall looking specifically at the papers before sending them.although plaintiff was unclear on the specific date of the dissolution,she absolutely knew decedent was divorced from christina at the time she faxed the court document and at the time of his accident.following their marriage ceremony,plaintiff held herself out as decedent wife to all persons at all times.she changed her last name to ceja,and the two of them wore wedding rings,shared a joint checking account,lived together in the same house as husband and wife,and handled their taxes as married but filing separately.plaintiff would not have had her wedding on september,had she not believed she would have a legal and valid marriage to decedent.had she realized at any time that her marriage was invalid,she and decedent would have simply redone the ceremony.
the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment.consistent with in re marriage of vryonis d vryonis,the court applied an objective test for putative spouse status and found the undisputed material facts established that plaintiff did not have an objectively reasonable good faith belief in the validity of her marriage to decedent.
the court of appeal reversed.disagreeing with vryonis objective approach,the court held section requirement of a good faith belief refers to the alleged putative spouse subjective state of mind.in the court view,plaintiff claims that she believed and acted as if her marriage were valid and that she had not read the marriage license or the final divorce papers,if found credible by the trial court,could support a finding of a good faith belief and establish putative spouse status.
we granted defendant petition for review.
discussion 
in california,wrongful death actions are statutory in origin and exist only so far and in favor of such person as the legislative power may declare.justus atchison cal d.under the current statute,those who may sue for a person wrongful death are limited to the decedent spouse,domestic partner,children,and other enumerated heirs,subd.a,the decedent dependent putative spouse,children of the putative spouse,stepchildren,and parents,subd.b,and the decedent minor dependents in certain circumstances,subd.c.the purpose of this standing requirement is to enable the heirs and certain specified dependents of a person wrongfully killed to recover compensation for the economic loss and deprivation of consortium they suffer as a result of the death.people giordano cal th,italics omitted.a trial court finding regarding putative spouse status will be upheld on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.vallera vallera cal d,estate of goldberg d,goldberg.

section b defines putative spouse to mean the surviving spouse of a void or voidable marriage who is found by the court to have believed in good faith that the marriage to the decedent was valid.the dispute here centers on the meaning of the statutory phrase believed in good faith.
plaintiff,like the court of appeal below,construes the phrase as referring solely to subjective good faith,the court need only find the alleged putative spouse held an honest,genuine,and sincere belief in the validity of the marriage.defendant,like the trial court,asserts the party belief must also be objectively reasonable.for the reasons below,we conclude that the good faith inquiry is purely subjective and evaluates the state of mind of the alleged putative spouse,and that the reasonableness of the claimed belief is properly considered as part of the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the belief was genuinely and honestly held.
a.the subjective nature of the good faith inquiry 
in ordinary usage,the phrase good faith is commonly understood as referring to a subjective state of mind.see cotran rollins hudig hall,cal th,fn.lay dictionaries,for example,equate good faith with sincerity and honesty.webster new internat.dict,a state of mind indicating honesty and lawfulness of purpose or absence of fraud,deceit,collusion,or gross negligence random house webster college dict,accordance with standards of honesty,trust,sincerity,oxford english dict.ed,honesty of intention in entering into engagements,sincerity in professions.in people nunn cal d,our court explained that good faith is ordinarily used to describe that state of mind denoting honesty of purpose,freedom from intention to defraud,and,generally speaking,means being faithful to one duty or obligation.see efron kalmanovitz d.
there appears nothing about a purely subjective standard that renders section illogical or unworkable in operation.depending on the context,however,good faith may also describe an objective standard requiring a reasonable basis,or alternatively,a standard combining both subjective and objective components.see cotran rollins hudig hall,supra,cal th at,fn,fei enterprises,yoon th,statute precluding payment penalties in good faith contractor disputes brasher cascade auto auction valley auto sales leasing th,good faith requirement city of oakland workers comp.appeals bd.th,good faith personnel action exemption in statute governing psychiatric injury claims.
here,the appropriate context for understanding the phrase as it appears in section b is furnished by the judicially developed putative spouse doctrine.as both parties acknowledge,the wrongful death statute did not include an explicit provision for putative spouses until former,as amended by stats,ch,see stats,ch.but long before any california statute first made reference to putative spouses,our courts began developing the putative spouse concept as a means for enabling a party to an invalid marriage to enjoy certain of the civil benefits of marriage if he or she believed in good faith that the marriage was valid.e,figoni figoni cal,schneider.schneider cal,coats coats cal,kunakoff woods d,wrongful death.
when the predecessor to section was amended in to include putative spouses,the legislature used language nearly identical to the language adopted in as part of the former family law act compare code civ,former with,former,added by stats,ch.because codification of the putative spouse doctrine was not meant to restrict the doctrine application vryonis,supra,d at in re marriage of monti cal.app d,precodification case law provides the key to ascertaining the legislature intent.
under precodification case law,the good faith inquiry focused exclusively on the state of mind of the alleged putative spouse.the subjective nature of the inquiry was demonstrated by the judicially recognized purpose of the putative spouse doctrine the types of factors deemed relevant to the inquiry and judicial review of postmarriage conduct.we address these matters in turn.
our court made clear from the beginning that the fundamental purpose of the putative spouse doctrine was to protect the expectations of innocent parties and to achieve results that are equitable,fair,and just,schneider schneider,supra,cal.at coats coats,supra,cal.at see pack vartanian d,accord,in re marriage of guo sun th.to effectuate this purpose,courts applied the doctrine only when the alleged putative spouse belief in the validity of a marriage was found to have been genuine vallera vallera,supra,cal d at,bona fide flanagan capital nat.bank cal,flanagan italics omitted,or honestly held sutton sutton d,turknette turknette d.by recognizing putative spouse status in cases of genuine,bona fide,or honestly held beliefs,courts adhered to the commonly understood meaning of good faith,a state of mind denoting honesty of purpose and freedom from intention to defraud.webster new internat,supra,random house webster college,supra,oxford english,supra.
in evaluating a party state of mind courts considered whether efforts were made to create a valid marriage and whether the party was ignorant of the infirmity rendering the marriage void or voidable.estate of krone d,see vallera vallera,supra,cal d at flanagan,supra,cal.at.good faith was a question of fact that depended on all the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the invalid marriage,and a party state of mind when entering the marriage was key.goldberg,supra,d at e,brown brown d,sancha arnold d,estate of foy d.however,a party who married in good faith could lose putative spouse status as of the date the marriage infirmity was discovered.see gallaher state teachers retirement system d,estate of raynor d,lazzarevich lazzarevich d.
courts assessed a party efforts to create a valid marriage by looking to the extent of compliance with the legal requisites of a marriage.in determining what inference to draw from a party efforts or lack thereof,courts deemed it appropriate to consider the party personal circumstances.for example,lack of personal familiarity and experience with marriage could support a good faith claim where the marriage was not solemnized,temescal rock industrial acc.com.cal.santos santos d parties did not solemnize marriage because they thought obtaining a license was sufficient macchi.la rocca.same.conversely,the circumstance that a plaintiff lived all her life in california,and had been previously legally married and divorced,was found to undermine a good faith claim where personal vows were exchanged but n o license was procured and no solemnization was had.flanagan,supra,cal.at.
other factors personal to a party,such as age and educational background,also appeared relevant to the good faith inquiry,kunakoff woods,supra,d at fn.although parties stipulated to plaintiff putative wife status,court noted she went to grammar school until she was and was years old when she attempted to marry in a molokan religious ceremony neureither workmen.bd.d,where petitioner had education but secured annulment in cal.of previous marriage,referee erred in holding her accountable for knowledge of law.
where,as here,a bigamous marriage was involved,the relevant circumstances included the party personal marital experiences,as well as what the party knew or was told regarding the prior marriage and its supposed termination.in this regard,prior marriage and divorce experience was not a per se bar to a good faith finding.e,brennfleck workmen comp.appeals bd.d,goldberg,supra,d at.such experience,however,could either support or undercut a good faith claim,depending on the totality of the circumstances.good faith could be found if the bigamist,or someone else claiming authoritative factual or legal knowledge,told the prospective spouse that
