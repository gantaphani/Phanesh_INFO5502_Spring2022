gabriela vernoff vernoff,on her own behalf and on behalf of her minor child brandalynn vernoff brandalynn,appeals the district court summary judgment in favor of the commissioner of the social security administration ssa denial of her claim for child survivor benefits.the ssa determined that brandalynn did not meet the eligibility requirements because she could not establish that she was dependent upon the deceased insured at the time of his death under california law,due to her posthumous conception.vernoff also appeals the district court denial of her claim that the ssa exclusion of certain children violates the equal protection clause.we affirm.
background 
vernoff and the insured,bruce vernoff,were married for five years when bruce died of accidental causes in july.shortly after his death,vernoff directed a physician to extract five vials of bruce semen.the couple had no children,and there is no evidence to suggest that bruce consented to the procedure or had ever contemplated having a child postmortem.in june,vernoff underwent in vitro fertilization using bruce sperm and brandalynn was born march.
in october,vernoff filed her initial claim for child survivor benefits with the social security administration,on behalf of both brandalynn and herself,as the mother of a surviving child.her claim was denied both by the ssa and on appeal before an administrative law judge alj before she appealed to the district court.while her appeal was pending,this court decided barnhart,cir,and the ssa subsequently issued an acquiescence ruling to the decision on september.see social security acquiescence ruling ssar.the district court remanded the case to the ssa for further proceedings in light of the two decisions.the ssa reaffirmed its final decision in december,and the district court affirmed the decision in.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to uphold the ssa denial of benefits.see mayes massanari,cir.the agency final decision denying benefits must be affirmed unless the findings are based on legal error or are unsupported by substantial evidence.id.considerable weight must be given to the construction of the act adopted by the commissioner of the ssa,who has statutory authority to interpret and enforce the social security act act under a.see das dep t of health human,cir.
iii.discussion 
the decision 
in,we contemplated the act application to children for the first time.the case centered around twins conceived months after their father passing,at.their father,netting,delayed cancer treatment in order to deposit semen for later use by his wife.id.at.before he died,he confirmed that he wanted his wife to have their child using his frozen sperm.id.at.
we first noted that to receive benefits under the act,a claimant must show that he or she is a child,under the act and he or she was dependent on the insured wage earner at the time of his death.id.at citing d.we then interpreted the word child,for purposes of e,to mean the natural,or biological,child of the insured.id.in doing so,this court held that,contrary to the ssa interpretation,a child did not also have to satisfy the terms of h,demonstrating right to take through intestacy laws of the state and other means of establishing paternity where parentage was not disputed.id.at.
we next examined the dependency requirement of d.the act does not require proof of actual dependency for those children that are deemed dependent,through a determination either that they are the legitimate child of the insured under state law or a deemed legitimate child through compliance with h.see d applying arizona law,we held that the twins were the deemed dependents of netting because they were his legitimate children under state law,which recognizes e very child as the legitimate child of its natural parents,at quoting.netting was the natural parent of the twins,in turn,as the biological father of a child born using artificial insemination of his spouse.id.at citing.
the social security acquiescence ruling 
in the ssar,the ssa reaffirmed its interpretation of e that to meet the act definition of child for purposes of e a child must also demonstrate a sufficient connection to the insured through compliance with h,but acquiesced to interpretation of e for the ninth circuit only.the ssar also reaffirmed that,in the usual circumstances,this means a child can only be deemed a legitimate child for dependency purposes,under d,if she has already first complied with h and shown that she is able to inherit through the intestacy laws of the state of the insured residence id.the ssar noted that in the ninth circuit,however,due to,the child must only be biologically related to the insured,and must only be the insured legitimate child under applicable state law to be deemed dependent for purposes of d.id.the ssar further explained,however,that the legitimacy distinction has been replaced in jurisdictions within the ninth circuit by a system of rights which flow between parents and their children,regardless of the parents marital status.id.in conclusion,the ssar stated that a child acquires these rights and thus is deemed both legitimate and dependent if he establishes that an individual is his parent under state family law provisions.id.emphasis added.
determining parentage under california law 
though our decision in and the ssa subsequent acquiescence ruling require brandalynn to be considered the insured child under the act because of her biological relationship to the insured,that determination does not end our inquiry.vernoff must also establish that brandalynn was dependent upon the insured at the time of his death,see d c ii,to be eligible for benefits.brandalynn has three methods of establishing dependency under d show actual dependency at the time of the insured death satisfy the requirements in the ninth circuit under the ssar and by establishing that the insured is her parent under california law provisions and that she is,therefore,deemed both legitimate and dependent or satisfy the requirements under h by establishing that she may inherit from the insured under the intestacy laws of california,and therefore,is deemed legitimate,see ssar.vernoff can not establish that brandalynn was actually dependent upon the insured at the time of his death,as brandalynn was not yet conceived,so she must rely on the other two methods of establishing deemed dependency.we first examine whether vernoff can establish that the insured is brandalynn natural father under california law.
as noted above,in we relied on arizona state law,which recognizes e very child as the legitimate child of its natural parents.at quoting,second alteration added.the ssar recognized that all jurisdictions within the ninth circuit,excepting guam,had similarly eliminated categorization of children based upon the marital status of their parents.therefore,following the approach taken in,the ssar instead required a claimant to establish that the insured was his or her parent under state law for the court in,this determination was based upon arizona recognition of biological parenthood as sufficient to establish natural parenthood,particularly for the biological father of a child born using artificial insemination of his spouse.at citing.
california has taken a different approach to resolving the problems posed by categorizing a child as legitimate or illegitimate.rather than deeming every child legitimate,as arizona has,california has instead chosen to replace the legitimacy determination with an alternate scheme which bases parent and child rights on the existence of a parent and child relationship rather than on the marital status of the parents.see johnson calvert,cal th,d.a parent and child relationship can be established only between a child and his natural or adoptive parent.see cal.
the primary means for a father in california to acquire rights as a natural father is through application of california family code.that section sets out several methods by which a father is presumed to be the natural parent of a child,including,most relevant to this case,if h e and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage or within days after the marriage is terminated by death a.because the vernoff marriage was terminated by death,and brandalynn was not born with days of the insured death the insured is not presumed to be her natural father under this provision.none of the other presumptions set forth in are applicable either,including if a man receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,d,or presumptions concerning situations in which both parents are cohabitating and there is a question as to the biological relationship,or where there is a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity,see,et and,et 
contrary to vernoff assertions,california law does not equate natural parent status with biological parenthood such that a mere biological relationship is sufficient under california law to grant status as a natural parent.the california supreme court has noted that t he paternity provisions are driven not by biological paternity,but by the state interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family.elisa superior,cal th,d,quoting in re salvador,th,d see also in re,th,d a biological father can be a presumed father,but is not necessarily one and a presumed father can be a biological father,but is not necessarily one.
this concept is illustrated by an examination of california family code and family law decisions.the presumed natural father section itself does not mention nor require a biological relationship between the father and the child.see.moreover,while of the california family code allows the presumption of to be rebutted with biological evidence,the rebuttal is only permissive,not required,and is only permitted where the biological relationship or lack thereof is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence.see elisa,cal th at,d,refusing to rebut the presumption of natural parenthood for lesbian mother following termination of the relationship with the biological mother.furthermore,and analogously,of the california family code deems the husband who has consented to his wife artificial insemination by another man biological gamete,to be the natural parent.section of the family code,too,does not rely on biological parenthood alone,as that section precludes rapists from acquiring natural father status.moreover,in in re jerry,th,d,a case vernoff cites to for the importance of biological parenthood,the court protected presumed natural parent rights for a man who was not biologically related to his son,observing that a s adults we must not forget what every child relationship is not spun from dna.id.at,d.
while vernoff is correct in asserting that is not the exclusive means of determining natural parent status,see,consenting husband natural father of child conceived through artificial insemination of his wife,vernoff has failed to establish that the insured qualifies as brandalynn natural father under any california family code provision.
california family code c,which allows vernoff to initiate a court action to establish paternity where there is no presumed father or the presumed father is deceased,is of little help to her.in any paternity action,a california state court would apply the same family code provisions to determine who is brandalynn natural father.none of those provisions contemplate this situation.the most analogous provision,b,excludes a sperm donor from status as a natural father.section a allows a husband to instead be treated as the natural father following artificial insemination of his wife,but only if he specifically consents to the artificial insemination.consent is lacking here.section f also allows for a paternity suit to be filed in cases of artificial insemination,but only to enforce the intent expressed in the assisted reproduction agreement.here,there is no agreement,or even evidence of the insured consent or intent.
the courts reliance on the decedent consent to the posthumous conception,as a basis for establishing natural parenthood,was central to the holdings in both and in woodward commissioner of social security,a case cited by both and vernoff.see woodward,at,noting inadequacy of a rule that would make the mere genetic tie of the decedent to any posthumously conceived child sufficient to establish the decedent as the legal father of any resulting child.consent,in turn,demonstrates a willingness to support the child and an intent to create the child.in,the court determined that the insured was the natural parent under arizona law because he was married to the children biological mother at the time he consented to the posthumous conception.see,at see also.b.both an intent to create and a willingness to support a child are relied upon regularly by california courts in determining whether an alleged parent should be considered a natural parent.see,elisa,cal th at,d,applying presumption to lesbian,mother because she actively participated in causing the children to be conceived with the understanding that she would raise the children as her own together with the birth mother in re jerry,th at,d protecting natural parent rights of parent who was indisputably ready,willing,and able to exercise the full measure of his parental responsibilities in re,th at,d see also cal,f.
vernoff has not persuasively argued that she would prevail in any suit filed under c,based only upon the undisputed biological relationship between the insured and brandalynn she has not provided any evidence of consent to the conception by the insured or his willingness to support brandalynn,as the biological mother was able to do in.therefore,brandalynn does not fall under the ninth circuit ruling in and the subsequent ssar,and is not deemed to be the insured legitimate child and deemed dependent for purposes of d.
determining intestate succession under california law 
vernoff third and final option to establish brandalynn as the insured deemed dependent is to establish that brandalynn can inherit from the insured estate pursuant to california intestacy law.see ssar.citing d,h.vernoff primary argument is that the ssa has not shown that brandalynn is excluded from california intestacy provisions.this argument misplaces the burden,which is on brandalynn to establish her eligibility.it also misconstrues the nature of intestacy law,which excludes from inheritance any person not specifically included.three primary provisions of the california probate code merit our consideration,and.
under,r elatives of the decedent conceived before the decedent death but born thereafter inherit as if they had been born in the lifetime of the decedent.vernoff attempts to construe this provision in her favor,as a provision extending rights to posthumous children.this argument fails,however,as children born posthumously,but conceived before death,and children are not similarly situated.as we discussed in relation to california family code a,see supra,this provision neither explicitly or impliedly includes children.section does not extend intestacy rights to children.finley astrue.
section of the california probate code defines natural parents for purposes of intestacy.the primary means of establishing a natural parent and child relationship,as in the family code,is through reliance on the unrebutted presumptions outlined in california family code.see a.natural parent status can also be established pursuant to an action permitted by c,but only if one of three limited conditions also exists.most relevant to this case is b,which allows a c action to establish paternity if i t was impossible for the father to hold out the child as his own and paternity is established by clear and convincing evidence.
vernoff argues that b is an alternative means of showing that the insured is brandalynn natural father.it is unclear,however,if the provision could be used in this situation.previously,courts have approved the impossibility argument only in situations where the alleged father died after the child was conceived but before it was born,see cheyanna nielsen,th,d,or where the child mother or a third party was physically preventing the father from holding the child out as his own,see in re jerry,th at,d.aft
