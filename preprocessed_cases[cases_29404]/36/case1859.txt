background 
formerly known as,was born at northwestern memorial hospital on june,to petitioner renee,the mother of the child.mother acknowledges relationships with three men at or near the time of the child conception and birth.two of these men provided emotional support to mother with their presence at the hospital where the child was born.the third man,respondent,was not present at the hospital.however,mother stated in her deposition that she informed respondent of the birth.in her discovery deposition,mother said that there was a doubt in her mind as to which man,louis,richard,or al,was the father of the child.
the baby was born prematurely with serious medical complications developing immediately after the birth.at the time of the child birth,mother and richard prepared and signed an electronic birth certificate worksheet worksheet as required by law for the filing of the state of illinois certificate of live birth.in the worksheet submitted for the birth certificate,mother and richard acknowledged that richard was the father of the child.both signed and verified the worksheet.the worksheet was also signed by a person designated to be the at the hospital.the birth certificate named the child using richard surname.
on january,mother filed a verified petition to determine the existence of the father and child relationship against richard,the voluntary father,in the circuit court of dupage county,illinois.mother sought a determination of parentage,an award of child support,payment of her pregnancy and delivery costs,medical insurance coverage for the child,life insurance as security for support and educational expenses,contribution toward a trust fund to pay the child education expenses,and attorneys fees.mother did not identify respondent as either a possible putative father of the child or notify respondent of the parentage proceedings occurring in the circuit court of dupage county.in paragraph of that verified petition,mother stated,the natural father of the minor child is richard c.the voluntary father appeared in court during these proceedings,with counsel,and agreed that he should be determined to be the child natural father.
on june,the court entered an agreed order of parentage,custody and interim support declaring richard to be the father of the child,awarding sole custody to mother,and requiring the voluntary father to pay interim child support at a rate of per week beginning immediately.on september,the court entered a subsequent agreed order resolving all other issues including the payment of pregnancy and delivery expenses,medical insurance,payment of uncovered medical expenses,contributions to education expenses,and increasing the child support amount to per week.
on december,mother filed a petition for rule to show cause against richard for violating the terms of the agreed order by failing to pay for medical expenses,life insurance coverage,and child support.the court entered an order for a rule to show cause to issue.on january,with both parties present,the court found the voluntary father to be in indirect civil contempt for failure to provide proof of life insurance coverage and for failure to pay child support.the court set a hearing date on the medical reimbursement issue and the possible discharge of said obligations in richard pending bankruptcy proceeding.on october,the dupage county court transferred the case to inactive status pending review of the final bankruptcy order.neither mother nor the voluntary father requested any dna testing throughout these proceedings to verify that the voluntary father was,in fact,the biological father of this child.
nearly two years later,on may,mother filed a standardized pro se petition to terminate my child support maintenance for the reason stated below due to dna testing richard is not the father of the child.mother also requested permission to amend birth certificate to reflect her own last name.mother prepared a notice of motion for richard,the legal father,to appear in court on this motion.on may,mother also sent an ex parte letter to judge dudgeon,the dupage county judge,stating,
dear judge dudgeon,
it is in the best interest of a five year old little boy to hear this emergency motion on friday,may,at.this motion is to vacate court order dated september.
petitioning the court to hear the validity of the dna testing done by identigene on october.the court will be provided with the chain of custody and sample handling and aabb government guidelines.
also,as you know richard is a hard person to contact,as luck will have it,he will be available this holiday weekend to spend time with and address the court on friday may,at am.he will be returning to kansas on may.
we pray that this court will vacate the order,relinquishing richard from all his financial obligations but not obligations of the heart.in turn we can take this over to will county court system and enable his right to know who he really is.
mother also prepared an emergency notice of motion to vacate order dated september.the only petition pending at this time was the pro se motion filed on may.richard did not appear on may,but the court,on its own motion,entered an order that included the following language 
renee appearing to present the parties agreement vacating the court finding of parentage and declaring that the respondent,richard,is not the biological father of the minor child,due notice having been given and the court otherwise advised in the premises a brenda carroll is appointed as the representative of the minor child b the parties and the child representative shall appear in the court on june,at for status.
the court order also ordered the parties to submit to parentage testing at labcorp and required that the county of dupage pay for the costs of the testing.
richard,the voluntary father,filed a general appearance on may,but never appeared in court or filed a responsive pleading in this matter.mother represented herself,pro se.neither mother nor the voluntary father filed any additional motions or amendments to the pending motion.on june,mother and the child representative appeared in court but richard was not present.the court entered an order on that date requiring the child representative to send the labcorp results to richard by mail setting a hearing date on mother motion for august,at and,if richard has not responded by that date,default shall enter against him.the record does not show richard ever received formal written notice and proof of mailing regarding the court hearing on august.the order entered on august,stated,richard not appearing but having been notified by the guardian ad litem and acknowledging to renee that he was aware of the court date and had received correspondence from the gal.
the court further ordered 
that there being no objection,due notice having been given and the test results for parentage indicating that richard is excluded as the father for the child,that richard is declared not to be the father of the child that the motion being previously filed and no objection being given,that the child name shall be henceforth changed to that the clerk of the circuit court shall reduce any child support arrearages on richard account to a zero balance and the child support account in this case shall be closed and they shall end richard child support obligation that any judgments entered against richard for child support will be vacated all prior orders of parentage are hereby vacated,too.
the case was then closed in dupage county.
on may,almost a year after the case was closed in dupage county,mother filed a petition to determine the existence of a relationship in the will county circuit court against respondent louis was six years old at this time.in this petition,mother also requested prospective and retroactive child support,health insurance coverage for,payment of a share of uninsured medical expenses for,life insurance coverage naming as the beneficiary,reservation of payment of education expenses,and attorneys fees.
respondent filed a motion to dismiss the will county action pursuant to specific sections of the code of civil procedure.ilcs west.in his motion to dismiss,respondent contended that,since mother and the voluntary father both signed an acknowledgment of paternity naming richard as father,that issue had already been resolved and was binding on those parties.in further support of his position,respondent stated that both mother and the voluntary father made a judicial declaration of parentage by consenting to the entry of the agreed orders in the dupage county court proceedings.finally,respondent argued that the dupage county order vacating the judgment of parentage against richard was void.respondent filed amended and supplemental motions to dismiss clarifying the issues.
the trial court denied respondent motion to dismiss and all amended and supplemental motions to dismiss.the court entered a judgment of paternity against respondent on february.on october,the court entered an additional order setting forth respondent financial obligations toward this child.respondent filed a timely notice of appeal.on appeal,respondent argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss and entering the judgment of paternity against him.additional facts,as necessary,will be discussed in the analysis below.
respondent argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss the pending cause of action because paternity of this child has been established by the previous voluntary acknowledgments of paternity.first,respondent argues the voluntary acknowledgments were not properly vacated by the court since mother did not file a section petition.second,respondent claims the dupage county order vacating the order of parentage,support and other issues was void due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.third,respondent contends that mother lacked standing to request vacating richard parental rights.consequently,respondent claims richard paternity order is still in effect and bars the current paternity action against him.
conversely,mother asserts that the doctrine of merger bars this court from reviewing the denial of respondent motion to dismiss since those issues merged into the issues and affirmative defenses raised in trial and the final judgment.next,mother argues respondent could not collaterally attack the dupage county order because the dupage county court had continuing subject matter jurisdiction over richard paternity obligations.third,she asserts the will county action of paternity against the biological father,respondent,is not barred by res judicata because the parties in the will county action differ from those named in the dupage county action.finally,mother contends equity and the best interests of the child dictate naming respondent as the child father.
voluntary acknowledgments of paternity operate as judgments 
at issue is whether this natural mother can rely on the illinois parentage act of parentage act ilcs et west to compel respondent to pay child support for her child when she knowingly acknowledged richard as the father and later agreed to a court order of support against richard.importantly,richard has not personally challenged the legal presumption of his paternity in any court.
richard,a close friend,attended the birth of the child.in her discovery deposition,mother said that there was a doubt in her mind as to which man,louis,richard,or al,was the father of the child.however,at the hospital,richard and mother completed the electronic birth certificate worksheet required pursuant to the vital records act ilcs west.according to the exhibits,hospital personnel certified this documentation.the resulting birth certificate identified richard as father and revealed the child shared richard last name.in this case,mother and richard were not married.at common law,a putative father was not legally obligated to support his child born out of wedlock.people ex rel.cantazaro centrone,d.however,today a father obligation to pay support,as well as other parental rights and obligations,are governed by the parentage act ilcs et west regardless of whether the parties were married.we are called upon to interpret the act in order to determine the person responsible for this child support.statutory construction involves a question of law requiring a de novo review.in re marriage of kates.
parental obligations encompass many considerations unrelated to financial support,such as the obligation to insure the physical,mental,and emotional of the child.our supreme court recently recognized these considerations by emphasizing the language of the parentage act.the court stated,
in enacting the parentage act,the general assembly established a statutory mechanism that serves to legally establish parent and child relationships in illinois.citation.t he purpose of this statutory enactment is to further the public policy of illinois to recognize the right of every child to the physical,mental,emotional and monetary support of his or her parents under this act.citations.as such,the parentage act defines the term parent and child relationship as the legal relationship existing between a child and his natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights,privileges,duties and obligations.citation.
accordingly,under the parentage act,a relationship may be established in a number of ways by presumption citation,by consent citation,or by judicial determination citation,at.
the parentage act creates a presumption of paternity arising from a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.pursuant to section a of the act,a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he and the child natural mother have signed an acknowledgment of parentage in accordance with section of the vital records act.ilcs a west.unless this acknowledgment is timely rescinded,the presumption is conclusive.ilcs b west.
the act allows that fatherhood is not always created by pure genetics.consent is as legally binding on a parent as a dna determination when that unconditional acceptance of the role of parent is voluntarily accepted for purposes of an adoption or a voluntary acceptance of paternity.here,both mother and richard agreed to name richard as legal father at birth.neither richard nor mother timely rescinded that agreement or alleged that their respective acknowledgments of paternity were based on duress,fraud,or mistake of fact as required by statute.this acknowledgment creates a legal presumption which can not be easily cast aside when the responsibilities of parenting become difficult.
further,a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage that is witnessed according to the requirements of section of the vital records act operates with the full force and effect of a judgment entered under the illinois parentage act.ilcs west.
the vital records act ilcs et west provides in pertinent part 
live births place of registration.
unless otherwise provided in this act,if the mother was not married to the father of the child at either the time of conception or the time of birth,the name of the father shall be entered on the child birth certificate only if the mother and the person to be named as the father have signed an acknowledgment of parentage in accordance with subsection.
upon the birth of a child to an unmarried woman,the institution at the time of birth and the local registrar or county clerk after the birth shall do the following 
a provide i an opportunity for the child mother and father to sign an acknowledgment of parentage.the signing and witnessing of the acknowledgment of parentage conclusively establishes a parent and child relationship in accordance with sections and of the illinois parentage act of.ilcs,west.
in the pending case,mother and richard voluntarily established a relationship between richard and by preparing the electronic birth certificate worksheet at the hospital pursuant to the vital records act.the record shows this acknowledgment of parentage was certified by a hospital representative.consequently,we conclude this admission of paternity operated as conclusively as a judicial determination based on evidence or a judgment establishing paternity pursuant to section of the illinois parentage act of.ilcs west.
in spite of her voluntary acknowledgment,mother now wishes to designate another person as her child father.when asked why she and richard completed dna testing of richard in,mother responded,
there was always a question.richard signed on birth certificate thinking the baby was going to die.we both did.there was all these court proceedings going on.richard was responsible for the next years through college.he was taking my child out of state.there was always,always,always a doubt in both of our minds.
however,in spite of mother change of heart,statutory procedures control whether an acknowledgment of paternity may be rescinded or whether the presumption arising from the acknowledgment remains in full force and effect.ilcs west.
section b of the act states that a party may rescind his or her voluntary acknowledgment of parentage within days of its signing.ilcs b west.specifically,the act states 
a presumption under section a or a is conclusive,unless the acknowledgment of parentage is rescinded upon the earlier of days after the date the acknowledgment of parentage is signed,or the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child including a proceeding to establish a support order in which the signatory is a party.ilcs b west.
the presumption arising from a voluntary acknowledgment becomes conclusive if not rescinded before the earlier of two dates provided by the act.ilcs b,b west people ex rel.of public aid smith.after the deadline for rescission has passed,a presumed father may only challenge the acknowledgment in the limited circumstances where he alleges fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact.ilcs d west illinois of public aid ex rel.howard graham,d,smith,at.richard,the voluntary father,has not challenged his presumption of paternity.mother now wishes to pursue support from another person and by necessity had to first extinguish richard status as father.
in smith,our supreme court explained that the presumption from a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity under the statute is conclusive and can not be overcome by any additional evidence or argument.smith,at.a man who voluntarily acknowledges paternity can later challenge the voluntariness of the acknowledgment if he can show that it was procured by fraud,duress,or material mistake of fact.however,the parentage act does not allow him to avoid the conclusive presumption of paternity with contrary evidence,such as the dna results in this case.smith,at.the illinois supreme court stated,
clearly,it would be unreasonable to allow a man in this position to undo his voluntary acknowledgment years later on the basis of dna results,when his paternity was based not on a mere marital presumption that he was the child father but on the conscious decision to accept the legal responsibility of being the child father.smith,at.
in this case,the voluntary acknowledgments of paternity were not rescinded by the parties within days or challenged based on fraud,duress,or mistake.
further,mother relied on richard status as father when she filed a verified petition to determine the existence of the father and child relationship in dupage county on january.mother verified richard was the father of her child in this petition filed approximately seven months after birth.similarly,in his verified response,richard,with an attorney,admitted parentage and agreed to the entry of an agreed order of parentage,custody,and interim support in dupage county on june.this proceeding occurred more than days after the parties acknowledged paternity in the birth certificate worksheet,and provided richard and mother a second opportunity to confirm paternity through dna testing.neither mother nor richard requested the dna testing.as a result,the court entered orders outlining richard legal privileges and obligations to the child,both financially and with regard to visitation.once paternity is established,the rights to a relationship are constitutionally protected and should not be lightly set aside.a parent may willingly surrender parental rights for purposes of an adoptive proceeding after meeting strict statutory criteria.ilcs west.also,the state can involuntarily terminate parental rights if an abusive or neglectful parent refuses to surrender parental rights and the state makes a proper showing of abuse or neglect of the child.ilcs west.fortunately,this is not a neglect or abuse situation.richard has been a good father to this child and has only encountered some difficulty in paying support.however,findings of parental unfitness may not be determined based on financial considerations alone.ilcs west.
in this case,it was not the not the child biological mother who requested the court to release richard from his financial obligations as father so that she could pursue another person for support contributions for her child needs.interestingly,mother only desires richard to be relieved of the monetary burdens in favor of imposing those duties on respondent.mother stated in her letter to the dupage county court that matters of the heart will be unaffected.however,no court has authority to bifurcate parental responsibilities between affairs of the heart and financial affairs.
in parentage cases,the trial court has no inherent powers to deviate from the statute.parental rights can be surrendered by the parent in limited situations or terminated by the state under special circumstances.however,there is not any statutory authority for a court to vacate or simply set aside parental rights at the request of a parent.the trial court authority is limited to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the court by the act,at.no court can arbitrarily vacate a judgment of paternity,created by statute or judicial determination,and allow a parent to abandon the duties necessary for the of their child,no matter how inconvenient those obligations may be for one or both parents.
mother argued that the agreed order of parentage,custody and interim support declaring richard to be the father of the child operated as a consent judgment which can later be modified with the consent of both parties.burchett goncher,d.we agree the terms of the order can be modified,but the underlying premise of paternity can not be challenged after two years except,by means of a section petition.
additionally,mother argument fails because there is no evidence that the dupage county order vacating richard parentage of was entered by agreement.the will county trial judge addressed that issue during the hearing on respondent motion to dismiss.the court stated,
i have looked at the dupage order.it clearly is not an agreed order.so the consent judgment argument is not.richard was not there.he did not sign off on it.it not agreed to.it indicates on its face that he did appear.
the will county trial court also reviewed the dupage county order entered prior to entry of the order vacating richard paternity which stated richard would be defaulted if he failed to appear or respond to mother motion.the trial court correctly found the dupage county order vacating richard paternity was not by agreement of the parties.
we conclude the acknowledgment of paternity was not rescinded within the statutory time frame.we also determine the status as a parent may not be vacated by agreement of the parties.parental status may only be relieved by operation of law as a result of fraud,duress,or mistake or based on omission of duties arising to the level of abuse or neglect.
we now turn to whether the respondent motion to dismiss established another person had status as the child father and barred mother action to compel respondent to contribute to the financial needs of the young boy.
ii.motion to dismiss 
respondent filed a motion to dismiss mother petition to declare him the father of,pursuant to ilcs west,on grounds that the parentage of had already been established,and improperly vacated,by the dupage county circuit court.the will county court conducted a lengthy hearing on respondent pretrial motion.the court denied respondent motion to dismiss.however,the record does not contain the judge oral pronouncement of the ruling.additionally,the written order does not include any written findings.
mother contends when the trial court denied respondent motions to dismiss,the issues from that motion merged into the trial on the merits and the subsequent judgment.mother cites the case of in re,d,for the premise that a motion to dismiss is analogous to a motion for summary judgment under the rules of civil procedure.mother claims that,after the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,the issues raised in that pretrial motion merged into the issues presented at trial.consequently,mother contends respondent is precluded from challenging the denial of his section motion to dismiss in this appeal.
respondent counters this argument stating that an exception to the doctrine of merger exists when the issues presented in the prior motion are questions of law,rather than fact,and those questions of law were not presented to the court again at trial.battles lasalle nat.bank,d.respondent contends that ilcs e grants an exception to the doctrine of merger.section e states,pleading over after denial by the court of a motion under this section is not a waiver of any error in the decision denying the motion.ilcs e west.
a transcript from the first hearing on respondent motions to dismiss held before judge baron is helpful.after judge baron denied respondent motion to dismiss,respondent stated he would be raising similar affirmative defenses in his responsive pleadings to the complaint just to protect the record.respondent attorney stated that he did not expect the court to the same issues raised as affirmative defenses.the court concurred stating,i understand.you think that necessary to protect your appeal rights,it appropriate that you do so.respondent attorney further clarified that the court was denying his statutory argument in the motion to dismiss,and the court concurred.
clearly,respondent preserved his right to appeal the trial court denial of his motions to dismiss based on legal issues rather than questions of fact.therefore,these issues fall within the exception to the merger doctrine.the denial of the motions to dismiss are properly before this court.
now that we have addressed the fact that respondent may properly request our review of the denial of his motion to dismiss,we turn to the contentions of error regarding the circuit court ruling on the motion to dismiss.pursuant to section a and of the code of civil procedure ilcs a,west,a defendant may,within the time for pleading,file a motion for dismissal of the action or for other appropriate relief upon any of the following grounds that the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment and that the claim asserted against the defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.pursuant to these subsections,respondent filed his timely motions to dismiss.
respondent alleged the will county case was barred by the dupage county judgment naming richard the father of also,respondent argued the lawsuit was barred by other affirmative matters being the voluntary acknowledgments of paternity,made by mother and richard when preparing the birth certificate,that operates as a judgment pursuant to the illinois parentage act of ilcs a west and the vital records act ilcs west.however,both parties contest the other standing to challenge the dupage county proceedings that vacated the order of parentage,custody,child support and other issues regarding richard as father.we consider the issue of standing as to each party separately.
iii.standing 
where standing is challenged by way of a motion to dismiss,a court must accept as true all facts in the plaintiff complaint and all inferences that can reasonably be drawn in the plaintiff favor.international union of operating engineers,local,illinois of employment.a court disposition of a section motion on lack of standing presents a question of law which we review de novo.international union,at.
in his motion to dismiss,respondent collaterally attacked the dupage order vacating richard paternity and obligations on grounds that the order was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.mother asserts respondent may not collaterally attack the dupage order because he was not a party to that lawsuit and,therefore,is without standing.respondent contends that he has standing to collaterally challenge the void dupage county order because a void order can be attacked at any time in any court.
it is well settled that a judgment,order or decree entered by a court which lacks jurisdiction of the parties or of the subject matter,or which lacks the inherent power to make or enter the particular order involved,is void,and may be attacked at any time in any court,either directly or collaterally.sarkissian chicago board of education,see also ashlock ashlock,george kennedy construction company,industrial commission,d,state bank of lake zurich thill.
the law in illinois does not place restrictions on a collateral attack of a void judgment.we reject mother contention that respondent did not have standing to collaterally attack the dupage county order.we conclude respondent had standing to challenge an order he claims was void from the inception by means of his section motion to dismiss.
next,we consider respondent challenge to mother standing.respondent claims mother did not have standing to request the dupage county court to vacate richard paternity,child support and other parental obligations.the permanent consequences of voluntary acknowledgments of parentage extend to both the mother who gives birth and the man who knowingly assumes the role of father.by voluntarily acknowledging paternity,both mother and richard accepted the legal consequences of the statutory presumption of paternity and waived their option to request dna testing.both have standing to challenge their own acknowledgment of paternity upon the earlier of days after the signing of the acknowledgment of parentage,or the date of an administrative or judicial proceeding related to the child,including a proceeding to establish support,in which the signatory is a party.ilcs b west.
however,in donath buckley,d,we rejected a mother assertion of her standing to challenge a father paternity based on section of the parentage act ilcs west.justice mcdade stated in donath,unless father seeks to deny the relationship,mother is legally bound by the judicial declaration of paternity that she and father secured by agreement and consent.donath,d at.justice mcdade continued,section b of the illinois parentage act governs the circumstances under which a natural mother may challenge paternity.the statute of limitations for her challenge is found in ilcs west,providing that the action must be brought no later than two years after the petitioner obtains knowledge of the relevant facts.donath,d at.
in this case,by acknowledging richard paternity at birth,and later relying on that acknowledgment in the dupage county court
