karen,a child,appeals from an order of the juvenile court denying her petition for an order determining the existence of a mother and child relationship between leticia and her.though leticia joined in the petition,she is not a party to this appeal.
we will vacate the order and remand the matter to the juvenile court for further hearing and consideration in light of a recent decision of the supreme court of california,in re nicholas cal th,d,nicholas.as will be discussed,that case involved a presumed father.we hold that under the facts of the present matter,the decision reached in nicholas applies with equal force to a woman,as a presumed mother.
the record of the proceedings below tended to show the facts stated in the following four paragraphs.
karen was an unwanted child of alicia and jose,a married couple.through an intermediary who had unsuccessfully attempted an untherapeutic abortion on alicia,alicia gave karen to leticia promptly after karen was born in the los angeles county general hospital in.alicia told the hospital staff her own name was leticia,so that leticia would be named on karen birth certificate as karen birth mother.leticia raised karen as her own child.leticia told karen that karen was adopted.karen had no contact with her natural parents to her,leticia was the only parent she ever had.the sole source of the information in this paragraph was leticia 
when karen was years old,the preceding facts came to the attention of the dcfs,after leticia,who was an alcoholic and suffered from clinical depression,beat karen.leticia herself called the authorities,expressing fear that she might seriously harm the child.karen was declared a dependent of the juvenile court on october.the juvenile court placed her in foster care and ordered that leticia be provided with reunification services.
the juvenile court ordered leticia to participate in parenting classes,individual counseling,alcoholism treatment,alcohol abuse counseling,and to take her prescribed depression medication.her performance fell short of what the juvenile court required.leticia applied to the appropriate agency for a license to serve as a foster parent,but the agency denied the application.leticia did not attempt to persuade dcfs that it ought to let her adopt karen.
neither karen nor leticia has had any contact with alicia and jose,who leticia believes reside in guatemala.
karen requested that the juvenile court decree the existence of a relationship between her and leticia,who joined in the motion.the juvenile court denied the request.the juvenile court reasoned,in part,that the law does not provide that a woman who is neither a child birth mother nor a child genetic mother may be the child mother.this appeal followed.
karen contends the family code sections concerning the father and child relationship may also be applied to determine the mother and child relationship karen has standing to bring an action to determine the existence of her mother and child relationship with leticia leticia is karen legal,presumed mother leticia must be granted status as karen legal mother based on public policy and logic pursuant to family code section,subdivision b and karen was denied equal protection of the laws because the juvenile court would have applied the law differently had leticia been a man,and because the relevant statutes,as interpreted by the juvenile court,are unconstitutional as applied.
dcfs contends the appeal should be dismissed as moot,because the question of whether leticia is a presumed mother,a biological mother,a psychological mother,or a de facto mother is irrelevant,since the juvenile court is not going to place karen with leticia in any event leticia does not qualify as a presumed mother leticia should not be permitted to benefit from her unclean hands and karen was not denied equal protection of the laws,because a the juvenile court did not decide the matter any differently than if leticia had been a man,and b men and women are not similarly situated when parenthood is in dispute,since only women give birth to children.
karen preliminary contentions are correct.karen has standing to bring an action to determine the existence of a relationship between leticia and her,because any interested person can bring such an action.under the trial court current order,karen has effectively been made an orphan.she therefore has an obvious interest in a legal determination of whether leticia is her mother.
next,the appeal is not moot.the existence of a relationship is different from the question of placement,so the fact that the juvenile court has not placed karen with leticia,and appears unlikely to do so in the future,does not prevent the maternity question from being considered an actual and ongoing dispute.
finally,karen claim is not defeated by leticia unclean hands,because the record on appeal contains no evidence that karen participated in or ratified any of leticia wrongful or harmful acts.
the pertinent statute is the california uniform parentage act the act,section et.similar to its predecessor,the uniform paternity act,the act concentrates on questions of paternity rather than maternity.the focus on paternity is likely due to the fact the identity of a child birth mother is rarely in dispute.
section provides that there are three ways to determine parentage a between a child and the natural mother,it may be established by proof of her having given birth to the child,or under this part.b between a child and the natural father,it may be established under this part.c between a child and an adoptive parent,it may be established by proof of adoption.
section sets forth rebuttable presumptions of paternity.most of these presumptions flow from various forms of marriage or attempted marriage to the child mother,and are based,no doubt,on the public interest in marital stability and legitimacy of children.but a different one that is pertinent provided in section a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if d he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
section deals with the rebuttal of the section presumption of paternity.a court judgment establishing the paternity of a different man rebuts the section presumption.in the absence of such a judgment,any presumption arising under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a,italics added.
if the section presumptions point to two men,if one man is married to the child mother,but another man receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,the conflict is resolved in favor of that presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls,subd.b.
importantly,any interested person may bring an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of a mother and child relationship.the second sentence of section provides that the paternity statutes are also applicable to the relationship i nsofar as practicable.
the judicial determination of paternity is thus a mixture of a search for genetic truth and the implementation of the strong public policies favoring marriage and family stability,and disfavoring labels of illegitimacy.a judgment establishing paternity can,therefore,be a decretal fiction.
the effect of the section presumptions of paternity is that in certain cases,a man known not to be the child genetic father is decreed to be the de jure father any doubt about this premise was dispelled by the decision in nicholas,supra,cal th,d.there,the man seeking to establish paternity conceded that he was not the genetic father.he did not meet the child mother until three months before the child was born,but received the child into his home and openly raised nicholas as his natural child the trial court held that under those facts,the case was not an appropriate action to rebut the section,subdivision d,presumption of fatherhood.the court of appeal reversed,reasoning that the presumption of paternity had been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence,namely,the undisputed evidence esta
