introduction 
in this appeal we conclude that the failure on the part of two divorcing spouses to exchange final declarations of disclosure,does not constitute a card,giving either one of them the automatic right to a new trial or reversal on appeal when there is no showing of a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.we also deal with several miscellaneous challenges to the judgment,which we affirm.
tahereh hosseini and william steiner married in december and separated in march.during their marriage,hosseini and steiner had two children,john,now,and shah,now.a judgment for dissolution of marriage was entered in april,and the court reserved all other issues for trial.the trial took place in november and lasted approximately eight days.
at the trial neither party complained about the absence of any declarations of disclosure.the only reference to the subject in the record,and that was an extremely oblique one,was made by steiner trial counsel.in the context of a discussion about whether a certain deposit of was hosseini separate property,steiner lawyer made reference to certain form interrogatory responses received from hosseini he complained that she had not acknowledged receiving the in those interrogatory responses.as an afterthought,he then made a brief comment that there was no declaration of disclosure to that effect either 
after the trial,judge mandel ordered steiner counsel to prepare the proposed judgment.then a long time than a steiner counsel submitted the judgment.that was long enough for judge mandel to retire in the interim and be replaced by several judges,ending with judge daniel brice.
finally,on february,the judgment was submitted.judge brice approved it two days later on february.that did give hosseini enough time to file any objections to it see cal.rules of court,rule e,but she did so anyway on march.
hosseini was served with a copy of the signed judgment on march,and on march,she filed the notice of intention to move for a new trial,but without a supporting memorandum of points and authorities.it was not until more than three weeks later,on april,that she filed a supporting memorandum.the memorandum did mention the failure to serve final declarations of disclosure on the part of both parties,but did not specify any way in which hosseini had been prejudiced by that failure.hosseini filed timely appeals from both the entry of judgment and the order denying the new trial.
iii.discussion 
a.the proposed judgment 
we will tackle an easy issue first.there is no question that judge brice slipped up in signing the proposed judgment two days after he got it.see cal.rules of court,rule e any party affected by the judgment may,within days after service of the proposed judgment,serve and file objections thereto.the court shall,within days after expiration of the time for filing objections to the proposed judgment sign and file its judgment.emphasis added.the question is whether that mistake was prejudicial.
no.while a rule of court phrased in mandatory language is generally binding on the courts departure from it is not reversible error unless prejudice is shown.estate of cooper d.no reversible error where appellant was precluded from filing objections to the proposed judgment because the court did not follow requirements of rule see also baker eilers music cal,error disregarded where court prematurely signed and filed findings.
hosseini has not identified any substantial right which she lost as a result of the trial court premature signing of the judgment before reading her objections.in fact,an examination of her objections shows that they would have been of no aid to the trial judge if he had waited.those objections were a tangle of connections between the judgment and portions of a reporter transcript not otherwise quoted or identified.indeed,as presented to the reader,they are incomprehensible.here are illustrative excerpts 
paragraphs c and e are in contradiction with the actual minute order with respect to the court reporter transcript of november,proceedings and the court minute order on november.paragraph is in contradiction with the court minute order and the court reporter transcripts on november,proceedings.paragraph is in contradiction with the court minute order.paragraphs and are in contradiction with the court minute order and the court reporter transcripts of the trial proceedings.paragraph b contradicts the court minute order and the court reporter transcripts of the trail sic proceedings on november of.moreover,the proposed judgment of community property is incomplete and dose sic not cover all the minute orders and the findings of the court during the trial.
insufficient objections raise an inference that the findings in question support the judgment.see code civ,where omission or ambiguity was brought to the attention of the trial court it shall not be inferred on appeal that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,the clear implication of section is that if a party does not bring deficiencies to the trial court attention the appellate court will imply findings to support the judgment.ripani liberty loan d.objections merely stating that the findings are not adequate and ambiguous not sufficient.in this case,hosseini opaque assertions of unarticulated inconsistencies with unquoted portions of reporter transcripts could not have helped judge brice in any event.we therefore conclude the error here was harmless.
b.the absent declarations of disclosure 
now to the harder issue.we may infer from both the motion for new trial and the appellant opening brief that the parties did exchange preliminary declarations of disclosure as required by section of the family code.that is,hosseini makes no complaint that the failure to receive a preliminary declaration hampered her discovery or preparation for the case.it is also a reasonable inference from the record that neither party cared about receiving a final declaration as we mentioned,the only time the issue was brought up at trial before judge mandel was in the context of a complaint by steiner counsel regarding a question of characterization of property that hosseini was claiming to be her separate property.moreover,there is no dispute before us now that both parties are at fault,not just steiner.
so the question before us is the failure to exchange final declarations of disclosure is enough,by itself,to compel the granting of a new trial or the reversal of a judgment on appeal 
prior to the amendments to the family code disclosure statutes see stats,ch,the question would have been easily answered no.at least two court of appeal opinions,in re marriage of jones th,d and in re marriage of mclaughlin th,d,had squarely held that a party must show some prejudice as a result of the nondisclosure.see jones,supra,th at,d mclaughlin,supra,th at,d.of course,if a trial court in its discretion vacated a judgment because of the absence of disclosures,the decision would readily be upheld on appeal as well.see in re marriage of fell th,d in re marriage of brewer federici th,d.
however,the amendments added this sentence to subdivision d of section the failure to comply with the disclosure requirements does not constitute harmless error.it appears that the sentence was added precisely to undo the rule articulated by jones and mclaughlin.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,this changes law under which the court had discretion to decide,on a basis,whether the parties waiver of the final declarations of disclosure exchange would affect their rights.it also supersedes case law affirming judgments under a harmless error standard despite a violation of the disclosure statutes.
jones and mclaughlin were not,however,cases based purely on statutory construction.each case relied on the constitutional mandate embodied in article vi,section of our state constitution that no judgment may be set aside or new trial granted unless there has been a miscarriage of justice.jones,supra,th at,d mclaughlin,supra,th at,d 
article vi,section reads,in its entirety,as follows no judgment shall be set
