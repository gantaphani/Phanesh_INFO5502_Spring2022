caroline mother appeals from the february,jurisdictional and dispositional orders of the juvenile court adjudging minors aiden,born in december,and elizabeth,born in may,dependents of the court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b failure to protect scott father is not a party to this appeal.the issue presented is whether the juvenile court should have sustained a petition alleging only that mother is mentally ill and is unable to care for the minors where father has always been,and is,capable of properly caring for them.while mother mental health is such that the minors would be at substantial risk if they were in mother custody,the custody order filed in the family court by the juvenile court after making the challenged adjudication and disposition orders eliminated such risk.because the matter belonged in the family court,there was no reason for the juvenile court adjudication and dispositional orders.we reverse and remand with directions to the family court.
