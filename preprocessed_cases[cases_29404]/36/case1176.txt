kristina,mother of the minor,appeals from the orders of the superior court denying her petition to terminate the parental rights of walter father and free the minor for adoption by the stepfather,et appellant contends that this court should apply the existing indian family doctrine to permit her to avoid the substantive requirements of the indian child welfare act icwa.et appellant further contends that the good cause exception in icwa should apply to permit termination of the father parental rights.we requested supplemental briefing on several questions relating to application of the provisions of icwa.after consideration of those issues,we conclude reversal is required.
in august,appellant filed an application to terminate the father parental rights in conjunction with the stepfather petition to adopt the minor.the petition to adopt the minor stated that the minor had no indian ancestry.the father was in custody.
in october,the confederated tribes of the grand ronde community of oregon ctgr moved to intervene because the minor was an enrolled member of the federally recognized tribe.the court granted the motion.
according to the probation report on stepparent adoption,appellant had custody of the minor and the father had failed to provide for the minor for over four years.the father did not consent to the adoption.the report recommended terminating the father parental rights and granting the petition for adoption.a subsequent investigation report stated that appellant was involved with the father when appellant was and the father was in his.according to appellant,the father was abusive and controlling and she left him,when the minor was born,to live with the maternal grandmother.the relationship continued over the next year and a half until the father was arrested in december and eventually convicted of violent crimes against appellant,including kidnapping and terrorist threats.the father is currently serving a prison term as a result of these convictions.appellant had some contact with the paternal aunt in and the paternal grandmother in.the investigation report stated the father had had minimal contact with the minor and had provided no support for her.the report concluded that termination of the father parental rights was in the minor best interests.
appellant filed an amended petition in march,alleging that the father had abandoned the minor and had been convicted of a felony demonstrating his unfitness to have custody.
ctgr filed a pretrial statement which indicated that the father had applied for tribal membership for the minor in november and that the minor was enrolled in april.the tribe had an interest in preserving the minor heritage but did not object to termination of the father parental rights if appellant provided assurances that she would maintain the minor cultural connection to the tribe.in october,ctgr and appellant stipulated to these facts.
the father moved to dismiss on the ground that appellant had failed to show compliance with the substantive provisions of icwa.specifically,the father argued,appellant had not shown active efforts had been made to prevent the breakup of the indian family or that evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,including testimony of a qualified expert witness,supported a determination that the continued custody of the child by the father was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.d,f.
appellant opposed the motion,contending that the existing indian family doctrine constituted an exception to the application of the substantive provisions of icwa and that the doctrine should apply in this case.alternatively,appellant argued that the requirements of icwa had been met since there was no family to preserve and appellant could do little in any case to rehabilitate the father,who was in state prison.further,therapist sharon sloper,an indian expert,had stated that introducing the minor to the father would be damaging to her except under the most controlled conditions.
at trial,sloper testified as an expert within the meaning of icwa.based upon her interview with the minor,she stated that the minor had no recollection of the time when the father was involved in her life and viewed her stepfather as her father.sloper observed the minor interact in a positive way with the stepfather.sloper believed that under the right circumstances,in counseling,it would be appropriate and important for the minor to learn her biological father identity.sloper opined it was in the minor best interests to be adopted by her stepfather.it was her belief that for the father to form a bond with the minor it would be necessary to have consistency and stability in the relationship.however,informing the minor of the existence of her biological father,followed by frequent and consistent contact with him at this age,would be confusing for the minor and could cause emotional harm depending on the minor reaction.the expert saw no way the necessary consistent parental contact to develop a bond could occur while the father was incarcerated,and sporadic contact would be confusing for the minor.further,the expert opined that visiting a parent in prison might be good to maintain a relationship,but not to establish one.even if contact with the father was being initiated carefully,he would not be functioning as a father and the expert still believed that termination of parental rights was in the minor best interests.
appellant testified about her relationship with the father prior to and following the minor birth.appellant stated she separated from the father just before the minor was born,after they were served with an eviction notice due to the father violent behavior.she testified she received no support from the father after his arrest and had no contact with him thereafter except for a letter sent from prison through his relatives,which she returned.appellant testified that the minor does not know the father is her biological father and thinks that appellant husband is her father.after the minor was born,appellant did travel to oregon to visit the father there for about a week while he was addressing his drinking problem.the minor did have contact with the father before he was incarcerated and he provided some care for the minor from time to time but was often under the influence when he visited.appellant testified she had made no attempt to contact the father and had not worked with the tribe or any other entity to assist him in communicating with the minor.she was opposed to the father having contact with the minor by mail or email.appellant believed the father was violent based on his actions toward her,and that he was a danger to the minor.she had not hired a therapist to help the minor deal with the fact that the man the minor believes is her father is not her biological father.
the father testified he had been in an alcohol rehabilitation plan through the tribe in oregon and appellant had visited him there.he had seen the minor frequently after her birth and felt the minor was bonded to him.he testified he relapsed twice in and appellant made it clear their relationship was over.she was tired of dealing with his drinking and did not want him around.he agreed he had a drinking problem and had prior felony convictions in for rape and oral copulation,and his own family had restraining orders against him in and.following his convictions of the offenses against appellant,a lifetime domestic violence restraining order was issued prohibiting him from contacting appellant.
the court issued its statement of decision in which it rejected the existing indian family doctrine,following the prior decision of this court.the court found proof beyond a reasonable doubt was lacking to establish that appellant made active efforts to provide remedial and rehabilitative services,or that expert testimony was presented supporting finding beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by the father was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage.the court reviewed the evidence,and found that appellant testimony was evasive at times and lacking in candor,and that appellant actively prevented co
