ii.background 
facts and procedural history 
in september,dwight and his former wife initiated divorce proceedings.in november,they met separately with a family court mediator to work out a temporary agreement for custody and visitation rights to their two daughters,and,then ages five and three,respectively.expressed no concern during the mediation that dwight had sexually abused the girls,and the mediator report of the mediation did not mention any concern of sexual abuse.through the mediator,dwight and agreed that would have temporary sole legal and physical custody of the girls,dwight would visit the girls three days each week,and dwight parents would supervise the visits.the agreement did not have any provision for overnight visits.
during a second mediation on february,dwight sought unsupervised overnight visits with the girls.at the time of the february mediation,dwight was living with his parents,was,and set his work schedule according to work availability.he believed his visits with the girls had been going well,and he did not wish to further impose on his parents to supervise the visits.
at the february mediation,the mediator again spoke separately with dwight and wanted the paternal grandparents to continue supervising the visits.she acknowledged that the girls were enjoying the visits and would likely enjoy overnight visits,but she believed the visits were going well only because the paternal grandparents were involved.she told the mediator she did not trust dwight judgment,but she expressed no concern that dwight had or would sexually abuse the girls,and the mediator february report does not mention any concern of sexual abuse.dwight and did not reach an agreement at the february mediation,but the mediator recommended to the family court that dwight have unsupervised visits with the girls,including overnight visits on alternating weekends.
during a march,order to show cause hearing in the family court,accused dwight for the first time of sexually abusing the girls.the family court rejected the accusation as unfounded,and adopted the mediator recommendation that dwight have unsupervised visits,including overnight weekend visits.even though the court authorized unsupervised visits,after the march hearing dwight made certain his parents were present during all of his visits with the girls as a precaution against false accusations of sexual abuse.
dwight visited the girls on tuesday and thursday,march and,in the presence of his parents.these daytime visits went smoothly and uneventfully,without any problems.the first overnight visit took place on friday,march,through sunday,march,at the paternal grandparents home.the girls had never before spent the night there,and the paternal grandparents were present throughout the visit.
shortly after the march to march weekend visit,dwight discovered that had her first therapy session with christy on friday,march.before march,neither nor had ever seen a therapist.

christy acknowledges that she had her first therapy session with on march.she claims that,in keeping with her custom and practice for new patients,she instructed to draw pictures of a tree,a house,herself and her favorite animal.this helped her connect with and learn more about the child.christy claims that,b ased on the pictures drew,as it pertained to her father house and sleeping arrangements she shared with her father,and based upon my professional opinion,i had a reasonable suspicion that there may be sexual abuse.
christy denies dwight allegations that she facilitated,instructed,or guided into making certain statements and drawings,to conjure up sexual abuse allegations against dwight.she also denies conspiring with anyone,including,or any social workers,to violate dwight or the girls federal civil rights.she claims the only action she took concerning was notifying child protective services of her suspicion as a mandated reporter.
on tuesday,march,christy completed a mandated report of her suspicion that dwight was sexually abusing,subd.a,and notified child protective services of her suspicion.christy did not immediately report her suspicion because she did not believe was in any immediate danger.she understood that had custody of,and believed that would be staying with over the weekend of march to march.christy continued to treat on a weekly basis until february.
in his declaration opposing christy motion,dwight claims that on march,christy stated i christy asked if she could draw me a picture of daddy dwight and her in bed.dwight does not say to whom or under what circumstances christy made the statement,but according to dwight,christy act of coaching to draw pictures of herself in bed with dwight was nothing more than impermissible coaching of to make false sexual abuse allegations against dwight.
dwight adduces the declaration of hanlon,a licensed psychologist and marriage and family therapist,who states he has never come across a reliable or valid protocol,standard,or guideline that allows anyone to make reliable or valid inferences about the dynamic meaning of children drawings.hanlon is critical of christy for the extremely poor method she used in obtaining information from,for her utterly unfounded assumptions about what that information the drawings signified,and for assuming that dwight was sexually abusing without attempting to rule out who else in environment might have molested her.hanlon states t he sequence of events christy describes in her contact with strongly suggests that she approached her evaluation of from a mental set of confirmatory bias,that is,of viewing all information in a light that confirmed her preconceived idea or hypothesis that dwight was sexually abusing.

reporter immunities under california law 
california has a strong interest in preventing and remediating child abuse and neglect.storch silverman d.to better enable authorities to prevent ongoing instances of child abuse and neglect,the legislature enacted a comprehensive reporting scheme,currently known as the child abuse and neglect reporting act the reporting act,et.
the reporting act designates as mandated reporters certain professionals who work in positions where child abuse and neglect is likely to be detected,subd.a.in addition to teachers,physicians,and other professionals whose work regularly brings them in contact with children,mandated reporters include social workers,subd.a,family and child counselors,such as christy,subd.a,and a ny employee of a county office of education whose duties bring the employee into contact with children on a regular basis,such as,subd.a.
subject to exceptions not applicable here,a mandated reporter has a duty to make a report to an agency specified in penal code section whenever the mandated reporter,in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment,has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect,subd.a watson county of santa clara d.a report of suspected child abuse by a mandated reporter is known as a mandated report,subd.a.a mandated reporter who fails to make a mandated report as required by penal code section is guilty of a misdemeanor,subd.c.given their obligation under penalty of criminal prosecution to report all known and reasonably suspected instances of child abuse or neglect,mandated reporters have unqualified,absolute immunity from criminal and civil liability for any report required or authorized to be made under the reporting act,even if the mandated reporter acquired the knowledge or reasonable suspicion of child abuse or neglect outside of his or her professional capacity or outside the scope of his or her employment,subd.a.
a mandated reporter is also absolutely immune from civil and criminal liability for conduct giving rise to the obligation to report including the collection of data,or the observation,examination,or treatment of the suspected victim or perpetrator of child abuse,and even for knowingly or recklessly making a false report or falsifying evidence of child abuse or neglect.storch silverman,supra,d at.krikorian barry d.mcmartin children institute international d.thomas chadwick d.chadwick.as explained in storch the reporting act is designed to encourage the reporting of child abuse to the greatest extent possible to prevent further abuse.reporters are required to report child abuse promptly and they are subject to criminal prosecution if they fail to report as required.accordingly,absolute immunity from liability for all reports is consistent with that scheme.storch silverman,supra,at,italics added.
in contrast to mandated reporters,voluntary reporters persons who voluntarily report known or suspected instances of child abuse or neglect have qualified immunity from civil or criminal liability as a result of any report authorized under the reporting act,subd.a.voluntary reporters are immune,unless it can be proven that a false report was made and the person knew that the report was false or was made with reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the report.ibid.
iii.discussion 
overview of code of civil procedure section 
a slapp suit a strategic lawsuit against public participation seeks to chill or punish a party exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.rusheen cohen cal th,d.code of civil procedure section,the statute,allows a party to bring a special motion to strike a meritless slapp suit at an early stage of the litigation.rusheen cohen,supra,at,d,gerbosi gaims,weil,west epstein,llp th,d gerbosi.
code of civil procedure section prescribes a process for courts to follow in determining whether a cause of action constitutes a slapp.navellier sletten cal th,d,code civ,subd.b.the court first determines whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action aris es from protected speech or petition activity.navellier sletten,supra,at,d.this showing is made if the act underlying the challenged cause of action fits one of the four categories of protected activities described in code of civil procedure section,subdivision e navellier sletten,supra,at,d.
if the court finds the defendant has met this threshold burden,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits of the plaintiff claim.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.to meet this burden,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the statute,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit is a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.id.at,d.
we review an order granting or denying a special motion to strike de novo.south sutter,llc lj sutter partners,th,d.that is,we independently determine whether the challenged cause or causes of action arise from protected activities,and if so whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claims.maranatha corrections,llc department of corrections rehabilitation th,d.
b.the section claims are based on protected activities 
dwight claims christy did not meet her burden of demonstrating that the section claims against her are based on protected free speech or petition activities.code civ,subds.b,e.we disagree.
a cause of action aris es from protected speech or petition activities if the act underlying the claim is itself an act in furtherance of the right of free speech or petition.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,code civ,subd.b.in determining whether a claim is based on protected activity,we disregard the labeling of the claim and examine its principal thrust or gravamen,or the allegedly wrongful and injury producing conduct that provides the foundation for the claim.citation.hylton frank rogozienski,th,d.we consider the pleadings together with the supporting and opposing affidavits adduced on the motion,stating the facts upon which the liability is based.code civ,subd.b navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
the protected activities described in subdivision e of code of civil procedure section include statements or writings made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law see kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d.these protected activities include acts preparatory to or in anticipation of the bringing of an action or other official proceeding.see briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.
the core conduct underlying the section claims against christy is her alleged conspiracy with social workers and others to falsify evidence that dwight was sexually molesting,her improper coaching of to draw illicit pictures of herself and dwight,and her mandated report to child protective services of her allegedly false suspicion that dwight was sexually abusing.as such,the section claims are based on acts preparatory to or in anticipation of official proceedings,namely,an investigation by child protective services of christy suspicion that dwight was sexually abusing,and possible juvenile dependency proceedings for the girls.code civ,subd.e.
dwight points out that he did not allege that christy made a mandated report of her suspicion that dwight was sexually abusing.instead he alleged that made the mandated report of christy suspicion of the sexual abuse.this attempt to parse christy alleged coaching and conspiracy activities from her act of making the mandated report is unavailing.christy adduced uncontroverted evidence that she is a mandated reporter and that she,not,reported her suspicion to child protective services that dwight was sexually abusing.
in any event the point is a red herring.even if or someone other than christy made the report,christy other alleged acts of conspiring with and social workers to fabricate evidence that dwight was sexually abusing and coaching to draw illicit pictures of herself and dwight nonetheless constitute protected activities in anticipation of official proceedings.code civ,subd.e see briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.
relying on flatley mauro cal th,pages through,d,flatley and lefebvre lefebvre th,pages and,d lefebvre,dwight further argues that christy alleged coaching and conspiracy activities are not protected activities under code of civil procedure section because they were unlawful as a matter of law.this argument fails because there is no uncontroverted evidence that christy alleged coaching or conspiracy activities,as dwight characterizes them,were unlawful.
unlawful or criminal activities do not qualify as protected speech or petition activities under the statute.flatley,supra,cal th at,d,code of civil procedure section can not be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is illegal as a matter of law lefebvre,supra,th at,d code civ,does not protect activity that,because it is illegal,is not in furtherance of constitutionally protected speech or petition rights.but when the defendant assertedly protected activity may or may not be unlawful,the defendant may invoke the statute unless the activity is unlawful as a matter of law.gerbosi,supra,th at,d.an activity may be deemed unlawful as a matter of law when the defendant does not dispute that the activity was unlawful,or uncontroverted evidence conclusively shows the activity was unlawful.flatley,supra,at,d.
here,christy does not concede that she engaged in any unlawful activities.nor is there any uncontroverted evidence that her coaching and conspiracy activities,as dwight characterizes them,were unlawful as a matter of law.in her declaration in support of her motion,christy denies unduly persuading or coaching to draw illicit pictures of herself and dwight,or engaging in any conspiracy with social workers,or others to falsify evidence that dwight was sexually abusing.dwight mere allegation that christy engaged in unlawful coaching and conspiracy activities is insufficient to render her alleged actions unlawful as a matter of law and outside the protection of code of civil procedure section.
in contrast to the section claims,flatley and lefebvre involved claims based on activities that were indisputably unlawful as a matter of law and therefore unprotected under the statute.the plaintiff in flatley sued an attorney for civil extortion and related causes of action based on the attorney alleged criminal attempt to extort money from the plaintiff by threatening to publicize the plaintiff alleged rape of the attorney client unless the plaintiff paid the attorney and his client a seven figure settlement.flatley,supra,cal th at,d.in opposing the attorney motion,the plaintiff adduced uncontroverted evidence that the attorney had engaged in the alleged extortion attempt.id.at,d,the attorney did not deny that he sent the letter nor did he contest the version of the telephone calls set forth in the plaintiff attorneys declarations.based on the uncontroverted evidence that the attorney attempted to extort money from the plaintiff,the court in flatley concluded that the attorney made the extortion attempt,which was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore not a protected form of speech under code of civil procedure section.flatley,supra,at,d.
lefebvre also involved undisputed unlawful activity the filing of a false police report which uncontroverted evidence showed was in fact a false police report.the plaintiff sued his former wife and another defendant for malicious prosecution and related claims,alleging that they conspired to falsely accuse the plaintiff of threatening to kill his former wife and their children.lefebvre,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff was prosecuted for making a criminal threat but was acquitted and later found factually innocent.ibid.moreover,the former wife admitted she filed an illegal,false criminal report.id.at,d.thus,as a matter of law,the former wife could not show that her former husband claims against her and her codefendant were based on protected speech or petition activities.ibid.
additional cases further illustrate the critical distinction between a plaintiff bare allegations of unlawful activities and uncontroverted evidence of unlawful activities.in siam kizilbash th,d,the defendant allegedly false report to school officials that the plaintiff abused the defendant children was protected activity,notwithstanding the plaintiff allegation that the report was merely an attempt to manufacture corroboration for the defendant false accusations of abuse.id.at,d.in siam,as here,there was no uncontroverted evidentiary showing that the defendant report was false.similarly,in chabak monroy th,d,the defendant allegedly false report to police that the plaintiff inappropriately touched her was deemed protected activity because there was no uncontroverted evidentiary showing that the report was false.finally,in gerbosi,the plaintiff complaint against a law firm for invasion of privacy and related cla
