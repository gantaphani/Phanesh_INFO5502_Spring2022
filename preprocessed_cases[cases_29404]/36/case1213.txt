andrew and jamie parents appeal a judgment terminating their parental rights to their children,and parents argue the exception to termination of parental rights under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c d is unconstitutionally vague nevertheless,they assert section,subdivision c d precludes termination of parental rights because there was insufficient evidence to support the court finding the maternal grandfather grandfather was willing to adopt the children.parents further assert there was insufficient evidence to support the court finding the beneficial relationship exception to termination of parental rights under section,subdivision c a did not apply.
we conclude substantial evidence supports the trial court determination the exceptions under section,subdivision c a and d did not preclude termination of parental rights.

in april agency filed a supplemental petition under section,alleging andrew was no longer able to adequately care for the children.andrew was detained in the navy brig after pleading guilty to charges of methamphetamine possession and use,providing a false official statement and being absent from his unit.andrew admitted he was a heavy user of methamphetamine when he was younger and had been using on and off.jamie acknowledged she began using methamphetamine at age and,before she began treatment,used as often as every day.jamie successfully completed a drug treatment program in april and entered an aftercare program.however,she too relapsed.
jamie and andrew relationship was historically volatile,and domestic violence continued after the children were returned to their custody.in february andrew threw a peanut butter jar at jamie,bruising her.reported when daddy hits mommy,she sits on the couch and cries and i go and hug her.behavior deteriorated.school personnel reported he was defiant,aggressive and out of control.jamie was approximately seven weeks pregnant and appeared frazzled.at the second disposition hearing,the court allowed jamie to retain custody of the children on the condition andrew remain out of the home.

in august,at the third disposition hearing,the court terminated reunification services and referred the matter to a section permanency plan hearing permanency hearing.by that time,each child had been in six foster care placements.after a positive visit with the children in september,parents moved out of san diego county.in late october jamie gave birth to another son.parents visitation with the children became less frequent because of the distance and expense of travel and because parents feared agency would remove the baby from their custody.by december,behavior had stabilized in foster care.he and both appeared happy and.
on december,at the initial permanency hearing,agency recommended termination of parental rights and adoption.parents submitted on the report.the court did not determine if the children were adoptable but found adoption was in the children best interests and no exceptions to termination of parental rights applied.the court continued the permanency hearing for days to allow agency to find an adoptive home for the children,either with a relative or in foster care.the children attorney,jeanette day,requested agency evaluate grandfather home.
in january the children were placed with grandfather.grandfather asked parents to forgo visitation until he established a relationship with the children.the social worker reported the placement was going very well.grandfather told the social worker he preferred to remain the children grandpa but would not insist on guardianship for fear of losing his grandchildren to an adoptive placement.he was committed to offering the children a permanent and stable home.
