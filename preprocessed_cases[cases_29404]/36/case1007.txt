the san diego county health and human services agency agency and the minor children,adrianna,maurice,and collectively,the children appeal from orders directing the agency to provide reunification services to adrianna presumed father,andrew,and to maurice,the presumed father of,maurice,and 
today we decide two factually related cases that concern the grant and denial of family reunification services to the parents of the four dependent children.in the related nonpublished case,in re adrianna et,wl,we discuss esther appeal from orders removing the children from her custody and denying her reunification services.here we focus on appellants challenges to orders directing the agency to provide reunification services to andrew and maurice.to summarize our holdings and conclusions in their proper context,we briefly note the circumstances that gave rise to the issues presented in this appeal.
from may to june,adrianna and together,girls were dependents of the juvenile court due to esther physical abuse of adrianna and domestic violence between esther and maurice.adrianna father,andrew,was incarcerated for a lengthy period on felony drug charges.the agency offered andrew services and provided services to maurice to address domestic violence and substance abuse issues.at the review hearing,the court terminated the fathers services.about a year later,the court established a guardianship for the girls with maurice mother grandmother and retained jurisdiction.
two years after the guardianship was established,the court returned adrianna and to esther custody.maurice,was then almost months old,and was born several months later.the family received family maintenance services for six months without any reported problems.in june the court terminated jurisdiction.three weeks later the agency initiated dependency actions on behalf of all four children after it determined esther was physically abusing adrianna and.at that time,maurice was in jail.andrew remained incarcerated.
the agency recommended the court deny services to the parents and proceed to a permanency plan hearing under the bypass provisions of welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and e the court determined there was no clear legal direction as to the appropriate procedure to follow when the court had denied a noncustodial parent request for placement under section,subdivision a,and it was not clear the bypass provisions under section applied under the circumstances.over the objections of the children and the agency,the court ordered the agency to provide services to andrew and maurice.
appellants contend the court erred when it determined the bypass provisions under section did not apply to a noncustodial parent.they further contend the court erred when it did not deny services to andrew and maurice under section,subdivision b,and to andrew under section,subdivision e.
as we shall explain,we conclude the juvenile court erred as a matter of law when it determined section did not authorize the court to bypass services to a noncustodial parent who had requested and had been denied placement of his or her child under section,subdivision a.despite the court erroneous legal conclusion,we further conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered the agency to provide reunification services to maurice,and we affirm that order.we further conclude the court erred when it ordered the agency to provide reunification services to andrew,and we remand the case to the court with directions to vacate its order as to andrew.
factual and procedural background 
esther and maurice began living together when esther was pregnant with andrew daughter,adrianna,who was born in october.esther and maurice daughter,was born in june.
the record indicates andrew had some contact with adrianna during adrianna early years.however,starting in,andrew committed a series of offenses that resulted in his commitment in august to the california department of corrections and rehabilitation for a term of eight years eight months.
in may the agency detained the girls after esther struck adrianna with a belt and injured her.the court removed the girls from parental custody and ordered the agency to offer or provide reunification services to andrew,maurice and esther.
the agency referred maurice to a domestic violence program,counseling and substance abuse treatment for cannabis dependence and abuse.maurice initially participated in services and visited the children almost every day.however,toward the end of,maurice stopped participating in treatment and his visits with the girls became less frequent.
the agency sent andrew a prison packet in march.
during fall,after the agency recommended the court terminate reunification services,maurice reengaged in services and visited the girls more frequently.
in january the court terminated services to andrew and maurice,and continued services to esther.in december the court approved a permanent plan of guardianship for the girls with grandmother.maurice continued to visit the girls several times each week.
the record suggests maurice and esther lived together from time to time between and.maurice and esther had a son,maurice,in august,and a daughter,in march.maurice was convicted in october on a felony drug charge.in april he was again arrested on drug charges.maurice pleaded guilty to one count of possession of rock cocaine,and was sentenced to days in jail,less credits,and three years probation.
the court placed the girls with esther under a plan of family maintenance services in january,and terminated dependency jurisdiction on june.several weeks later,the agency learned esther had hit adrianna with a belt on a number of occasions,causing bruises.the agency detained all four children with grandmother and filed petitions under section,subdivisions a and j.
the agency recommended the court remove the children from esther custody,deny reunification services to the parents and set a section hearing.andrew requested legal custody of adrianna.maurice asked the court to place,maurice,and in his care.
the contested jurisdiction and disposition hearing was held on october,november and december,and january.the court admitted into evidence agency reports from and.social worker jonathan ogle testified in person and by stipulation.the court also accepted the stipulated testimony of maurice and maurice probation officer.
briefly,the evidence before the court showed,at maximum,andrew would be incarcerated until,although it was possible he might be eligible for release as early as.adrianna was reluctant to have any contact with andrew except through written correspondence.
after maurice was released from jail in he completed an anger management class and attended parenting classes.maurice participated in a substance abuse treatment group while waiting to enter a more intensive substance abuse treatment program.he tested negative for drugs in october.maurice attended classes on weekdays and visited the children on weekends.
after removing the children from esther custody,the court determined it would be detrimental to the children to place them with their fathers under section,subdivision a.the court noted section did not explicitly authorize the court to deny reunification services to a noncustodial parent whose request for placement of his or her child had been denied.the court stated it was not clear whether it could bypass services to maurice and andrew under section,subdivision b,and declined to exercise the option to deny services to andrew under section,subdivision e.the court stated it would err in an abundance of caution and ordered the agency to provide services to andrew and maurice.
discussion 
i.the issues raised on appeal are not moot 
andrew,maurice and esther respondents contend the issues raised on appeal have been rendered moot because andrew and maurice have received services for more than six months respondents argue because the ordered services can not be rescinded,this court can not grant effective relief and should therefore dismiss the appeal as moot.in re christina th,d.
appellants assert this action,if moot,involves a matter of continuing public interest that is likely to recur,and this court should exercise its inherent discretion to resolve the issue.in re robert th,d in re miguel th,d.
we exercise our discretion to resolve the issues of first impression raised here as matters of continuing public interest that are likely to recur.in re robert,supra,th at,d.
ii.section controls the provision and denial of reunification services to a noncustodial parent who has not assumed custody of his or her child under section,subdivision b 
appellants contend the juvenile court erred as a matter of law when it determined that it was without authority to deny services to a noncustodial parent pursuant to section where that parent requested placement but the court denied the request under section,subdivision a.appellants assert section is primarily a placement statute and argue that when a child is placed in care,section governs the grant or denial of reunification services to both the custodial parent and the noncustodial parent.more particularly,they contend the provisions of section that permit the court to bypass family reunification services apply to a noncustodial parent.
relying on prior case law authority,respondents assert section addresses the noncustodial parent circumstances and controls whether reunification services should be provided to that parent,while section is clearly directed to the custodial parent or parents.in re terry th,d terry.they contend appellate courts have consistently applied section to noncustodial parents and section only to custodial parents.robert superior court th,d robert superior court th,d in re th,d.accordingly,respondents assert that the bypass provisions of section do not apply to a noncustodial parent.
this issue presents a pure question of law,which we review de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
as a matter of first impression,we conclude section governs the grant or denial of reunification services to a noncustodial parent who has not assumed custody of his or her child under section,subdivision b.we reach this conclusion for several reasons.first,on its face,section addresses the court authority to grant or deny reunification services to a noncustodial parent only where a noncustodial parent assumes custody of the child,subd.b.it does not specifically address the court authority to grant or deny services to a noncustodial parent whose request for custody has been denied under section,subdivision a.
second,respondents application of terry and robert,both decided in a different factual context,are clearly distinguishable and of little value in deciding the issues presented here.moreover,in view of subsequent statutory changes,the dichotomy created by these cases between a custodial and noncustodial parent is no longer necessary or tenable.rather,where the court has removed the child from the physical custody of a parent under section and has determined it would be detrimental to place the child with a noncustodial parent under section,the court must order the agency to provide reunification services to the child mother and statutorily presumed father unless it determines that a statutory bypass exception applies under the relevant provisions of section,subds.b,c e.
third,in view of the clear public policy favoring family reunification and the equally clear policy disfavoring services where the reunification process would not be safe for the child,or would not benefit the child and waste limited public resources,we do not believe the legislature intended to leave a gap in the statutory framework concerning the grant or denial of services to a noncustodial parent.see,generally,in re aryanna th,d in re alanna th,d in re jesse th,d,b a xvi federal law requires reunification services except in specified circumstances.
we explain.
when a child has been removed from the physical custody of his or her parents under section,subdivision c the court must place the child in a safe home or setting,free from abuse or neglect.the safe placement of the child is governed by various provisions in the statutory scheme.see,see also.section governs placement when the child has a parent with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,subd.a,italics added.it directs that before the child may be placed in care,the court must first consider placing the child with the noncustodial parent,if that parent requests custody,supra,th at,d,supra,th at,d.
if the court places the child with the noncustodial parent,the court initially has three alternatives.the court may order the noncustodial parent to assume custody of the child,terminate juvenile court jurisdiction and enter a custody order,subd.b.it may continue juvenile court jurisdiction and require a home visit within three months,after which the court may make orders as provided in subdivision b,or,subd.b.or the court may order reunification services to be provided to either or both parents and determine at a later review hearing under section which parent,if either,shall have custody of the child,subd.b.
if the court determines the child placement with the noncustodial parent would be detrimental to the child safety,protection,or physical or emotional,the court is required to order the care,custody,and control of the child to be under the supervision of the social worker,subds.d,e see also,subds.f,g,h,i j addressing additional requirements and preferences concerning placement.
other than when section,subdivision b applies,section is silent on the issue of reunification services.thus the juvenile court observation that section did not authorize it to deny reunification services to andrew and maurice was valid.however,neither does section authorize the court to grant reunification services to a noncustodial parent who does not assume custody of his or her child.while respondents assert section does not apply to a parent in andrew and maurice circumstances,they do not identify any other statutory provision that would authorize the court to provide reunification services to a noncustodial parent who has not assumed custody of his or her child.further,respondents do not take into account the comprehensive nature of section.
within the statutory framework of the california dependency scheme,section generally governs the provision of family reunification services to the child parents.it also specifically describes the circumstances in which the court may and in some circumstances,must bypass those services,subds.b,e.the section details who is entitled to receive mandatory reunification services,who may receive reunification services,the circumstances under which the court may deny reunification services to someone otherwise entitled to receive them,and those circumstance under which the court must deny reunification services.given this comprehensive framework,the central importance of an appropriate reunification plan to the dependent child,and the carefully delineated exceptions to reunification services,it is unlikely the legislature intended to strip the court of its authority to deny services to a noncustodial parent pursuant to an applicable bypass provision simply because of the parent status as a noncustodial,as opposed to a custodial,parent.
statutory changes enacted in support this conclusion.effective january,the legislature enacted revisions to section and changed those entitled to reunification services under section,subdivision a.instead of using the term parents,the legislature clarified that the child mother and statutorily presumed father were entitled to receive reunification services,unless an exception applied.the amended statute also gave the court the discretion under certain circumstances to order services to the biological father.stats,ch.in enacting these revisions to section,subdivision a,the legislature did not distinguish between a custodial and noncustodial parent,although earlier cases such as terry and robert had interpreted the term parent to refer only to a custodial parent.because the legislature is deemed to be aware of judicial decisions in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light of prior cas
