introduction 
this is an appeal from an order of the probate court denying the claim of appellant terrold bean hereafter bean to be the equitably adopted son of decedent arthur patrick ford hereafter ford and hence inherit ford intestate estate.we affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in september,bean,then a little over one year old,was placed in the foster care of ford and his wife.at the time,the fords acted as foster parents for many children placed in their care by,mainly,the san francisco superior court.the fords were paid a monthly stipend by the city and county of san francisco for their foster care.bean was one of approximately foster children taken in by the fords at about the same time.
in early,bean was judicially freed from his natural mother care,custody and control and was thus available for adoption.bean remained as a foster child in the ford household for approximately years overall.during that period,many other foster children were reunited with their natural parents or adopted,but bean was never interviewed by any prospective adoptive parents nor was his name placed in the fords foster children register.he was also kept in the household even after the fords stopped accepting new foster children.during his years in the ford household,bean testified,they changed his religion from protestant to catholic,called him son in the presence of others,encouraged a relationship with their only child,mary catherine ford mary catherine,and included him in family vacations.similarly,he referred to the fords as mom and dad and to mary catherine as his sister.
the fords never applied to adopt bean.indeed,bean admitted that neither ford discussed the subject of adoption with him during his years with them,nor did they promise to adopt him or provide him with any inheritance.on the other hand,bean testified that mary catherine told him once that her parents had wanted to adopt him,but did not do so due to unspecified problems with the natural mother and paperwork.similarly,a former neighbor and friend of the fords testified that the fords wanted to adopt bean,but ford was worried that,if they tried to do so,bean might be temporarily removed from their custody and mistreated.
in,ford died.bean,although then,stayed at the ford home for another two years and during that period,he financially contributed to the household from his income as a butcher.in,at age,he left the ford household and a few years later was married.ford loaned bean to start a new household,and later forgave a balance when bean marriage failed.throughout this time,bean continued to stay in touch with both ford and mary catherine.
in,ford suffered a fall and disabling stroke.mary catherine,who never married,was apparently unable to cope with ford medical needs,and bean persuaded her that ford needed to be placed in an elder care facility.bean visited ford in that facility on a regular basis.
later in,mary catherine died of cancer her life insurance proceeds were designated to go to her father,ford.bean,identified in the policy as her brother,was named as alternate beneficiary.the same former neighbor and friend of the fords testified that mary catherine had assumed she would outlive her father and intended to put bean name on the house with mine because i have no other family.
in any event,after mary catherine death bean obtained a temporary power of attorney from ford and petitioned the superior court for the appointment of a longtime family friend who lived near ford care facility,joan malpassi,as ford conservator.bean and malpassi participated in the decision to put ford on life support systems at his nursing home and,during the same general period,also arranged for mary catherine funeral.bean was appointed administrator of the latter estate,which was distributed to the ford conservatorship.
on may,ford died intestate.his nearest relatives,respondents herein,were his nephew,john ford iii,and his niece,veronica newbeck.neither had any contact with ford over the last years of his life.malpassi,the conservator,advised the nephew of his uncle and cousin death via counsel.on june,both malpassi and ford nephew filed petitions for letters of administration.the nephew petition listed only himself as ford heir,while malpassi listed the nephew,ford niece three sons,and bean as potential heirs.the nephew was apparently under the impression that his sister was deceased,and had so advised malpassi counsel.on july,the probate court appointed malpassi special administrator.on august,the nephew filed a petition to determine heirship,this time listing both himself and his sister as ford heirs.on october,bean filed a statement of interest,claiming to be entitled to distribution of ford entire estate based on both foster child heirship and the doctrine of equitable adoption.
a bench trial was held on december,and briefs filed both before and after trial.on march,the court issued its tentative ruling holding,inter alia,that because bean did not meet the foster child heirship requirements of section,he had not proven equitable adoption.bean counsel filed objections contending,inter alia,that the court tentative decision confused the two concepts and that,in any event,the standard of clear and convincing evidence was not applicable to a claim of equitable adoption under section.
on april,the trial court issued a revised ruling and order denying bean claim.in it,the court concluded that there was no clear and convincing evidence of an intent by ford to equitably adopt bean,and thus denied bean claim.a timely notice of appeal was filed.see,subd.g.
iii.discussion 
a.the trial court ruling and issues on appeal 
initially,bean contended before the trial court that he was entitled to the entire ford estate under both sections and.the former provides,inter alia,that a foster child may inherit via intestate succession if the foster relationship continued throughout the joint lifetimes and there is clear and convincing evidence that the foster parent would have adopted the foster child but for a legal barrier.by the time his trial brief was filed,however,bean had apparently abandoned any argument based on section and,instead,argued solely the applicability of the equitable adoption doctrine recognized by section.that section provides,simply nothing in this chapter affects or limits application of the judicial doctrine of equitable adoption for the benefit of the child or the child issue.
nonetheless,the trial court ruled on bean claim under both sections.regarding his claim under section,it first characterized that section as dealing with the equitable adoption of foster children,but then ruled that bean did not fall within that section because there was no evidence,much less clear and convincing evidence,of the requisite legal barrier.
regarding bean equitable adoption claim under section,the trial court first summarized the holdings in the authorities principally relied upon by bean,and then distinguished them by contrast,in the instant case,there is no evidence that decedent ever told terrold or anyone else that he wanted to adopt him nor publicly told anyone that terrold was his adopted son.nor was terrold given use of the family surname.the fact the fords retained terrold in their home for years without making him available for adoption by someone else is not,in and of itself,a public acknowledgement of an intent to adopt.although it is clear that terrold had an affectionate relationship with decedent who treated him as he would a son,and that terrold continued to have contact with him for years after leaving the home,these factors are not sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended to and did equitably adopt terrold.
bean appeals only from the trial court ruling regarding equitable adoption under section as to that section,bean claims that the trial court erred in requiring clear and convincing evidence of equitable adoption and requiring evidence of intent to adopt.both contentions implicate issues of law and hence our review of them is de novo.
