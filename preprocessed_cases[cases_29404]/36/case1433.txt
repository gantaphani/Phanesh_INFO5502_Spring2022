discussion 
dcfs has complied with the notice requirements of the icwa.
father contends dcfs failed to comply with the notice requirements of the icwa because dcfs did not include the children paternal grandfather name on the notices it sent to the blackfeet tribe and did not send notice of the proceedings to one of the federally recognized cherokee tribes.based on these grounds,father asks this court to reverse the order removing his children from his custody.
the icwa is designed to protect the interests of the indian child and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.it sets forth the manner in which a tribe may obtain jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving an indian child or intervene in the state court proceedings the notice requirements of the icwa ensure a tribe will have the opportunity to assert its rights under the statute 
section,a of the icwa sets forth the following requirements for proper notice in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary of the interior in like manner,who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or indian custodian and the tribe.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary california courts have concluded a juvenile court failure to secure compliance with these notice requirements constitutes prejudicial error 
notice to a tribe under the icwa must include the name of a child grandparents and any other information set forth in the bia guidelines at code of federal regulations part d,to the extent such information is known.
father contends dcfs failed to give proper notice under the icwa because it did not include the children paternal grandfather name on the notices it sent to the blackfeet tribe.father argues the omission of the grandfather s name from the notices to the blackfoot sic t ribe very well may invalidate any determination by the blackfoot sic tribe that and are not indian children.
in california,an agency providing notice of dependency proceedings to a tribe under the icwa is required to use form soc issued by the state of california health and welfare agency and the department of social services entitled notice of involuntary child custody proceeding involving an indian child.on this form is the following language required substitution permitted.this form provides a tribe with information about a child parents names,tribal affiliation,birthplaces and birthdates,and notice of the dependency proceedings and of the tribe right to intervene.california courts have concluded an agency complies with the notice requirements of the icwa when it fills out form soc and sends it to the appropriate tribe s,by registered mail with return receipt requested,and files with the juvenile court the completed form and proof of its service on the tribe 
the state of california health and welfare agency and the department of social services also issued form soc entitled request for confirmation of child status as indian.this form,which an agency also may send to a tribe,includes spaces for inserting information about a child family history,including the names and t
