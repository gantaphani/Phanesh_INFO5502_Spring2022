factual and procedural background 
predetention efforts to avoid intervention 
in august the los angeles county department of children and family services department received a referral that shahida was abusing illicit drugs when kadence was in her custody and had been inconsistent in taking the medication prescribed for her diagnosed bipolar disorder and anxiety.a department social worker went to shahida home in palmdale to investigate,but the apartment was empty neighbors explained shahida and kadence had recently,and abruptly,moved.the department finally located shahida and kadence in nevada,where shahida explained she had gone to meet the social worker assigned to her older children dependency case,filed in washoe county,nevada in june shahida told the department she had been clean and sober for more than two and years and was in the process of reunifying with her older children,who had been placed with shahida sister in los angeles county in accordance with a nevada juvenile court case plan.shahida social worker in nevada confirmed shahida had been compliant with her case plan during her pregnancy with kadence and for several weeks after kadence birth,but appeared recently to have relapsed.she had not appeared at several drug tests,and the one time she did test the results were inconclusive due to a diluted sample.shahida sister similarly told the department that shahida appeared recently to be under the influence of illicit drugs when she visited the children.
shahida denied using any drugs other than her prescribed medication for anxiety and depression.at the department request,on september,shahida agreed to submit to a drug test but staff at the testing center observed shahida with some type of device and,as a result,deemed her test invalid.shahida denied bringing a device with her.when asked by the staff at the testing center and the department to retake the test,she became angry and refused.on september,shahida brought kadence to meet with department social worker,who observed kadence to be overall in good health.afterward,however,shahida failed to respond to the department multiple efforts to contact her to arrange for a team decisionmaking meeting and further drug testing.
the dependency petition 
on october,the department filed a petition under section alleging shahida had a long history of substance abuse,was a current abuser of methamphetamine and marijuana and her substance abuse had led to the removal of her three older children in ongoing dependency proceedings in washoe county,nevada.the petition also alleged that shahida suffered from diagnosed and only intermittently treated bipolar disorder and anxiety and her emotional instability and substance abuse rendered her incapable of providing regular care for then kadence.a first amended petition,filed december,added the allegation that robert had been arrested on october,for assaulting his female companion and brandishing a firearm,violent conduct that placed kadence at risk of physical harm.neither shahida nor robert appeared at the initial detention hearing.after concluding the department had made a prima facie showing that kadence was a person described by section,the court issued an arrest warrant for shahida and a protective custody warrant for kadence and ordered kadence detained as soon as she was found.shahida and kadence were located in december,and kadence was immediately detained and placed with her paternal aunt.
the jurisdiction and disposition hearings 
at the march,jurisdiction hearing the department presented evidence of shahida long history of substance abuse,the ongoing dependency proceedings in nevada and her predetention failures to drug test.in addition,shahida had failed to appear for multiple drug tests,including tests,between december and march despite the court and the department efforts to provide convenient test locations.the department also reported that shahida had appeared at a testing facility in nevada in december in connection with her dependency proceedings for her older children,but walked out after being told the test would be conducted using an oral swab,explaining she was not prepared to take that type of test.shahida did appear at a testing facility in tarzana on march,demanding to drug test,but,to her frustration,she was turned away.social workers explained to her that random drug tests,by nature,can not be scheduled at the election of the person required to test.at the time of the jurisdiction hearing,shahida had failed to take a single drug test since the department became involved in the case.the department also reported that the juvenile court in nevada had terminated reunification services due to shahida noncompliance with the case plan.
as to the allegations of her emotional instability,shahida acknowledged to social workers she suffered from anxiety and depression,but denied it was untreated.she was under the care of a psychiatrist in nevada who was treating her condition with medication.shahida explained she had run out of her medication,but said she had a scheduled appointment with her psychiatrist to obtain more and planned to go to urgent care in california if necessary.
the court sustained each of the allegations in the petition,explaining,t he department was trying to give her a chance.and i think it not just that she was cooperative.i have to think she was actively trying not to cooperate because if she had that would have provided evidence s he was ordered by the court in february to walk across the street and drug test.and she did do that.i mean that is completely,i think,indicative of her level of denial well,denial of a problem or actual attempt to hide the problem so i think that given all of the circumstances in this case,the whole totality of the situation,her past history,her history of refusing to be tested,her current level of noncooperation with the department,and her defiance of a court order,it pretty significant evidence that i believe she hiding,trying to hide the fact that she still using drugs.the court also found shahida suffered from mental and emotional problems that,coupled with her drug use,also put kadence at risk of harm.the court declared kadence a dependent child of the court,removed her from parental custody and ordered family reunification services for both parents.
icwa findings 
initially,shahida denied any indian ancestry and on september,completed a questionnaire to that effect.however,on december,at the initial hearing on the amended section petition,shahida indicated that kadence may be a member or eligible for membership in the blackfeet indian tribe the court ordered the department to contact the maternal grandmother to confirm any indian ancestry.on january,the maternal grandmother reported that her father side of the family had blackfeet indian ancestry and recalled photographs of her father ancestors in indian dress.she explained the maternal had died nine years earlier and she lacked any additional knowledge of indian ancestry.she said she would call her brother to obtain additional information.
on february,maternal grandmother reported that her brother,ron jones,had confirmed creek indian ancestry.jones also told the department directly that maternal grandmother was percent creek and maternal grandmother was half white and half seminole.he was unsure about any blackfeet ancestry.the department asked the court to advise which tribes should be noticed based on the information obtained on february,the court found the department information confusing as to blackfeet ancestry the court continued the adjudication hearing and ordered the department to reinterview the family.
robert also had initially denied any indian ancestry on december,but on february,indicated his grandmother may have been cherokee.the court ordered the department to address robert possible indian ancestry in a supplemental report.
in a information for the court in connection with the march,jurisdiction hearing,the department reported the maternal great uncle,after consulting with senior relatives,had no further information about any blackfeet ancestry.as to robert possible indian ancestry,the paternal grandfather believed his mother kadence paternal was cherokee,although he was not certain.
at the jurisdiction hearing,the court found shahida claim of possible blackfeet ancestry could not be substantiated by any family member and,therefore,the court had no reason to know kadence was an indian child.the court did not expressly address information regarding her possible seminole or creek ancestry.as to robert claim of indian ancestry,the court made a finding that,at this point,it had no reason to believe icwa applied,but ordered the department to provide notice to the cherokee tribe.the court proceeded to adjudicate the petition,stating it would recall and retry the matter if it later obtained information,after notice to the cherokee tribe,that icwa applied.
discussion 
governing law and standard of review 
the purpose of section is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.see in re giovanni th.section,subdivision b,allows a child to be adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court when t he child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse.
although section generally requires proof the child is subject to the defined risk of harm at the time of the jurisdiction hearing in re savannah th,in re rocco th,the court need not wait until a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take steps necessary to protect the child.in re th.the court may consider past events in deciding whether a child currently needs the court protection.ibid.a parent p ast conduct may be probative of current conditions if there is reason to believe that the conduct will continue.in re th,accord,in re christopher th.
in addition,the legislature has declared,the provision of a home environment free from the negative effects of substance abuse is a necessary condition for the safety,protection and physical and emotional of the child.successful participation in a treatment program for substance abuse may be considered in evaluating the home environment.exercise of dependency court jurisdiction under section,subdivision b,is proper when a child is of such tender years that the absence of adequate supervision and care poses an inherent risk to his or her health and safety.in re rocco,supra,th at accord,in re christopher,supra,th at.

the court jurisdiction finding is supported by substantial evidence 
shahida contends the jurisdiction finding that kadence was at substantial risk of harm is not supported by substantial evidence,insisting there was no evidence she had resumed using drugs and,even assuming she had,no evidence kadence was actually at risk of any harm in her care.in fact,she asserts,kadence was observed to be in overall good health.
contrary to shahida contention,there was ample evidence she was hiding her current drug use.she avoided or refused to take drug tests she provided diluted samples when she did appear at a facility to test and one occasion tried to alter a test result.this is not a record devoid of evidence of drug use.as we have previously explained,a missed drug test,without adequate justification,is properly considered the equivalent of a positive test result.in re christopher,supra,th at.the fact that kadence has not yet been harmed by such use,without more,is not determinative.in re,supra,th at.there was substantial evidence the continuous illicit drug use that had led to the removal of shahida older children was continuing and kadence,an infant,was at substantial risk of harm.see christopher,at a finding of substance abuse by a parent of a child under six years old is prima facie evidence of that parent inability to provide regular care resulting in a substantial risk of harm in re drake,supra th at same.
remand is necessary for the juvenile court to comply with icwa 
icwa reflects a congressional determination that it is in the best interests of indian children to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations,see in re th,in re alexandria th,see also welf,subd.a.it is intended to protect indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.in re karla th,see also in re suzanna th.for purposes of icwa,an indian child is a child who is either a member of an indian tribe or is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.welf,subd.a adopting federal definitions.

juvenile courts and child protective agencies have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a dependent child is or may be an indian child.in re th,cal.rules of court,rule.as soon as practicable,the social worker is required to interview the child parents,extended family members,the indian custodian,if any,and any other person who can reasonably be expected to have information concerning the child membership status or eligibility,subd.c in re shane th,cal.rules of court,rule a.
