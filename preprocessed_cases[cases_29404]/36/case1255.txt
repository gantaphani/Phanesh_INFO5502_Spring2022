elvina appeals from an order summarily denying her modification petition under welfare and institutions code section and from an order under section,subdivision b identifying adoption as the permanent placement goal for her son ramone and allowing days for finding an appropriate adoptive family.the latter order was premised on a finding that ramone has a probability for adoption but is difficult to place,and required the court to proceed with either adoption or legal guardianship as his permanent placement at the end of the period,subd.c.ramone was currently placed in a foster home with a specially trained caretaker to help provide for his medical and other special needs.
we affirm the denial of the section petition.we reverse the section,subdivision b order because there was no evidence ramone adoption was probable.the court abused its discretion by foreclosing foster care as a placement option under the circumstances of this case.
background 
ramone was born in may.on july,the san francisco department of human services dhs detained ramone and placed him in emergency foster care after elvina brought him to an emergency room with severe burns on his lower body.according to the detention report,elvina claimed the burns occurred while ramone was with his father cousin,but this account was soon proven false.elvina could not identify the cousin address,and said the cousin had taken ramone for a visit with his father in jail,but there was no jail visitation at the time.ramone had first degree burns on his torso and right arm,and second and third degree burns on his feet,ankles,and genitals.the burns appeared to be a day or two old and were consistent with immersion in scalding water.
it was discovered that earlier in july,elvina had taken ramone to an emergency room in los angeles,where it was determined that he needed antibiotics.elvina did not want him admitted,became belligerent with hospital staff,and fled the hospital with ramone still attached to an intravenous tube.ramone had been hospitalized the previous march for an abscess.elvina had failed to take him for his appointment,or for his routine immunizations.
elvina reported that she was unemployed and received only medical assistance,but that her sister and cousin were supporting her financially.a sister said she did not know how elvina was supporting ramone she thought they were receiving welfare.elvina had been removed from her parents care at the age of.she repeatedly left her placements and associated with drug dealers,becoming involved in assaultive robbery and,allegedly,prostitution.she was adjudicated a section ward in december.she was years old when ramone was born.the social worker reported that elvina was argumentative and hostile after ramone was detained.
the disposition report filed in september stated that elvina was now claiming ramone had been with her boyfriend when he was burned.she said the boyfriend,whom she refused to identify,had prepared a bath for ramone when the child crawled into the tub by himself.however,the burn pattern was consistent with dunking,not crawling.elvina said she would attend parenting classes but refused to undergo substance abuse assessment.there was a warrant for her arrest based on her failure to promptly seek medical care for ramone burns.an investigator had reportedly learned that elvina boyfriend was also her pimp,and was previously involved with another child who died in a bathtub.
elvina failed to appear for one visit with ramone,failed to confirm another which was then cancelled,and arrived late for two others.during the first visit,ramone was hesitant and apprehensive with elvina,who became irate and confrontive sic when she overheard the social worker talking about discharging ramone into foster care.at the second visit,ramone screamed when elvina tried to restrain him on her lap,and she became visibly frustrated.elvina left minutes before the scheduled two hours were up.ramone was discharged from the hospital on august,and was doing well in a medically fragile infant mfi foster home.he was on antibiotics,and his burn wounds required him to wear compression stockings hours a day.the department was planning to pursue placement with shamika,a paternal cousin.
an addendum report filed in october stated that ramone screamed throughout the day and night,as if he were in pain.he had a hard time making eye contact with his caregiver.shamika had been unable to handle him,and he was placed in another mfi home.elvina had been arrested and jailed after pleading guilty to a charge of child endangerment under penal code,section,subdivision a.dhs recommended that no reunification services be provided to elvina because of her role in ramone severe injuries,subd.b.the report noted that ramone alleged father had an extensive criminal history,and was currently incarcerated for possession of cocaine and a firearm.
in another addendum report filed in december,dhs said it had decided to place ramone with a maternal aunt,eva,the only relative assessed without a criminal or child abuse history.a gradual transition was contemplated.during the combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing in,elvina filed a waiver of her right to reunification services.the court took jurisdiction over ramone,continued his foster care placement,and scheduled a hearing under section.
dhs filed a section report in march.foster care was the proposed permanent plan.ramone,though still very needy,both emotionally and physically,was said to be thriving in his mfi foster home.an old fracture had been discovered in his right arm.he was prone to angry tantrums,and did not sleep at night instead,he banged his head,kicked,screamed,and removed his clothes and bedding and threw them on the floor.eva had visited ramone three times but stopped coming in february,without telling dhs why.recently,however,she had participated in a meeting at which a renewed visitation plan was discussed.if everything was going well by a scheduled visit on april,placement with her was planned.elvina was in jail and the criminal court had ordered her to stay away from ramone.
an addendum report filed in may stated that eva had made one visit,come at the wrong time for another,and never returned since or communicated with the social worker.nevertheless,dhs now recommended that the court find a probability of adoption,with a continuance to find an adoptive home.ramone arm had been examined and it was decided not to rebreak and reset it,though such a procedure might be necessary when he was years old.dhs reported that he continued to thrive in the mfi home,but he also continued to exhibit all the symptoms noted in the previous report.
in june,dhs moved to suspend elvina visitation,though she had not seen ramone since the previous august.elvina had been released from jail on may,and a condition of her probation was that she have no contact with ramone.the social worker,karan sjolin,reported that in addition to his head banging and violent tantrums,ramone emotional problems included playing with his feces.
the section hearing was continued to august.on august,elvina filed her modification petition under section.she requested reunification services,based on the following changed circumstances she was no longer incarcerated she had successfully completed anger management and parenting classes she was trying to enroll in individual therapy she would like to reunify with ramone and was willing to provide him with a stable permanent home there were no other identified persons willing to provide him with a permanent home she could give ramone providers insight into his unique personality,and his likes and dislikes she was willing to help transport ramone and participate in his services and ramone would benefit from consistent contact with her.
at the beginning of the august hearing,the commissioner summarily denied elvina modification petition,ruling she had failed to make a prima facie showing of changed circumstances that might justify finding reunification services would be in ramone best interest.
two witnesses then testified,karan sjolin and judy pekarsky.pekarsky was the clinical psychologist who supervised ramone therapist,a psychology intern who was a doctoral student.pekarsky had never actually met ramone or his foster mother.her direct testimony consisted of an offer of proof read into the record by counsel for dhs.this testimony related that the foster mother reported prolonged tantrums and smearing of feces when ramone was alone in his crib.pekarsky observed ramone behavior problems indicate that the ordinary events of his daily life are experienced as difficult and highly distressing for him.the contributors to ramone difficulties are doubtless complex and still not entirely clear.his extremely traumatic experience surrounding the burn he received and the lengthy painful and frightening medical treatment for it have certainly been highly influential in creating ramone anxiety and wariness.
pekarsky noted that beginning in september,ramone would have weekly individual visits with a psychologist,and sometime in the next two months a developmental neuropsychologist would begin an assessment to clarify his constitutional developmental and cognitive capacities and vulnerabilities.she added it is clear that at months ramone has already experienced significant traumas and difficulties and is showing obvious behavioral problems and symptoms.at this point,the introduction of any new experience which is likely to be confusing or to provoke strong feelings such as visits with elvina may be expected to increase ramone distress.
on,pekarsky was asked whether it would be unlikely that an adoptive family would be found for ramone.she replied i do think it would be easy.i certainly have been involved in cases where it happened and was a good thing for the child.
sjolin,the social worker,testified that since the plan to place ramone with eva had fallen through,dhs was exploring the possibility of placing him with paula,a paternal cousin.an assessment of paula had not been completed,but she had indicated she was open to adoption if the father was okay with it.a background check had revealed an outstanding warrant for paula,but that had since been cleared up.
sjolin said the foster mother reported ramone continued to have tantrums,bang his head,and play with his feces during the night.he was standoffish,not wanting to interact,but was getting better with that.the foster mother was having trouble sleeping because of the constant head banging at night.child care was being provided for ramone to give the foster mother some respite.a communication evaluation had been done for ramone a year earlier,concluding he had moderate to severe language delays.speech therapy had been recommended but not provided.sjolin thought there was a more recent communication assessment,but did not know who performed it and had no report.in her most recent visits with ramone,at the end of july,he was extremely limited verbally.sjolin had never asked ramone foster mother whether she was interested in adoption or legal guardianship,because sjolin did feel the foster mother would be interested.she believed it would be detrimental to change ramone placement,unless it were to a permanent caregiver.a failed placement would traumatize him further.
in closing arguments,counsel for ramone conceded it would be difficult to place him,but noted pekarsky testimony that she could say it could happen.counsel for the father argued it was premature to make a finding that adoption was probable,in view of ramone difficult behaviors and the fact that dhs had not provided a recent speech assessment or developmental evaluation.he asked the court to continue ramone in his foster placement.elvina counsel contended there was no evidence to support a finding that adoption was probable,and asked the court to make a finding under section,subdivision c c t he child is placed in a residential treatment facility,adoption is unlikely or undesirable,and continuation of parental rights will not prevent finding the child a permanent family placement if the parents can not resume custody when residential care is no longer needed.counsel claimed that eva and elvina father wanted to be considered for placement.
counsel for dhs disputed the notion that a child with special needs like ramone has no probability of adoption.she asked the court to grant dhs request for days to finalize its assessment of the paternal cousin who previously had not been ruled out but whose assessment was stopped because of the bench warrant,which now seems to have been lifted.counsel noted it was not until today that we have heard that the maternal aunt,eva,is again interested,and the maternal grandfather again today through mother counsel is letting the department know about possibly being interested again.
the court ruled that ramone adoption was probable,though he would be difficult to place.it said his current problems did not preclude this finding,because the very argument of some of those that were opposing this recommendation have put forth the names of individuals that are actually interested in adoption.the court was unwilling to prolong the matter by setting it over for a placement.the court agreed with sjolin assessment that changing placements would be harmful for ramone if he going to be going to a place we feel will be permanent,so be it.we will begin a transition period.we not going to be bouncing him from place to place,that would be the worst thing that could happen to him.
the court also granted dhs visitation motion,finding it would be detrimental to ramone to have visits with elvina.elvina offers no arguments on appeal against this ruling.
discussion 
the modification petition 
we review the summary denial of elvina section petition for abuse of discretion.in re brittany th,d.elvina was required to make a prima facie showing of a genuine change of circumstances or new evidence sufficient to justify a finding that providing her with reunification services would be in ramone best interest.id.at,d in re marilyn cal th,d,in re anthony th,d.the allegations of her petition were to be liberally construed,but conclusory claims are insufficient to require a hearing.specific descriptions of the evidence constituting changed circumstances is required.successful petitions have included declarations or other attachments which demonstrate the showing the petitioner will make at a hearing of the change in circumstances or new evidence.in re anthony,supra,th at,d.
elvina petition fell well short of establishing the kind of prima facie showing that might have merited a hearing.it was not verified,in violation of section,subdivision a and rule a of the california rules of court.elvina provided no sworn declaration to support her counsel allegations.
even taken at face value,those allegations would not amount to a prima facie case for providing reunification services.the fact that elvina was out of jail was itself not necessarily in ramone best interest,given that she had been in jail for her role in his severe burn injuries.her desire to provide ramone with a stable home was irrelevant,absent any suggestion she was able to do so.her insight into his personality was of questionable value,given her history with him and the fact that she had not seen him for a year.her completion of anger management and parenting classes,which were conditions of her probation,were new circumstances but by themselves did not support a finding that ramone interests would be served by beginning reunification services at this late stage in the dependency proceedings.similarly,elvina willingness to participate in services was not a compelling consideration at this point in the process.
on the eve of a section hearing,the child interest in stability is the court foremost concern,outweighing the parent interest in reunification.thus,a section petition seeking reinstatement or,in this case,initiation of reunification services must be directed at the best interest of the child.in re anthony,supra,th at,d in re edward th,d in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.elvina concedes her claim that ramone would benefit from contact with her is merely conclusory.none of her other unsworn allegations required a hearing to determine if ramone would benefit from reunification services for hi
