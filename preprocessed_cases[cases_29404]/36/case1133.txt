appellant roger schlafly,former husband of respondent julie schlafly,appeals from an order modifying child support.roger claims that the court erred in imposing a child support payment that deviated from the guideline amount and in retroactively modifying child support without using actual income figures.roger also claims the court erred in imposing an attorney fees order contradicting an earlier order by the court.we conclude that the court erred in imputing of income per month based on roger housing.we therefore reverse the december,child support order and remand the action for further proceedings.we affirm the attorney fees order.
background 
roger and julie married in december and have two minor children,millicent born in and geneva born in.millicent was born three weeks after julie graduated from law school,about six months into the marriage,and julie remained at home throughout the marriage to care for the children.roger,a mathematician,is and is an independent contractor in the computer software industry.in addition to other assets,roger owns a minority interest in a corporation,several patents,his own business,and a home.
the couple separated in october,and julie filed for dissolution of marriage.the parties initially split custody of the children by mutual agreement,and,in july,the court ordered roger to provide julie a temporary support payment of per month.the court also set a hearing in august to discuss financial issues and ordered roger to file and serve an income and expense declaration and to provide recent tax returns.
during the august,hearing,the court the honorable thomas kelly presiding chastised roger for providing evasive answers and incomplete information regarding his financial situation.the court ultimately ordered in child support,retroactive to july.in doing so,the court deviated from the guideline amount of based on roger living in house worth.the additional increased roger total support payment to per month.the support order was made retroactively modifiable so that it could be revised when the court had more information on father actual income and on julie efforts to enter the work force.
on november,roger custody percentage decreased from percent to approximately percent.on may,the court conducted another status hearing regarding financial issues.judge kelly modified the temporary support figures to reflect the adjusted timeshare,retroactive to november.in doing so,the court expressly stated that it was not taking into account the fact that roger lived in a house since today is a snapshot,temporary order,i not going to depart from guideline based on a lack of mortgage but she going to make an argument next month i should depart from guideline as i did before.the child support order thus was modified to,the dissomaster guideline amount based on the financial information then available.the court again ordered roger to produce financial documents,intending to address the housing issue at a later hearing when the court believed more accurate information would be available.the support orders were again made retroactively modifiable,and the court entered a judgment of dissolution as to status only.
roger provided julie with his tax return in october,and a new hearing was set for december before commissioner irwin joseph,who took over the case from judge kelly.on december,the court issued a new child support order of,effective january,based on changed income and timeshare for father.the court ordered further modification,effective january,to,based on an anticipated increase in roger timeshare to percent.in calculating the new payments,the court imputed a percent rate of return for roger stock market portfolio as taxable income and imputed in income per month based on roger housing.after calculating the guideline amount,the court added to provide for the children education and activities,split evenly between the parties.julie waived her rights to any future spousal support.
in the december order,the court also addressed past support payments.the court modified the child support order effective november,to account for roger housing,noting that judge kelly failed to perpetuate his calculated deviation for father housing circumstance.in this instance,the court adopted judge kelly approach and added to the guideline amount.
roger filed a motion for modification,deemed a motion for reconsideration,contesting both the december child support order and a december order regarding attorney fees.the court denied the motion on february.roger timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
statutory guidelines regulate the determination of child support in california.see.the guidelines set forth several important principles relating to child support determinations,including that the interests of the child are the state top priority,a parent principal obligation is to support his or her children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,children should share in both parents standard of living,and in cases in which both parents have high levels of responsibility for the children,child support orders should reflect the increased costs of raising the children in two homes and should minimize significant disparities in the children living standards in the two homes,subd.a b,d g.the guideline amount of child support,which is calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the relative incomes of the parents,is presumptively correct.see,subd.a in re marriage of de guigne th,d de guigne.the court may depart from the guideline only in special circumstances set forth in the child support statutes.county of stanislaus gibbs th,d.
a child support order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton th,d cheriton see also in re marriage of destein th,d destein a trial court decision to impute income to a parent for child support purposes based on the parent earning capacity is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.we determine whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.de guigne,supra,th,d.we do not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court,but determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order.ibid.
in this case,roger claims the court erroneously deviated from the guideline amount by imputing a rate of return to his stock portfolio that exceeds the actual rate of return,by including of income based on his housing,and by imposing a discretionary for the children activities.he also claims the court failed to comply with section,modified a temporary child support order using inaccurate figures,and erred in ordering him to pay an additional in julie attorney fees.
imputation of percent rate of return 
roger first objects to the court imputation of a percent rate of return on his stock market portfolio.at the time of the order,roger portfolio contained approximately million in assets and,according to roger,paid dividends of about percent annually roger contends that because the portfolio was the court was required to use the actual income received and was not authorized to impute additional income.we disagree.
section,which defines annual gross income for purposes of child support calculations,expressly provides the court may,in its discretion,consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent income,consistent with the best interests of the children,subd.b.this earning capacity doctrine embraces the ability to earn from capital as well as labor.de guigne,supra,th at,d see also mejia reed cal th,d,i n assessing earning capacity,a trial court may take into account the earnings from invested assets.just as a parent can not shirk his parental obligations by reducing his earning capacity through unemployment or underemployment,he can not shirk the obligation to support his child by underutilizing assets.in re marriage of dacumos th,d dacumos,emphasis added.
in this case,the court implicitly determined that roger percent return on almost million of assets was an underutilization of the assets and that imputing a higher rate of return was in the best interests of the children.the court explained that the percent figure was a more accurate reflection on the value of the assets unless roger was earning at least percent annually in the stock market,he would invest in bonds and be guaranteed a percent return.this determination was within the court discretion.see in re marriage of labass th,d labass section is unmistakably clear that the only qualification to the discretionary imputation of income is that it be consistent with the children best interest.destein,supra,th at,d o ur supreme court has refused to read any limitation into a trial court discretion to impute income when in the child best interests.
the court decision is by california caselaw.dacumos,supra,th,d provides one persuasive example.in that case,the father owned two rental properties that generated higher expenses than the amount received in rent.id.at,d.the trial court nevertheless imputed rental income based on the fair market rental value of the properties and the father net equity in the properties.ibid.the appellate court concluded that a broad definition of earning capacity to include income that could be derived from assets as well as from work is in accord with the legislative intent and found no error.id.at,d.we find no basis to distinguish dacumos,in which the properties were utilized as rentals but were underperforming,from the case at hand.roger million stock market portfolio earns only the barest amount of income,and,thus,is underutilized as an asset.
roger cites as support in re marriage of pearlstein th,d,in which the court held that stock received in the sale of the father business was a capital asset,not income.the court holding is not contrary to the approach taken in this case.the pearlstein court in fact held that although the stock was a capital asset,in the court discretion,a reasonable rate of investment return could be imputed to the value of the stock that was available for sale,and that amount added to the father gross income.id.at,d.that is precisely the approach taken in this case.
roger argument that the imputation is invalid because the court has no authority to direct his investment strategy also is unavailing.the trial court has broad discretionary authority to impute income and need not defer to the parent choice of investment.destein,supra,th at,d.roger decision to prioritize future value over current income does not mean that the million in assets must be disregarded as a source of support.as the destein court explained,quoting an opinion by the new york court of appeals,a parent may be required to make his considerable assets earn income which,by an objective standard,is commensurate with at least a conservative estimate of what they are capable of producing,and,when he fails to do so,he may be treated as though he had his decision to let them grow for his own future benefit is not one which the courts are obliged to honor in all circumstances.id.at,d,internal quotations omitted,quoting kay kay.ignoring the stock market portfolio,or recognizing only a small fraction of its substantial value,would effectively permit roger to avoid his obligation to support his children according to his ability,his circumstances and station in life,and his standard of living.see cheriton,supra,th at,d,quoting,subds.a,d f see also destein,supra,th at,d noting that a parent may not place a source of possible income through his or her choice of investment.
we next consider the court use of percent as a reasonable rate of return.as roger rightly contends,figures for earning capacity can not be drawn from thin air they must have some tangible evidentiary foundation.in re marriage of cohn th,d.in this case,however,we find ample support for the imputed rate of return.
at the december hearing,the court explained that percent represents the minimum anticipated return on investment for bonds or certificates of deposit.roger did not contest the assumption that percent was a reasonable rate of return for these types of investments,just that they were not his preferred forms of investment in fact,roger acknowledged that certificates of deposit and some bonds would pay percent we therefore find that the application of a percent rate of estimate that is supported by common knowledge and common supported by substantial evidence.
finally,we reject roger argument that the court erred in failing to comply with section.section requires the court,among other things,to state in writing or on the record the reasons it deviated from the guideline amount and why the deviation is in the best interests of the children,subd.a.the court decision to substitute earning capacity for actual income is not,however,a deviation that requires compliance with section.labass,supra,th,d.the imputation of income relates to an input in the guideline calculation,and is not a deviation from the final guideline amount.see id.at,d.we therefore find no error in the court failure to note special circumstances justifying the imputation of a percent rate of return.
in sum,we find no abuse of discretion in the court imputation of income relating to roger million stock market portfolio.
roger next objects that the court erroneously deviated from the guideline in including in the income calculation to account for his home.
the impact of free housing on child support payments has been discussed in several different cases.in two gomez th,d stewart and county of kern castle th,d kern the court characterized the fair value of the obligor parent free housing as income.in stewart,the father lived on an indian reservation.stewart,supra,th at,d.the trial court included the reasonable value of the free rent he received as part of the father section income in calculating child support.id.at,d.the appellate court affirmed,citing subdivision a of section,which gives the court discretion to consider as income employee benefits or benefits,taking into consideration the benefit to the employee,any corresponding reduction in living expenses,and other relevant facts.id.at,d.the court concluded that there was no reason to distinguish an employee housing benefit from an indian reservation housing benefit.id.at,d.thus,the trial court properly included the reasonable rental value of the father house as income.ibid.
the appellate court in kern,supra,th at pages,d,found that the lower court erred in excluding from income any consideration of the benefits the father received as a result of his million inheritance.citing stewart,the court observed that,among other things,the trial court here could have discretionarily considered as income the housing the father was living in because he paid the mortgage off with part of the proceeds from his inheritance.id.at,d.
the fourth district,in in re marriage of loh th,d loh,discussed at length the propriety of incorporating benefits into child support calculations and ultimately disagreed with the approach set forth in stewart and recognized in kern.reiterating that income tax returns are presumptively correct in calculating a parent income,the loh court observed that stewart and kern departed altogether from an income tax model of section income with regard to certain free housing benefits.loh,supra,th at,d.
the loh court first questioned the limits of a rule that allows courts to consider anything that reduces living expenses as income,pointing out that it leads to support payments based on money the parent does not have.loh,supra,th at,d.moreover,the stewart rule,which recognizes as income free housing provided by third parties,is incongruous when compared to the prohibition on considering free housing provided by a new partner or spouse in ordering child support.id.at,d.second,the court noted that,subdivision a refers to employee benefits that reduce living expenses,and found no statutory justification for interpreting the plain language of the statute to include as income reductions in living expenses not related to employment.id.at,d.the loh court therefore concluded that if a trial court determin
