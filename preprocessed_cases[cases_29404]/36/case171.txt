background 
the following facts were found by the district court subsequent to an evidentiary hearing held on july.andrew and kristina maxwell met and married in australia in,and shortly thereafter moved to massachusetts.on january,the couple quadruplets were born with developmental disabilities.the couple became estranged in december.at that time,andrew moved back to australia.kristina,the quadruplets,and kristina daughter from a previous marriage,gabi,moved to north carolina to live with kristina mother.
in,kristina filed for divorce in north carolina and andrew subsequently initiated a child custody action there as well.in august,andrew traveled from australia to north carolina for the custody hearing.during andrew stay in north carolina,he and kristina discussed reconciliation,resolved their custody dispute,and decided to discontinue the divorce action.on august,the parties signed a memorandum of judgment memorandum issued by the general court of justice in mecklenburg county,north carolina that granted kristina primary custody of the quadruplets.the memorandum was later incorporated into a consent order order entered by the superior court of mecklenburg county,north carolina,on october,
following the couple decision to reconcile,andrew traveled back to australia,while kristina and the children remained in north carolina.at the onset,both parties had trust issues.in particular,kristina was concerned that andrew was using the couple reconciliation as a means to gain custody of the quadruplets she was also concerned that andrew was still seeing his girlfriend,maryanne land maryanne.andrew agreed to end his relationship with maryanne,but not before he confirmed that kristina had ended her relationship with her male friend,derek otten.
despite their trust issues,the couple began making arrangements for kristina and the children to move to australia.initially,the couple communicated frequently.kristina began preparing for the move to australia by collecting the information needed to get permanent australian residency for her and gabi giving andrew permission to obtain australian passports for the quadruplets helping andrew look for a house helping andrew purchase a minivan briefly inquiring about work as a licensed practical nurse in australia exploring information technology and bartending programs in australia and telling friends and family that her move was permanent 
kristina continued to suspect that andrew was using the reconciliation as a means to gain custody of the quadruplets.she also learned that andrew was still seeing maryanne.the couple began to communicate less frequently and experience financial hardship kristina considered that the move to australia might be temporary,so she purchased round trip tickets with a departure date of december,and a return date of march.she arranged for herself and the children to travel with australian tourist visas that placed a limit on their stay in australia.before leaving the united states,kristina sought permission from gabi school to allow gabi to resume classes at the school in march of the following year.kristina also maintained the lease and insurance on her car,and kept her cell phone account,bank account,and north carolina medicare insurance.
kristina and the children traveled to australia on december.they brought the following items photographs of the family,jewelry and perfume bedding,blankets,linen,household cutlery,dishes,pots and pans bike helmets portable dvd players one month of prescription medication for kristina summer clothing andrew power tools and flashlights gabi school records the quadruplets and gabi medical and immunization records.
the couple experienced marital difficulties after kristina and the children arrived in australia.their trust issues persisted and they argued frequently.andrew became violent towards kristina and threatened to remove her from the house.within a few weeks of the move,andrew asked kristina if she would continue to live in australia if their marriage failed.after she responded in the negative,andrew took the following items from kristina to prevent her from leaving australia with the children the quadruplets passports,which he kept at his office copies of kristina and gabi passports,which he later returned and copies of the order.
kristina immediately sought legal advice from a solicitor regarding andrew confiscation of the passports.upon learning of kristina actions,andrew posed as kristina in an message in an attempt to have the order lifted.he also placed the children on the state department passport alert list,ripped out the solicitor section of the local yellow pages,and disabled kristina internet access on her computer.despite andrew attempts to prevent kristina from leaving australia with the children,kristina continued to seek legal advice.she was advised by a solicitor that she could either ask the embassy for interim passports or seek a court order requiring return of the passports.however,neither option was feasible at the time because the interim passport application required the signature of both parents,and the process for obtaining a court order was too expensive.
when kristina realized that she was not going to be able to leave australia immediately,she filled out permanent residency applications for herself and gabi,filled out paperwork to enroll gabi in school and the quadruplets in preschool and ymca classes and began attending marital counseling with andrew.kristina continued to seek legal assistance during this time.in february,just two months after kristina and the children arrived in australia,the embassy agreed to reissue the family passports without andrew consent.kristina and the children left immediately and returned to the united states.
when andrew noticed that kristina and the children were not home,he obtained an ex parte restraining order from the family court of australia to prevent kristina from removing the quadruplets from australia.by then kristina and the children had already departed.kristina phoned andrew the day she arrived in the united states,and they discussed the possibility of living separately in australia and sharing custody of the children.however,those plans soon fell through.kristina filed a domestic violence protection order after andrew threatened over the phone to kill her and left messages for the children calling kristina a drug addict.
on june,andrew filed a petition for wrongful removal in the united states district court for the western district of north carolina,charlotte division under the international child abduction remedies act,et,which implements the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction.
the district court entered an order denying andrew petition on september.the district court made the following findings of fact kristina testimony should be credited and andrew testimony should not be credited andrew failed to sustain his burden of proof gabi testimony corroborated her mother testimony and kristina intention before and after the move was that the move to australia would be conditional.based on those findings of fact,the district court held that andrew failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the habitual residence of the children was australia,and even if the children were habitual residents of australia,the return of the children to the united states was not a wrongful removal or retention in breach of andrew rights of custody under australian law because the order did not grant andrew custody rights.andrew timely filed his appeal from the district court order and we have jurisdiction under and a.
ii.discussion 
issues on appeal 
on appeal,andrew contends that the district judge erred in his findings regarding the habitual residence of the quadruplets immediately prior to the alleged removal from australia and the custody rights of the parties.first,with regard to the quadruplets habitual residence,andrew contends that the district court erred in determining that the children place of habitual residence at the time of their removal from australia was the united states failing to determine the parties last shared intention regarding what their children habitual residence would be,and consequently failing to ascribe appropriate significance to the last shared intention when determining what the children place of habitual residence was at the time of their removal from australia and by finding as a matter of fact that kristina relocation to australia with the children was intended to be experimental and contingent,or in the alternative failing to apply the common law principle of estoppel to prevent kristina from denying the permanency of her intentions.second,with regard to his custody rights,andrew argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not enjoy custody rights in relation to the children at the time of their removal from australia and by failing to properly interpret the north carolina custody order upon which it relied when it found that andrew did not enjoy custody rights at the time of the children removal from australia.
standard of review 
on appeal,the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and its legal conclusions regarding domestic,foreign,and international law are reviewed de novo.ruiz tenorio,cir silverman silverman,cir en banc mozes mozes,cir feder,cir.therefore,we must accept the district court historical or narrative facts unless they are clearly erroneous,but exercise plenary review of the court choice of and interpretation of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the facts.feder,at.
the hague convention seeks to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as secure protection for rights of access.hague convention,at.to secure the return of an abducted child under the hague convention,a petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child has been wrongfully removed.e a.
specifically,the petitioner must establish that the child was habitually resident in the petitioner country of residence at the time of removal the removal was in breach of the petitioner custody rights under the law of his home state and that the petitioner had been exercising those rights at the time of removal.miller miller,cir citing hague convention,at,at.consequently,if we affirm the district court finding on the habitual residence issue,the remaining issue regarding andrew custody rights will become moot and not require consideration by this court.thus,the crux of the issue on appeal is whether the district court determination that the quadruplets habitual residence was the united states at the time they were removed from australia is clearly erroneous.
the framers of the hague convention intentionally left habitual residence undefined,and intended that the term be defined by the unique facts in each case.see whiting krassner,cir.federal courts have developed a framework to assist in the habitual residence analysis.under this framework,the first question is whether the parents shared a settled intention to abandon the former country of residence.see mozes mozes,cir ruiz,at we summarize the approach suggested in mozes and adopt it as our own the first step towards acquiring a new habitual residence is forming a settled intention to abandon the one left behind.it is not necessary to have this settled intention at the time of departure,as it could develop during the course of a stay originally intended to be temporary.internal citation omitted gitter gitter,cir we agree with mozes and conclude that courts should begin an analysis of a child habitual residence by considering the relevant intentions.focusing on intentions gives contour to the objective,factual circumstances surrounding the child presence in a given location.this allows an observer to determine whether the child presence at a given location is intended to be temporary rather than permanent.
the second question under this framework is whether there was an actual change in geography coupled with the passage of an appreciable period of time,one sufficient for acclimatization by the children to the new environment.papakosmas papakosmas,cir quoting mozes,at.these two questions are addressed separately below.
shared parental intent 
the ninth circuit opinion in mozes mozes has served as a guide for federal courts in determining parental intentions in hague convention cases.see papakosmas,at gitter,at ruiz,at whiting,at silverman,at.in mozes,the ninth circuit recognized that d ifficulty arises,of course,when the persons entitled to fix the child residence no longer agree on where it has been situation that,for obvious reasons,is likely to arise in cases under the convention.mozes,at.
the mozes court divided these cases into three broad factual categories.in the first category are cases where the court finds that the family as a unit has manifested a settled purpose to change habitual residence,despite the fact that one parent may have had qualms about the move.id.in the second category are those cases where the child initial translocation from an established habitual residence was clearly intended to be of a specific,delimited period.id.at.in these cases,courts have generally refused to find that the changed intentions of one parent led to an alteration in the child habitual residence.id.
the third category of cases is comprised of i n between cases where the petitioning parent had earlier consented to let the child stay abroad for some period of ambiguous duration.id.at.following mozes,another category of cases developed.in this category are those cases where courts have refused to find a change in habitual residence because one parent intended to move to the new country of residence on a trial or conditional basis.see papakosmas,at ruiz,at gitter,at mckenzie mckenzie,d.
in cases where there is a dispute regarding a child habitual residence,the representations of the parties can not be accepted at face value,and courts must determine habitual residence from all available evidence.gitter,at considering the subjective intentions of parents to determine whether the parents shared an intent to adopt a new country of residence for their children feder,at same.federal courts have considered the following factors as evidence of parental intent parental employment in the new country of residence the purchase of a home in the new country and the sale of a home in the former country marital stability the retention of close ties to the former country the storage and shipment of family possessions the citizenship status of the parents and children and the stability of the home environment in the new country of residence 
in the case at bar,andrew argues that kristina conduct before the move to australia indicates that she intended that the move would be indefinite.specifically,andrew points to the following conduct kristina sale of her cherished personal items her failure to tell her family and friends that her move to australia was conditional her statement to family and friends on the day before she departed that t his is our last night in the and her completion of permanent residency applications for herself and gabi.we find that the district court properly considered this conduct and correctly determined that much of this evidence is equivocal as these actions would be appropriate even if kristina and the children were planning on living in australia temporarily,as per the custody order,or on a trial basis.
andrew also places great emphasis on the letters that gabi received from teachers and friends with statements wishing her good luck on her new life in australia,and saying goodbye,good luck,and i will miss you.the district court also considered this evidence in its analysis and properly concluded that the weight that andrew places on these letters is undermined by the fact that kristina sought permission from gabi school to allow her to miss the first portion of the spring semester and return to school in march.
moreover,the district court appropriately determined that the following facts support the conclusion that kristina intended that the move to australia would be conditional kr
