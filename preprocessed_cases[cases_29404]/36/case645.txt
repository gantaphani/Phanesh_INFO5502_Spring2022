husband owned of a real estate partnership for several years prior to marrying wife.during the parties marriage,the partnership modified the partnership agreement.the modified agreement stated the names of each partner,including husband and wife as owners of a interest.husband and wife filed for dissolution within a year.
on appeal,husband contends the partnership interest is his separate property,because the documents do not contain an express declaration transmuting the character of the property interest as required under family code section wife asserts that the partnership interest is community property under the joint title presumption of section,which provides that property acquired during marriage in joint form is presumed to be community property.we hold that when a spouse places separate property in joint title form,the transmutation requirements of section must be satisfied before the joint title presumption of section applies.the documents in this case do not contain an express transmutation of husband separate property interest in the partnership,and therefore,it remained husband separate property.
we asked the parties for additional briefing on the character of loan proceeds received by the partnership after the modification.we remand the matter for the trial court to determine whether the lenders intended to rely on the parties community property to satisfy the loans.if so,the community acquired a proportionate share of husband interest in the partnership.husband contends the trial court abused its discretion by awarding excessive attorney fees to wife.the award of attorney fees to wife must be reversed for a new determination in light of our opinion.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.

procedural history 
lafkas filed a petition for legal separation on may.doane filed a response requesting dissolution of the marriage on may.a judgment of dissolution as to marital status only was entered nunc pro tunc as of may.
lafkas moved for a separate trial of the interest in smile enterprises,which lafkas claimed was his separate property and doane claimed was community property.a trial was held before commissioner louise halevy,judge pro tem of the los angeles superior court,on september,january,and may and.
lafkas argued that none of the documents in the case,including the modification of the partnership agreement,contained an express declaration transmuting his separate property interest in the partnership.doane argued that the modification made her a partner as to an undivided interest under partnership law,and community property law did not apply.
lafkas testified to the following additional facts.he expected the rental income from the riverside properties would be sufficient to pay the mortgage and expenses of the properties.if not,smile enterprises held retained earnings and profits in a partnership savings account to be used for the expenses of operating the riverside properties.the smile enterprises partners qualified for the loan without doane participation.sylvia and dorcas have their own businesses and were partners in smile enterprises prior to the partnership application for a loan to purchase the riverside properties.after speaking with the loan officer,however,lafkas believed doane had to be included on the partnership agreement and the loan application because they were married.he told doane that she needed to be added to the documents in order to satisfy the lender requirements.he believes her credit was reviewed in connection with the purchase.
lafkas believed that he owned of smile enterprises before and after the modification.he did not believe that he had assigned any of his interest in smile enterprises to doane or made her a legal owner of smile enterprises.lafkas told doane that she was being made a partner to facilitate the purchase of the properties and as long as they were together,she would have a share.in other words,as long as they were married,she would get what he got.he did not intend to change the character of his partnership or convert his separate property interest in smile enterprises.
doane testified to the following additional facts.she did not own any separate real property,but lafkas owned other real property that he had purchased before marriage.they had discussed owning property together.he said dorcas had found properties in riverside,and he asked her to become a partner in smile enterprises.he said smile enterprises needed her salary to qualify for the loan for the properties and she would be required to sign loan documents to purchase the properties.he said the properties ran themselves.they discussed liability.when lafkas refinanced other properties that he owned,he asked her to sign quitclaim deeds.in at least one transaction,she was placed on the title of the property to facilitate refinancing the loan,then she quitclaimed her interest in the property.she signed the quitclaim deeds to be relieved of liability for the property.she wanted to know why he would put her on a partnership agreement that would increase her liability.he said it was a great opportunity.she told him that she would not sign a quitclaim deed.he took her to see the property.two or three weeks later,she signed the modification of the partnership agreement.she believed she became a partner when she signed the modification and she believed she was liable for anything that might have occurred with respect to the partnership and its assets since the partnership inception in.the partners went to dinner and welcomed her to the partnership.she believed dorcas became a partner at the same time.she knew proceeds from the sale of the monrovia property were going to be used as part of the consideration for the riverside properties.
in,during trial,smile enterprises sold the pasadena property.one of the riverside properties was sold in for,and the other in for.the partnership was dissolved.
on december,commissioner halevy entered a further judgment on bifurcated issues.the court found the modification amounted to a new partnership agreement and the riverside properties were property acquired during the marriage under section.lafkas had the use of doane name and credit until the sale of the properties.the modification substituted lafkas and doane for a combined share in place of lafkas sole ownership of share in the original agreement.by referring to the parties as husband and wife,the partnership was acquired in joint form as required by section.the creation of the modification agreement at lafkas behest converted lafkas interest under the prior agreement to a shared interest taken as husband and wife,which satisfied the requirement of an express declaration under section,subdivision a.
the trial court found it was not the parties intent to wholly convert lafkas holdings prior to june,to community property,however.the statement of partnership,the executed and notarized modification agreement,and the taking of joint property,show the parties intended to change the character of the partnership interest from june,forward.the court found lafkas and doane took an undivided share of the partnership from the date of the modification forward.lafkas transmuted his interest in smile enterprises and its holdings to community property only from and after june.
he retained a separate property interest in smile enterprises.the separate property component was of rents acquired prior to june,of rents after june,derived from property held prior to june,and of the value of property held by smile enterprises prior to june,and the appreciation of the value of the partnership holdings from the inception of the partnership until june,which was later determined to be.the remainder of the partnership interest,including properties acquired by the partnership on and after june,and appreciation,was community property subject to equal division between the parties.
lafkas filed a notice of appeal from the further judgment on bifurcated issues on february,but this appellate court held it was a nonappealable interlocutory order and dismissed the appeal.in re marriage of lafkas th.
trial was heard on remaining issues on september,and,november and,december,january,and,february and,and august and.commissioner halevy presided over the trial,but was unable to rule on the issues.judge dianna gould saltman reviewed reporter transcripts of the proceedings and issued a tentative decision on november.on may,judge gould saltman issued a minute order ruling on attorney fees.judge gould saltman ordered lafkas to pay attorney fees and costs of from his portion of the proceeds from the sale of the riverside properties and an additional to doane appellate counsel.lafkas had previously paid to doane trial counsel.the total attorney fees paid on doane behalf was.
lafkas filed a notice of appeal on august,from the judgment.

nature of partnership interest at time of marriage 
lafkas acquired his interest in smile enterprises prior to the parties marriage,and it is undisputed that when the parties married,the partnership interest was his separate property.we note that the applicable partnership law in this case is the uniform partnership act upa former,et.effective january,the upa was repealed and replaced with the uniform partnership act of upa,et,but the former act governs rights that accrued or actions that commenced prior to january.the property rights at issue in this case accrued prior to january,since the modification agreement was signed in and the dissolution action filed in,thus the upa applies.

lafkas owned the interest in the profits of smile enterprises as his separate property prior to the execution of the modification agreement.his separate property interest was in the partnership profits and surplus,not in specific property held by the partnership.
effect of modification agreement 
the modification agreement stated lafkas and doane,as husband and wife,own an undivided interest in the partnership.lafkas contends the modification agreement did not change the character of his separate property interest in the partnership to joint ownership,because it did not satisfy the requirements of section for a valid transmutation.doane contends that since the modification agreement provides for the parties to hold title in joint form,the joint title presumption of section applies and lafkas is limited to reimbursement of his contribution under the provisions of section.we conclude the transmutation requirements of section must be satisfied before the joint title presumption of section applies.
history of family code sections and 
sections and both evolved in response to in re marriage of lucas cal d lucas.in lucas,a husband and wife purchased a home during marriage for.wife used of her separate property for the down payment and spent of her separate property for improvements.they took title as gerald lucas and brenda lucas,husband and wife as joint tenants.id.at.at the time of dissolution,the net equity in the home was approximately.id.at.during marriage,the couple also traded in a community property vehicle toward the purchase of a motor home.wife used her separate property to pay the majority of the purchase price.the parties intent was to use the motor home for their family,and husband did not object to putting title in wife name alone.id.at.
the lucas court noted that where there is no written indication of ownership interests between the spouses,the general presumption of community property may be overcome simply by tracing the source of the funds used to acquire the property to separate property.citations.lucas,supra,cal d at.before the law was modified by statute in,spouses could agree to alter the character of their property by specifying a form of title,which raised a rebuttable presumption that the parties ownership interests were as stated in the title.id.at see,socol king cal d,tomaier tomaier cal d.the form of title presumption could be rebutted by evidence of a contrary agreement,but not simply by tracing the source of the property.lucas,supra,at.
when spouses owned a residence in joint tenancy,it was presumed to be separate property in which each spouse held interest.lucas,supra,cal d at.in dissolution proceedings,the court could not award the residence to one spouse as a family home unless the title presumption was rebutted by evidence of an agreement.id.at.but spouses took title in joint tenancy primarily because real estate professionals presented them with deeds in joint tenancy form,without understanding the difference between joint tenancy and community property.id.at.
in,the legislature added a provision to former civil code section to solve these problems in dissolution proceedings.lucas,supra,cal d at.as amended,civil code section provided that a single family residence acquired by a husband and wife during marriage as joint tenants was presumed to be community property for the purposes of division of property at divorce.ibid.civil code section was replaced in with a nearly identical provision in former civil code section.id.at,fn.
the lucas court held,based on the form of title and civil code section,that the house belonged entirely to the community,unless on remand the trial court found the parties had an agreement or understanding that wife would retain a separate property interest.lucas,supra,cal d at.the court reasoned,to allow a lesser showing could result in unfairness to the spouse who has not made the separate property contribution.unless the latter knows that the spouse contributing the separate property expects to be reimbursed or to acquire a separate property interest,he or she has no opportunity to attempt to preserve the joint ownership of the property by making other financing arrangements.the act of taking title in a joint and equal ownership form is inconsistent with an intention to preserve a separate property interest.accordingly,the expectations of parties who take title jointly are best protected by presuming that the specified ownership interest is intended in the absence of an agreement or understanding to the contrary.id.at.
the lucas court noted that on remand,if the trial court found the house belonged entirely to the community,wife would not be entitled to reimbursement of her separate property contribution to the property unless the parties had agreed to reimbursement.lucas,supra,cal d at.it was that a spouse who used separate property for community purposes was deemed to be making a gift to the community unless there was an agreement otherwise.ibid.the lucas court similarly concluded there was substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that husband made a gift of his community property interest in the motor home to wife,because title to the motor home was taken in wife name alone,husband was aware of it,and he did not object.id.at.
enactment of joint title and reimbursement statutes 
the legislature enacted several statutes in response to lucas.in,the legislature adopted provisions that are now codified as sections,and.former,subds.a b,respectively.
section provides that property acquired in joint title during marriage is presumed to be community property upon dissolution the presumption may be rebutted only by a clear statement in the title document by which the property is acquired that the property is separate and not community property,or proof of a written agreement that the property is separate.under section,a party will be reimbursed for contributions to the acquisition of community property to the extent the party traces the contributions to a separate property source unless the party waived the right to reimbursement in writing.the amount reimbursed does not include interest or appreciation,and can not exceed the property net value.ibid.
the california law revision commission the commission commented that sections and were originally enacted to correct injustice under the former law in two ways.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.first,the statutes were to reverse the supreme court holding in lucas that separate funds used to acquire a community asset were a gift to the community absent an express agreement otherwise.ibid.the lucas decision was widely considered to cause injustice to persons who contributed their separate funds for use by the community and then lost the funds entirely to the community at dissolution of marriage.often the parties were unaware that taking title in joint tenancy had the effect of making a gift of the separate property to the community.id.at.
second,the legislation changed the rule that a spouse could rebut the community property presumption for a joint tenancy residence with evidence of an oral agreement that it was separate property.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.the requirement of a writing provides a reliable test by which to determine the understanding of the parties.it seeks to prevent the abuses and unpredictability that have resulted from the oral agreement standard.id.at.
the commission noted,the presumptions also govern property initially acquired before marriage,the title to which is taken in joint form or as community property by the spouses during marriage.the measure of the separate property contribution under section in such a case is the value of the property at the time of its conversion to joint or community property form.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.
application of family code section 
the modification agreement stated lafkas and doane,as husband and wife,own interest in the partnership.this is a joint form of title.according to the law above,a partnership interest is considered to be acquired during marriage in joint form for the purposes of section whether it is initially acquired in joint form or initially acquired as separate property but placed in joint form during marriage.in this case,the admission of a new partner caused the dissolution of the partnership under former corporations code section,subdivision,unless otherwise provided in writing signed by all of the partners before admission.by operation of law,therefore,the modification agreement dissolved the existing partnership and created a new partnership.the new partnership interest was taken in joint form,and therefore is community property at dissolution under section,unless section requires otherwise.
enactment of transmutation requirements 
in,the legislature adopted the transmutation statutes of former civil code sections through,now family code sections through.estate of macdonald cal d.the commission reported that existing law made it quite easy for spouses to transmute both real and personal property a transmutation can be found based on oral statements or implications from the conduct of the spouses.recommendation relating to marital property presumptions and transmutations,cal.law revision com.commission report,fn.omitted.the rule allowing easy transformations reflected the convenience and informality of interspousal transfers,but generated extensive litigation in dissolution proceedings.it encourages a spouse,after the marriage has ended,to transform a passing comment into an agreement or even to commit perjury by manufacturing an oral or implied transmutation.id.at.
to solve the problem of easily manipulated and unreliable evidence in transmutation cases,the legislature adopted former civil code section,now codified as family code section.estate of macdonald,supra,cal d at valli,supra,cal th at.a married person may transmute the character of property from separate to community or from community to separate by agreement or transfer,with or without consideration.however,the transmutation must meet statutory requirements to be valid.in re marriage of haines th.a transmutation of real or personal property is not valid unless made in writing by an express declaration that is made,joined in,consented to,or accepted by the spouse whose interest in the property is adversely affected,subd.a.
the commission report states that the statute imposes formalities on interspousal transmutations for the purpose of increasing certainty in the determination whether a transmutation has in fact occurred.commission report,supra,at.the transmutation statutes overruled case law inconsistent with the new requirements,including the lucas court holding that husband made a gift of community property by allowing title to be taken in wife name alone.valli,supra,cal th at,fn.
the transmutation statutes apply to property transactions between spouses,as well as property purchased from third parties.valli,supra,cal th at.an express declaration is a writing signed by the adversely affected spouse which expressly states that the characterization or ownership of the property is being changed.estate of macdonald,supra,cal d at.an express declaration does not require use of the terms transmutation,community property,separate property,or a particular locution.citation.in re marriage of starkman,supra,th at.though no particular terminology is required citation,the writing must reflect a transmutation on its face,and must eliminate the need to consider other evidence in divining this intent.citation.in re marriage of benson cal th.the express declaration must unambiguously indicate a change in character or ownership of property.citation.a party does not slip into a transmutation by accident.citation.in re marriage of starkman,supra,at.
courts have adhered closely to these requirements and declined to find a valid transmutation without a clear understanding in writing that the document changes the character or ownership of specific property.in re marriage of starkman,supra,th at trust language stating any property transferred to the trust was community property unless identified as separate property did not unambiguously establish spouse was effecting a change of ownership of separate property in re marriage of barneson th,written instructions to transfer stock to spouse name,and form stating the undersigned hereby sells,assigns and transfers unspecified shares of stock to spouse,did not expressly state the characterization or ownership of the property was being changed estate of bibb th,registration of separate property automobile in the name of husband or wife was not a valid transmutation,because dmv printout was not signed by adversely affected spouse and did not contain clear and unambiguous expression of intent to change character,but deed granting property from husband to husband and wife as joint tenants was a valid transmutation,because it was signed by the adversely affected spouse and grant is the word historically used to transfer an interest in real property in re marriage of leni th,escrow instructions to split proceeds from sale of community property did not satisfy transmutation requirements,because there was no express declaration that the character of the property was being changed compare in re marriage of holtemann th,transmutation agreement stating character of listed property was transmuted from husband separate property to community property of both spouses was a valid transmutation in re marriage of lund th,agreement stating husband separate property is hereby converted to community property of husband and wife was a valid transmutation.
application of family code section 
the modification agreement provides lafkas and doane with an undivided interest as husband and wife.the interest in the new partnership is traceable directly from lafkas interest in the prior partnership.the parties did not provide any additional consideration to the partnership.the addition of doane to the partnership did not reduce the ownership interest of any partner other than lafkas.the clear intent of the modification agreement was to add doane as a of the interest formerly held by lafkas as his separate property.
the modification agreement does not meet the requirements for a valid transmutation of lafkas separate property to community property under section,because it does not contain any express declaration that the characterization or ownership of the property is being changed.the modification signed by lafkas simply adds doane name as owner of an undivided interest as husband and wife.a valid transmutation requires more than simply naming one or both spouses as the owner in a title document.valli,supra,cal th at.additional language is
