lauren mother appeals from a paternity judgment finding kevin is the father of her son matthew the child,even though brent,the child biological father,signed a voluntary declaration of paternity we conclude that because the voluntary declaration of paternity signed by brent functioned as a judgment of paternity under family code section,the court ruling must be reversed 
at a february,paternity hearing,kevin,mother,brent,and the child,through counsel,waived an evidentiary hearing and agreed the court could base its decision on the factual matters set forth in the file,including declarations and exhibits that were inadmissible under the rules of evidence.no oral testimony was presented at the hearing.accordingly,the following recitation of facts is taken from reporter transcripts and documents filed with the lower court,including declarations and exhibits.

one month later,kevin petitioned under section to establish a parental relationship as the child presumed father,seeking legal and physical custody of,and reasonable visitation with,the child.he declared that he always knew he was not the child biological father he took the child into his own home,held him out as his own child and paid all of the child expenses from the time mother became pregnant up until she vacated kevin home kevin desired custody of the child because he had been a primary caretaker and under all circumstances was the person most likely to allow the child frequent and continuing contact with mother,who had restricted kevin time with the child kevin believed it would be in the child best interests for the court to award him custody of the child.
the next month,kevin filed an order to show cause requesting custody of and visitation with the child pending a hearing.he also requested the court to order mandatory drug testing for mother and to appoint a mental health professional to perform a custody evaluation.kevin declared the following.early in mother pregnancy with the child,kevin and mother consulted a doctor about a possible miscarriage and together decided mother should have the child if it was medically possible.mother and her first son then moved in with kevin.kevin friends and relatives attended a baby shower for mother no one was told that kevin was not the biological father.kevin went to the hospital twice once directly from work when mother had false labor pains.kevin was present at the child delivery and cut the umbilical cord.upon the child birth,kevin took the baby into his home and openly held the child out as his natural son.the child birth announcement stating the family proudly introduces their new son and brother was sent out to all friends and family.

finally,kevin declared in support of his order to show cause that mother suffered from emotional and health problems,alcoholism and drug abuse including prescription drugs,and a poor driving record.kevin and mother relationship was destroyed in july when mother used cocaine,seriously damaged a friend bathroom,and was taken to hoag hospital for evaluation as a dangerous or gravely disabled person under welfare and institutions code section.
mother opposed kevin request for an ex parte custody order and argued there was no risk of immediate harm to the child.she had received telephonic notice of the ex parte hearing,but had never been served with kevin section petition to establish a parental relationship she declared the following.e arly on,she told her friends and family that the child was not kevin son.she refused kevin ultimatum to put his name on the child birth certificate or he would not marry her.mother did not approve the birth announcement before it was sent out.in she sent out christmas cards with a photograph of only her and her sons.she encouraged kevin to tell his parents the truth.

mother also declared that during the last months she lived in kevin house,she suffered from a painful medical condition that required her to take prescription drugs.mother never used cocaine and believed someone,maybe kevin,drugged her in july.she believed kevin had planned since she was pregnant to try to take her child because kevin is sterile and says he can not adopt due to legal problems.in december,mother graduated with a masters degree in psychology.she was currently a stay at home mother with both her children,her father helped her financially,and she lived in a three bedroom,two bath home with a back yard.she played with the children and took them to the park,to the pool for swimming lessons,and to tennis lessons.she continued to hire the nanny for extra help.mother had allowed kevin a few visits with the child,but then the child began crying at exchanges and was returned with dirty diapers and sometimes hungry.

at an ex parte hearing on kevin order to show cause,judge linda miller found kevin had made a prima facie showing that he is a presumptive father of the child,and granted him visitation with the child on alternate weekends and every wednesday overnight.the court ordered both parties to undergo drug testing with soltani and a custody evaluation with an expert,all at kevin expense.a hearing on kevin order to show cause was scheduled for july.

the court set a hearing on mother order to show cause for april,and advanced the hearing on kevin order to show cause to the same date.
on april,mother filed a response to kevin petition to establish a parental relationship,stating that the child biological father had filed a voluntary declaration of paternity.attached to mother response was a copy of an april,voluntary declaration of paternity signed and dated by brent,mother,and a witness at the department of child support services at main street,santa ana.also attached was a copy of an application to amend a birth record and acknowledgment of signed and dated by brent and mother.
that same day,brent filed a declaration as follows.he was the child biological father as proved by a dna test.he was married at the time mother became pregnant with the child and did not want to get his family involved.brent agreed to limited contact with mother but told her he would always support her and the baby.he paid her a month in cash during the pregnancy and child support after the child was born.he met mother and the child at the park and restaurants sporadically,and mother often emailed or phoned with little updates on the child.
attached to brent declaration was a copy of a february,dna identification test report from genetics center in orange,concluding the probability of brent parentage of mother then fetus was percent.
the child nanny declared she had seen brent at mother home and had heard the child call him daddy.brent often phoned.the nanny had never heard the child call kevin dad or daddy.before kevin second wednesday visit with the child,he asked the nanny to every wednesday evening for the child while kevin was at work.
mother moved to disqualify judge miller.she also moved for a change of venue,alleging kevin had been routinely appointed by orange county judicial officers as a minor counsel in family law matters,and had a long term relationship with nearly all of the judicial officers in orange county,as well as investigators and mediators.the venue motion was denied,but the case was reassigned several times and eventually placed with judge josephine staton tucker because she probably did not know kevin at all,whereas every other judicial officer knew kevin according to judge francisco firmat.judge tucker continued the hearing on mother order to show cause to june,with the existing temporary custody and visitation orders to remain in effect.
at the june hearing,kevin,mother,brent,and their counsel were present in court.mother counsel advised the court that,in a related paternity case brought by mother against brent,mother and brent had entered into a stipulation for judgment on paternity.the stipulated judgment had not yet been entered in that related case,but was being sent to the court for filing.mother counsel asked the court to stay kevin visitation with the child because the stipulated judgment conclusively rebutted kevin claimed presumed father status and,alternatively,because the visitation ruling was improperly ordered ex parte.the court ruled the existing temporary orders would remain in effect.the two paternity claim and mother action against reassigned and consolidated for all purposes,in the interests of the policies supporting a direct calendar and a single judge for one family.
on june,mother declared she had entered into a stipulated judgment with brent regarding custody and visitation.
that same day,brent filed a declaration,declaring,inter alia,his circumstances ha d changed in that he was currently single and desire d to be actively involved in the child life.he declared,it is my strong desire to step up to the plate and take on full responsibility and i hope my past inaction does not prejudice me,as i can afford the true biological father bond between father and son that no other person in the world can.
attached to brent declaration was a stipulated judgment on paternity signed by mother,brent,and mother counsel,but not executed by the court.the stipulation awarded joint legal custody to mother and brent and sole physical custody to mother with reasonable visitation to brent.as to child support,the stipulation stated a.at this time,both parties agree that they have sufficient funds to care for the child without child support.the parties have come to an agreement regarding the timeshare and agree that child support is unnecessary at this time.b.the issue of child support is reserved so that at a future date,if circumstances change,either party may request future child support.
on december,mother filed with the court a copy of the april,voluntary declaration of paternity,certified by the california department of child support services as having been submitted to that agency on april.
the consolidated cases were assigned to judge robert monarch,who was on the civil panel,not on the family law panel.trial on the bifurcated issue of paternity was set for february and.judge monarch ordered mother to meet with the child counsel and submit to drug testing with soltani.
on january,brent attorney moved to be relieved as his counsel,declaring brent had failed to communicate with the lawyer for several months.counsel had made over calls to brent cell phone,but the line was at least temporarily out of service.
the hearing on the bifurcated issue of paternity took place on february,before judge monarch.upon stipulation of counsel,judge monarch proceeded to determine the issue based on the factual matters set forth in the file,and the argument of counsel.brent counsel stated for the record his attempt to locate brent and that there was no appearance by him today.kevin and mother were sworn for examination and waived their right to a full trial.
as discussed in further detail below,judge monarch weighed kevin paternity claim against that of brent and concluded kevin is the child legal father under the rebuttable presumption established in section,subdivision d for a man who receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
discussion 
mother contends the court finding that kevin is the child father is erroneous because brent voluntary declaration of paternity was properly executed and filed with the department of child support services under section,the declaration had the force and effect of a paternity judgment the declaration was never rescinded or set aside and under section,subdivision c,a paternity judgment rebuts the rebuttable presumptions under section,including the presumption for a man who takes a child into his home and holds the child out as his own.
california statutory scheme governing paternity 
the family code contains several interrelated statutes that together govern the judicial determination of paternity the uniform parentage act et containing rebuttable paternity presumptions the paternity judgment or the conclusive paternity presumption arising from a voluntary declaration of paternity et the conclusive paternity presumption for a husband who cohabited with the mother at the time of conception,the presumption concerning the child of a marriage et craig sandy th,d and the uniform act on blood tests to determine paternity et.
section integrates these statutes by stating that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he meets the conditions for a paternity judgment or conclusive presumption by filing a voluntary declaration of paternity,or for a conclusive presumption of paternity over a child of a marriage,or for a rebuttable presumption of fatherhood under any of section subdivisions.
presumed fatherhood status under section entitles a man to custody of a child.although more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity,there can be only one presumed father.in re jesusa cal th,d.how the various family code sections are reconciled and prioritized to identify a single presumed father is the subject of our inquiry here.
sections et,concerning voluntary declarations of paternity,govern brent parentage claim.under section,a valid declaration of paternity must be signed by both a mother and the man she identifies as her child only possible father,subd.b.the declaration of paternity must contain,inter alia,a statement by the father that he understands he is waiving his constitutional right to have the issue of paternity decided by a court,subd.b that he is the biological father of the child and that he consents to the establishment of paternity,subd.b.although hospitals must try to obtain signed declarations soon after the birth of infants to unwed mothers,subd.a,attesting parents may mail a notarized declaration to the department of child support services at any time after the child birth,subd.d,italics added.in addition and among other options,attesting parents may sign a declaration in person at a local child support agency office where staff witnessing the parents signatures must forward the signed declaration to the department of child support services,subd.f.
the legislature declared intent in enacting these sections was,in part,to establish a simple system allowing for establishment of voluntary paternity,subd.b as a first step toward a child support award,subd.a.the legislature also found knowledge of family medical history is often necessary for correct medical diagnosis and treatment.additionally,knowing one father is important to a child development,subd.a.
under specified circumstances,a voluntary declaration may be rescinded or set aside.either parent may rescind the declaration within days by filing a rescission form,subd.a.in addition,a court may set a declaration aside when blood tests citation establish that the declarant is not the child father.county of los angeles sheldon th,d.the notice of motion for genetic tests under section may be filed not later than two years from the date of the child birth by a local child support agency,the mother,the man who signed the voluntary declaration as the child father,or in an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship pursuant to section or in any action to establish an order for child custody,visitation,or child support based upon the voluntary declaration of paternity,subd.b a see also in action where paternity is relevant,court shall upon motion of any party order the alleged father to submit to genetic tests.even when genetic tests show that a man who signed a declaration of paternity is not the child biological father,the court may decide that denying an action to set aside the declaration is in the child best interests,considering factors such as the child age and duration of relationship with the declarant,and the length of time since the declarant signed the declaration,subd.b a,b c.furthermore,either parent may file an action or motion to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity on any of the grounds described in,and within the time limits specified in,section of the code of civil procedure relating to mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,subd.c.the statute is not intended to restrict a court from acting as a court of equity,subd.c.for example,an equitable collateral attack on a voluntary declaration of paternity is available on the grounds of extrinsic fraud.in re william th,d.
unless rescinded or set aside,a voluntary declaration of paternity signed by adult parents on or after january,is treated as a judgment.under section enacted in,such a declaration filed with the department of child support services shall establish the paternity of a child and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.the declaration must also be recognized as a basis for the establishment of an order for child custody,visitation,or child support.the legislative intent behind section was to eliminate the need to file a separate court action for the purpose of giving a declaration the force and effect of a judgment of paternity.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.
in contrast,voluntary declarations of paternity signed before create a conclusive presumption of paternity with the same force and effect of the conclusive presumption under section child of a marriage,subd.a.this conclusive presumption may be rebutted with blood tests within three years of the declaration execution,subd.d and override s all statutory presumptions of paternity except a presumption arising under section child of a marriage or paternity index in genetic test of or greater,subd.e.
under another part of the family uniform parentage establishes rebuttable paternity presumptions under each of its six subdivisions.under subdivision d the basis of kevin claim to paternity of the man is a presumed father if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.these presumptions are rebuttable pursuant to section,which provides a except as provided in chapter commencing with section child of marriage and chapter commencing with section voluntary declaration of paternity of part or in section repealed pilot program for voluntary declarations of paternity,a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.b if two or more presumptions arise under section that conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.c the presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.fn.added.
there are no time limits or standing requirements for challenging,or asserting,a section,subdivision d presumption.any interested party may bring an action at any time for the purpose of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship presumed under subdivision d or f of section,subd.b.
the court ruling 
we first summarize judge monarch oral comments at the paternity hearing.the judge found brent had filed a valid declaration of paternity which put him at least on the level of being characterized as a presumed father.kevin,on the other hand,was a presumed father under section,subdivision d,although the supporting evidence was on the weak side,relative to the time period that he was actually involved in the child life,the lack of an existing family to abet the proposition,and the emphasis on the first person singular,the i,i,i,me,me,me aspect of this and precious little with respect to the best interests of the child.nonetheless,based to a certain extent on the law of the case,where there was a preliminary determination that there was a prima facie case of paternity established,judge monarch found kevin met the threshold of presumed paternity,but reiterated that kevin showing was on the weak side.
judge monarch then interpreted sections and to place these two presumed father s on equal footing.the judge noted,however,the issue was problematic and confusing because a declaration of paternity is the equivalent of a judgment under section.indeed,california statutory scheme governing parentage miller,baseline,best interests a pragmatic approach for california to provide certainty in determining parentage mcgeorge,has been criticized as involving an outmoded and confusing system of presumptions.id.at.nonetheless,after acknowledging appellate clarification might be needed,judge monarch concluded the spirit and intent of sections and,subdivision c limited the recognition of brent to that of a presumed father,on no less of a plateau than any other presumed father.
the judge then proceeded to balance,pursuant to section,subdivision b,the conflicting presumptions to determine which presumption on the facts was founded on the weightier consideration of policy and logic the judge found brent declarations had inconsistencies within them the stipulated judgment does require him to pay support although his declaration stated he has been paying a month,the judge inferred,as a function of the input from counsel,that he really has paid anything and the court was not aware of any consistent contact and nothing in the file show ed any consistent contact or desire to contact other than a declaration submitted earlier in the game,which is less than convincing.most significant was brent failure to appear after appropriate notice to participate in these proceedings.s electing the best of the two available alternatives,and without much choice in the matter with the only two alternatives presented,judge monarch determined kevin was the child father.the court clarified that its ruling applied to both consolidated cases and took into consideration the comments of minor counsel the judge continued in effect the existing orders regarding visitation and custody.
judge monarch then issued a written statement of decision,having reviewed the files in this matter,having considered the comments and arguments of counsel including the comments from harold la flame,attorney for the minor,and pursuant to the stipulation of counsel that the court may make the determination of paternity based upon the factual matters set forth in the files.as to brent,judge monarch found brent was the child biological father brent had failed to implement or confirm his status as the natural father of the child and had not,prior to or since the birth of the child,taken any meaningful steps to have or maintain contact with the child or provide for his support brent attempted to create the appearance of involvement in the child life by cooperating with mother to establish by stipulation his legal status as a father the stipulation fails to provide for significant support or contact with the child brent cooperation with said stipulation appears coerced and no evidence showed his declaration of paternity was filed with any state agency.judge monarch found kevin was a presumed father under section,subdivision d,who had acted as an interested and involved father figure to the child from the child birth until mother ended her relationship with kevin,received the child into his home,and openly held out the child as his natural child.balancing considerations of policy and logic,judge monarch concluded kevin was the child psychological father,and found it to be in the child best interests to designate kevin the legal father.
brent voluntary declaration of paternity serves as a paternity judgment making him the child legal father 
kevin contends there is no evidence brent voluntary declaration of paternity was filed with the department of child support services.he points to judge monarch written finding in the statement of decision that there was no evidence the declaration was duly filed with the state of california or any other agency.kevin claims mother failed to object to this finding and therefore waived her right to challenge it on appeal.he concludes brent declaration lacks the force of a paternity judgment under section which applies only to declarations filed with the department of child support services and thus no judgment exists to rebut his own section,subdivision d paternity presumption.
we review for substantial evidence judge monarch finding the declaration was never filed with an appropriate agency.in re marriage of feldman th,d substantial evidence standard of review applies to factual findings underlying paternity judgment.not only is this written finding taken from kevin proposed statement of decision inconsistent with the judge oral finding the declaration was valid,but it is clearly false.the certified copy of brent declaration of paternity leaves no doubt it was submitted to the department of child support services.the declaration was signed and dated by an employee of the santa ana office of the department of child support services,who witnessed the parents signatures as contemplated under section,subdivision f.see in re raphael th,d evidence code section presumption that official duty has been regularly performed includes proper filing of voluntary declaration of paternity.nor has mother waived the right to challenge on appeal the court erroneous finding in the statement of decision.although code of civil procedure section requires a party to bring to the trial court attention any omissions or ambiguities in the statement of decision in order to avoid an appellate court implying findings to support the judgment,a party is free to argue on appeal that the court factual finding is not supported by substantial evidence,even if not raised in the trial court generally,points not urged in the trial court can not be raised on appeal.citation.the contention that a judgment is not supported by substantial evidence,however,is an obvious exception to the rule.tahoe national bank phillips cal d,fn.
we turn to the central issue presented by this appeal does a man voluntary declaration of properly signed and filed after and never rescinded or set a rebuttable presumption of paternity under a subdivision of section the resolution of this issue depends solely on statutory interpretation and is subject to our independent review.in re liam th,d.
kevin contends the court properly weighed his claim against brent because the goal of the paternity statutes is the protection of the child well being.he argues our supreme court has held that functioning interpersonal relationships trump biological parentage,relying on in re jesusa,supra,cal th,d.he asserts that awarding brent parental rights would mean that the child effectively would have no father.he reminds us that brent declined to be named as the child father at the child birth,concealed the fact from his wife and the public,and only signed the declaration of paternity when mother stipulated she would not ask him for child support,and that he would not have any responsibility for physical custody.
in advancing these arguments,kevin never addresses the statutory language of any family code section relevant to our inquiry here.yet,we must begin with the fundamental rule that our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.citation.we must begin with the words of the statute.adoption of kelsey cal th,d.the language of section is clear a voluntary declaration of paternity,duly completed and filed after,has the same force and effect as a judgment for paternity equally clear is the language of section,subdivision c a section presumption is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.and section,subdivision a,listing the section presumptions that are rebuttable,expressly excludes presumed father status arising from a declaration of paternity as one of the rebuttable presumptions.even a voluntary declaration of paternity override s the rebuttable presumptions created by section s subdivisions,subd.e.
section delineates the only circumstances under which a court may set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity.no statute grants a court the discretion to ignore,or treat as a rebuttable presumption,a voluntary declaration of paternity accorded the force of a judgment under section.it is a cardinal rule that courts may not add provisions to a statute.adoption of kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.
brent declaration of paternity was filed within two years of the child birth,yet kevin never moved for genetic tests under section to disprove brent biological paternity.nor has kevin ever challenged brent declaration on equitable grounds such as extrinsic fraud.thus,kevin never availed himself of statutory options for challenging brent voluntary declaration 
although kevin questions brent motivation for signing a declaration of paternity,he does not contend the declaration lacks legal effect.nor can he.by signing the voluntary declaration,brent waived his constitutional rights and established his paternity of matthew with concomitant rights and obligations,including child support,subd.b.although mother and
