dafer dakhil dakhil,a director of the omar ibn al khattab foundation mosque,in downtown los angeles,testified that the arabic marriage contract was not issued by his mosque.he was unaware of any other mosque in los angeles with the name omar ibn al khattab and found no marriage records at his mosque relating to appellant and deleon.

appellant testified on his own behalf that on october,he went to omar ibn al khattab mosque in downey,where he and deleon signed a marriage contract.afterwards,they went to his apartment in lakewood and had sex.appellant did not move in with deleon after the mosque marriage.
on october,appellant and deleon signed the license and were married in what appellant referred to as an american marriage.before that ceremony,he thought he and deleon were living together as husband and wife,though they did not live in the same house.he introduced her as his wife and believed they were married before god.after the confidential marriage,he moved in with deleon at the lugo residence,opened a bank account with her,obtained insurance on his life for her benefit,and paid utility bills.

discussion 
appellant was properly convicted of violating section count introduction 
section,subdivision a provides every person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed,registered,or recorded in any public office within this state,which instrument,if genuine,might be filed,registered,or recorded under any law of this state or of the united states,is guilty of a felony.appellant was convicted of violating section by reason of his having signed the license,falsely attesting that he and deleon have been living together as husband and wife.
appellant contentions 
appellant contends that his conviction of section is unsupported by substantial evidence that the license was false because there is no indication that the term living together as husband and wife requires that both the unmarried man and the unmarried woman be living together under the same roof.he argues that he and deleon were married in a religious ceremony two years before signing the license,believed they were married in the eyes of god,and consummated their relationship before the confidential marriage.
appellant further contends that the trial court erred in finding that the license was an instrument as defined in section.he argues that unlike here,the cases establishing a broad meaning of instrument,involve clearly and intentionally false or forged documents.these contentions are meritless.
living together as husband and wife 
there is undisputed evidence appellant did not live in the same dwelling with deleon 
in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citations.people bolin cal th,d.there is overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence that appellant and deleon were not living together as husband and wife before appellant signed the license attesting that they were.deleon close friends testified that she and appellant began living together only after the confidential marriage.deleon mother,consuelo,with whom deleon had lived for years,testified that appellant had never lived with deleon before that marriage.even appellant testified that after the purported mosque marriage in,he did not move in with deleon until after the confidential wedding.deleon admitted that she and appellant were not residing in the same house before the confidential marriage,although she claimed they were still living together 
living together means living together 
faced with this uncontroverted evidence,appellant argues that the parties need not have been cohabiting in order to be living together as husband and wife.he refers us to no authority supporting this claim,nor have we found any.we must therefore determine the meaning of that phrase by interpreting section.we review the proper interpretation of a statute and its application to undisputed facts de novo.regents of university of california superior court cal th,d,people bergen th,d.
in the absence of any legislative or judicial guidance,we construe the language of the statute according to its plain meaning.people popular th,d duty abex d.we must give the language a reasonable and common sense interpretation,consistent with the apparent purpose and intention of the legislature.in re rochelle th,d.if possible,we will give significance to the plain meaning of every word,phrase and sentence of a statute id.at,d.when construing a statute,a court must first examine the words at issue to determine whether their meaning is ambiguous.sand superior court cal d.if statutory law is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.in re lance cal d.
the words living together are unambiguous.their plain,common sense meaning is cohabitating.the settled meaning of cohabitation is living together as husband and wife.steven matthew th,d dealing with the statutory presumption that a child born of a wife cohabiting with her husband,who is not impotent or sterile,is conclusively presumed to be a child of the marriage.cohabitation has acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning through its use in defining common law marriages.citation.ibid.if the legislature had intended the term living together as husband and wife to mean that the parties did not have to live in the same dwelling together,it could have said so.family code section,for example,could have made the requirement for a confidential marriage to be only that parties hold themselves out as husband and wife,rather than living together as husband and wife.
appellant argues that by believing they were married before god prior to the confidential marriage,having had sex before that marriage and having considered themselves married,they were living together as husband and wife.he is wrong.his interpretation reads the words living together out of family code section as completely as if they were not there.
the purpose of the confidential marriage statutes is to shield the parties and their children,if any,from the publicity of a marriage recorded in the ordinary manner,and thereby to encourage unmarried persons who have been living together as man and wife to legalize their relationship.encinas lowthian freight lines d.to accomplish that purpose,family code section dispenses with the usual marriage license requirement that the parties obtain a health certificate,and the recorded confidential marriage license is closed to the public.interpreting the term living together to mean actually residing in the same dwelling is consistent with the statutory purpose.
living together as husband and wife has been described as the holding forth to the world by the manner of daily life,by conduct,demeanor and habit,that the man and woman who live together have agreed to take each other in marriage and to stand in the mutual relation of husband and wife and when credit is given by those among whom they live,by their relatives,neighbors and acquaintances to these representations and their continued conduct,then habit and repute arise and attend upon cohabitation.people mcintyre cal.occasional illicit intercourse with a person is not sufficient to establish that they have been living together as man and wife.id.at.
living in the same dwelling is the most significant characteristic of daily life that creates the impression that a couple is married.it is unmarried couples who have lived together and held themselves out as husband and wife,and any children of that relationship,who are most likely to be embarrassed and stigmatized by revealing in a nonconfidential marriage that they were not previously married,that their representations to others that they were married were a sham and that children born of that relationship were illegitimate.family code section seeks to encourage this group to legalize their marriage with the inducement that the fact that they were not previously married will not be revealed.
instrument 
appellant also claims that the license is not an instrument,as that term is defined in section.we disagree.
as appellant points out,several older appellate court opinions adopted a narrow definition of instrument as used in section.the seminal case,people fraser,fraser,held that a birth certificate was not an instrument within the meaning of that section.it reasoned that an instrument as employed in our statutes has been defined to mean an agreement expressed in writing,signed,and delivered by one person to another,transferring the title to or creating a lien on real property,or giving a right to a debt or duty.id.at.relying on fraser,other appellate cases have applied the same narrow definition of instrument.see people fox d.false affidavit of voter registration is not section instrument people olf d.application for permit to department of corporations not section instrument.
more recent cases have criticized fraser and interpreted instrument in section more expansively.see,people parks th,d concluding temporary restraining order is section instrument people tate th,d work referral forms filled out by administering agency including number of hours probationer did community service is section instrument.section wa
