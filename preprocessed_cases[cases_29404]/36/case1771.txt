this is an initial case in which both texas and tennessee claim jurisdiction.we must decide whether texas is the child home state for purposes of the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,and thus whether the texas trial court properly assumed jurisdiction over the case.we hold that,because the child lived in tennessee with his parents for at least six consecutive months immediately before the proceeding was commenced,texas is not the child home state and the trial court exercise of jurisdiction was improper.accordingly,we conditionally grant the petition for writ of mandamus and order the trial court to stay this proceeding and communicate with the tennessee court.if the tennessee court does not determine that texas is a more appropriate forum,the trial court shall dismiss this proceeding.the writ will issue only if the trial court does not comply.
in february,russell powell moved from texas to tennessee to accept a new position with his employer.in may,his wife,sonia powell,sold her house in texas,closed her texas bank accounts,and moved with the couple son,to tennessee to join russell.there,the couple leased a house with an option to buy.within a week of her arrival in tennessee,sonia obtained a tennessee driver license,opened a checking account with a tennessee bank,and began applying for jobs.she and russell enrolled in kindergarten.sonia delivered newspapers for a short time and then began working at in september.on april,sonia moved back to texas and took with her.at the time,she was seven months pregnant with,who was later born in texas.
approximately two weeks after arriving in texas,on may,sonia filed for divorce in hardin county,texas,requesting managing conservatorship of.she asserted in her petition that she had been a domiciliary of texas for the preceding period and a resident of hardin county for the preceding period.sonia testified that she was born and raised in texas,that she was trying tennessee out,and that she did not intend to reside permanently in tennessee.on august,the trial court issued temporary orders appointing sonia temporary managing conservator of 
russell filed for divorce in tennessee two weeks after sonia filed in texas.the tennessee court issued a temporary parenting plan on may,awarding custody of to russell.the court also found that tennessee has jurisdiction over as the parties did not separate until april.
russell then filed in the texas proceeding a plea in abatement and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction arguing that the tennessee court secured service of citation first,giving it exclusive jurisdiction over this divorce action.he further claimed that abatement and dismissal were required because neither he nor sonia had been a domiciliary of texas for the six months preceding the filing of this suit or a resident of hardin county for ninety days preceding this suit,as required by the texas family code.
the trial court denied russell plea in abatement,stating in a letter to counsel this case involves a very close question of fact.the fact that both children were born in texas and that the home state of the youngest child is clearly texas are persuasive.the motion for abatement is denied.the court also entered an order denying the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction without explanation.
russell sought mandamus relief,asking the court of appeals to vacate the trial court order and to transfer the case to the chancery court of hawkins county,tennessee.a divided court of appeals denied mandamus relief,holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in retaining jurisdiction because texas was clearly home state,and there was a fact issue on whether sonia time spent in tennessee was a temporary absence and thus whether texas or tennessee was home state.russell petitioned this court claiming the trial court lacked jurisdiction over this custody dispute because,among other things,texas is not home state.russell does not challenge the trial court jurisdiction over the dispute as to,who has never lived anywhere but texas.
in considering russell petition,we focus on the trial court ruling.in re meador.a writ of mandamus is an appropriate means to require a trial court to comply with the uccjea jurisdictional requirements.see in re forlenza,geary peavy,stating that mandamus is an appropriate remedy to resolve a jurisdictional dispute under the former uniform child custody jurisdiction act.the question in this case,then,is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying russell motions to abate and dismiss.a trial court abuses its discretion if it fails to analyze or apply the law correctly.walker packer.construction of the uccjea home state provision as codified in the texas family code is a question of law that we review de novo.see mcintyre ramirez.
effective september,texas adopted the uccjea,which replaced the previously adopted uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja.act of,ch.laws codified at.the uccja provided four bases for jurisdiction over a custody dispute,but did not prioritize one over the others.act of may,ch.laws,as amended,repealed by act of,ch.laws.this often led courts in different states to simultaneously exercise jurisdiction in cases.the uccjea was designed,in large part,to remedy this situation by prioritizing jurisdiction.stoner,the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea a metamorphosis of the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja,house comm.on juvenile justice and family issues,bill analysis,stating that this act revises the child custody jurisdiction law to prioritize home state jurisdiction see in re forlenza,at discussing the uccjea in the context of continuing jurisdiction over custody matters.the texas family code accordingly prioritizes jurisdiction and provides in pertinent part that a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination only if 
this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding,or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.
a.because this case involves an initial determination,and jurisdiction has priority,the question presented is whether,on the date the proceeding was commenced,texas or tennessee was home state.
the texas family code defines home state as 
the state in which a child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding a period of temporary absence of a parent is part of the period.
id.russell asserts that this language creates a,test focused on the child physical presence.hence,in his view,stay in tennessee with his parents confers jurisdiction on the tennessee court.but sonia claims the proper analysis is not so simple.she argues that time in tennessee was merely a temporary absence from texas and that texas remained home state throughout his stay in tennessee because sonia intended to be there only temporarily.we reject sonia argument for a number of reasons.
first,sonia argument presumes that her own intent should control and that russell is irrelevant.but the family code definition of home state is the state in which a child lived with a parent,and russell is a parent with whom undisputedly lived in tennessee for over ten consecutive months preceding commencement of the custody dispute.sonia premise,that she did not reside in tennessee and therefore did either,necessarily presumes that she is the only parent that the statute covers,which of course is not the case.even if sonia residence in tennessee was temporary because she intended to return to texas,as she claims,it is immaterial in determining whether tennessee acquired status through russell.
second,we believe that a test based on subjective it examines the intent of the mother,the father,or the thwart the uccjea meaning and purpose.when interpreting statutes we try to give effect to legislative intent.crown life ins.casteel.in doing so,we look first to the plain and common meaning of the statute words.
