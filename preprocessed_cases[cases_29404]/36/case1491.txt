donna and robert morrison engaged the services of a fertility clinic,to no avail,and ultimately abandoned their efforts to conceive,believing their unused genetic materials would be destroyed.when the clinic later became the target of an investigation into its widespread misuse of genetic materials,the morrisons along with many others sued the clinic and later settled their claims for an undisclosed amount of money.the morrisons,wondering whether they have a genetic child or children in the world,then embarked on a campaign to intrude into the lives of another fertility clinic family judith and jacob doe who might have innocently received donna morrison genetic material.the morrisons filed a complaint in which they asked the court to determine whether they are the genetic parents of the does twin daughters now almost years old and,if so,to grant custody of the children who know nothing about this claim and who have no reason to question their parentage to the morrisons.although the morrisons later withdrew their request for custody,they continued their efforts to compel blood tests and obtain the right to visit the twins.
the does sought protective orders and moved to quash the morrisons complaint.when the morrisons were unable to present any admissible evidence to establish a connection between their genetic material and the fertility services received by the does,the trial court granted the does motion to quash and dismissed the morrisons complaint.the morrisons appeal,claiming the trial court should have either admitted their inadmissible evidence or otherwise concluded that the morrisons curiosity justified a further intrusion into the does lives.we reject the morrisons claims and affirm.we hold that the morrisons evidence was properly excluded,and that they have not shown any link at all to the does daughters.we also hold that,assuming a genetic connection between the morrisons and the twins,the best interests of the children dictate the result reached by the trial court.
in,donna and robert morrison were fertility clinic patients of the center for reproductive health crh at the university of california at irvine uci.as part of the in vitro fertilization process,the morrisons eggs and sperm were entrusted to crh with the intent that the resulting embryos would produce the child they hoped to conceive.no pregnancy was achieved and the morrisons ultimately abandoned their efforts on the assumption that any remaining genetic material would be destroyed by crh.
in the,uci learned there had been medical and other improprieties at crh.an investigation ensued,and findings were made that egg stealing had occurred human eggs were taken from one patient and implanted in another without the consent of the donor.stone regents of university of california th,d.the morrisons and many others sued crh,uci,and the doctors involved in the egg stealing.the morrisons case was settled by the payment of only after the morrisons learned through the discovery process that their genetic material might not have been destroyed,that judith and jacob doe who were also patients of the crh fertility clinic might have without the does knowledge received the morrisons eggs,sperm,or embryos,and that in december judith doe had given birth to twin daughters,ida and rose.the morrisons claim they are the twins genetic parents.
in,the morrisons filed a complaint to establish parental relationship,naming the does as defendants,alleging that the morrisons are the biological and legal parents of the twins,and asking for custody,visitation rights,and an award of attorney fees.between and,the morrisons attempted to obtain blood tests and dna samples from the twins but the does refused to provide them and these negotiations ultimately failed.
in,the morrisons filed an amended complaint in which they abandoned their quest for custody but reasserted their demands for blood tests and for visitation.at the morrisons request,a hearing was set to determine the morrisons right to obtain dna tests and to have a mental health professional appointed to help determine the commencement,frequency,degree of contact or visitation the morrisons should have with the twins.the matter was continued from time to time 
in april,the does asked the trial court to seal the records of this case to issue protective orders to ensure the privacy of the children in this potentially litigation,and to preclude deliberate or accidental disclosure of the existence of this litigation and the morrisons claims to the children and to quash the morrisons petition on the grounds among others that a the does are the presumed natural and legal parents of the twins,and b the morrisons lacked standing to pursue a parentage action or to compel blood or dna testing,subd.a,subd.a.
in support of their motions,the does submitted declarations establishing that since they have lived together continuously as husband and wife,that in addition to the twins they have two older children one from jacob former marriage,the other together,and that the twins were conceived because the does had actively tried to conceive with medical assistance,intending to use jacob sperm and anonymously and voluntarily donated ova.judith doe became pregnant by her husband,gave birth to the twins,and remains a full time mother.jacob doe was neither impotent nor sterile at the time the twins were conceived or at the time they were born,and he is their father as well as the father of the does two older children.when judith doe gave birth to the twins,the does knowingly and joyously received the twins into their home and family.they have adored the twins and have reared them in the does culture and religion the does are the only parents that ida and rose have ever known.the does objected to the release of any medical information to the morrisons,pointed out that the morrisons claims had caused great emotional stress to the does,and said the introduction of the morrisons into the does family life would be a monstrous intrusion.
in opposition to the does motion to quash,the morrisons claimed they had standing to pursue this action because donna morrison is a genetic mother.to prove this point,the morrisons submitted a copy of a letter from uci to the morrisons and a copy of an unauthenticated redacted copy of one handwritten page of the seven page teri ord list in which donna morrison name appeared.other than by name,the morrisons did not identify teri ord or explain her relationship to these proceedings.the does objected to the morrisons evidence,pointing out that the unauthenticated list contained privileged information and did not connect the morrisons to the does or to anyone,genetically or otherwise.
at a hearing held in june,the family law court sustained the does objections to the morrison evidence and found that the morrisons had failed to establish their status as interested parties entitled to pursue a parentage action.the court nevertheless continued the matter to afford the morrisons an opportunity to present additional evidence.
as additional evidence,the morrisons submitted an unredacted copy of the handwritten list and a declaration from teri stated that she was employed from through and including by ami medical center as an i n v itro f ertilization biologist in charge of the embryology lab at that facility.in that capacity,she states,she participated in transfers of genetic materials obtained by the doctors at uci from fertility patients.according to laboratory records,donna morrison was an infertility patient at ami between march and may,as was judith doe.ord stated that,based on information contained in other clinical and laboratory records,she prepared the handwritten document in to show that,between march and may of,patient judith doe received sixteen eggs from patient donna morrison.eggs were extracted from donna morrison,and five transferred into donna morrison own fallopian tubes.the remaining sixteen were transferred to judith doe,and the notations next to judith doe name show that a twin pregnancy resulted.emphasis added.the morrisons also submitted evidence that uci original clinical and laboratory records for its former patients
