this is a domestic violence case in which a woman sought a permanent restraining order against her former boyfriend.as is common in such proceedings,both sides appeared pro per.for that reason we were not surprised the hearing proceeded rather informally.but what we found in this instance was a hearing short on due process,especially for the party facing the prospect of a restraining order,including denial of a continuance to which that party was entitled as a matter of law.we feel it necessary to reverse and remand for a proper hearing where appellant is given the opportunity to challenge respondent evidence and also to present affirmative evidence in his defense and where respondent likewise has the same meaningful opportunity to be heard.
facts and proceedings below 
respondent tameka ross and appellant oscar figueroa were in a relationship for a considerable period before ross sought to terminate the relationship.on january,she filed a form requesting an ex parte temporary restraining order against figueroa and setting a february,hearing date for the court consideration of whether to make the order permanent.commissioner randall pacheco granted the temporary order ex parte without prior notice to figueroa.this order included a section labeled time for service which advised ross she was required to serve a copy of the order and its notice of the february hearing on figueroa at least days before the hearing.that same section advised figueroa i f you want to respond in writing,someone or serve form on ross.
on february,both parties appeared for the required hearing before temporary referee,susan baumberger.ross was accompanied by her mother,who was serving as the support person permitted by family code section,subdivision b figueroa was alone.ross mother initially sat next to ross,but the referee soon told her only a party and the party lawyer were allowed to sit at the table and ordered her to return to the audience area of the courtroom.unless the referee conducted a mass of all parties appearing that day prior to calling this case,something not reflected or implied in the transcript of the hearing,neither ross nor figueroa was sworn as a witness at any time when speaking at the hearing.
at the outset of the hearing,figueroa requested a continuance for two reasons.first,he had not had time to get a lawyer.and second,he had not figured how to get his response and accompanying written evidence served on ross without violating the tro prohibition against sending any written communications to her.
at first,the referee appeared inclined to grant the requested continuance,conditioned on maintaining the temporary protective order in place until the new hearing date.figueroa expressed no objection to that course of action.however,ross and her mother objected to a continuance and the fact they would have to take time off work again in order to attend the second hearing.ultimately the referee denied the continuance and proceeded to summarily grant the requested permanent protective order,for the maximum period of three years.
at the time the referee ruled,the only evidence before her was the form request for the temporary protective order which ross had submitted on january.this form was signed under penalty of perjury and included a narrative statement from ross describing the events leading to her need for a protective order.she also attached some letters she said had been written by figueroa and contained what she characterized as threats of violence against her.the referee did not take any oral testimony from ross,nor did she ask figueroa whether he wanted to challenge any of the statements in the written submission.moreover,when figueroa asked whether he could submit evidence of his own,the referee answered,no.
only when the referee began summarizing what the protective order prohibited and reached the firearm restriction did figueroa have an opportunity to contradict any of the claims in ross written submission.in her narrative statement,ross had said figueroa had a handgun which he kept under the seat in his automobile.but when the referee instructed figueroa he would have to surrender any firearms he owned or possessed,he denied having any such weapon or indeed any firearms whatsoever.whether he would have disputed other factual statements in ross submission it is impossible to know,since the referee had previously denied him the opportunity to do so.
discussion 
it is rare for a court of appeal to get a peek into the world of domestic violence proceedings,because these protective orders are nearly never appealed.we know something about these proceedings,not so much from the appellate brief and oral arguments,but because of judicial administration studies and innovations over the past few years we know the litigants,both plaintiffs and defendants,are unrepresented by counsel in the vast majority of was true here we also know this fact influences how these hearings should be the judge necessarily expected to play a far more active role in developing the facts,before then making the decision whether or not to issue the requested permanent protective order in such a hearing,the judge can not rely on the pro per litigants to know each of the procedural steps,to raise objections,to ask all the relevant questions of witnesses,and to otherwise protect their due process rights.we have some concerns about how the trial court conducted the hearing in this particular case.but first we consider whether this hearing should have been held when it was or whether the trial court was compelled by statute to honor appellant request for a continuance.
appellant was entitled to an automatic continuance under family code section,subdivision e,which the court improperly denied.
family code section,subdivision e provides respondents are entitled as a matter of right to a continuance when they first appear at a hearing where a permanent order is being considered,if but only if the temporary order was issued without notice.this is to allow the respondent reasonable time to respond to the applicant grounds for seeking the protective order.the respondent also is entitled to have received the order to show cause and supporting documents at least five days before the hearing.
if,on the other hand,the court issued the temporary restraining order only after notice was given to the responding party,there is no right to an automatic continuance of that hearing.there is,however,a right to receive the order to show cause and supporting documents at least days before the hearing.
in appellant brief,his counsel concedes there is no document in the record expressly stating the court issued the temporary restraining order before giving notice to figueroa,thus bringing section b into play and creating an entitlement to a continuance under section,subdivision e.he argues,however,this lack of notice can be reasonably inferred from several factors first,the absence of any declaration in the court record indicating notice was given to figueroa before the tro hearing,second,the shortened time for service of the tro on figueroa,and third,the absence in the hearing transcript of any mention he had received notice before the tro issued when the request for a continuance was being discussed.we observe further support for respondent position can be gleaned from the fact ross request for the tro was stamped as being received on january and filed on january.the court issued the tro and notice for a hearing on the permanent restraining order on the.unless ross provided written notice to figueroa she was seeking a tro before she even submitted her request,an unlikely scenario,the single day or less between when she gave the court her written request and when the court issued the tro seems too short a period for notice to have been given to respondent.
but the most persuasive evidence is found in the court order itself.it instructs ross she must serve figueroa with a copy of that order at least five days before the hearing the time period provided under b when a tro has been issued without prior notice to the responding party.had figueroa received notice prior to the ex parte hearing on the tro the court would have been compelled to fill out this section of the court order to state ross must serve a copy at least fifteen days before the hearing as required by c.thus,the content of the tro and notice of hearing is consistent only with the conclusion this tro was issued under b not c and the provisions of,subdivision e apply.as a result,figueroa was entitled,as of course,to one continuance for a reasonable period and the court lacked discretion to deny him the continuance it denied.
there is a curious wrinkle in the facts of this case,but not one we conclude affects the outcome.as will be recalled,under b when the court issues a tro without prior notice,the applicant must serve the order to show cause and supporting documents on the respondent at least five days before the hearing on the permanent order.but under c,if the court issued that order with prior notice,the applicant must serve those same papers on the respondent at least days before that hearing.here ross served the tro,the order to show cause,and all the other required documents on figueroa the very next day after the tro issued,january.that was fully days before the hearing date for consideration of a permanent restraining order.consequently,figueroa had a longer time to prepare for that hearing than if he had received prior notice of the tro before it was considered and issued.
but does this anomaly mean figueroa lost his entitlement to a mandatory continuance under e we think not.the fact ross provided days more notice than the minimum required when a tro is issued without prior notice does not take this out of the definition in b which qualifies figueroa for a mandatory continuance.b does not say it only applies if the applicant provided precisely five days notice,or no more than five days notice,or between five days and days notice,or less than days notice.it is silent on the upper limit of the notice period,and authorizes any notice of any length,so long as it is at least five days before the hearing.if a tro has been issued against a respondent without a prior notice,and he or she is served with the required papers for the hearing on the permanent order at least five days before that hearing,the respondent has been served under b,no matter that notice was received or or days before the hearing.and,if the respondent has been served under b,he or she is entitled,as of course,to one continuance under the terms of e.
it is true figueroa was unaware of section and its interrelated subdivisions and did not raise the argument he had an entitlement under that code section to a mandatory continuance.instead he appealed to the trial court discretion,urging he had reasons for needing a continuance.first,he needed more time to find a lawyer.second,he had not been able to serve his written response on ross,because he interpreted the tro erroneously to preclude him from sending anything,even legal papers,to ross.finally,he evidently lacked enough time to get signatures on some of the written statements from his defense witnesses.the trial court wavered,but finally decided it was more important to save ross and her mother the inconvenience and cost of attending a second hearing than to give figueroa a second chance to supply written evidence in his defense.thus,the court exercised its discretion to deny figueroa his requested continuance.
in doing so,however,the trial court exceeded its discretion.the court simply lacked the discretion to deny figueroa the continuance he requested because he was entitled to it as a matter of right under the terms of section b and e.especially in a forum which in practice must largely function without lawyers and where the judge,as a result,is expected to play an active role in protecting the rights of the parties,we are loath to conjure a waiver or forfeiture of figueroa statutory entitlement to a continuance from his failure to argue those grounds when seeking a continuance at the hearing.if the trial court was aware of figueroa right to a continuance,it was duty bound to rule accordingly when a continuance was requested.if the court was not aware of this right,that may be unfortunate but certainly not a sufficient ground to affirm a clearly erroneous ruling.
ii.because appellant will be entitled to a rehearing in this case should respondent elect to pursue a permanent restraining order after remand,this court notes some due process and procedural problems that should be avoided in future proceedings.
the form figueroa received from the court notifying him of the hearing which would decide whether a permanent restraining order should be issued advised he was entitled to file a written response,if he served it on ross no later than two days before the scheduled hearing.in no sense did this notice state or imply the filing of such a written opposition was a prerequisite figueroa had to fulfill if he were to challenge ross written statement and accompanying papers.there is nothing in the notice or indeed anything in the code provisions suggesting this written statement is in the nature of a functional equivalent of an answer in more formal civil absence of which would entitle the plaintiff to a default judgment.nor is there anything in the notice or the applicable code provisions suggesting it is the substantial equivalent of a formal opposition to a summary judgment motion,which again if not filed might entitle the moving party to a judgment in its favor without a hearing.
to put it another way,nothing in the notice or in the procedural sections of the code suggests the responding party in one of these protective order cases is not free to challenge the issuance of a permanent order entirely through oral testimony at the hearing itself.figueroa,along with any other responding party,might reasonably construe the notice as providing him an option to provide some or all of his evidence through a written submission prior to the hearing itself.the notice advises these parties they may submit such a written statement,not that they must 
in the unlikely event it indeed is the practice in this or all domestic violence restraining order proceedings to require the responding party to submit a written response before being entitled to present any oral evidence in opposition to the moving party allegations and evidence,the form notice used in this case would raise serious due process issues.a notice advising respondents they may,but not must,serve and file a written response is calculated to mislead,if indeed the failure to submit such a written response forecloses all other avenues for presenting evidence challenging the moving party allegations and evidence.if that were the case,and we assume it is not,the court would have affirmatively deprived figueroa and other respondents of their due process opportunity to be heard by misleading them about the consequences of failing to file a written statement prior to the hearing.
we seriously doubt this is a common or even uncommon practice in domestic violence proceedings before california courts.we have discussed the due process problems with such a procedure or practice only because the pro tem referee in this case appeared to act as if this written statement were the only form of evidence figueroa could use to challenge ross request for restraining order and accompanying documents.after his request for continuance had been denied and it was revealed figueroa had a written statement but had not served it on ross he asked the referee if he nevertheless could present this evidence.the referee merely answered no,and proceeded to rule,granting a permanent injunction for the maximum period of three years.
at that point,especially in a proceeding largely used by pro pers and in which figueroa was in fact participating on a pro per basis,the referee should have advised figueroa he could provide oral testimony,even though he would not be permitted to file the written statement he had failed to timely serve on ross.it is true figueroa had mentioned his witnesses were not present and thus he was in no position to offer their oral testimony.but he certainly could have testified himself and raised questions to be
