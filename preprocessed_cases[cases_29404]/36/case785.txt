closing arguments

in arguing that the petitions should be dismissed,parents counsel asserted that ashley was manipulative,and her testimony was inconsistent and not credible.
jurisdictional rulings 
at the commencement of its oral statements following the jurisdictional hearing,the court stated that it had read literally every single page of every single exhibit.it found that ashley lies and manipulates people to get her way,and there were numerous lies and inconsistencies in her testimony.it noted that teresa,maurice,and melissa daughter were not called to testify at the hearing and ashley diary,allegedly containing information about the molestation,was not produced.the court found that ashley was not credible,trustworthy,or reliable,and it did not sustain the sexual abuse,subd.d or failure to support,subd.g allegations in ashley petition.the court sustained only the allegation in ashley petition,under section,subdivision b,that mother failed to provide and ensure medical care resulting in ashley hospitalizations and a medical emergency.it found not true all of the allegations in ashton petition and ordered it dismissed.
february dispositional report 
the bureau february dispositional report recommended that ashley be adjudged a ward of the juvenile court and reunification services be offered to mother.the report stated that ashley was still residing with a nonrelated extended family member and ashton was residing with mother and james.it also stated that ashley had had very little contact with ashton.in february,ashley had three social worker supervised visits with ashton which went well.ashley did not speak negatively about mother during the visits.however,thereafter,parents decided they did not want to continue the visits calls to mother and her attorney were not returned and visits did not resume.the social worker concluded that it would be in the minors interests to maintain their relationship,which the social worker described as significant.the report requested that parents make ashton available for visitation with ashley and commit to a consistent visitation schedule.however,the bureau recommended order did not include visitation between the minors 
march dispositional hearing 
at the march,dispositional hearing,mother counsel argued that parents requested there should be no visitation between the minors until ashley had undergone a certain number of therapeutic appointments.the court refused the request.mother counsel informed the court that parents had split up and james and ashton had relocated to texas.mother said she agreed to ashton relocation.ashley counsel stated that ashley primary concern was that she be able to see ashton.the court ordered ashley to have twice monthly,supervised visitation with ashton,to be paid for by parents,but acknowledged such visits are unlikely unless james and ashton return from texas.the court ordered mother to advise the bureau if ashton is in town.the court written dispositional order specified that ashley is to have supervised visitation with mother,ashton,and robert m.as to ashton,it specified twice monthly visits.responsibility for payment of supervision during visits is not mentioned in the written dispositional order.
i.the minors appeal 
discussion 
the sole issue raised by the minors is that the juvenile court dismissals of the sexual abuse allegations in ashley petition and in ashton petition were erroneous because the court overlooked teresa corroborating statement contained within the bureau jurisdictional report.
the minors note that,at the jurisdictional hearing,the court stated the following regarding teresa w hen the officer tries to contact the one person ashley claims to have told about this,teresa,he never able to reach her melissa,though,this is interesting,last sentence in the police report the officer talks again with melissa.between july and the date he wrote his report,august,melissa said,i have been in contact with teresa,and she will call you.so melissa suddenly is taking on the job of an investigating police officer.nobody asked her to do that.officer,i talked to her.she going to call you.guess what she does.why would melissa do this why she more invested.again,this child is ashley friend,not her friend.i find that very curious.no one finds her no one brings her to court.clearly,she does want to have anything to do with this,even if somebody did find her.and she does ever give a statement to the police.italics added.
the minors also note that the december jurisdictional report contains the martinez address and telephone number for teresa as well as the following proposed witness statement if present and called to testify t eresa would testify that she is a friend of ashley.she would go on to explain that they have been friends since the grade.she would go on to state that one day while they were in an grade art class,ashley was visibly upset and crying.she began to question her to find out what was wrong.she would report that she was concerned as she was aware of previous incidents ashley had shared with her about her mother being mean and abusive to her by pulling her hair.as she continued to probe,she asked ashley if james had done anything to her or if he had raped her and she nodded her head yes.t eresa would conclude her testimony by sharing that she wrote in her journal about ashley,the abuse she suffered and being raped by james and that the journal with that particular entry was with the martinez police department at this present time.
the minors argue that these matters,contained within the jurisdictional report,establish that the court overlooked substantial evidence in support of the sexual abuse allegations.
standard of review 
where,as here,the issue on appeal turns on a failure of proof at trial,the question for a reviewing court becomes whether the evidence compels a finding in favor of the appellant as a matter of law.citations.specifically,the question becomes whether the appellant evidence was uncontradicted and unimpeached and of such a character and weight as to leave no room for a judicial determination that it was insufficient to support a finding.citation.in re th.w e presume in favor of the juvenile court order,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving the prevailing party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of the order.citations.in re autumn th.
in conducting our review we have no power to judge the effect or value of,or to weigh the evidence to consider the credibility of witnesses or to resolve conflicts in,or make inferences or deductions from the evidence.we review a cold record and,unlike a trial court,have no opportunity to observe the appearance and demeanor of the witnesses.citation.issues of fact and credibility are questions for the trial court.citations.it is not an appellate court function,in short,to redetermine the facts.citation.absent indisputable evidence of abuse evidence no reasonable trier of fact could have rejected we must therefore affirm the juvenile court determination.in re sheila th.
the minors do not argue that the court erroneously failed to admit teresa corroborating statements contained within the jurisdictional report.instead,they argue the court overlooked or missed the evidence.they note that,pursuant to section the hearsay statements regarding teresa contained within the jurisdictional report were admissible,and no hearsay objection was tendered to this evidence.we presume in support of the court order that the court followed the applicable law in re julian cal th,trial court is presumed to have followed applicable law and understood that teresa statements in the jurisdictional report were admissible.the court made it very clear at the outset of the jurisdictional hearing that it considered every exhibit.the december jurisdictional report and the police reports were both exhibits admitted into evidence and both stated that ashley told teresa about james molestation.a supplemental police report expressly stated that ferrara had attempted to contact teresa,but she did not return his calls.
this case turned on the juvenile court express determination that ashley was not credible.the court also questioned the credibility of melissa.therefore,the court could properly give little or no weight to the proposed testimony of ashley friend,teresa,who failed to return ferrara phone calls and was not called as a witness at the jurisdictional hearing.we are not in a position to second guess the court credibility determinations or the weight it assigned to the evidence.the minors have failed to demonstrate error.
ii.james appeal 
james contends the court lacked authority to order visitation between the minors and,therefore,the visitation order is voidable.he argues that since ashton dependency petition was dismissed without a finding of jurisdiction,the court had no authority over ashton.james also argues that since he is not the father of ashley,he was not subject to the court jurisdiction.
preliminarily,the bureau argues that james has waived the issue of sibling visitation by failing to object thereto below.it asserts that at the dispositional hearing parents stated that they objected to visitation between the minors until ashley received therapy,but did not object to the issue of visitation itself.this is an overly narrow reading of the record before us.
parents first objected to visitation between the minors shortly after the dependency petitions were filed and continued to object thereto.the dispositional report noted that parents decided they did not want to continue the visits.since ashton dependency petition was dismissed following the jurisdictional hearing,james was not a party to the dispositional matter concerning ashley.james was neither present nor represented by counsel at the dispositional hearing.we,therefore,reject the bureau assertion that james waived the issue of sibling visitation.
as james concedes,since the dispositional order ordering ashley visitation with ashton,a nondependent of the court,was made in ashley dependency case,james arguably does not have standing to challenge that order because he was not a party to that case.however,he makes three arguments supporting his standing to challenge the visitation order.first,he argues that,as the custodial parent of ashton,who was not a dependent of the juvenile court,he possessed a fundamental liberty interest in parenting ashton free from government intervention.second,he argues that,since the court ordered that he be responsible for paying for the supervised visitation,he is personally aggrieved by the visitation order.finally,he argues that,since he and mother both objected to ashley visitation with ashton,his and mother interests interweave such that each has standing 
the bureau argues that the visitation order involves mother,who has not appealed,and the minors.it argues that an august memo reflects ashton desire to see ashley and ashley desire to see ashton.therefore,james interests do not interweave with either child.
generally,parents can appeal judgments or orders in juvenile dependency matters.citation.however,a parent must also establish she or he is a party aggrieved to obtain a review of a ruling on the merits.citation.therefore,a parent can not raise issues on appeal from a dependency matter that do not affect her or his own rights.citation.in re th.to be aggrieved,a party must have a legally cognizable immediate,pecuniary and substantial interest which is injuriously affected by the court decision.county of alameda carleson cal d,in re,at.a nominal interest or remote consequence of the ruling does not satisfy the standing requirement.citation.an appellant can not urge errors that affect only another party who does not appeal.citation.in re,at.
pursuant to this standard,james has standing to appeal the sibling visitation order.at the dispositional hearing,the court stated that parents would be responsible for paying for the supervised visitation between the minors.although the clerk transcript does not mention the responsibility for payment for the supervised visitation,where,as here,the court oral statements in the reporter transcript differ from the recitals in the clerk transcript,the oral statements control.in re th,in re merrick th.james responsibility for payment of the supervised visitation implicates an immediate,substantial,and pecuni
