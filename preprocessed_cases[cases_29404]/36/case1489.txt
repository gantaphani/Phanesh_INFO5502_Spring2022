in this case,a mother appeals from the dispositional order removing her daughter from her custody and awarding custody to the child father.the mother claims the juvenile court violated the indian child welfare act et icwa.she argues it erred in going forward with the dependency proceedings when no evidence of service of notice on the appropriate tribes,receipt of notice by the tribes,or any response from the tribes had been filed with the court.the social services agency and the father,on the other hand,contend the icwa notice provisions are inapplicable because the child ultimately was placed in her father custody,not in the custody of a foster parent,and the icwa does not apply to intrafamily disputes.
however,the child was initially removed from her mother and temporarily placed in emergency shelter care and then in foster home care.the fact that the court later ordered the child placed in the custody of her father did not nullify the icwa notice provisions applicable in involuntary proceedings.moreover,the marital dissolution exception to the application of the icwa is itself inapplicable.the mother and father are not married and this is not a custody dispute arising out of a marital dissolution,but rather a proceeding born out of concern for the safety of the child.
we agree with the mother that the social services agency failed to provide to the juvenile court information on which the court could base a decision as to whether proper notice had been given to the indian tribes and whether the procedural provisions of the icwa apply.it also made no determination as to whether,if those provisions apply,the mother has waived their application.we therefore reverse and remand for such determinations.
on january,the orange county social services agency ssa filed a juvenile dependency petition,asserting jennifer came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.jennifer,then years old,had been living with her mother.according to ssa,jennifer was frequently left alone with her nephew and her mother used methamphetamine on a regular basis.
the detention hearing was held on january,at which time jennifer was detained at an emergency shelter home.according to her father,the court asked at the detention hearing whether the mother or father had indian heritage.the mother said she believed she was of cherokee heritage and the father indicated he believed he was of yaki heritage.the court ordered ssa to investigate jennifer possible indian heritage and to provide notice to the appropriate tribes.the court also set the matter for trial on january.
on that date,ssa filed its report in which it stated the icwa might apply.it reminded the court that jennifer mother had stated she might have cherokee heritage and jennifer father had stated he might have yaki heritage.ssa also stated it had sent notice to both tribes and to the bureau of indian affairs bia.
trial commenced on january,as scheduled.no evidence concerning notice to the tribes or the bia was presented.the mother states no mention of either the icwa or any notices was made during the oral proceedings,and the father and ssa generally agree with her characterization of the facts.
when trial commenced,jennifer continued to live in an emergency shelter home.jennifer father,who was not married to her mother,was willing to take jennifer into his home,but jennifer did not want to live with him.ssa recommended that jennifer be declared a dependent child of the court.the court ruled that jennifer came under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b and set the dispositional hearing for february.
in advance of that hearing,ssa filed a report stating jennifer had been placed in a foster home.ssa recommended against jennifer being returned to her mother at that time,and stated jennifer still did not want to live with her father.it recommended that she remain in foster home care,with regular visits with both parents.by order dated february,the court ordered jennifer declared a dependent child of the orange county juvenile court under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d.it also ordered that jennifer father have custody of her,under the supervision of ssa.the court set the review hearing for august.
jennifer mother filed an appeal from the february,dispositional order.she claims the juvenile court erred in failing to apply the notice and other procedural requirements of the icwa.
discussiona.applicability of icwa notice.title united states code section a 
title united states code section a provides in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe 
according to jennifer mother,the requirements of this section were not met.because ssa report informed the court that both the mother and the father claimed to have indian heritage,the court had reason to know that an indian child was involved,and was therefore required to ensure compliance with the icwa notice requirements despite this,the mother points out,no copies of notices are contained in the superior court file.there is no proof,she says,that notice was sent by registered mail,return receipt requested,or assuming notice was sent,that the contents of the notice informed the tribes of the proceedings and of their right to intervene.
foster care placement 
ssa contends any violation of the icwa notice requirements was harmless error,for a couple of reasons.for one,it emphasizes the portion of title united states code section a providing that n o foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the tribe ssa maintains the proceedings need not have been delayed on account of notice because there was no foster care placement at issue,inasmuch as the court put jennifer in the custody of her father.
but this argument ignores the fact that the issue of possible foster care placement was squarely before the juvenile court.in advance of the dispositional hearing,ssa filed a report recommending that jennifer remain in foster home care.ssa asks us to fixate on the result of the proceedings,the order that jennifer be placed in the custody of her father,rather than on the possibility that the court could have ordered continued foster home care.the distinction was addressed in a decision of our sister state court in state ex rel.juvenile department of multnomah county cooke.
in that case,the appellate court stated although the court could have ordered the child placed in foster care after finding jurisdiction in this case,it did not do so.therefore,plaintiff says,the court did not need to follow icwa procedures and will not need to do so unless there is a later attempt to change the placement of the child.in short,plaintiff argues,the actual rather than the potential result of the proceeding should determine the role which the icwa plays in it.plaintiff argument would require the court to speculate about the outcome of a juvenile proceeding in order to determine what role the icwa would play and would encourage the agency to base its recommended disposition on issues other than the child best interests.it would allow the court and the agency to become deeply involved in the child family while ignoring the requirement that they consider the child cultural heritage.they could avoid providing the required procedural protections until almost the very end of the process,making the ultimate decision a fait accompli.state ex rel.juvenile department of multnomah county cooke,supra,at.
jennifer had already been placed in temporary foster home care and ssa recommended that the foster home care continue.at the time the court made its order,it was unknown whether,in the months to come,jennifer might have been placed in permanent foster home care or whether her mother parental rights might ultimately have been terminated.certainly this was an involuntary proceeding within the meaning of title united states code section a,and ssa,as the party seeking temporary foster home care,had the obligation to comply with the icwa notice requirements.
this conclusion is consistent with title united states code section i,which defines the term foster care placement as any action removing an indian child from its parent or indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or indian custodian can not have the child returned upon demand,but where parental rights have not been terminated.jennifer was temporarily placed in a foster home and ssa was seeking to have the temporary placement continue.jennifer had been removed from her custodial parent,her mother,who could not have jennifer returned upon demand.the notice provisions of title united states code section a apply in involuntary proceedings of this nature.
as summed up in in the interest of and iowa,a proceeding to determine whether a child is in need of assistance due to the mother unfitness could result in temporary foster home placement of the indian child and clearly falls under the icwa.accord,state ex rel.juvenile department of multnomah county cooke,supra,at.
dissolution exception 
ssa and jennifer father also contend that the icwa does not apply unless custody is being taken from both parents.it is correct that the icwa,by its terms,is inapplicable in marital dissolution proceedings adoption of lindsay d.lindsay in re crystal d.crystal.but this is not a marital dissolution proceeding.neither ssa nor the father cites any authority applying the dissolution exception when a child is removed from the custodial parent out of safety concerns,and temporarily placed in emergency shelter care,then in foster care,and ultimately in the care of the noncustodial parent,to whom the custodial parent is not married.
in lindsay,supra,d,the child was born out of wedlock to an indian father and a mother.when the mother later married and her husband sought to adopt the child,the court declined to extend the dissolution exception in proceedings to terminate the parental rights of the indian father.the court held the icwa was clearly applicable,inasmuch as it was clear the child was an indian child and the termination of parental rights was at issue.a.the court held it was just as clear that t he language of the act makes but two exceptions it does not apply to the custody provisions of a dissolution decree or to delinquency proceedings.lindsay,supra,d at.just because the two parents of the child opposed each other in the proceedings,did not mean the dissolution exception applied.the child was born out of wedlock and no dissolution proceedings were taking place.
the court in crystal,supra,d.applied a similar analysis and concluded that the icwa dissolution exception was inapplicable when a mother petitioned to terminate the parental rights of the indian man who was her and the father of the child.the crystal court observed,as did the lindsay court,that the statutory scheme included only two exceptions custody disputes resulting from dissolution proceedings between parents of an indian child and placements of indian children resulting from juvenile delinquency actions.citations.crystal,supra,d at.as the crystal court further stated,the excluding language on its face means a custody dispute involving a placement in a dissolution proceeding.congress delineated the only exclusions and judicially created exclusions can not be added.citations.id.at.the court rejected the view that the icwa is inapplicable in all types of intrafamily custody disputes.rather,it concluded congress was obviously aware of the issue of whether the icwa should apply in all intrafamily custody disputes or only in dissolution proceedings and chose to limit the exception to the dissolution context.id.at.
the reasoning of lindsay,supra,d.and crystal,supra,d.is sound.this is not a custody battle arising out of a dissolution proceeding and we can not apply the dissolution exception to the facts of this case.
notice to tribes 
evidence before the juvenile court 
as jennifer mother states,the superior court record contains no proof that notice was sent to the tribes,that it was properly served,or that it provided the information required by the icwa.as she further asserts,ssa should have provided proper documentation to the juvenile court for its determination as to whether the notice requirements of the icwa had been met.as stated in in re marinna th,footnote,d marinna to satisfy the notice provisions of the act and to provide a proper record for the juvenile court and appellate courts,a social services agency should follow a procedure.first,it should identify any possible tribal affiliations and send proper notice to those entities,return receipt requested.rule f.second,the agency should provide to the juvenile court a copy of the notice sent and the return receipt,as well as any correspondence received from the indian entity relevant to the minor status.if the identity or location of the tribe can not be determined,the same procedure should be used with respect to the notice to bia.see also people ex rel.south dakota department of social services,notice to tribe insufficient when record contains no proof that notice was sent by registered mail,return receipt requested.
this procedure was not followed in the case before us,as it should have been.no evidence regarding notice,receipt of notice,or any responses from the tribes or the bia was provided to the juvenile court.
this case bears similarity to in re samuel th,d samuel.in that case,the social worker report for the jurisdictional hearing stated that a request for confirmation of the children status had been sent to the tribe.however,the social services agency did not provide the juvenile court with copies of the notices sent or the return receipts received.on appeal,the social services agency requested the court to take judicial notice of a copy of the notices sent and the return receipts received.the court granted the request.yet it stated since these documents were not provided to the juvenile court,the court did not have a sufficient record from which to make a determination whether there had been compliance with the notice provisions of the icwa,or whether further inquiry was needed.id.at,d.
while in samuel,supra,th,d,the social services agency only alleged that it had sent the tribes a request for confirmation of the children status,in the case before us ssa maintains it sent notices meeting the requirements of the icwa.however,in this case,as in samuel,no evidence was presented to the juvenile court concerning the communications with the tribes.in samuel,the social services agency attempted to cure the error by requesting the appellate court to take judicial notice of the documentation that should have been provided to the juvenile court.here,ssa attempted to cure the error by requesting this court to take additional evidence on appeal.this court,as did the appellate court in samuel,took judicial notice of the proffered documentation.unfortunately,we erred in this regard.ssa moved to introduce evidence on appeal,but did not request judicial notice.therefore,we vacate our earlier order granting judicial notice.in addition,we deny ssa motions to take additional evidence on appeal.making the appellate court the trier of fact is not the solution.
without knowing whether proper notice was given,and whether any response was received from the tribes,the juvenile court could not knowingly determine whether the remaining provisions of the icwa applied.see samuel,supra,th at,d.it could not,for example,ascertain whether to apply the icwa heightened standards of proof.see,d requiring proof that remedial services designed to prevent breakup of indian family have been unsuccessful e requiring,for foster
