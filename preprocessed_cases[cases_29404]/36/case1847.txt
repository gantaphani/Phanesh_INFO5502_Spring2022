background 
we initially note that raymond brought his motion to dismiss alexis complaint under section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west.a motion to dismiss admits all allegations in the complaint and reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts.in re chicago flood litigation.with that presumption in mind,we review the factual background of this case.
alexis is a single woman who was years old at the time of the filing of her complaint,and raymond is a male who was years old at the time of the filing of the complaint.alexis and raymond first met in and began an intimate relationship lasting years.when they met,raymond introduced himself to alexis as jim richardson and told her that he was divorced.
during their relationship,the parties discussed marriage.alexis and raymond are of different races and,according to alexis,raymond told her that he would have to wait until retirement to marry because his community would not accept a marriage.raymond promised alexis that upon his retirement,they would move to another community and be married.
the parties also discussed alexis desire to have children with raymond.despite their attempts to conceive,alexis did not become pregnant,and it became apparent that raymond could not father children.in,raymond suggested to alexis that she become artificially inseminated by an anonymous donor as a means to have their child.artificial insemination by a donor is also known as heterologous artificial insemination.alexis claims that raymond promised her that he would provide financial support for any child born by means of artificial insemination.however,raymond written consent to the procedure was never obtained.alexis contends that raymond orally consented to the procedure and that but for raymond promise to support the children,alexis would not have completed the procedure.
according to alexis,with raymond continuing consent and active encouragement,she attempted to become pregnant through artificial insemination.raymond provided financial assistance for the insemination procedure accompanied alexis to the doctor office for examinations injected alexis with medication designed to enhance her fertility and participated in selecting the donor so that the offspring would appear to be a product of their relationship.
on the fifth attempt,alexis became pregnant and gave birth to twin boys in.raymond participated in selecting names for the children.after the births,raymond acknowledged the children as his own.he also provided support for them in the form of monthly payments of cash and the purchase of food,clothing,furniture,toys,and play equipment.in her complaint,alexis further describes many family vacations with raymond to different states and mexico,and alleges that raymond also paid for the children medical,travel,and entertainment expenses.
in,alexis discovered that raymond was not named jim richardson and that he was married.upon discovering raymond true name and marital status,alexis ended their relationship.since,raymond has provided no financial support for the children.
alexis filed a complaint against raymond seeking to establish paternity and impose a support obligation for the benefit of the twin boys.in the first two counts,alexis sought to impose child support obligations by invoking common law theories of breach of an oral agreement and promissory estoppel.in the remaining count of her complaint,alexis sought a declaration of paternity and establishment of child support pursuant to the illinois parentage act ilcs et west.
raymond filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that alexis common law claims,contained in counts i and ii,were unenforceable under the provisions of the frauds act ilcs et west and contravened illinois public policy.raymond also argued that all three counts should be dismissed pursuant to section of the code ilcs west because alexis failed to set forth a legally recognized basis for the imposition of a relationship or for child support under the illinois parentage act ilcs et west.
the circuit court granted raymond motion and dismissed alexis complaint.the circuit court interpreted the illinois parentage act as requiring that a husband consent in writing before he is treated in law as the natural father of a child conceived to his wife by means of artificial insemination.the circuit court commented that it would not be rational that unmarried couples would have fewer safeguards in such a matter.the circuit court therefore held that alexis common law theories were not actionable because the illinois parentage act expressly requires written consent.the circuit court did not refer to the frauds act in its dismissal of the complaint.
alexis appealed the circuit court decision,and the appellate court majority determined that alexis common law theories for child support fail because the illinois parentage act governs artificial insemination and requires that the husband consent must be in writing.the appellate court held that written consent is required before an unmarried man becomes legally obligated to support a child born as a result of artificial insemination.based on its decision,the appellate court did not reach the issue concerning the frauds act.
ii.discussion 
as previously noted,raymond brought his motion to dismiss under section of the code ilcs west.section permits a litigant to combine a section ilcs west motion to dismiss and a section ilcs west motion for involuntary dismissal into one pleading.ilcs west.a section motion raises certain defects or defenses and questions whether raymond is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.illinois graphics nickum.a section motion questions whether a complaint states a cause of action.illinois graphics,at.
when ruling on a motion to dismiss under either section ilcs west or section ilcs west of the code,the court must interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.chicago flood litigation,at.a motion to dismiss should be granted only if alexis can prove no set of facts that would support a cause of action.chicago flood litigation,at.we review both the dismissal of a complaint and the interpretation of a statute de novo.chicago flood litigation,at,people robinson.
in construing a statute,this court must give effect to the intent of the legislature.antunes sookhakitch.to ascertain legislative intent,we must examine the language of the entire statute and consider each part or section in connection with every other part or section.castaneda illinois human rights comm n.where the language is clear and unambiguous,we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction.davis toshiba machine,america.with these principles in mind,we now turn to the interpretation of the illinois parentage act.
in,the general assembly enacted the illinois parentage act ilcs et west to define the legal relationships of a child born to a wife and husband requesting and consenting to artificial insemination.pub.act,eff.january.section of the illinois parentage act provides 
a if,under the supervision of a licensed physician and with the consent of her husband,a wife is inseminated artificially with semen donated by a man not her husband,the husband shall be treated in law as if he were the natural father of a child thereby conceived.the husband consent must be in writing executed and acknowledged by both the husband and wife.the physician who is to perform the technique shall certify their signatures and the date of the insemination,and file the husband
