this case is not much about grace it is about grace,a child born with severe spina bifida.grace was abandoned soon after birth to the custody of the new mexico children,youth,and families department and placed with a foster family.over the foster family objection,the children,youth,and families department allowed veronica bogey to adopt grace soon after grace first birthday.the basis of the foster family objection was that they thought bogey was actually a man pretending to be a woman because of bogey extensive facial hair.veronica bogey hermaphrodite who claims also to be veronica bogey moved in.responsibility for her case bounced around from one social worker to another and concerns about her situation were investigated by an uninquisitive investigator.grace situation quickly turned from muddled to tragic she died four weeks after the adoption was finalized,apparently as the result of being beaten to death.
this case is legally about the claimed failures of the children,youth,and families department the department to properly discharge their custodial obligations of investigation and oversight,particularly during the period between placement for adoption and the time adoption decree was entered.the argument is that,but for the failure of oversight by the department during the months leading up to the entry of the formal decree of adoption,the adoption would not have been permitted and grace would not have been placed in mortal danger.
scott johnson,as personal representative of the estate of the child,renamed grace bogey at adoption,filed suit under state tort law and against the department and a number of its employees.his state tort claims were dismissed as a matter of law,his claims against several department employees were dismissed on summary judgment,and a jury entered a verdict in favor of two department employees on his remaining claims.he now appeals,arguing that sovereign immunity does not bar his state tort claims against the department and the department employees the district court erred in granting summary judgment to virginia villareal and ginger bowman,department employees responsible for monitoring grace placement and an investigation into child abuse allegations raised against the adoptive mother and the jury verdict in favor of anne holmes and sonia perez sanchez,two other department employees involved with the adoption,should be overturned because the jury instructions improperly required a determination that their actions shocked the conscience in order to find that they violated the child substantive due process rights.
under new mexico law,it is clear that the state did not waive sovereign immunity.the jury instructions used in the trials of holmes and perez were clearly in accordance with our substantive due process jurisprudence.the district court decision granting summary judgment to bowman was also proper.however,there are disputed questions of material fact as to whether villareal properly exercised her professional judgment by failing to investigate several disturbing events that took place while she was the primary social worker assigned to grace case.we conclude the district court dismissal of the claims against the department,its grant of summary judgment to bowman,and the jury verdicts in favor of holmes and perez should be affirmed.grant of summary judgment to villareal,however,should be reversed and the case remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in,lorena torrez gave birth to graciela cano grace lee bogey grace.as noted,grace was born with severe spina bifida and,because of her special needs,torrez soon proved unable to care for her.torrez thus relinquished all parental rights,whereupon the department assumed legal custody and began efforts to find adoptive parents.in the interim,grace was placed with foster parents charlene and graydon blevins.
the department conducted several home studies in its efforts to find permanent adoptive parents for grace,including one by denise narvaez,a department employee,of veronica bogey,a single schoolteacher previously licensed by the department as a qualified adoptive parent.viviane encinias,an adoption consultant,forwarded the bogey home study along with several other home studies to anne holmes,a department employee previously assigned as grace treatment worker.
department officials decided to focus on bogey and held a matching staffing meeting to discuss bogey as the potential adoptive parent and her ability to care for grace.in attendance were encinias,holmes,narvaez,lydia saenz,a treatment supervisor,sonia perez the placement worker assigned to provide services for grace,and virginia villareal,perez supervisor.at the meeting,they decided that bogey was a good match for grace.an expert hired by the personal representative described the process as having been conducted in an excessively hasty manner.
the department ultimate decision to place grace with bogey was not free from hesitation and doubt.holmes expressed concern that bogey would not be able to meet grace needs because she was single.charlene blevins objected because she believed bogey appeared to be a man pretending to be a woman.both of these worries were determined by the department to be unfounded.the department then proceeded to the next steps required to permanently place grace with bogey a home inspection and full disclosure,during which department officers fully explained to bogey the extent of grace medical problems,and a visit by bogey with grace in the foster home.
on completion of this process,the department allowed preadoptive placement with bogey.soon thereafter,perez expressed concern that bogey would be overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for a child with special needs,and suggested that respite care might be appropriate.despite this concern,the department proceeded without offering such assistance,but did provide a monthly subsidy of and agreed to cover medical expenses for any condition not covered by bogey health insurance or medicaid.
after placement,perez,who was performing the responsibilities of two social workers due to understaffing in the department,assumed primary responsibility for monitoring grace progress.although under department policy perez was expected to conduct monthly home visits,perez visited bogey home but two or three times over the course of almost six months.perez did,however,monitor grace progress in other ways.she saw grace in the department offices on two or three occasions,once picked her up at a daycare facility,and placed a number of phone calls to bogey to discuss grace progress.villareal also met with grace during her visits to the department offices.
during the preadoptive placement,a nurse,kerstin lagestam,was hired to conduct on grace.during her first visit to bogey home,nurse lagestam noticed swelling and a large purple bruise on the left side of grace face.bogey explained that she accidently bumped grace face on the side of a car door.
nurse lagestam then began to visit grace once each day at her day care facility.several months after she started,nurse lagestam noticed marks on grace neck,back,and abdomen.considering the marks to be fingernail scratches deep enough to leave scars,nurse lagestam reported the injuries to her supervisor,janie mealand,who proceeded to call holmes at the department.holmes was unavailable and,a few days later,nurse lagestam noticed that grace right hand was bruised and swollen.she promptly reported this to mealand as well.
mealand did not hear from holmes for several days.when holmes eventually returned her call,she told mealand to call sonia perez.mealand did so on march,and two days later,perez told mealand to call the department abuse hotline.immediately after she heard from perez,mealand called the hotline it was march.she did not hear back from the department for two weeks,at which point,she called the hotline again.this time,she was told that perez would call her back.another week passed before perez returned her call.
the bureaucratic morass at the department did not only impede its ability to return phone calls the actual investigation into the abuse allegations was stalled as well.although mealand had first contacted department officials about the reported abuse much earlier,the department did not begin its investigation until the call to the hotline was made on march.bogey left for a vacation the next day,march.although perez and the department abuse investigator,ginger bowman,attempted to contact bogey before she went on vacation and left a phone message,they were not able to reach her.
when bogey returned from vacation on april,she called perez,who told bogey about the allegations and explained that allegations of this sort are frequently unsubstantiated.bogey responded by saying that grace tends to get bruises that do not heal quickly when crawling and that the pet ferret belonging to bogey father may have scratched grace.
when perez and bowman finally conducted the required home visit following abuse allegations,bowman examined grace and determined that there was no evidence of physical abuse.grace shins were bruised,but bowman noted that this is common among children like grace who lack feeling in their lower extremities.according to bowman,grace seemed attached to bogey and did not flinch when bogey approached.bogey told bowman that any scratches or bruises were probably the result of contact with other children at day care or from incidental contact with rings that bogey wears.
after this investigation,bowman told villareal and perez that there was no evidence of abuse.she did not,however,prepare a contemporaneously written report,nor did she explain to either what she had observed.perez offered bogey respite care,but bogey declined.bowman did not contact any third party to ask about the abuse allegations.
two months later,perez quit her job at the department.because of the lack of available staffing at the department,villareal assumed the entirety of perez double caseload,as well as keeping her supervisory responsibilities.for the next two months,villareal was the primary social worker assigned to grace case.during this period,substantial changes occurred in the bogey home.first,bogey father,terry bogey,moved in.villareal did not know that terry bogey was going to move in,although she did know that bogey planned to move,along with grace,to wisconsin after the adoption became final in order to be closer to her father.second,bogey removed grace from daycare and fired her home health nurses,leaving grace entirely cut off from any contact with the outside world.villareal neither investigated terry bogey nor the decision to remove grace from outside contact.despite the upheaval in grace life,villareal did not visit bogey home once during this period.
following a hearing in children court,bogey adoption of grace was finalized on july.both the abuse allegations and bowman report that determined the allegations as being without merit were provided to the children court and grace guardian ad litem before the finalization of the adoption.
little more than one month later,bogey brought grace to a hospital emergency room because she was congested and could not breathe.grace died soon after.on admission,hospital personnel determined that grace death was the result of child abuse.an autopsy report concluded that grace died of craniocerebral blunt force,and noted that there was evidence of serious injuries to grace head,neck,torso,and extremities.grace arm was also broken.autopsy timing of the break was placed as likely having occurred several weeks prior to grace death.fingernail scratches of recent origin were identified on grace arm,as were scars on grace abdomen and lower back.
the personal representative for grace estate sued bogey and her father,a number of department,villareal,bowman,holmes,saenez,encinias,karen zarate,and bonnie the department itself he claimed that the defendants violated the new mexico torts claims act nmtca and the federal adoption assistance and child welfare act aacwa.he also filed a claim under for violations of the substantive component of the due process clause against the department employees and the bogeys.
in response to a b motion,the district court dismissed the nmtca and aacwa claims against all defendants.the district court also dismissed the claims against bogey and her father because they were not state actors.it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims against the bogeys.
the district court then granted summary judgment on the claims for bowman,encinias,narvaez,saenz,vehstedt,villareal,and zarate on qualified immunity grounds.claims against holmes and perez,however,proceeded to trial,and a jury returned a verdict in their favor.
the personal representative now appeals,arguing that the district court improperly dismissed on the pleadings the claims brought under the nmtca utilized improper jury instructions for the trial of perez and holmes and improperly granted summary judgment to bowman and villareal.
below,the state tort claims against the department,a new mexico state agency,and the department employees were dismissed because the defendants were protected by sovereign immunity.this determination was erroneous,the personal representative argues,because the building waiver clause in the nmtca expressly waives sovereign immunity in these circumstances.he is mistaken.because new mexico does not have a duty to engage in the operation of bogey house or the provision of care to grace,the buildings waiver does not apply.sovereign immunity thus bars the personal representative state tort law claims against the department and the individual defendants.
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.sutton utah state sch.for deaf and blind,cir.the new mexico tort claims act does not provide a cause of action for all negligent behavior engaged in by state employees.instead,it seeks to balance the need to limit governmental liability and the desire to compensate those injured by the negligence of state employees by creating a general immunity from tort liability for the state and state employees with certain,limited exceptions.cobos dona ana county hous.
one exception is the building waiver exception,which states.the immunity granted pursuant to subsection a of section nmsa does not apply to liability for damages resulting from bodily injury,wrongful death or property damage caused by the negligence of public employees while acting within the scope of their duties in the operation or maintenance of any building,public park,machinery,equipment or furnishings.
stat.ann.emphasis added.
because the department had the responsibility to provide oversight over grace care by bogey,it is urged,the state had responsibility to maintain and operate bogey home.the new mexico supreme court has interpreted the phrase operation and maintenance in somewhat broadly it is not limited in its applicability strictly to defects in the physical building.upton clovis mun.sch.nor is it limited to buildings owned by the government.cobos,at.instead,courts must examine the scope of the duties performed by public employees to operate or maintain the building in question.id.when public employees have a duty to operate or maintain a structure,the state is liable if the negligent actions of the public employees pose a danger to the general public.espinoza town of taos.however,claims based on a public employee duty to inspect and supervise do not fall within the building waiver exception.cobos,at.
this is not an issue of first impression new mexico courts have considered similar facts twice before.in state ex rel.human servs.dep t,the new mexico court of appeals held the department did not operate a foster home under the nmtca by virtue of placing a child in the home.judge mizner wrote a concurring opinion noting that,although the department did not operate the foster home by making the placement decision,under some circumstances the department could operate a foster home because it engages in extensive supervision of actual operation.id.at 
in young van duyne,the court of appeals seized upon this distinction made in judge mizner concurrence.it held that the building waiver exception applied when the state placed an extremely violent young man in a foster home and the young man killed one of the foster parents.the court found that the waiver applied because the state extensive role in regulating foster homes amounted to control over the home as a licensed foster home.id.at.the holding in young rested on the extensive role the state plays in regulating and operating foster homes.
before us,the personal representative claim that the department operated and maintained bogey home takes two forms.first,he argues that the state regulation of adoptive homes before the adoption is final is akin to the state regulation of foster homes,and that,therefore,young applies.this argument is flawed because the state treatment of adoptive homes is substantially different from its treatment of foster homes.under the nmtca,foster parents are public employees,and hence the operation of their home is by the state.stat.ann.f.new mexico regulations make clear that,although foster parents are private citizens,they play a public role when they take in foster children the foster parent is a member of the child case management team and,as a team member,participates in the development and implementation of team plans and may participate in conferences,citizen review boards,judicial reviews,individual education plans.foster parents do not make independent plans for children in their care.admin.code c emphasis added.instead,foster parents cooperate with and carry out the department plans for the child.id.further,the state directly controls parenting in foster homes.for instance,state regulations specifically require foster children to be assigned household chores,id,and foster parents are forbidden from making negative comments about the foster children birth parents.admin.code.new mexico regulations also specifically regulate the buildings in which foster parents live.see id.stat.ann.d.
there are no similar regulations of putative parents before adoptions are made final.adoptive parents are investigated by the state and their progress is monitored by the state,but they are not considered public employees nor is their conduct as parents regulated and controlled by the state.in light of the highly unusual facts of young and the tension between its analysis and that in,we are not persuaded that new mexico precedent treats everything that happens within a foster home as within the building waiver exception.but even accepting that premise for sake of argument,we conclude that the reasoning of young does not extend to adoptive homes.the state does not play anywhere near as extensive a role in adoptive homes as it does in foster homes.
secondly,the personal representative argues that the department failed to sufficiently investigate and report the allegation of child abuse.the department does have a duty to investigate and report on whether there has been successful integration of the family,whether there were needs for social services,and whether there were instances of child abuse.this,however,is not operation of the home.new mexico courts have been clear that a duty to regulate and investigate violations does not constitute operation of a facility under the nmtca.see,caillouette hercules,holding that the state did not operate within the meaning of the nmtca a truck containing explosives that was inspected by state police officer following a crash because the use of the words operation and maintenance indicates an intent not to extend liability to all activities supervised or inspected by the state.owens leavitts freight,the design,planning and enforcement of safety rules for school bus transportation do not fall within the meaning of operation of a motor vehicle.cobos,at finding the state did operate a private building used as a housing project because the defendants duties in this case do not arise as a consequence of the general regulatory relationship between the government and its citizens.
neither the department nor its employees operated bogey home and they are therefore protected by sovereign immunity against the personal representative tort claims.dismissal of these claims should be affirmed.
the personal representative also appeals the jury verdict that holmes and perez did not violate grace rights under the substantive component of the due process clause.he claims that the jury instructions for their trial misstated the applicable law by requiring the jury to find that their actions shocked the conscience.therefore,the personal representative claims,the jury verdict should be reversed.this claim is meritless the jury instructions were a correct statement of applicable law.
because the personal representative failed to object to the jury instructions at trial,we review only for plain error.greene safeway stores,cir.under that standard,we will affirm unless the instructions were patently,plainly erroneous and prejudicial.id.quoting unit drilling enron oil gas,cir.
the claims against holmes and perez allege violations of grace substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.generally,state actors are liable under the due process clause only for their own actions and not the actions of private citizens.uhlrig harder,cir.there are two exceptions to this rule.state officials may be subject to constitutional liability if they create a danger that results in a harm to an individual,even if that harm is not ultimately inflicted by a state official or if the state has a special relationship with the individual who is harmed by the third party.id.both the danger creation and the special relationship theories of liability were advanced at trial.the district court instructed the jury that the personal representative was required to prove that the defendants conduct shocked the conscience to recover under either theory.
on appeal,the personal representative argues that a shocks the conscience test only applies to danger creation claims and does not apply to special relationship claims.this argument is directly precluded by our precedent.in radecki barela,we held 
it is true,of course,that state actors are generally only liable under the due process clause for their own acts and not private violence.there are,however,two exceptions to that rule.first,the state may be subject to constitutional liability if it does not perform a duty to provide protection to an individual with whom the state has a special relationship because it has assumed control over that individual,such as in a prison.second,the state may be constitutionally liable if it creates a danger that results in harm to an individual,even if that harm is ultimately inflicted by a private party.the shocks the conscience standard applies to both types of suits.
cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the jury instruction correctly stated the law and there is no reason to reverse the jury verdicts in favor of holmes and perez.
appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment favoring villareal and bowman on qualified immunity grounds is predicated on the claim that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes and improperly drew inferences in favor of bowman and villareal.the undisputed facts show that bowman exercised her professional judgment in her investigation of abuse allegations and,thus,did not violate grace substantive due process rights.there are,however,genuine issues of material fact as to whether villareal exercised her professional judgment by failing to investigate several suspicious events during the period she was the department employee directly responsible for grace.hence,we affirm the grant of summary judgment for bowman,but reverse the grant of summary judgment for villareal.
