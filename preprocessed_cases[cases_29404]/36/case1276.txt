procedural background 
on july,when was two and years old,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a dependency petition for her under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b it alleged that was exposed to violent confrontations between mother and her boyfriend,eddie,in the family home,and mother used marijuana to excess.at the july detention hearing,the court ordered detained in foster care,ordered the agency to evaluate all appropriate relatives,and gave it discretion to detain with a relative upon hours notice to her attorney.on september,the court entered true findings on the petition.on september,it declared a dependent and placed her in a foster home.
ii.factual background 
when grandmother found out eddie had injured mother,she called children protective services cps.on july,grandmother told an agency protective services worker that around june,mother left eddie and went to grandmother home eddie came to the home and threatened to kill everyone around july,mother returned to him grandmother had seen with a black eye both mother and eddie smoked marijuana and drank in front of mother hit and verbally abused her and grandmother believed was in danger.maternal aunt melody aunt,who lived with grandmother,also expressed her concerns to the protective services worker.grandmother said she wanted to become guardian in order to protect her.was already spending weekends and at least one night during the week at grandmother home.
on july,mother told social worker jessica newmyer she wanted to stay in her foster placement but agreed grandmother could have visits.at the dispositional hearing,mother testified she had not wanted placed with grandmother because she was upset that grandmother had called cps.
on august,mother said she was happy with foster home placement and did not want her placed with family members.mother disclosed she was in foster care at age because grandmother boyfriend molested her but grandmother did not believe she was being molested.mother had been misbehaving at home and stealing money and was taken to the police station.she told the police about the molestation,which had been going on for two years.she remained in foster care until she turned because she did not want to return home where she would have to follow grandmother rules.aunt was in foster care for a short time then returned to grandmother 
on august,newmyer told mother she was evaluating grandmother home for placement.mother said she preferred that remain in her foster home,but believed grandmother and aunt would take good care of her.newmyer went to grandmother and aunt home,where aunt boyfriend,luis luis,and their child,also lived.aunt told newmyer she worked nights and would be able to care for during the day while grandmother worked.aunt said she had never been molested and grandmother boyfriend had not molested mother.
newmyer asked grandmother about her cps history.according to newmyer,grandmother related the following.when mother was years old,she was ditching school,stealing,lying,and running away.when she got into trouble with the police,she told a detective that grandmother boyfriend had been molesting her and grandmother and aunt knew about and had observed the molestation.mother and aunt were removed from grandmother custody,although the allegations were false.grandmother went to counseling and soon reunified with aunt but not with mother.mother did not want to return home and manipulat ed the system.the social workers told grandmother she was sick and in denial although she had not said the allegations were false she believed the dependency system was currently treating her unfairly her only intent was to protect and try to prevent her from being in the system.
grandmother testified that when her cps case was active,she did not believe her boyfriend had molested mother,but nevertheless ended her relationship with him.since this situation with came up,grandmother believed mother claim of molestation.on august,when grandmother told newmyer she did not believe mother was molested,this was in response to a question about her original belief,not her current belief.
grandmother acknowledged she had a criminal record but believed this should not prevent placement.she testified she had a arrest for drug possession,which was dropped she was convicted of a lesser offense,unsafe housing,because there were drugs in her home she was on probation for three years and drug tested for six months with all clean tests she never used drugs and she had no other arrests.grandmother was married to,who had a criminal record,but they were separated because they did not get along 
by august,mother was no longer angry at grandmother and told newmyer she wanted placed with grandmother.newmyer reported the agency was in the process of evaluating grandmother home,but because she had a criminal background and cps history,waivers would be needed.by august,the agency had scheduled supervised visits for grandmother every other sunday and had asked counsel to agree to unsupervised visits.by september,grandmother was having unsupervised visits every sunday.she was appropriate during visits and called her mama.grandmother telephoned almost every day during the conversations,asked for her cousin,
on september,newmyer reported a criminal records check revealed grandmother was arrested on may,for for sale substance.this charge was dismissed and she was convicted of allowing drug sales in her home,a felony.regarding grandmother cps history,newmyer stated grandmother did not believe mother at the time grandmother still denies that mother was molested by her and mother was given the choice to return home or remain in foster care and she chose to remain in foster care.luis,whose criminal record involved carrying a weapon on school grounds in and possessing marijuana in had moved out of grandmother and aunt home.grandmother testified she intended to keep him out if was placed with her she would obtain a restraining order and call the police if necessary and he would have contact with outside the home.at the dispositional hearing,newmyer testified she had not officially begun evaluating grandmother home but found it to be a clean,organized apartment,with grandmother in one bedroom and aunt and in the other 
newmyer discussed grandmother with a multicultural committee,an adoptions supervisor,and other supervisors and the recommendation was that remain in a foster home until a suitable relative becomes available and approved for placement.although grandmother and mother wanted placed with grandmother,newmyer said this was against a gency policy and it was unlikely that grandmother would qualify to adopt if reunification failed.newmyer testified that factors in the decision not to approve grandmother home were her criminal and cps histories her disbelief that mother had been molested,which raised concerns about her ability to protect and about men with whom she might become involved her failure to reunify with mother and mother desire,as a teenager,to remain in foster care rather than return home.
agency supervisor martin testified she had never met grandmother or seen her home,but was impressed by her bond with,frankness and cooperation with the agency,consistent concern for safety,and efforts to protect nevertheless,martin declined to approve grandmother home for placement due to her cps and criminal histories and luis criminal history.martin believed the issues from mother dependency were unresolved,complicating placement with grandmother.according to martin,when mother was removed from grandmother as a teenager,grandmother did not believe the molestation allegations,demonstrate an ability to protect,or reunify with mother,although there were reasons for the lack of reunification such as mother teenage problems and grandmother did reunify with aunt.martin admitted grandmother participated in therapy,but did not know if she participated in conjoint therapy with mother or in any other services.grandmother,however,testified she attended individual counseling and conjoint counseling with mother and participated in parenting education.
another reason martin would not approve the placement was grandmother pattern of dating unsafe men,that is,over a period she had a relationship with the boyfriend who was accused of molesting mother and a relationship with,who had served a prison sentence for a offense,and with whom she was still involved to some degree despite their separation martin final reason for withholding her approval was that,according to the adoptions unit,which had not yet evaluated the home,it was not likely to be approved for adoption if reunification failed.
iii.the hearing and the ruling 
at the hearing,attorney joined in mother request that the juvenile court place with grandmother.appellate counsel agrees with trial counsel position and argues the judgment should be reversed,but no notice of appeal was filed on behalf.
in denying placement with grandmother,the juvenile court said while it believed the independent judgment test applied,it would make the same decision under the abuse of discretion test the agency carefully considered and balanced the factors in section there was no abuse of discretion and my independent judgment would not be different because i do believe i need to rely upon the agency expertise and the information regarding the examination of the case and the investigation of the case to make that placement.
iv.discussion 
section the relative placement preference 
when a child is removed from parental custody at the dispositional hearing,a relative requesting custody is entitled to preferential consideration,subd.a,that is,the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated,subd.c.in determining whether placement with the relative is appropriate,the county social worker and court shall consider,but shall not be limited to,certain listed factors,subd.a.
mother contends the juvenile court failed to state reasons for its denial of placement with grandmother as mandated by section,subdivision e.she further contends the agency recommendation against the placement violated section,subdivision a h because it was based solely on the premise that it would not provide legal permanency if reunification failed.she also contends the juvenile court failed to exercise its independent judgment regarding the placement and improperly employed the abuse of discretion standard.because grandmother had a criminal conviction and a child abuse history,section does not control our analysis,mother contentions are inapposite,and a consideration of section and related law,discussed below,is necessary.
mother additionally contends foster care placement violates mother statutory and due process rights to reasonable reunification services and her right to family unity and integrity.the cases on which mother relies are not on point as they do not concern section.in re baby girl d.in re monica th,d in re daniel th,d in re jessica d.cesar superior court th,d.moreover,p lacement with a relative is not tantamount to family preservation.in re jasmine th,d.nor is mother assisted by her claim that f oster care in practical effect will serve to almost guarantee the termination of m other parental rights and will ensure that m other does not have daily contact with in august,mother told the social worker she wanted to reduce her visitation with from two days a week to one.
section and health and safety code section criminal and child abuse history 
the statutes and regulations 
before a child is placed in a relative home,the social worker must institute a criminal records check and a child abuse index check,subds.a,b,c.the child abuse index check includes the review of the investigation report and file prepared by the child protective agency which investigated the child abuse report.health,subds.a c,tit,subd.a,subd.a.the criminal records check entails a state and federal level criminal records check to be conducted by an appropriate governmental agency,subd.b.
if the criminal records check indicates that the relative has been convicted of a crime that would preclude licensure under section of the health and safety code,the child may not be placed in the home,unless a criminal records exemption has been granted by the county,based on substantial and convincing evidence to support a reasonable belief that the person with the criminal conviction is of such good character as to justify the placement and not present a risk of harm to the child pursuant to paragraph,subds.d.section,subdivision d provides,in pertinent part,t he county shall evaluate individual criminal records in accordance with the standards and limitations set forth in paragraph of subdivision g of section of the health and safety code,and in no event shall the county place a child in the home of a person who is ineligible for an exemption under that provision.

analysis and case law 
grandmother cps history began in or,when mother,then or years old,reported that grandmother boyfriend molested her.mother was in foster care until,when she turned,because she refused to return home,although her troubled relationship with grandmother had improved by the time of dispositional hearing.the record contains no details of the molestation or any allegations of a dependency petition no statement what allegations were substantiated varying accounts as to when grandmother came to believe mother molestation claim and no information from the agency about the services in which grandmother participated.it is therefore unclear whether the agency reviewed the report and file from the dependency case as required by health and safety code section.that question,however,is not dispositive,as the agency did conduct a criminal records check 
the criminal records check revealed grandmother may,arrest for for sale substance and ensuing felony conviction of keep ing a place to.controlled substance.when a relative seeking placement has a record of criminal convictions,an agency social worker,such as newmyer,may request an exemption from her supervisors.in re hanna,supra,th at,d.the agency plays a hybrid role in dependency proceedings,exercising both executive and judicial functions.in re ashley th,d.its decision not to grant an exemption for a criminal conviction is an executive one in re miguel th,d,subject to administrative review health,tit.
