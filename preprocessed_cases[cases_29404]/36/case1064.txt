mother of dependent minors jesse and,appeals an order terminating her reunification services at a review hearing under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e this case presents an issue of first impression whether,at a review hearing involving dependent minors under the age of three,the juvenile court is required to continue previously offered reunification services for one parent when reunification efforts continue for the other parent and the court does not set a section selection and implementation hearing.we conclude the juvenile court may,but need not,continue an offer of reunification services to one parent when services are extended for the other parent and no selection and implementation hearing is set.given that discretion,we further conclude the court here properly terminated services because the evidence showed,despite receiving six months of services,made no attempt at reunification and was extremely unlikely to do so in the near future.accordingly,we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
in november,jesse and together the minors came to the attention of the san diego county health and human services agency agency when stabbed the minors father,christopher,with a steak knife.agency filed petitions in the juvenile court under section,subdivision b alleging the parents had exposed the minors to domestic violence.the court detained the minors with christopher on certain conditions,including not allowing in the home.
at a jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the court sustained the allegations of the petitions as amended and placed the minors with christopher.the court ordered a family maintenance plan for christopher and explained that if he did not follow all court orders,the minors would be removed from his care.the court ordered to participate in reunification services,including a domestic violence program,counseling,a psychological evaluation if recommended by her therapist,the substance abuse recovery management system sarms program and parenting classes.
during the next several months,did not maintain contact with agency or visit the minors.in march,assaulted christopher in his home after he told her to leave.the police and probation officer were notified and an arrest warrant issued.the juvenile court also issued a bench warrant after finding had not participated in drug treatment.
in may,agency filed a supplemental petition under section,alleging the minors placement with christopher was no longer appropriate because the social worker,during a visit to christopher home,found there.an investigation showed was likely living with christopher and the minors.christopher denied lived with him,said he did not know where she lived and claimed the social worker saw someone other than in his home.the court detained the minors out of home and set the jurisdiction and disposition hearing on the section petition to coincide with the review hearing.
the social worker recommended terminating services.the parents had made no progress with their service plans,and had not maintained contact with agency or visited the minors.agency was reluctant to recommend services for christopher,but recognized services were required because the minors had not been removed from christopher care before the section petition was filed.
the court sustained the allegations of the section petition and placed the minors in relative care.agency recommended the court terminate services but offer six months of services for christopher.counsel argued the court was required to continue services for,regardless of participation or progress,as long as christopher was receiving services and no selection and implementation hearing was set.the court ordered the parties to brief the issue.
after considering the parties positions,the court found had not participated in any reunification services or complied with the requirements of her criminal probation,and thus,it was futile for agency to continue offering her services.the court continued the minors as dependents,terminated services,ordered reunification services for christopher and set a review hearing.
discussion 
contends that when the court does not return a minor to parental custody or set a section hearing,it must continue reunification services for any parent who was previously receiving services,irrespective of that parent compliance with those services.citing section,subdivision e and california rules of court rule,asserts once the court orders services for a parent,it has no authority to terminate those services unless a section hearing is set.
section,subdivision e contains no express provision for a situation,like the one here,where the minors are under the age of three,there is no possibility of returning them to their mother custody because she has not availed herself of reunification services within the maximum period provided by section,subdivision a,but the court can not set a section hearing because the minors father is receiving his initial six months of services.nevertheless,we believe a fair reading of section,subdivision e,together with section,subdivision a and in light of the statutory scheme as a whole,compels the conclusion that at a review hearing,the juvenile court retains the discretion to terminate the offer of services to one parent even if the other parent is receiving services and no section hearing is set.
our analysis of this issue requires examining the interplay between the two statutes relevant here section,subdivision a governing reunification services for a parent when the minor is under the age of three,and section,subdivision e governing review hearings.in construing these statutes,we look first to the words used to determine the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the law purpose.in re heraclio th,d.where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,we follow its plain meaning and need not examine other indicia of legislative intent.in re alanna th,d.if a statute is theoretically capable of more than one construction,we must choose the construction which most comports with the legislature intent.renee superior court cal th,d.
further,although different hearings within the dependency process have different standards and purposes,they are part of an overall process and ongoing case.one section of the dependency law may not be considered in a vacuum.it must be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.in re marilyn cal th,d.in this regard,we give significance,if possible,to every word,phrase,sentence and part of a statute in accordance with the legislative purpose.in re merrick th,d.such purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the act.ibid.
in construing sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e,we strive to avoid an interpretation that requires one statute to be ignored.see in re merrick,supra,th at,d.a court must,where reasonably possible,harmonize statutes,reconcile seeming inconsistencies in them,and construe them to give force and effect to all of their provisions.citations.this rule applies although one of the statutes involved deals generally with a subject and another relates specifically to particular aspects of the subject.citations.in re sarah d.
whenever a minor is removed from parental custody,the juvenile court must,in the absence of certain specified exceptions order the social worker to provide services to the parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family,subd.a in re luke th,d in re michael th,d.the importance of reunification services in the dependency system can not be gainsaid.the law favors reunification whenever possible.in re aryanna th,d.to achieve this purpose,parents are generally entitled to months of reunification services.however,under section,subdivision a,services shall not exceed a period of six months if the minor was under the age of three when removed from the physical custody of his or her parent.italics added see sara superior court cal th,fn,d.the shortened reunification period was meant to give juvenile courts greater flexibility in meeting the needs of young children,in cases with a poor prognosis for family reunification daria superior court th,d.it also represents a legislative determination that in certain situations,efforts to continue reunification services beyond the six months do not serve and protect a minor interest.see in re joshua th,d.nevertheless,the court may extend the reunification period for a minor under the age of three up to months if there is a substantial probability the minor will be returned to the parent physical custody within the extended time period or reasonable services have not been provided to the parent,subd.a.
the statutory scheme allows services to be provided for one parent but not the other,subd.c,subd.b,subds.b,e see also in re brian th,fn,d one parent denied services at disposition under section,subdivision b while other parent was offered services riverside county superior court th,fn,d same in re dejohn th,d court may reinstitute services for one parent,but not the other,after a reversal on appeal.the court determinations regarding whether to offer services,and which particular services to offer,are necessarily made as to each parent individually.see david superior court th,d services offered to father were inadequate because they were not tailored to meet his specific needs in re victoria d.parent is entitled to services that are responsive to family special needs in light of one parent particular disabilities.nowhere in the statutory scheme is the provision of services to one parent expressly conditioned on the provision of services to the other parent.moreover,at no time during the reunification process does the court offer of continued services to one parent depend solely on the efforts of the other parent.see in re alanna,supra,th at,d court exercise of discretion regarding extending services at hearing was based on each parent efforts to reunify.indeed,at each review hearing,the court must evaluate the efforts or progress toward reunification made by each parent individually by considering the extent to which he or she availed himself or herself to services provided,subds.e f,italics added see also,subd.g,subd.a.although the purpose of services is to facilitate a child return to parental custody,reunification often involves one,but not both,parents.
the goal of family reunification is not served when a parent has shown no interest in reunifying.because reunification services are a benefit,not a constitutional entitlement,the juvenile court has discretion to terminate those services at any time,depending on the circumstances presented.in re aryanna,supra,th at,d father abysmal efforts at reunification supported court decision to terminate services before expiration of period.in deciding whether to terminate the services of one parent who has failed to participate or make progress toward reunification,the court is not constrained by a consideration of the other parent participation in services.
does not base her right to an extended offer of reunification services entirely on the provision of services to christopher.rather,she also argues the clear language of section,subdivision e prohibited the court from terminating her reunification services because it did not set a section selection and implementation hearing.specifically,claims section,subdivision e requires the juvenile court to direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue however,takes this language out of context and ignores the entire statutory scheme of which this provision is a part,including the limitation on the provision of services where the minors were under the age of three.
significant safeguards have been built into the dependency scheme,including periodic review hearings at which the court determines whether a minor should be returned to parental custody and evaluates a parent reunification efforts in light of the services offered or provided.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.review hearings are critical because they are the point at which a parent may be denied further reunification services.in re james th,d.at the review hearing,the court must order the minor returned to the physical custody of his or her parent unless it finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that returning the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child safety,protection,or physical or emotional,subd.e.the parent failure to participate regularly and make substantive progress in treatment programs shall be prima facie evidence that return would be detrimental.ibid.in making its determination,the court must consider the efforts and progress shown by the parent and the extent to which the parent availed himself or herself of services provided.ibid.
section,subdivision e further provides 
whether or not the child is returned to a parent the court shall specify the factual basis for its conclusion that the return would be detrimental or would not be detrimental.the court also shall make appropriate findings pursuant to subdivision a of section and,where relevant,shall order any additional reunification services reasonably believed to facilitate the return of the child to the custody of his or her parent 
if the child was under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal,or is a member of a sibling group in which one member was under the age of three years and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.if,however,the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child,who was under the age of three years on the date of initial removal or is a member of a sibling group in which one member was under the age of three years may be returned to his or her parent within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided,the court shall continue the case to the permanency hearing.
if the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown,or the parent has failed to contact and visit the child,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to section within days.
if the child had been placed under court supervision with a previously noncustodial parent pursuant to section,the court shall determine whether supervision is still necessary.the court may terminate supervision and transfer permanent custody to that parent 
in all other cases,the court shall direct that any reunification services previously ordered shall continue to be offered to the parent pursuant to the time periods set forth in subdivision a of section,provided that the court may modify the terms and conditions of those services.
if the child is not returned to his or her parent the court shall determine whether reasonable services that were designed to aid the parent in overcoming the problems that led to the initial removal and the continued custody of the child have been provided or offered to the parent the court shall order that those services be initiated,continued,or terminated.
subd.e italics added.
the statute makes clear that the court has discretion to set a section hearing at the review hearing under specified circumstances the minor was under the age of three or was a member of a sibling group in which one member was under the age of three the parent whereabouts continue to be unknown or the parent has not visited or contacted the minor or the parent was convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness.if the court chooses to set a selection and implementation hearing,it shall order the termination of reunification services to the parent,subd.h.
if the case does not fall into one these categories,the paragraph beginning with the language i n all other cases becomes operative.under that paragraph,the court must direct that previously ordered reunification services continue to be offered to a parent,subject to the court ability to modify the terms and conditions of those services.this presupposes reunification efforts with that parent are ongoing because otherwise,there would be no need for services or purpose served by offering them.thus,where the minor is not returned to a parent custody at the hearing but the possibility of reunification with that parent exists,the court must ensure appropriate services are being offered in furtherance of that goal.
in all cases where the minor is under the age of three,the provision for continued services found in section,subdivision e is by the mandatory time periods of section,subdivision a.because a parent of a minor under the age of three can receive a maximum of six months of services unless there is a substantial probability the minor will be returned to that parent physical custody,subd.a,the provision for continued services beyond six months applies only when a parent is so entitled,that is,has participated in and made substantive progress with services and has shown there is a substantial probability of reunification by the date.thus,the requirement for continued services under section,subdivision e does not apply when a parent has been offered or received six months of services for a child under the age of three and there is no probability of return.
nothing in section,subdivision e requires the court to continue to offer services at the hearing to a parent whose children are under the age of three and who has made no attempt at reunification.rather,the provision of continued services is expressly limited by section,subdivision a,which includes a provision that services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care,subd.a.under the rules of statutory construction,we may not introduce a new factor into the statutory equation.
moreover,even when the court does not set a section hearing at the review hearing,it retains discretion to terminate services.section,subdivision e further provides that if the minor is not returned to a parent custody,the court must assess the reasonableness of services offered or provided and shall order that those services be initiated,continued,or terminated.this provision is consistent with the notion that a parent services can be terminated at a review hearing without regard to whether the other parent is receiving services or the court sets a section hearing.
our conclusion is not changed by rule f.that rule,which was meant to implement section in the conduct of review hearings,provides that if a minor is not returned to a parent and the court does not set a section hearing,the court must continue to offer reunification services previously ordered.conspicuously absent from this rule is the language contained in section,subdivision e,which expressly incorporates section,subdivision a and thereby limits the provision of services to six months where the minor is under the age of three.if a statute reflects a legislative choice to require a particular procedure,a rule of court may not deviate from that procedure.people hall cal th,d,commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d.to the extent rule f is inconsistent with or does not track the language of the statute it purports to implement,it can not be followed.see renee superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.further,as we have concluded,sections,subdivision e and,subdivision a give the juvenile court discretion to terminate or continue services.we read rule f as consistent with that conclusion.
in the end,a court must adopt the construction most consistent with the apparent legislative intent and most likely to promote rather than defeat the legislative purpose and to avoid absurd consequences.in re cal th,d.reading section,subdivision e together with section,subdivision a,we reject interpretation that the juvenile court has no discretion to terminate a parent reunification services at the review hearing unless a section hearing is set.to read the statute as suggests would ignore the legislative choice,reiterated in the review statute,that services shall not exceed six months when the minor is under the age of three and can not safely be returned to parental custody,subd.a.interpretation would also frustrate the basic purpose of section,subdivision a by requiring the court to offer,and perhaps even,months of services to a parent who has made little or no progress toward reunification and whose prognosis for reunification is poor.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,as proposed to be amended.mandating that previously ordered services continue to be offered to a parent,who is uninterested in reunifying,until the court sets a section hearing is not a result the legislature could have intended.
construed together,sections,subdivision a and,subdivision e provide the court with the option to terminate reunification services after six months when a parent of a minor under the age of three has made little or no progress in his or her service plan and the prognosis for overcoming the problems leading to the child dependency is bleak.daria superior court,supra,th at,d.we recognize the primary purpose of limiting the period of reunification is to afford the child stability and permanence where reunification is unlikely within the statutory time limits,supra,at,d.however,even when a section hearing is not set,the termination of services previously not utilized or wanted is a step toward eliminating uncertainty in the lives of very young children and ultimately achieving the stability and permanence the legislature sought to provide for them.moreover,although financial considerations can not trump a parent fundamental rights,the legislature has recognized that in some circumstances,it may be fruitless to provide additional reunification services.in such a case,the general rule favoring reunification services is replaced by a legislative assumption that offering services would be an unwise use of governmental resources.in re alanna,supra,th at,d.
we conclude section,subdivision e provides no express limitation on the court authority to terminate reunification services to a parent at a review hearing where the minor is under the age of three and the parent has received or been offered six months of services,regardless of whether the court sets a section hearing or offers further services for the other parent.under these circumstances,the juvenile court retains the discretion to terminate the offer of services to one parent.
this court holding in alanna,supra,th,d,does not compel a different result.in that case,the father appealed the termination of his reunification services at the review hearing,arguing the court could not terminate his services while continuing the mother services to the date.he further argued,as does here,the court can only terminate a parent services if it sets a section hearing,and terminating his services served no useful purpose.we held the applicable provisions for hearings did not bar termination of reunification services for the father even though services were extended for the mother.we further held the juvenile court reasonably found the father performance did not merit continued reunification services.in re alanna,supra,th at,d.
in reaching our conclusion,we recognized the distinction between the statutory language governing review hearings,subd.e and review hearings,subds.f g,noting the court discretion to terminate services remains limited at the hearing where a child remains in foster care and the goal remains reunification.in re alanna,supra,th at,d.this observation is not inconsistent with our holding in this case,which applies when a parent has been offered or provided with the maximum amount of time to reunify with a minor under the age of three and the goal is no longer reunification with that parent.
further,we believe dicta in in re alanna highlights the importance of allowing,but not requiring,the court to offer continued reunification services to a nonreunifying parent at a review hearing as a practical matter,where a nonreunifying parent is likely to have some continued contact with his or her child,further services to that parent may be in the chi
