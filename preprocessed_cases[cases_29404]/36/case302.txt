in july,when he was six years old,brokaw and his sister were forcibly removed from their parents home in mercer county,illinois.after he turned eighteen,filed suit against his grandfather and aunt,who he contends conspired with his uncle,a deputy sheriff of mercer county,to violate his constitutional rights.also sued the social worker and other officers involved in removing him from his home,along with the state judge who presided over various hearings.additionally,the suit named mercer county and the state of illinois although the state of illinois is no longer a party to the case.after allowing to amend his pro se complaint,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.brokaw appeals.we reverse as to all defendants except the presiding judge and probation officer hansen.
factual background 
because this case comes to us from a b dismissal,we assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true,and read those facts,and all reasonable inferences flowing from those facts,in the light most favorable to bethlehem steel bush,cir.in determining whether failed to state a claim,we also consider any additional consistent facts presented by on appeal.albiero city of kankakee,cir.with this in mind,we go back in time to.
in early july of that year,the plaintiff father,dennis brokaw,who had recently been released from the hospital and who was still recuperating,was invited by his sister,karen weaver,and their father,weir brokaw,to weir home.the invitation specifically excluded dennis wife,bonnie,and their children,the plaintiff and sister.as it turned out,they were excluded because karen and weir were attempting to convince dennis to leave his family.during the next few days,weir and karen brought intense pressure on dennis to leave his family and to obtain a divorce because they objected to dennis and his family religious beliefs and practices.dennis refused.soon thereafter,on the evening of july,there was a confrontation between parents and weir brokaw and karen weaver,during which parents expressed their vehement repugnance of weir and karen attempts to split the family apart.
the next morning weir and karen,along with james brokaw weir son and dennis and karen brother and,significantly,a deputy sheriff for mercer county conspired in a plan to end the marriage.together,in response to the previous evening confrontation and because they disagreed with dennis and bonnie religious beliefs,james,karen and weir decided to file baseless and scurrilous claims of child neglect.they believed that this would cause and his sister to be removed from their parents home,and in turn prompt dennis to divorce his wife and leave his family.to further this plan,they enlisted the help of the sheriff of mercer county,marvin thirtyacre,and fabricated concerns about the welfare of plaintiff and his sister.
at about noon that same day july,sheriff thirtyacre contacted penny ingersoll,who was a caseworker for the department of children and family services,and arranged a meeting for later in the afternoon.thirtyacre,weir,james and karen met with ingersoll briefly outside the courthouse in aledo,illinois,and a few minutes later judge susan gende joined them.during this meeting,thirtyacre,weir,james and karen allegedly made allegations of child neglect to cause the dcfs to remove and his sister from their home.
according to,although judge susan gende attended this meeting,she did not issue a court order concerning the children custody.nonetheless,at dusk that evening,two men walked into home,grabbed and his sister,and carried the crying children out of their home.parents chased the intruders while repeatedly demanding that they identify themselves and explain what was happening.the men refused,one shouting we do have to tell you a damn thing believed he was being kidnaped and was going to be killed.his parents also believed that their children had been kidnaped,and they called the police.they later learned that their children were removed based on the alleged child neglect.
the strangers,who were later identified as deputy sheriff jonathon weakley and probation officer james bartlet,drove and his sister to a lane that led into a cornfield,where they were met by deputy sheriff james brokaw and sheriff martin thirtyacre.while it is unclear from the record,it appears that from there the children were taken to a foster home where they spent the night.
the next day sheriff thirtyacre filed a petition for adjudication of wardship,and the children were ordered to remain in foster care.about one week later,on july,probation officer vickie hansen picked up from the foster home and drove him to a courthouse.at the courthouse,judge gende and several other of the defendants questioned about the alleged abuse,and according to,he was frightened and coerced into answering questions,and defendants attempted to make him say derogatory statements about his parents.
about three weeks later,judge gende began presiding over an adjudication hearing.the hearing was continued until august,at which time judge gende ordered and his sister wards of the state,in part based on a social study prepared by probation officer james bartelt.contends that the report contained false information,and that his parents were denied the opportunity to disprove those allegations because they were not given access to the report until after the hearing and after the court had already made a ward of the state.after her ruling,judge gende allegedly threatened the parents attorney that if the children parents appealed her decision of wardship,she would personally see to it that they would not see their children until they were adults,but that if they did not appeal,she would be more inclined to allow the children to return home someday.
it is unclear what,if any,investigation took place or what facts came to light,but on october,almost four months after they were first removed from their home,judge gende entered an order permitting and his sister to return home,finding insufficient evidence that they needed protection.however,it was not until july of parents dismissed a federal lawsuit they had filed concerning their children judge gende dismissed the order of wardship.
in february,after he had reached the age of majority,filed a pro se complaint in federal court against mercer county marvin thirtyacre,the mercer county sheriff james brokaw,a mercer county deputy sheriff weir brokaw,his paternal grandfather karen weaver,his paternal aunt the state of illinois penny ingersoll,a caseworker for the illinois department of children and family services steve dickens,a caseworker for the illinois department of children and family services susan gende,a state judge in the judicial circuit of illinois james bartelt,the director of the mercer county probation department jonathon weakley,a mercer county deputy sheriff and vickie hansen,a mercer county probation officer.the district court,thinking this complaint was barred by the statute of limitations,ordered to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed.responded by citing illinois tolling statute,which provides that the statute of limitations does not begin to run on a minor claim until he reaches the age of eighteen.ilsc.the district court then struck the complaint,ordering to file an amended complaint specifying the legal basis on which it was brought.complied with the order,and filed an amended complaint under,alleging claims under the first,fourth,fifth,eighth,ninth,tenth,and fourteenth amendments.also alleged state law claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.
all of the defendants,except thirtyacre,appeared and filed motions to dismiss.the district court dismissed the federal claims against all of the defendants,including thirtyacre,for failure to state a claim,or based on sovereign,absolute,or qualified immunity.the district court further stated that because it had dismissed all of federal claims,it was dismissing his state law claims as well.moved for leave to file an amended complaint,which the district court denied.appeals 
ii.analysis 
on appeal,contends that the defendants violated and conspired to violate,by depriving him of certain constitutional rights,and that he is entitled to attorney fees under section.we first consider the section claim.
in order to state a claim under section,a plaintiff must allege that the defendants deprived him of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states,and that the defendants acted under color of state law.starnes capital cities media,cir.in this case,alleged that the defendants violated,and conspired to violate,his constitutional rights under the first,fourth,fifth,eighth,ninth,tenth,and fourteenth amendments.on appeal,however,presents arguments based on only three constitutional theories first,he contends that the defendants violated his fourth amendment rights by forcibly removing him from his home without cause second,he asserts that the defendants violated his substantive due process right to familial relations and third,argues that the defendants violated his right to procedural due process by denying him fair and constitutionally adequate process both before and after his removal.we consider each theory below,keeping in mind that dismissal is appropriate only if is unable to present any set of facts consistent with the complaint which would entitle him to recover.crenshaw baynerd,cir.
initially we need to clear up the issue of eleventh amendment immunity.on appeal,the illinois attorney general office argues that the claims against judge susan gende and probation officers james bartelt and vickie hansen are barred by the eleventh amendment to the extent that is suing those defendants in their official capacities.federal suits against state officials in their official capacities are barred by the eleventh amendment,gossmeyer mcdonald,cir,but on appeal contends that we should construe his claims against gende,bartelt and hansen as individual capacity claims.because the state defendants have treated suit as an individual capacity demonstrated by their assertion of the defense of qualified will too.stevens umsted,cir explaining that while a suit against a government official will be assumed an official capacity suit,that assumption is negated if the parties have treated it as an individual capacity suit by asserting the defense of qualified immunity.an individual capacity suit is not barred by the eleventh amendment,so individual capacity claims against judge gende and probation officers bartelt and hansen remain.gossmeyer,at that said,we move on to the three legal theories presented,beginning with the fourth amendment.
fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment,incorporated by the fourteenth amendment,provides that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,amend.iv.contends that the defendants violated,and conspired to violate,his fourth amendment rights when they forcibly removed him from his home on july.
to determine whether stated a cause of action under the fourth amendment,we must determine whether the defendants alleged conduct constituted a seizure and if so,whether the seizure was unreasonable in light of the factual allegations donovan city of milwaukee,cir.a person has been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment if,in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.united states mendenhall,d.in this case,claims that he was physically carried out of his home,placed in a car,and driven away from his family.under these circumstances,a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave,and thus a seizure occurred within the meaning of the fourth amendment.
of course,seizure alone is not enough for liability the seizure must be unreasonable.donovan,at internal quotations omitted.however,t he test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application,and its proper application requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.graham connor,d.accordingly,we must consider allegations in light of the specific circumstances at issue,namely the removal of a child from his home based on allegations of child neglect.
in the context of removing a child from his home and family,a seizure is reasonable if it is pursuant to a court order,if it is supported by probable cause,or if it is justified by exigent circumstances,meaning that state officers have reason to believe that life or limb is in immediate jeopardy.tenenbaum,at quoting good dauphin county social services for children and youth,cir.see,tenenbaum,at analyzing child removal as a seizure under the fourth amendment,and considering whether a court order,probable cause or exigent circumstances justified the child removal wooley city of baton rouge,cir noting that a warrant,probable cause,or a reasonable belief that a child is in imminent harm is necessary to justify a seizure of a child under the fourth amendment washington county,cir applying probable cause standard to removal of child wallis spencer,cir state may not remove children from their parents custody without a court order unless there is specific,articulable evidence that provides reasonable cause to believe that a child is in imminent danger of abuse.landstrom illinois of children and family,cir search or seizure of child by dcfs must be reasonable,but that does not necessarily require probable cause or warrant darryl coler,cir accord.of course,even then the manner in which the seizure is carried out must be reasonable.tennessee garner,d reasonableness depends on not only when a seizure is made,but also how it is carried out.
in light of these general principles and allegations,we consider the reasonableness of seizure.first,contends that he was removed from his home without a court order authorizing his seizure,and that it was not until the next day that a petition for adjudication of wardship was filed with the court.assuming these facts are true,seizure can not be justified by a pickup.that still leaves the possibility that removal was justified by probable cause or exigent circumstances.see supra at.however,all we know at this stage is that aunt,grandfather,and uncle who,remember,as a deputy sheriff is a state actor told the dcfs and the sheriff office something which set in motion removal that same evening,and that the removal occurred without any further investigation into the allegations of child even a home visit,or a conversation with.while in rare circumstances allegations of neglect may be so credible and severe that they justify a and removal,without knowing the details of the alleged neglect,under the alleged facts before us,we can not conclude that exigent circumstances justified removal.see,darryl,at not every report of child neglect constitutes exigent circumstances.see also,wooley,at statements made to police casting doubt on mother fitness insufficient to create reasonable belief that the child was in danger of imminent harm so as to justify removal,especially in light of the child apparent safety at his home wallis spencer,cir t he police can not seize children suspected of being abused or neglected unless reasonable avenues of investigation are first pursued,particularly where it is not clear that a crime has will.id.whether a reasonable avenue of investigation exists,however,depends in part upon the time element and nature of the allegations.croft westmoreland county children and youth,cir allegations of neglect insufficient to establish as a matter of law that caseworker had reasonable grounds to believe that a child was in imminent danger so as to justify removal without court order.nor can we conclude that the unspecified allegations of neglect against parents established probable cause justifying removal.because the allegations fail to establish the reasonableness of seizure as a matter of law,we must conclude at this juncture that has stated a claim under the fourth amendment.
even if a court order directed removal,or exigent circumstances or probable cause justified seizure,the manner in which the defendants seized may still make his seizure unreasonable.as the supreme court stated in tennessee garner,d,the fourth amendment guarantee of reasonableness depends on not only how a seizure is made,but also how it is carried out.more recently,the court explained in graham connor,d,that the manner in which a seizure occurs must be analyzed under the fourth amendment objective reasonableness standard.
applying the objective reasonableness standard here,we conclude that has stated a fourth amendment claim premised on the manner in which the defendants allegedly seized in plain clothes,driving an unmarked car,entering his home in the evening without knocking or identifying themselves,and then refusing to do so when asked.most significantly,they abruptly removed the screaming children from the home without explanation.in effect they acted like kidnappers rather than law enforcement officers.yates city of cleveland,cir it was not objectively reasonable for a police officer to enter the dark hallway in the entrance of a private residence at without identifying himself as a police officer,without shining a flashlight,and without wearing his hat jacobs city of chicago,cir complaint stated a cause of action under the fourth amendment where allegations failed to justify a entry of plaintiff apartment by breaking through door.
finally,we note that to the extent the defendants knew the allegations of child neglect were false,or withheld material information,and nonetheless caused,or conspired to cause,removal from his home,they violated the fourth amendment.malik arapahoe county of social services,cir government officials procurement of a court order to remove children based on information they knew was founded on distortion,misrepresentation and omission,violated the fourth amendment.
up to this point,we have treated the defendants together,questioning only whether stated a fourth amendment claim.however,we can not stop there because t o establish personal liability in a action,the plaintiff must show that the government officer caused the deprivation of a federal right.luck rovenstine,cir internal quotation omitted.thus,we must determine which of the defendants are therefore liable alleged fourth amendment violations.
an official causes a constitutional violation if he sets in motion a series of events that defendant knew or reasonably should have known would cause others to deprive plaintiff of constitutional rights.morris dearborne,cir.therefore,a n official satisfies the personal responsibility required of if she acts or fails to act with a deliberate or reckless disregard of plaintiff constitutional rights,or if the conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurs at her direction or with her knowledge or consent.smith rowe,cir internal quotation omitted.
against this backdrop,we consider each defendant participation in the seizure of.the easiest case concerns probation officer bartelt and deputy sheriff jonathon weakley who contends physically removed him and his sister from their home.because these two defendants actually seized,the fourth amendment claims against them are clearly proper.also straightforward is the claim against deputy sheriff james brokaw,who joined in the seizure of the children at the cornfield where was taken immediately after he was snatched from his home.because he also participated in the seizure,the fourth amendment claim against him stands as well 
the claim against sheriff thirtyacre is a little more complicated,not because of the seizure was also involved at the because in his complaint alleged that marvin thirtyacre was acting in his official capacity under color of state law.thus,suit is not really against thirtyacre,but against the governmental entity he represents,which in this case is the mercer county sheriff office.franklin zaruba,cir.however,the mercer county sheriff office is not automatically liable for the acts of its employees.luck,at.therefore,we must determine whether the mercer county sheriff opposed to thirtyacre constitutional deprivation.
a municipality violates the constitution when it has an unconstitutional custom or policy.id.a custom or policy can take one of three forms an express policy that,when enforced,causes a constitutional deprivation a widespread practice that,although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy,is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law or an allegation that the constitutional injury was caused by a person with final authority.mctigue city of chicago,cir.in this case,contends that the sheriff of mercer county participated in his unconstitutional seizure,along with two other deputy sheriffs.we have previously held that a sheriff in illinois has final authority,ryan county of dupage,cir,and that a custom or policy may be established by an allegation that the constitutional injury was caused by a person with final policymaking authority.mctigue,at.see also,baxter by baxter vigo county sch,cir it is true that a single act or decision of a final policymaker can establish municipal policy.therefore,allegations that sheriff thirtyacre participated in his seizure are sufficient at this stage for to state a claim against the mercer county sheriff department 
to further complicate matters,also sued mercer county,alleging that the defendants actions were consistent with the policy,custom,and usage of mercer county,and that therefore mercer county is also liable under section for the alleged fourth amendment violations.this complicates things because it is unclear whether the sheriff and the deputy sheriffs involved in seizure were acting on behalf of mercer county the mercer county sheriff office.we have struggled with the appropriate defendant in such a case,see ryan county of dupage,cir franklin zaruba,cir degenova sheriff of dupage county,cir,and unfortunately are unaided by the defendants because at this stage based on allegations we can not determine on whose behalf the sheriff and deputies were acting,we remand the claims against mercer county and the mercer county sheriff office for the district court to further consider which entity is the appropriate defendant.
next we consider defendant penny ingersoll,who was a dcfs caseworker involved in removal.while penny was not present during the actual seizure of,the allegations read in the light most favorable to indicate that she directed those who removed the children to do so.that is enough to affix liability.ryan mary immaculate queen,cir holding that allegations that a supervisor directed the unconstitutional search is enough to affix liability.see also,morris,at defendant who was moving force behind the removal of children was responsible for causing allegedly unconstitutional removal.
ingersoll responds by arguing that she acted only after having received three complaints of alleged neglect,and that she did not have a constitutional obligation to investigate those complaints.however,that argument begs the question of whether the complaints she received were legally sufficient to justify the immediate removal of.we do not know the nature of the allegations of child neglect,whether or not the allegations of neglect could be easily verified or negated,or whether the alleged neglect created an imminent risk to the children.without knowing these details,we can not conclude at the pleadings stage that ingersoll could reasonably believe that an immediate,removal of was reasonable 
while presented sufficient facts to create an inference that ingersoll caused his alleged constitutional deprivation,he did not do so for probation officer vicki hansen.in his complaint,merely alleged that probation officer hansen conspired with the other defendants to violate his constitutional rights.that allegation,however,is insufficient to put hansen on notice of the gravamen of complaint.and while the federal rules of notice pleading do not require the plaintiff to allege all of the relevant facts,f or fair notice to be given,a complaint must at least include the operative facts upon which a plaintiff bases his claim.kyle morton high,cir.sole allegation that hansen conspired with the other defendants is insufficient to put her on notice of complaint against her.while allegations against the other defendants were also meager,they were sufficient to meet the minimal notice pleading standards.moreover,presented numerous additional consistent facts on appeal concerning the other defendants involvement in his seizure,and showing their responsibility for his allegedly unconstitutional seizure.but all adds on appeal to hansen is that she was present during a conference in which was questioned by judge gende and several of the other defendants hansen mere presence at this conference is insufficient to create a reasonable inference that hansen had a meeting of the minds with the other defendants to remove him from his parents based on false claims of child neglect.kunik racine county,cir allegations of conspiracy must be further supported by some factual allegations suggesting meeting of the minds.therefore,even considering the facts added on appeal by,he still fails to state a claim against hansen.
that leaves judge gende.the district court dismissed claims against judge gende based on absolute judicial immunity.this common law doctrine shields judges from civil liability for their judicial actions.tucker outwater,cir.the principle of judicial immunity recognizes that a lthough unfairness and injustice to a litigant may result on occasion,it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer,in exercising the authority vested in him,shall be free to act upon his own convictions,without apprehension of personal consequences to himself.mireles waco,d.thus,judges are not liable in civil actions for their judicial acts unless they have acted in the clear absence of jurisdiction.stump sparkman,d.moreover,a judge will not be deprived of immunity even if the action was in error,was done maliciously,was in excess of his authority,and even if his exercise of authority is flawed by the commission of grave procedural errors.id.at.
attempts to overcome judicial immunity by arguing that judge gende actions were extrajudicial and thus beyond the protection of judicial immunity,relying on buckley fitzsimmons,d.in buckley,the supreme court held that when a prosecutor performs opposed to,he is acting extrajudicially and thus is not entitled to absolute judicial immunity.id.at.attempts to cast judge gende involvement in his removal in a similar light.first,he points to judge gende participation in the initial meeting with sheriff thirtyacre,weir,karen and dcfs agent ingersoll outside the aledo courthouse,claiming that at this point she was not acting as a judge,but rather as a social worker.next,he cites judge gende questioning of him on july to show that she was acting outside her judicial role.however,under illinois law,a judge may partake in an informal conference in child custody matters.ch,para.et,and therefore we can not conclude judge gende was acting in the clear absence of jurisdiction by participating in these conferences.see,washington county,cir judge did not abandon impartial judicial role by having ex parte communication with social worker newman state of,cir holding that judge acted within the outer bounds of his jurisdiction when he ordered parents to remain in courtroom pending the removal of their children from their home dellenbach letsinger,cir telephone call from trial judge to appellate judge was judicial act not outside scope of immunity.nor do allegations that judge gende joined the conspiracy alter the outcome.see john barron,cir mere allegations of conspiracy insufficient to overcome judicial immunity.accordingly,she is absolutely immune from suit.
still remaining are claims against weir brokaw and karen weaver for conspiracy to violate his fourth amendment rights.while a private citizen can not ordinarily be held liable under section because that statute requires action under color of state law,if a private citizen conspires with a state actor,then the private citizen is subject to section liability.bowman city of franklin,cir.to establish section liability through a conspiracy theory,a plaintiff must demonstrate that a state official and private individual s reached an understanding to deprive the plaintiff of his constitutional rights,and those individual s were willful participants in joint activity with the state or its agents.fries helsper,cir internal quotation and citations omitted.
in this case,alleged just such a conspiracy between weir and karen,and deputy sheriff james brokaw.specifically,asserted that weir and karen conspired with james,who was a deputy sheriff,in july to file false allegations of child neglect in order to cause the dcfs to remove from his home and to thereby cause parents to divorce,because of the religious beliefs and practices of family while weir and karen claim that allegations are too vague to withstand dismissal under b,has alleged all of the necessary facts the who,what,when,why,and how.no more is required at this stage.
weir and karen also argue that merely filing a report of child neglect with a state actor,even if false,is insufficient to create liability under section.we have no qualms with weir and karen proposition.but as summarized above,alleged much more.in short,alleged facts supporting the reasonable inference that an agreement existed between weir and karen and a deputy sheriff,james,to deprive of his constitutional rights,and that these defendants then jointly acted in furtherance of this conspiracy by reporting the false neglect charges to dcfs agent ingersoll,and this set in motion seizure.
weir and karen respond by citing cases which hold that a private citizen is not liable under section for reporting crimes to the police,or urging the government to prosecute criminal offenses.flagg,brooks,d gramenos jewel companies,cir butler goldblatt,cir.but those cases are distinguishable because they did not involve an alleged agreement between the police and the private citizens rather,the private individuals acted independently from the government in making the police reports.here,on the other hand,alleged facts creating a reasonable inference that weir and karen conspired with state actors to cause his removal.if true,weir and karen are subject to section liability.
alternatively,weir and karen seek cover in the various proceedings instituted as a result of their complaint a formal petition for adjudication of wardship,a court hearing,investigatory conferences held by the dcfs,adjudication of wardship by the court,and a dispositional hearing by the court,seemingly arguing that because a court determined that should remain in foster care,that demonstrates that their complaints of neglect were justified.but,assuming that weir,karen and deputy sheriff james brokaw knew the allegations of child neglect were false,then these proceedings actually weaken their case because that means they succeeded in the earlier stages of their created upheaval in family by having him removed from his home and by subjecting his family to governmental interference.moreover,as we have held in the criminal context,i f police officers have been instrumental in the plaintiff continued confinement or prosecution,they can not escape liability by pointing to the decisions of prosecutors or grand jurors or magistrates to confine or prosecute him.jones city of chicago,cir.similarly,weir and karen can not escape the consequences of their alleged actions based on the unwitting decisions of the various judges involved.see morris dearborne,cir plaintiff stated a constitutional claim against a teacher who allegedly created false evidence of sexual abuse,notwithstanding the fact that welfare officials and state judge independently evaluated allegations of sexual abuse and ordered child removed from home 
weir and karen also seek refuge in public policy,arguing that a person who reports child abuse should not be subjected to a civil rights action for the act of reporting.we have no qualms with that proposition,but as noted above this case involves a different situation claims that the defendants knew the allegations were false and that they conspired with a family member who was a deputy sheriff.in fact,it is reasonable to infer that weir and karen were able to pull off their plan to have removed only because they had a relative in a position of governmental authority in any other circumstance,it seems reasonable to believe that the government would investigate the complaint before bursting into home and snatching him from his family.it is a rare situation indeed where family members will be conspiring with another family member who is a state actor,and thus the parade of horribles that karen and weir march out in the form of public policy will seldom,if ever,come to pass.
before closing the fourth amendment discussion,it is important to reiterate two points.first,our holding should not be read as creating a constitutional claim any time a child is removed from his home and a later investigation proves no abuse occurred.the alleged facts here go much beyond that scenario,and our holding is limited to the unique circumstances of this case.second,it is important to remember that this case is here on b dismissal.further proceedings and discovery may well narrow this case substantially,but at this point the question is solely whether can succeed under any set of facts.gregory nunn,cir.because there are several factual scenarios under which could prevail,dismissal of his fourth amendment claim at this time would be inappropriate.
substantive due relations 
in addition to suing under the fourth amendment,presents a substantive due process claim.to the extent that this claim is premised on his seizure from his home,however,it can not succeed because,as the supreme court has recently reiterated,substantive due process should not be called upon when a specific constitutional provision protects the right allegedly infringed upon.united states lanier,d i f a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision,such as the fourth or eighth amendment,the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision,not under the rubric of substantive due process.as to initial removal,the fourth amendment specifically addresses that seizure,and thus his claim should be considered under the fourth amendment,not under the rubric of substantive due process.
however,also asserts that his constitutional rights were violated during the entire near period of separation from his parents.this forced separation implicates substantive due process,or more specifically constitutional right to familial relations 
the supreme court has long recognized as a component of substantive due process the right to familial relations.see prince massachusetts.meyer nebraska.santosky kramer,d there is a fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care,custody,and management of their child.see also,wallis spencer,cir parents and children have a constitutional right to live together without governmental interference.croft westmoreland county children and youth services,cir we recognize the constitutionally protected liberty interests that parents have in the custody,care and management of their children.see generally troxel granville,d.the due process clause includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.id.at.these decisions recognize that the right of a man and woman to marry,and to bear and raise their children is the most fundamental of all foundation of not just this country,but of all civilization.wisconsin yoder,d the history and culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children,this primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring american tradition.moore city of east cleveland,ohio,d t he institute of the family is deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition.equally fundamental is the substantive due process right of a child to be raised and nurtured by his parents.see santosky kramer,d u ntil the state proves parental unfitness,the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of the natural relationship.emphasis added washington county,cir we recognize that the forced separation of parent from child,even for a short time,represents a serious infringement upon both the parents and child rights.internal quotations omitted wooley city of baton rouge,cir a child right to family integrity is concomitant to that of a parent thus,substantive due process provides the appropriate vehicle for evaluating the constitutionality of the nearly separation of from his parents.see,washington county,cir i t is evident that there was interference with plaintiffs rights of familial association because was physically removed from her home and from her parents for a period of almost hours,which included an overnight stay in a shelter home.croft,at the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the government from interfering in the familial relationship unless the government adheres to the requirements of procedural and substantive due process.
however,like fourth amendment rights,the constitutional right to familial integrity is not absolute.see weller department of soc,cir substantive due process does not categorically bar the government from altering parental custody rights.indeed,this liberty interest in familial integrity is limited by the compelling governmental interest in the protection of children particularly where the children need to be protected from their own parents.croft,at.thus,a balance must be reached between the fundamental right to the family unit and the state interest in protecting children from abuse,especially in cases where children are removed from their homes.miller city of philadelphia,cir the fundamental interest in the familial relationship must be balanced against the state interest in protecting children suspected of being abused.the balance here,however,is no different than that developed in the fourth amendment context.darryl coler,cir.see also,wallis spencer,cir the same legal standard applies in evaluating fourth and fourteenth amendment claims for the removal of children.in balancing these competing interests,courts have recognized that a state has no interest in protecting children from their parents unless it has some definite and articulable evidence giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a child has been abused or is in imminent danger of abuse.croft,at.but in this case and at this stage,we lack sufficient factual details from which we can decide whether the government was justified in interfering with familial relations.therefore,for the same reasons that fourth amendment claim survives,his substantive due process claim covering the approximately time period during which was separated from his parents,does as well.
at this point,we again must consider which defendants are subject to suit for the alleged violation.we need not dwell on each individual defendant involvement,however,because,as detailed above,alleged that the defendants conspired to violate his constitutional his right to familial he presented sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference that each defendant other than hansen joined the conspiracy,and thus was responsible for causing the alleged substantive due process violation.for the reasons discussed above in the context of the fourth amendment claim,judge gende is entitled to absolute immunity.
procedural due process 
also alleges a procedural due process claim,asserting that the government infringed on his liberty interest in familial relations without a hearing,and that following his removal,the hearings lacked a semblance of due process.in contrast to substantive due process claims,i n procedural due process claims,the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in life,liberty,or property is not in itself unconstitutional what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest without due process of law.doe by nelson milwaukee county,cir.thus,a procedural due process claim involves a analysis first,we determine whether the defendants deprived the plaintiff of a protected liberty or property interest,and if so,then we assess what process was due.hamlin vaudenberg,cir.
in this case,alleged a liberty interest in his familial relations.this is a protected liberty interest.santosky,at.stanley illinois,d.see also,doe,at.thus,we must consider what process was due.hamlin,at.the supreme court has said that parental rights can not be denied without an opportunity for them to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d internal quotations omitted.similarly,a child right to be nurtured by his parents can not be denied without an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way.what exactly this means is less clear,as the amount of process due varies with the particular is a flexible concept.id.at.
however,no matter how much process is required,at a minimum it requires that government officials not misrepresent the facts in order to obtain the removal of a child from his parents.malik arapahoe county of social,cir an ex parte hearing based on misrepresentation and omission does not constitute notice and an opportunity to be heard.minimally,it also means that governmental officials will not remove a child from his home without an investigation and hearing resulting in a court order of removal,absent exigent circumstances.hollingsworth hill,cir removal of children from the custody of their parents requires predeprivation notice and a hearing except for extraordinary situations where some valid governmental interest is at stake that justified postponing the hearing until after the event.malik,at a parent has a liberty interest in familial association and privacy extraordinary be violated without adequate procedures.lossman pekarske,cir when a child safety is threatened,that is justification enough for action first and hearing afterward.jordan by jordan jackson,cir o nly where a child life is in imminent danger or where there is immediate danger of severe or irreparable injury to the child health and prior judicial authorization is not immediately obtainable may an official summarily assume custody of a child from his parents.
because claims that he was removed based on knowingly false statements of child neglect,and that the defendants removed him from his home without an investigation,a hearing,or exigent circumstances,he has stated a procedural due process claim as well.
perhaps the facts as developed on remand will demonstrate that a hearing was not constitutionally required because emergency action was required to avert imminent harm to donald polk county,cir in an emergency situation the government may take away liberty with hearing.nevertheless,the constitutional requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard are not eliminated,but merely postponed.weller,at internal quotations omitted.thus,due process guarantees that the judicial review of a child removal be prompt and fair.see,campbell burt,cir procedural due process guarantees prompt and adequate judicial review in child custody case jordan by jordan,at i t is that the requirements of process may be delayed where emergency action is necessary to avert imminent harm to a child provided that adequate process to ratify the emergency action is promptly accorded.
in this case,presents several facts calling into question the constitutional adequacy of the hearing he contends that the defendants filed or conspired to file false statements with the court.he also contends that the social study prepared concerning and his sister was not provided to his parents prior to the custody hearing,and that the court relied in part on this study to order him a ward of the state he asserts that the study included false information.together,these allegations are sufficient to state a procedural due process claim based on the process afforded see,morrison jones,cir dismissal of procedural due process claim improper where mother alleged child was removed without adequate hearing,schacht wisconsin of corrections,cir we agree that sham procedures do not satisfy due process and that,for purposes of something like rule b,plaintiff stated a claim.moreover,because of the alleged constitutional defects of the hearing,at this stage we can not conclude that the hearings eliminated any procedural due process claim based on removal.compare with lossman pekarske,cir,and donald polk county,cir holding that hearing establishing probable cause of abuse prevented due process claim for lack of hearing.
again the question remains as to which defendants are liable for any procedural due process violation.the defendants who allegedly made the false statements,deputy sheriff james brokaw,weir brokaw and karen weaver,are appropriate defendants.alleged that the other defendants conspired with those state actors and except as to probation officer hansen,gave sufficient details of their role in the conspiracy to create liability,and thus,the remaining defendants other than probation officer hansen,and judge is entitled to absolute judicial immunity are likewise appropriate defendants for this claim as well.
qualified immunity 
next we consider whether the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity qualified immunity protects government officials from individual liability under section for actions taken while performing discretionary functions,unless their conduct violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.thus,before liability will attach,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.
the defendants argue that it was not clearly established in june that their actions violated constitutional rights,noting that failed to cite to closely analogous cases clearly establishing his constitutional rights.however,a plaintiff need not always identify a closely analogous case rather,he can establish a clearly established constitutional right by showing that the violation was so obvious that a reasonable person would have known of the unconstitutionality of the conduct at issue.thus,binding precedent is not necessary to clearly establish a right.rakovich wade,cir.in fact,in the most extreme cases,an analogous case might never arise because the existence of the right was so clear,as a matter of the wording of a constitutional or statutory provision or decisions in other circuits or in the state courts,that no one thought it worthwhile to litigate the issue.burgess lowery,cir.see,through murphy morgan,cir an easy or obvious case of deprivation that has no precedent does not mean that officials would be immune from damages liability because no previous case had found liability in those circumstances.
as alleged,this case fits that principle to a t.the defendants alleged conduct in this case is so severe that a reasonable person would have understood that he was violating constitutional rights.specifically,a reasonable person would have known that it was unconstitutional to use the government power to cause,or conspire to cause,the unjustified removal of a child from his parents in order to destroy the family,based simply on the family religious beliefs.morris dearborne,cir it is beyond purview that any rational teacher could believe that governmental destruction of a family based on fabricated evidence is constitutionally allowed.id.at making knowingly false statements of child neglect violates clearly established constitutional right to familial relations malik,at i t is clearly established law that government official procurement through distortion,misrepresentation and omission of a court order to seize a child is a violation of the fourth amendment.internal quotation omitted.moreover,even if the individual defendants did not know the allegations of neglect were false,qualified immunity may still not protect them because,depending on the nature of the claims of neglect,it may well be that a reasonable law enforcement official would recognize that,seizure violated the fourth amendment.see,good,at denying defendants claim of qualified immunity because a reasonable person should have known that warrantless search was unconstitutional given that allegations of neglect would not cause a reasonable person to believe the child was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury franz lytle,cir no reasonable officer would believe that he could visually and physically inspect old child vagina based on one complaint that the child had a severe diaper rash.therefore,while the facts ultimately may not support these claims,at this stage we must reject the defendants qualified immunity defense.
in closing our discussion of qualified immunity,we note that several circuit courts have concluded that because the balance between a child liberty interest in familial relations and a state interest in protecting the child is nebulous at best,social workers and other state actors who cause a child removal are entitled to qualified immunity because the alleged constitutional violation will clearly established.see,kiser garrett,cir hodorowski ray,cir tenenbaum williams,cir doe state of louisiana,cir frazier bailey,cir.while we agree that that is generally the case,see,landstrom illinois of children and family,cir darryl coler,cir,as noted above,some governmental actions are so clearly beyond the pale that a reasonable person should have known of their unconstitutionality even without a closely analogous case.thus,
c ases claiming governmental interference with the right of family integrity are properly analyzed by placing them,on a case by case basis,along a continuum between the state clear interest in protecting children and a family clear interest in privacy.when the facts of a case place it in the center of the continuum where the two interests overlap and create a tension,the right to family integrity may properly be characterized as nebulous,and thus a defendant may claim the protection of qualified immunity.however,when the facts of a case place it squarely on the end of the continuum where the state interest is negligible and where the family privacy right is well developed in jurisprudence from this circuit and the supreme court,a defendant defense of qualified immunity,based on a claim that the right to family integrity was not clearly established,will fail.
here we do not know enough facts to determine where along the continuum this case falls.and given the role of specific facts,i t is impossible to know which clearly established rules of law to consult unless you know what is going on.elliott thomas,cir.accordingly,at this time,we can not conclude that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the facts once uncovered may turn out to be so severe and obviously wrong that the defendants should have known they were violating constitutional rights.see,good.
also seeks recovery under section section provides in relevant part if two or more persons in any state or territory conspire for the purpose of depriving either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation,against any one or more of the conspirators.a plaintiff raising a claim under must allege the existence of a conspiracy,a purpose of depriving a person or class of persons of equal protection of the laws,an act in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy,and an injury to person or property or a deprivation of a right or privilege granted to citizens.majeske fraternal order of police,local lodge,cir.
to establish that the purpose of the conspiracy is to deprive a person or class of persons of equal protection of the laws,the plaintiff must allege some racial,or perhaps otherwise invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators action.griffin breckenridge,d.this court has clarified that otherwise invidiously discriminatory animus includes conspiracies to discriminate against persons based on sex,religion,ethnicity or political loyalty.volk coler,cir.
alleged sufficient facts to support a claim under section he alleged a conspiracy and as discussed in the context of section,he did so with sufficient factual detail,and several acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.he also alleged that the conspirators had an invidious.as a result of this conspiracy,alleged that he was injured in that his fourth amendment and due process rights were violated.while due process rights and fourth amendment rights are not protected against private conspiracies under section in this case alleged that the conspiracy included state actors and that the alleged conspiracy was aimed at influencing state court proceeding in his custody case.therefore,has sufficiently alleged a deprivation of a right or privilege granted to citizens.see,united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america,local,scott,d.accordingly,allegations are sufficient to state a claim under section as well.
disqualification 
one issue remains.before the district court,moved to disqualify judge mcdade arguing that he has demonstrated bias and created an appearance of partiality through his handling of complaint.specifically,complains that judge mcdade demonstrated an alliance with the defendants by issuing a rule to show cause as to why complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations.asserts that because the statute of limitations is a waivable affirmative defense,the district court could not raise it sua sponte.also contends that the district court demonstrated partiality by sua sponte waiving the local rule requiring the defendants to file a memorandum of law in response to the motion to dismiss by failing to give him the benefit of rule e which allowed him three additional days to respond to the defendants motion to dismiss because it was served by mail by sua sponte dismissing the complaint against sheriff thirtyacre and by refusing to accept as true his allegations that judge susan gende acted in a dual role of investigator and judge.argues that cumulatively these rulings indicate that judge mcdade assumed an advocacy role on behalf of the defendants requiring his disqualification under a and b,and.
section a requires a federal judge to disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,and section b provides that a judge shall disqualify himself if he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.seeks judge mcdade recusal under both sections.however,we have held that the denial of a request that the judge recuse himself under section a must be appealed immediately by application for writ of mandamus,or it is waived.united states horton,cir.because did not petition for mandamus,this court can not review the district court disposition of the section a motion.durhan neopolitan,cir.
it is less clear under our case law whether we may review a refusal to recuse under section b when the argument is raised for the first time on appeal.united states smith,cir.we need not decide whether a claim for recusal under section b can be raised on direct appeal rather than mandamus,however,because we conclude that under section b,judge mcdade was not required to recuse.
in determining whether a judge must disqualify himself under b,the question is whether a reasonable person would be convinced the judge was biased.hook mcdade,cir internal quotation omitted.recusal under section b is required only if actual bias or prejudice is proved by compelling evidence.id.moreover,as the supreme court has made clear,judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.liteky united states,d.against this backdrop,we must conclude that a reasonable person would not reasonably believe that the district court was biased or prejudiced against because the only evidence of bias presents consists of judicial rulings.moreover,those rulings do not demonstrate evidence of personal animosity or malice,which is necessary to succeed on a section b motion.hook,at bias or prejudice from which the law of recusal protects a party must be grounded in some personal animus or malice that the judge harbors against him.therefore,th
