the june report noted had been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia and on other charges.expressed regret for relapsing and stated his desire to be free from drugs and to be with his son 
the court at the contested jurisdiction hearing in late june received into evidence the agency reports,with the exception of the june,addendum that was received in the disposition hearing in july,as discussed post,and heard the testimony of social worker onstott.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court found by clear and convincing evidence that was a person described under section,subdivision b in that the child had suffered,or there was a substantial risk that the child would suffer,serious physical harm or illness as a result of the failure of the child parents to supervise or protect adequately the child.
the july,addendum report for the july disposition hearing noted had been dismissed from serenity house on june after being admitted to the program on june,because she was disrespectful to staff and other clients in the program.subsequently contacted onstott on july,informing the social worker of her efforts to get into a new treatment program and discussing her living arrangements while waiting to do so.onstott told to get drug tested at healthworks in national city,which did that same day.tested negative for drugs.
the july addendum report also shows called onstott the following day to inform the social worker she was going to begin the residential treatment program kiva on july.the next day,july,again called onstott to inform her would not begin the kiva program until july.during one of these phone calls,told onstott that she was clean and sober and was not giving up.

at the july disposition hearing,the court considered the evidence already presented at the contested jurisdictional hearing and the additional addendum reports,including the documentary evidence attached to the july report as discussed.the court also took judicial notice of the findings and orders made in siblings cases.
testified at the contested disposition hearing that after she was dismissed from serenity house in late june,she applied to kiva,the house of metamorphosis and casa de milagros for treatment.ultimately,she was admitted into the kiva program on july,as noted in the july addendum report.said she drug tested during the time she was not in a treatment program,as requested by the social worker,and stayed in close contact not only with the social worker but also with probation and her son 
at the conclusion of testimony,the court inquired about the welcome home fair program.stated she is still part of that program.in addition,noted she had been involved in that program about years earlier.the court in response asked what was different at the present time versus years ago.responded more experience,life experiences.just tired.i just realized nobody else is going to come and rescue me,save me.it time for me just to step it up,make a change for now and myself and my children.
at the close of evidence and after hearing the arguments of counsel,which primarily focused on whether would be offered reunification services at the same time those services were offered to,the court ruled in part as follows 
i have read and considered the reports in evidence.i reviewed the mother documentation.i listened carefully to mother testimony.i would order,declare and adjudge to be a dependent of the court under the care,custody and control of the agency.custody will be removed from the parents pursuant to section,subdivision c,the court is making a section,subdivision c finding by clear and convincing evidence.
the court will order that be placed with relatives the gravamen of this case turns on whether the court orders reunification services for mother,or orders that the agency not offer services to her.in support of the request,the agency is relying on section,subdivisions b,and.i have,for the record,reviewed the orders and petitions in the following sibling matters 
under subdivision b,the court must find whether the court had ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings or half siblings,because in this case the mother failed to reunify with those half siblings or siblings who had been removed from mother custody pursuant to section,and is the same parent.here,in and matter,the court did order reunification services for the mother.the mother of those two half siblings is the same as mother,and the court did terminate reunification services in each of those cases based on the mother failure to reunify.the court made those finding s by clear and convincing evidence.
with respect to subdivision b,the court must find there have been parental rights terminated.and here as to all four of the siblings,parental rights for the mother were terminated.they were terminated on july of regarding june,regarding and may of regarding and the court does find that the mother of those four siblings or half siblings is the same as mother,and makes those findings by clear and convincing evidence.
with respect to subdivision b,the court would have to find that the mother has a history of extensive,abusive and chronic use of drugs and alcohol and has resisted prior treatment during a period immediately filing the petition which brought the child to the court attention or has failed to or refused to comply with the program of treatment required under section on at least two prior occasions 
regarding subdivision b,t he testimony before the court is that mother was resisting treatment through her probation and the criminal proceedings.so i do find that provision has been proved by clear and convincing evidence.
with regard to subdivisions b and b,the court would also have to find that mother has not subsequently made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that led to the removal of her children.that a very close and very difficult balancing for the court,because i do recognize that mother is her own worst enemy when it comes to interaction with people and authority and taking responsibility for her chemical dependency issues.
now,the positive things are that when mother visits with,he reacts positively after a period of time,the mother inquir es about his welfare,seems concerned about his welfare,and mother has tested negatively over the last several weeks even though there a gap in her programs.when the mother left was asked to leave serenity on june sic,she did,in my view,pursue diligently an alternative,and subsequently was accepted into kiva on july.
but on the other hand,the mother reason for discharge from serenity house is quite serious.mother indicates she did do anything wrong.but according to the program,the mother got into a verbal discussion that escalated with a member of her group.the facilitator intervened and tried to calm things down and could not.the mother was taken to the director office where things did not deescalate,but escalated,to which the mother referred to the director with a very derogatory term.it got to the point where the mother became stubborn and would leave and they had to call the police.that a far cry from doing nothing.
but i do have to conclude mother recent efforts have been reasonable under the circumstances.she in the fair program,has been there for a substantial period of time.she done well.she going to stay with the fair program.she connected with the church that seems to be very supportive of her to which she is also connected,and she in the kiva program,which is a very good program.
but i have to let the mother know the margin for error is very minimal in this case.when you feel those emotions welling up where you have to lash back,or you have a disagreement and you do practice some techniques to disengage before it really escalates,then you going to find yourself back here in the same situation,and you may not fare as well.but there is some responsibility you alone have to take on.and you have to learn techniques for handling this frustration and the anger that you have.
so i do not find subdivision b and have been proved.as to subdivision b,it has been proved,but under subdivision c,the court has to find does not order services unless finding by clear and convincing evidence it would be in the best interests of the child.here i do find by clear and convincing evidence that it would be in the best interest of for the following reasons one,i think this court has been hard on the mother about her conduct and action,but it has to be put into context.
mother has had a debilitating life experience with drugs and criminal activity.and i do think that probably hardened by her huge humanity,and i do think she trusts people.i know she does trust people in authority.these are going to be all new experiences for mother if she chooses to find the strength to address them.if she continues with her present motivation,i have every confidence she can do that.
second,is two.while it true that mother only had primary responsibility for him for five months,that not an insignificant period,and mother recent interaction with him indicates that it positive and it can be built upon.
and third,we offering services to the father.the father has only met his son,i believe,one time in march.so he will be getting services to assist him in regaining custody,in which case the mother will be in a position of coparenting the child.so i think to assist the father and child with that reunification effort,it would be important to also shore up the mother issues to maximize reunification of with at least one of his parents.
so i will order that the agency offer reunification services to the mother.i believe the case plan should be residential treatment.the mother would not be permitted to leave her residential treatment unless she is officially released by her case manager.the mother would have to enroll in after care,and care is required after her residential treatment.mother would have to attend parenting classes and counseling,and would have supervised visits with her son.
i incorporate by reference the balance of the recommendations in the report,making all findings by clear and convincing evidence.
discussion 
as stated,contends the court abused its discretion and thus erred when it determined reunification was in his best interest and ordered the agency to provide such services to,his mother.
subdivision b of section contains exceptions that permit a court to deny reunification services to a parent.these exceptions have been referred to as reunification bypass provisions.tyrone superior court th.if any one of the exceptions applies,a court may deny reunification services to a parent.id.at see also,subd.b.the bypass provisions are based on the fact that it may be fruitless to provide reunification services under certain circumstances.deborah superior court th.
an appellate court reviews a court findings under section for substantial evidence.in re harmony th.in so doing,we presume in favor of the order,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving the prevailing party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in support of the order.in re autumn th.
here,the court relied on bypass provision,which denies reunification services if a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent or guardian of the child has a history of extensive,abusive,and chronic use of drugs or alcohol and has resisted prior treatment for this problem during a period immediately prior to the filing of the petition that brought that child to the court attention,or has failed or refused to comply with a program of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by section on at least two prior occasions,even though the programs identified were available and accessible,subd.b.
however,as noted,the court also found under section,subdivision c that granting reunification services was in the best interest of subdivision c of section provides in part that the court shall not order reunification for a parent described in any one of the bypass provisions of subdivision b unless the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reunification is in the best interest of the child.
in determining the children best interest,the court should consider a parent current efforts and fitness as well as the parent history t he gravity of the problem that led to the dependency the strength of the bonds between the child and the parent and between the child and the caretaker and the child need for stability and continuity.in re william th.a t least part of the best interest analysis must be a finding that further reunification services have a likelihood of success.in other words,there must be some reasonable basis to conclude that reunification is possible before services are offered to a parent who need not be provided them.id.at.
a juvenile court has broad discretion when determining whether reunification services would be in the best interests of the child under section,subdivision c.citation.an appellate court will reverse that determination only if the juvenile court abuses its discretion.in re william,supra,th at.
here,we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it found it was in best interests to provide reunification services.the record clearly shows the court considered in detail multiple factors in making this determination,including current efforts to get treatment for her of drug dependency and the strength of the bond between and 
indeed,the record shows that once was arrested in late march and placed in las colinas,she sought services and participated in na,parent education,and job services meetings.also completed at least hours of training in the fair program while incarcerated.the director of this program described efforts to reach out and receive help for her chemical dependency.in addition,also completed two,hour instructional courses in substance and competencies for employment and participated in a family connections workshop,while incarcerated.
moreover,the record shows that once was released from jail,she went to the serenity house for residential treatment.when she was dismissed from that program,the record shows immediately sought to enter a new program and remained in constant contact with the social worker,probation and her son and his caregivers during the period she was in between programs.and,when she was told by the social worker to get drug tested,did so that same day with the test being negative for the presence of drugs.also reentered a new residential treatment program in early to and was in that program and ostensibly doing well in it at the time of the contested disposition hearing,when the court ordered reunification services for her.
the record also shows the bond between and her son strengthening over the course of time.indeed,in the april,addendum report,social worker onstott described a visit between and at las colinas that went well,where spoke warmly to,and played games with,her son.in the may,addendum report,onstott again described a visit between and that had gone well,where told her son she loved him,played with him during the en
