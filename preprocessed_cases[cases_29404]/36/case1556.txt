teia mother appeals from two orders of the juvenile court.one order,entered nunc pro tunc on may,the nunc pro tunc order itself was made on july,denied her welfare institutions code section petition and on august,the juvenile court terminated mother parental rights to angel angel.mother appealed from both orders,and those appeals were consolidated on october,for resolution here.
factual and procedural 
mother gave birth to angel in june thus,angel will be two years old in june.angel was born exposed to cocaine and amphetamines,and mother admitted using drugs shortly before angel birth,which she acknowledged was a bad thing to have done.angel never lived with mother,but was detained while in the hospital,and then promptly placed in foster care with a potential adoptive family.
two years earlier,in november,mother had given birth to robert,who was also born exposed to amphetamines and methamphetamines.robert had been declared a dependent of the juvenile court,and mother had failed to reunify with him.many years earlier,mother had also lost custody of this first child.as to robert,he had been placed with a foster family that wanted to adopt him,and angel,too,was placed with this same family with the plan that she would be adopted along with robert.in addition to robert and angel,the foster family had two biological children and a sibling set of children who the foster family had already adopted.
mother had a long history of drug abuse,having begun using at the age of thirteen.by,she was years old,and had tried to rehabilitate herself,without permanent success,on a number of occasions.
mother was granted monitored visitation with angel.she appeared for only some of the scheduled visits.she also failed to appear at several of the earliest court hearings.the juvenile court ordered that mother not receive any reunification services pursuant to section,subdivision b,because robert had been ordered into permanent planning rather than reunited with mother.
despite these problems,mother did begin to do better.she enrolled in a residential drug treatment program,consistently tested clean for four months,completed various classes,and even obtained employment.she had regular visits with angel,which went well.as a result,she petitioned the juvenile court pursuant to section to either grant her supervised custody of angel,or grant her reunification services.her petition was summarily denied without an evidentiary hearing,and thereafter her parental rights were terminated.she appeals from both orders.
contentions on appeal 
mother contends that the juvenile court violated her constitutional right to due process by refusing to hold a hearing on her section petition erred by failing to grant her either supervised custody of angel or reunification services and erred by finding that her relationship with angel did not meet the requirements of the exception to termination of parental rights in section,subdivision c a.the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs disputes these contentions.
discussion 
the juvenile court did not violate mother constitutional rights by refusing to grant her a hearing on her section petition,nor did it err by refusing to grant her either supervised custody or reunification services 
mother first contends that the juvenile court violated her constitutional rights by denying her request for a hearing on her section petition,and further contends that,in fact,the juvenile court should have granted her either supervised custody or reunification services.in fact,the juvenile court not only denied her an evidentiary hearing,but also summarily denied the petition we review such a summary denial for abuse of discretion in re anthony th,d,and resolve the constitutional issue as a matter of law.
section provides,in relevant part,a any parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a dependent child of the juvenile court may,upon grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence,petition the court in the same action in which the child was found to be a dependent child of the juvenile court for a hearing to change,modify,or set aside any order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court.the petition shall set forth in concise language any change of circumstance or new evidence which are alleged to require the change of order or termination of jurisdiction c if it appears that the best interests of the child may be promoted by the proposed change of order,the court shall order that a hearing be held and shall give prior notice,italics added.
a petition under this section must be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency.of court,rule a.thus,if the petition presents any evidence that a hearing would promote the best interests of the child,the court must order the hearing.in re aljamie th,d.the court may deny the application ex parte only if the petition fails to state a change of circumstance or new evidence that even might require a change of order or termination of jurisdiction.of court,rule b in re aljamie,supra,th at,d.
as mother herself concedes,this statutory scheme itself is constitutional because of its many safeguards.one such safeguard,as she acknowledges,is that if a parent makes a prima facie showing of a change of circumstance such that a proposed change in custody might be in the child best interest,then the juvenile court must hold a hearing.thus,the real issue here is not whether this statutory scheme is constitutional,but whether mother made the requisite prima facie showing if she did,then we shall simply reverse and direct the juvenile court to hold the hearing due process does require.
whether mother made a prima facie showing entitling her to a hearing depends on the facts alleged in her petition,as well as the facts established as without dispute by the court own file for example,angel age,the nature of her existing placement,and the time she came into care as a dependent child.the facts alleged in mother petition are set out in a declaration from mother,a letter from mother,a letter from bonnie brown a family friend whose relationship with mother was that of a second mother,and a letter from crihelp the residential drug rehabilitation program in which mother was enrolled.
according to mother,she had enrolled in crihelp in late january,and would graduate in july.she had obtained employment and would be working hours per week,had consistently tested clean for drugs and alcohol while in the program,and had completed parenting,anger management and daily living skills classes.in addition,she was successfully participating in individual counseling,had visited with angel consistently missing only those visits that the social worker or foster parents were unable to attend,and she and angel had bonded mother noted that angel reached for her and was obviously happy to see her at visits.mother also specifically asked,if she could not be given supervised custody,that she be given reunification services.
the crihelp letter noted that between january,when mother entered the crihelp program,and may,the date on which the crihelp letter was prepared,mother had made outstanding progress.the letter confirmed mother statements about her classes and negative drug and alcohol tests.
bonnie brown explained the nature of her relationship with mother that of a second mother as well as the length of time she had known mother since mother was a little girl.she set out the nature of mother family of origin,which included such problems as an alcoholic father who did work much and a mother who worked long hours to support the family,and the lack of any parental involvement in such positive activities as homework and visits to the library.in contrast,brown also commented on the family of origin less wholesome activities,for example,that mother father had allowed mother to smoke marijuana with him when she was only nine years old,that her father physically abused all the children,that mother did not protect them,and that when mother died father essentially deserted the children.
brown,who had acted as the monitor for mother visits with angel,noted the change she had seen in mother her eyes had become clear,she smiled and laughed and could talk about the past,and she obviously loved angel and was alive in her presence.brown opined that angel birth had motivated mother to change,and that this time,mother was actually ready to change.brown confirmed that mother had a job,and also opined that angel place was with mother.
given this evidence,did the juvenile court abuse its discretion by refusing to hold a hearing on mother section petition we conclude that it did not.a review of the kinds of cases in which courts have reversed summary denials of section petitions is instructive.
in in re jeremy th,d,the section petition was accompanied by three declarations,in one of which the mother doctor opined that she was presently able to provide suitable care for her son.id.at,d.likewise,in in re hashem,supra,th,d,the petition included a letter from a physician discussing the substance of the mother therapy,opining that she now could adequately supervise her son,and recommending he be returned to her custody.id.at,d.and in in re aljamie,supra,th,d,the petition alleged several concrete changes in the mother situation,such as completion of a variety of educational programs,including domestic violence management,as well as consistent visitation and strong bonding with the children.id.at,d.moreover,the petition also showed that the and children first choice,repeatedly expressed,was to live with their mother.ibid.this later fact is clearly important and relevant to the outcome in in re aljamie other cases have held that simple completion of the kinds of classes taken by the mother in in re aljamie and by mother here does not,in and of itself,show prima facie that either the requested modification or a hearing would be in the minor best interests.see cal.rules of court,rule c in re jasmon cal th,d,in re anthony th,d.
here,there was no evidence that mother was ready to assume custody of angel or provide suitable care for her while she had completed the drug program,the time she had been sober was very brief compared to her many years of drug addiction a concern expressed by the social worker,and in the past she had been unable to remain sober even when the stakes involved were the loss of her other child.nor was there evidence that she had a housing situation suitable for angel,or any arrangements for childcare while she worked.and,unlike the situation in in re aljamie,there was no evidence that angel preferred to live with mother rather than with the foster family.
it is also instructive to consider cases in which a section petition was summarily denied and the denial was then affirmed.in in re jamika th,d,the mother section petition alleged that she was participating in a drug recovery program and was testing clean,was receiving help for her developmental delays,and had missed previous court hearings only because of transportation problems.id.at,d.the reviewing court noted that these facts were part of the record in the case with which the juvenile court was thoroughly familiar,not evidence of changed circumstances or new evidence.id.at,d.in addition,the record showed that the mother had had very little contact with her child,had failed to follow the plan for reunification services,the existing guardian was capably caring for the child needs,the child was bonded to the guardian,and the child was doing quite well.ibid.in other words,mother petition failed to state facts that showed that the child best interests might be promoted by the proposed change of order.
here,too,whether angel best interests might be promoted by mother proposed change of order is a crucial issue in any determination of whether mother section petition should have been granted.the best interests of the child standard,subd.c is sufficiently clear to allow a review of the denial of a section petition.although the specific factors a court must consider vary with each case,each child best interests would necessarily involve eliminating the specific factors that required placement outside the parent home in re heather d,here,mother drug addiction.
in addition,as in any custody determination,a primary consideration in determining the child best interest is the goal of assuring stability and continuity.in re stephanie cal th,d.when custody continues over a significant period,the child need for continuity and stability assumes an increasingly important role.ibid.that need often will dictate the conclusion that maintenance of the current arrangement would be in the best interests of that child.ibid.thus,one moving for a change of placement bears the burden of proof to show,by a preponderance of the evidence that there is new evidence or that there are changed circumstances that may mean a change of placement is in the best interest of the child.in re audrey d.
this is a difficult burden to meet in many cases,and particularly so when,as here,reunification services have been terminated or never ordered.after the termination of reunification services,a parent interest in the care,custody and companionship of the child is no longer paramount.in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d.rather,at this point,the focus shifts to the needs of the child for permanency and stability.in re marilyn cal th,d.in fact,there is a rebuttable presumption that continued foster care is in the best interest of the child id.at,d,such presumption obviously applies with even greater strength when the permanent plan is adoption rather than foster care.a court hearing a motion for change of placement at this stage of the proceedings must recognize this shift of focus in determining the ultimate question before it,that is,what is in the best interest of the child.in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,in in re edward th,d,the denial of the parent section petition,made at the time of the section hearing,and seeking to modify the order terminating reunification services,was upheld.the reviewing court noted that at the point of these proceedings on the eve of the section permanency planning hearing the children interest in stability was the court foremost concern and outweighed any interest in reunification.citation.id.at,d.the court concluded that the prospect of an additional six months of reunification to see if the mother would and could do what was required to regain custody would not have promoted stability for the children,and thus would not have promoted their best interests.ibid.
in this case,the facts presented by the section petition show that mother is doing well,in the sense that she has remained sober,completed various classes,obtained employment,and visited regularly with angel.in addition,we shall assume,for the sake of this appeal,that this time her resolve is different,and that she will,in fact,be able to remain sober,remain employed,become and obtain housing.even so,such facts are not legally sufficient to require a hearing on her section petition.
as noted above,there is a rebuttable presumption that,in the absence of continuing reunification services,stability in an existing placement is in the best interest of the child,particularly when such placement is leading to adoption by the caretakers.in re stephanie,supra,cal th at,d.to rebut that presumption,a parent must make some factual showing that the best interests of the child would be served by modification.
here,mother has not made such a showing,and it is difficult to imagine how she could have done so,given the fact that mother never actually parented angel before her removal,and angel was immediately placed with an adoptive family and her own sibling.angel was removed from mother custody directly from the hospital,just two days after her birth.she was placed with a family that was not only in the process of adopting her older sibling,robert,but that also was successfully parenting two biological children and two other adopted children a sibling set,and that wanted to adopt angel as well,in part because it valued providing its adopted children with biological siblings.the parents in this family clearly,by deed if not by name,were angel parents.they,not mother,provided angel with all the,care needed by a helpless infant and then growi
