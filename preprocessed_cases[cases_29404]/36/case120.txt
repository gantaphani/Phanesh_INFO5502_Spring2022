background 
michael bigelow the decedent,the son of defendant michael bigelow,was employed at ge until his death on march.the decedent participated in three employee benefits plans a life insurance plan administered by metlife,a pension plan administered by ge,and a savings and security plan administered by ge.this dispute involves competing claims to the benefits of the life insurance and pension plans collectively,the plans the competing claimants are michael bigelow,the decedent father the father,on one side,and tracy bigelow and sherri bigelow gallup,the decedent daughters the daughters,on the other.
the decedent and his,karen bigelow,obtained a divorce decree in supreme court,montgomery county,new york on december,and the decree was entered in the montgomery county clerk office on january.they subsequently reached a settlement agreement distributing their marital property the stipulation,which was read into the record of the supreme court proceeding on january.the stipulation referred to a general electric insurance plan which consists of group life insurance,disability death and insurance for the dependant children,and it provided that the children of this marriage shall be designated irrevocable beneficiaries and the proceeds of such policies if ever paid will be paid in equal share or to the survivor of them.in the stipulation,the decedent also agreed to designate the children or the surviving child an irrevocable beneficiary of any retirement benefits attached to this program.it is not disputed that the daughters are the only children of the decedent marriage to karen bigelow.the stipulation was incorporated into a state court order and judgment on february,the judgment.despite his previous agreement to designate the daughters irrevocable beneficiaries,in the decedent designated the father as the primary beneficiary on the plans documents.
the decedent died on march,and two days later the daughters submitted to ge a claim to the life insurance,pension,and savings and security benefits.on march,the father submitted a claim to the life insurance and pension benefits.after receiving the competing claims,neither metlife nor ge followed the procedures outlined in d g and h instead,metlife and ge informed the daughters and the father that they were unable to make a decision,fearing exposure to double liability if they reached a conclusion that ultimately proved incorrect.metlife and ge,as stakeholders,then initiated an interpleader action,naming the daughters and the father as defendants.in their complaint,ge and metlife alleged that they were unable to determine to whom the benefits should be paid and that they were ready,willing and able to pay them to whichever party the court determined to be the appropriate beneficiary.
after discovery,the father and the daughters for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the daughters were the proper beneficiaries of the plans and,accordingly,denied the father motion and granted the daughters.following entry of judgment,the father appealed.
discussion 
initially we note that metlife and ge,as fiduciaries of the plans,had standing to bring an interpleader action pursuant to.and a b,and that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists under e and.see aetna life ins.bayona,cir metro.life ins.marsh,cir.
we turn now to the merits of the appeal,where the standard of review is.on appeal from a grant of summary judgment we review the record de novo to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist requiring a trial.morales quintel entm t,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
no material facts are in dispute.rather,the controversy involves solely statutory,whether erisa or state law governs the determination of the proper beneficiaries.if erisa governs,then the father,who is the named beneficiary in the plans documents,is the proper beneficiary.see a.if erisa does not apply,or if the judgment is exempt from erisa preemption provision,then the daughters,who were designated irrevocable beneficiaries in the stipulation,are the proper beneficiaries.see id.b.
generally,erisa preempts state laws that relate to employee benefits plans.a.the supreme court has held that a state law relates to an erisa plan if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.egelhoff egelhoff,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether a state law has a connection with an erisa plan,we look to the objectives of erisa and to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.state laws governing the designation of plan beneficiaries,such as the law giving effect to the judgment,relate to employee benefits plans and thus are subject to erisa preemption.id.at krishna colgate palmolive,cir.erisa,however,creates several exceptions to its general preemption provision,one of which is relevant here erisa does not preempt qualified domestic relations orders within the meaning of section d b i of this title b.this,then,is the nub of the present dispute if the judgment is a qualified domestic relations order qdro,erisa does not preempt it,and the daughters are the proper beneficiaries if,however,the judgment is not a qdro,then erisa preempts,and the father is the proper beneficiary 
the concept of the qdro originated with the retirement equity act the rea,an amendment to erisa which took effect,for relevant purposes,on january.pub.d,stat.timing is significant because prior to the rea and its qdro provisions,erisa preempted state court orders such as the judgment.since employment benefits were commonly at issue in state court matrimonial disputes and since erisa preemption provision had the unintended effect of disturbing interests and expectations fixed in such proceedings,the rea was designed to give effect to divorce decrees and related orders insofar as they pertained to plans.boggs boggs,d stating that one of rea central purposes is to give enhanced protection to the spouse and dependent children in the event of divorce or separation,and in the event of death,the surviving spouse.
the rea defines a qdro as a domestic relations order which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee right to,or assigns to an alternate payee the right to,receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan d b i i.in order to qualify as a qdro,a domestic relations order must also meet several other requirements.these include 
c a domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies 
i the name and the last known mailing address if any of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,
ii the amount or percentage of the participant benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee,or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,
iii the number of payments or period to which such order applies,and 
iv each plan to which such order applies.
d a domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order 
i does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit,or any option,not otherwise provided under the plan,
ii does not require the plan to provide increased benefits determined on the basis of actuarial value,and 
iii does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to
