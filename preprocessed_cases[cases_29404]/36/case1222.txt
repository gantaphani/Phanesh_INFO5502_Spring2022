the question posed in this appeal is whether a lump sum unallocated personal injury recovery is income,as defined by family code section,for purposes of calculating child support.we here decide the entirety of an undifferentiated lump sum personal injury recovery is not income for purposes of child support,and the determination as to whether some portion of an undifferentiated recovery is allocable as income must be left to the discretion of the trial judge.
in this case,the trial court correctly treated the recovery as a fund,and did not err in denying a request for allocation of a portion of the recovery as income.the court other rulings,regarding the parties respective incomes and regarding attorney fees,were also sound.accordingly,we affirm the order.
procedural and factual background 
george heiner and cathy chandler were married in may and separated in november.the marriage produced two daughters.george filed a petition for legal separation on november,
first trial 
original order on parenting schedule and child support 
it appears the parties could not reach agreement on custody,visitation,support,division of property,health insurance,medical expenses and attorney fees,and so proceeded to trial on those issues.the proceedings took place on seven days over a period of months.in may,the court issued its statement of decision,giving the parents joint physical and legal custody of the children,setting a temporary parenting schedule pending further evaluation,and ordering george to pay to cathy per month in child support.
order re attorney fees 
second trial 
in may,george filed a motion requesting modification of the court order with respect to visitation and child support.cathy opposed the motion,and the matter was set for hearing in june.for reasons not revealed in the record,the hearing did not commence until july.the proceedings in july,october and on february,involved almost exclusively the issues of custody and visitation further hearings took place on february,and,and on july.these related to financial issues underlying the calculation of child support,which issues are the subjects of this appeal.
evidence of george financial circumstances 
george worked as a dentist for about years,but became disabled from practicing dentistry after he was injured in an incident at a kmart store in march.he filed suit,and after a trial the jury returned a verdict in january awarding million in damages.the verdict did not separately state amounts for the various types of damages.kmart did not pay the judgment,but instead appealed and posted an appeal bond.in october,the verdict was upheld kmart and george then entered into a settlement agreement.according to george,kmart balked at paying the full amount of interest due on the judgment and george,therefore,accepted a settlement in an amount less than the full sum then due.the agreement characterized the entire sum paid as damages on account of physical and personal injuries.the agreement also made reference to internal revenue code section a for tax reporting purposes george did not declare any portion of the settlement proceeds as interest income,because the agreement called for an undifferentiated payment that eliminated any interest component.george admitted on that he received about more than he would have received had the judgment been paid when entered,but would not agree with counsel characterization of that amount as interest.george also testified that he had more debt because of the delayed payment 
george received from the settlement with kmart,after deducting attorney fees and costs from the proceeds of the settlement,george paid off a number of debts and purchased a residence.he used most of the remainder to invest in real estate and stocks.he also opened a money market account.he testified that his net worth as of february was million to million in real estate plus about in other investments and accounts including his individual retirement account.
evidence of cathy financial circumstances 
trial court rulings 
after receiving closing briefs,cathy objections to george brief,and george reply,the court issued a lengthy and detailed statement of tentative decision on financial issues.as pertinent here,the findings were as follows 
the court determined there were three time periods for which support should be calculated.the first period,commenced when george filed his motion to modify support may,and ended when george received his personal injury recovery from kmart may.the second period,began in june and ended in june of,when the court issued its order substantially altering the amount of time each parent had with the children.is the period commencing after june.
findings regarding george income 
the court found that,for the year comprising,george financial circumstances were in turmoil.although he had won a substantial verdict from kmart,the case had been appealed,and the benefit of the judgment had not yet arrived.because the verdict was not so liquidated as to constitute a basis for an imputed return,the court relied on george evidence of his actual income for.with respect to and,the court found that george use of his wealth to increase the value of his assets rather than to generate a stream of income is not in the children best interest and,therefore,the court imputed income to george at a rate of percent per year for his real estate holdings and at the rates of percent and percent per year in and,respectively,for his savings,stocks and bonds.
trial court order 
on january,the court issued its final statement of decision.the court calculated child support as follows for,cathy owed george per month for,george owed cathy per month for,george owed and continues to owe cathy per month.the order after hearing was filed on june.cathy appealed.
ii.standard of review 
a decision modifying a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found upon examination of the record.in re marriage of drake th,d.although precise definition is difficult,it is generally accepted that the appropriate test of abuse of discretion is whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.citations.w hen two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,a reviewing court lacks power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.in re marriage of connolly cal d.the burden is on the complaining party to establish abuse of discretion.blank kirwan cal d.the showing on appeal is insufficient if it presents a state of facts which simply affords an opportunity for a difference of opinion.in re marriage of varner th,d varner.
we observe,however,that the trial court has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation citation.furthermore,in reviewing child support orders we must also recognize that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule citation.in short,the trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the law regarding child support citation.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.
our review of the trial court findings of fact is limited to determining whether they are supported by substantial evidence.see in re marriage of schulze th,d schulze.
iii.discussion 
should the entire proceeds of george personal injury recovery be treated as income for child support 
cathy first argues that because the statute defining income for purposes of child support does not exclude personal injury recoveries,the principal sums recovered by george from kmart should have been included in the support calculations,just as lottery winnings are included.the fact that the award is not treated as taxable income,cathy argues,is irrelevant.
we observe that this contention was not squarely raised below this would normally preclude our consideration of it.g d holland construction city of marysville d.but here,the theory has been thoroughly briefed,and presents an important issue of public policy.further,the parties do not disagree as to the relevant facts.accordingly,we will proceed to adjudicate it.raphael bloomfield th,d a reviewing court may consider points not raised at trial when important issues of public policy are involved or when a contention newly made on appeal presents a question of law.
to begin with,we agree with cathy that the internal revenue code exclusion of personal injury recoveries from taxable income is not controlling.workers compensation payments,for example,are also excluded from taxable income,a but are included as income under family code section.
the plain language of section,which defines income for purposes of child support,does not speak to personal injury recoveries true,the statute is broad and uses inclusive language,t he annual gross income of each parent means income from whatever source derived and includes,but is not limited to,the following i ncome such as annuities,workers compensation benefits,disability insurance benefits,and social security benefits,subd.a.but it has not been read so expansively as to encompass every financial payout.for example,courts have held that life insurance proceeds in re marriage of scheppers th,d scheppers,student loans in re marriage of rocha th,d,inter vivos gifts schulze,supra,th at,d,and testamentary gifts county of kern castle th,d castle are not income within the statutory definition of section.the common thread in these cases is that such payments do not meet the generally accepted definition of income,that is,the gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,or property citation or from any other investment of capital citation.scheppers,supra,th at,d.in contrast,lottery winnings do constitute income because gambling proceeds are in the nature of a return on the investment of capital.county of contra costa lemon d.applying this approach,we examine the nature of the payment.
in george unlike the usual personal injury jury was instructed on five components of damages medical expenses,past loss of ability to work,present value of lost future earning capacity,pain and suffering,and emotional distress resulting from financial injury.kmart,supra,th at,d.none of these components is a gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,property or investment of capital.for the most part,personal injury awards are not intended as a gain at all,but as an attempt to make the injured party whole for losses physical and to the injury.we recognize that past and future loss of earning capacity might well be considered a substitute for wages or earned income,akin to disability or workers compensation benefits which are included in the definition of income.but in this case,those damages were not separately awarded because neither party requested a special verdict with respect to the damages id.at,d,and the settlement agreement also provided for an unallocated payment.under these circumstances,the entire amount of a lump sum undifferentiated personal injury award or settlement is not income 
this conclusion is congruent with the fact that future economic losses are awarded at a discounted value.baji.thus,the law presumes that the amount awarded by the jury in year one will be invested to produce sufficient proceeds to fully compensate the injured party over his or her lifetime.see,ches.ohio ry.kelly.if percent of a personal injury award were deemed income when received,and if child support were calculated based upon that number,the injured party would be unjustly deprived of the capital needed to produce the additional compensation to which he or she is entitled.
we have also considered cathy cited authorities and find them inapposite.in butler butler,in re marriage of fain,and in re jerome,jerome,the appellate courts upheld the lower courts decisions to treat the parents personal injury recoveries as income but all three cases involved either annuity payments or structured settlements thus,the courts in butler,fain,and jerome did not treat lump sum tort awards or settlements as income.see,jerome,supra,at a lump sum settlement is akin to an asset,citation,while annuity payments provide a regular income flow.under new hampshire legislative scheme,assets are not income for child support purposes.citation.
the fourth case cathy cites,villanueva d,villanueva,presents a different scenario.there,a father received a lump sum undifferentiated settlement as damages for injuries suffered to his hand.id.at.the trial court treated the entire amount as income for purposes of child support and the father appealed.ibid.the court of appeal reversed,holding that the entirety of a personal injury settlement could not be considered income,because it serves primarily to make the injured person whole,and does not represent a gain or profit.id.at.in villanueva,the parties had agreed that the settlement included a component representing lost earnings,but could not agree as to the amount,so the court remanded to determine that portion of the respondent settlement which was or should have been apportioned to replace the respondent past and future lost earnings.id.at.
villanueva thus does not support cathy position that percent of george personal injury award should be considered income.indeed,the villanueva court did not even hold that any component found to represent reimbursement for lost earnings must be considered income for purposes of child support,but only that it may be so considered.villanueva,supra,at.in so holding,the court also did not rule out the possibility that an apportionment might not be possible where it would be too speculative.id.at.
other courts have concluded that lump sum personal injury payments are not income.in kelly kelly so d,the court held that receipt of a lump sum settlement,as opposed to regular periodic payments,consists of a fund which is capital not a flow which is income,but that interest or other returns from the fund are income.similarly,in misc d,the court concluded that monthly payments from a structured settlement were income,but lump sum payments made as part of the settlement were not income.
in harmony with all these authorities,we conclude that the entirety of an unallocated lump sum personal injury settlement or award is not income for purposes of section.
b.did the trial court abuse its discretion in failing to allocate a portion of george recovery as income 
cathy next contends that if the entire amount of george recovery is not income,the court deviated from the statutory guideline in refus ing to consider that at least some portion of george personal injury recovery was income.actually,the court did not refuse to consider that a portion of the recovery might be treated as income rather,the court concluded it would be impossible to make the requested allocation.the issue before us is whether george personal injury recovery is reasonably subject to an allocation as among the various components of damages.
cathy argument is predicated on the assumption that the components of a personal injury award intended to be compensation for loss of income and loss of earning capacity may be considered by the court as income for child support.george does not dispute this premise,nor do we.although such revenue does not derive from investments of labor,business or property scheppers,supra,th at,d,damages for loss of income or earning capacity are unquestionably a substitute therefor.as such,they may be considered as income under section.the disputed question here is whether the trial court is required to include such damages in the income calculation.we conclude,as have our sister courts,that this is necessarily a determination.accordingly,it is best left to the discretion of the court,considering all the evidence before it.
in whitaker colbert,whitaker,for example,a parent received a personal injury settlement that was not apportioned as to amounts attributable to pain and suffering,permanent injury or disability,lost wages,lost earning capacity or future medicals the underlying case included claims for lost earnings,medical expenses,loss of earning capacity,disability,injury,an
