this appeal arises from judgments in a marriage dissolution action regarding the division of retirement and employment benefits,the division of other assets,the award of temporary and permanent spousal support,and the denial of requests for attorney fees and costs.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
appellant leslie moore and respondent terry moore were married for over years.they married on october.leslie is a homemaker.terry is an officer with the chico police department,and has been since.leslie filed a petition for dissolution on march.
the case proceeded with difficulty.all of the butte county superior court judges eventually recused themselves for cause.in august,the presiding judge reassigned the case to a visiting judge,the william lamb,for trial.
leslie was represented by three different attorneys.the latter two received permission from the court to withdraw as counsel.leslie proceeded to represent herself at trial.she filed her appellant opening brief in pro,but she retained an attorney to file her reply brief.
the court awarded temporary spousal support.as discussed further below,leslie later requested the court to modify the award,but the court never entertained the requests.
the court entered judgment terminating the marriage on september,effective august.trial continued on the issues of support,division of terry retirement and employment benefits,property division,and attorney fees.the court entered its judgment on those matters on june.it ordered terry to pay spousal support of per month.it awarded the couple home to leslie by stipulation of the parties,a value of.it also awarded leslie of the community interest in terry retirement pers,deferred compensation,and other deposits.it reserved jurisdiction on two of terry employment benefits a retiree medical reimbursement account and his accrued sick leave.it did not rule on a motion by leslie for sanctions due to terry failure to disclose the reimbursement account and other employment benefits.it also concluded terry accrued vacation had no value.
the court ordered leslie to make an equalization payment of.that payment included reimbursement for terry separate property contributions to the community and the value of leslie exclusive occupation of the couple home from separation to judgment.finally,the court ordered the parties to bear their own attorney fees and costs.
leslie appeals,challenging numerous trial court rulings.she contends the court erred by refusing to hear her motion to modify temporary spousal support retroactively incorrectly dividing,or reserving jurisdiction on,terry retirement benefits,employment benefits,and deferred compensation,and not ruling on her motion for sanctions for failure to disclose incorrectly dividing and valuing other community assets,including leslie use of the home after separation and terry separate property contribution awarding too little in permanent spousal support and not awarding her attorney fees and costs.she also contends the entire trial proceeding was tainted with bias.
we will address each contention,and we will provide additional facts as required.
discussion 
irequest to modify temporary spousal support retroactively 
leslie contends the trial court erred when it refused to hear her request to modify the award of temporary spousal support retroactively.she claims the award erroneously imputed income to her based on her ability to work when in fact she is permanently disabled.she claims the court reserved jurisdiction to address this issue after entering its order for temporary spousal support,and it erred when it refused to hear her motion and other requests to modify the award.we agree.
additional background information 
leslie moved for guideline temporary spousal support and attorney fees on august.she also asked that her dissolution case be consolidated with an earlier request she had filed for a domestic violence restraining order.she declared she had no income and had monthly expenses of nearly.
in his response,terry consented to guideline spousal support less for leslie use of the residence rent free and without a mortgage.he also requested each party bear their own attorney fees.terry claimed leslie had the ability to earn the minimum wage but she had deliberately chosen not to work.he asked that the minimum wage be imputed to her and she be given a gavron warning he declared his average monthly income,before taxes,was,and he had monthly expenses of.
on november,pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,the trial court ordered terry to pay leslie temporary spousal support in the amount of per month,effective september.in reaching its decision,the court imputed in monthly income to leslie,an amount equivalent to hours of work per week at minimum wage.the court stated its order,and the factors upon which it is based,are without prejudice to either party and are subject to retroactive modification to a date to be determined by the court,but no earlier than march.italics added.
at a hearing on august,leslie counsel stated the parties intended on that day for the court to address,among other matters,an issue that had been reserved whether leslie should be imputed any earnings value for purposes of spousal support.if she should not,counsel would present information on whether there should be a retroactive modification of the spousal support order.however,the court did not reach the issue that day because leslie became frustrated about not being able to speak on an issue,and she left the courtroom.her attorney thereafter withdrew,and leslie represented herself through trial.
at a hearing on december,on a motion for discovery by leslie,the court attempted to have the parties define the pending issues in order to set the scope of any discovery.during that discussion,counsel for terry stated the issue of leslie employability had been rendered moot because leslie had been determined to be permanently disabled and eligible for ssi benefits.terry would no longer argue that leslie should be seeking gainful employment for purposes of determining spousal support.
on december,leslie filed a declaration with the court which she intended to be used as a statement for trial readiness and issues to be addressed at trial.she asserted terry was in arrears in paying temporary spousal support,and she also claimed the amount of temporary support was in error in part because the court had imputed monthly income to her.
on january,she moved to adjust temporary spousal support retroactively and to calculate arrears.when the trial court took up the motion at trial,it refused to hear it.it stated the purpose of trial was to set permanent spousal support which would replace temporary spousal support.it held the temporary spousal support is not before the court.i here to hear evidence on permanent support.the court ordered that any remaining issues regarding temporary spousal support were to be addressed separately in a posttrial motion.
leslie continued to raise the issue during trial.she did so in a final statement to the record,in her written closing argument,and in her intended oral closing argument which she filed with the court.she also raised it on the final day of trial.at that time,the court stated spousal support arrears were not before it and no motion for spousal support arrears had been made.it said the issue still existed after trial,as jurisdiction had been retained,but there was no motion at that time.
the court understood leslie contention to be she was entitled to a higher amount of temporary support and that additional amount had not been paid.terry counsel said that issue had been waived.leslie asserted she had raised it in her brief and statement of issues,but she had not been allowed to present her case at trial.
leslie attempted to raise the issue again by a posttrial motion.the court did not file the motion but entertained argument on whether an order to show cause should issue to schedule a hearing on her motion.the court stated the issue of nonpayment of temporary spousal support had been addressed at trial.as to whether the temporary support could be retroactively adjusted to have started in march,the court recognized the temporary support award had provided for retroactivity,and it remembered leslie arguing this point in trial.terry counsel argued the issue was waived because leslie did not file a motion before or during trial to address it.over leslie protest that she had in fact brought such a motion,the court ruled the posttrial motion was premature,as it was filed before judgment was entered.leslie filed her notice of appeal the same day the trial court filed its judgment on reserved issues.
terry claims leslie waived appellate review of the issue of temporary spousal support because she did not file a timely appeal of the spousal support award of that was made in.in making this claim,however,terry misapprehends the thrust of leslie argument.he also fails to properly account for the fact that the parties stipulated to the terms of the temporary spousal support order,including its retroactive modifiability.
as we understand it,leslie is not arguing that it was error for the trial court to order terry to pay her only in temporary spousal support in november,when the court made that order.in fact,leslie could not legitimately make that argument here not only because any challenge to the order would be too late now,but also because the parties stipulated to the terms of that order,and a party can not challenge on appeal an order to which she consented.atchison,ry.hildebrand d.in our view,rather than raising a challenge to the support order that would be too late and would not be one she could make in any event,leslie is challenging the trial court refusal to consider her various requests that the court retroactively modify the temporary spousal support order,which the parties agreed the court could do.
terry offers no response to leslie argument viewed in that light.thus,terry offers no defense of the trial court refusal to consider whether leslie should have been provided with temporary support all the way back to march,or to some later date before,and whether the amount of the temporary support order should have been greater because for instance leslie did not in fact have the ability to work for the minimum wage.
the parties agreed the court could retroactively modify the temporary support order,the court included that retroactivity provision in the order,and no one challenged that order on appeal and rightly so,since they agreed to it.accordingly,that order,including the retroactivity condition,is res judicata.in re marriage of murray th.under these circumstances,it was error for the court to refuse to consider leslie various requests for retroactive modification of temporary spousal support.
terry asserts there is no evidence in the record showing the temporary award was improper.we disagree with this point as well.the motion for retroactive modification of the award was well founded.after the temporary order had been made and trial begun,terry counsel admitted leslie was unemployable,and he would not seek attribution of income in the determination of spousal support.this admission eliminated a factor upon which the temporary order rested,and the court should have exercised its reserved jurisdiction to reconsider its order upon leslie motion.the court erred in not doing so,and the judgment must be reversed to allow the court to hear and rule upon her motion.
division of employment benefits and retirement 
leslie contends the trial court erred in dividing certain of terry employment benefits and retirement.she challenges the court ruling on terry retiree medical reimbursement account,his accrued vacation,the commencement of her share of terry pers retirement,his accrued sick leave,and his deferred compensation.she also claims the court erred by not imposing sanctions against terry for his failure to disclose the medical reimbursement account and other employment benefits.we conclude the court erred in its analysis of terry accrued vacation.we also conclude the court erred when it declined to consider sanctions against terry for failing to disclose the medical reimbursement account.we affirm the court ruling on the other employee benefit and retirement issues.
medical reimbursement account 
one of the fringe benefits of terry employment is participation in a retiree medical reimbursement plan known as the retiree medical expense and health insurance trust medical trust.the trial court reserved jurisdiction to award any interest in the medical trust,as it found the medical trust current value was unknown and speculative.the court ordered its value,if any,to be determined upon terry retirement.
leslie claims the trial court erred in reserving jurisdiction on the medical trust.she contends the medical trust is a community asset that could have been divided at trial based on an actuarial valuation of present value,and the trial court erred when it did not order the valuation to be performed at terry expense.she also claims terry should be subject to sanctions,as he did not disclose this asset in his required disclosures.we conclude the medical trust is a community asset,but the court did not abuse its discretion in reserving jurisdiction on this issue.however,we conclude the court must consider leslie request for sanctions.
additional background information 
in its memorandum of understanding mou with the chico police officers association cpoa,the city of chico the city acceded to the cpoa establishing the medical trust.the medical trust is to provide funding for medical expenses and health insurance for eligible retirees,or qualified family members of eligible retirees as established by the trust.the city agreed to fund the trust with monthly contributions per police employee on active duty.the medical trust is administered and managed by the cpoa.as president of the cpoa,terry designed the entire trust.
the medical trust is a unique asset designed to pay retirees a monthly benefit up to a certain maximum for covered medical expenses and health insurance premiums.to an extent,the medical trust is a defined contribution plan.the city pays a set amount each month into the trust for each public safety employee.that amount was per month until january,when it was raised to per month,and until january,when it was raised to per month.the city began contributing to terry account in,and as of april,terry had earned in the medical trust.
however,the employee right to the funds does not mature until retirement,and even then he may not access the entire amount.the retiree must submit a claim for reimbursement.the medical trust will reimburse a valid claim up to a monthly maximum amount.the retiree maximum monthly benefit is set by the medical trust trustees,and is calculated for each retiree based on the number of years of employment since january,and the number of years the city made contributions for that retiree.if the retiree claims no expenses in a month,he receives no monthly benefit.leslie argued this was not likely to happen,as the trust was set up to pay medical insurance premiums.terry acknowledged it would pay those premiums.
as of the date of separation,terry had not vested in the medical trust,as under the trust terms at that time,the city had not contributed long enough to terry account to allow him to vest.since then,however,terry has vested.because terry has worked a sufficient number of years and received a prescribed minimum number of contributions from the city,the monthly benefit will be available to him from when he retires until his death.any surviving spouse and dependents will have limited benefits after that time.as of the time of trial,the medical trust had yet to make any payments or determine a monthly benefit amount as no beneficiary rights,including terry,had matured.
terry did not disclose the medical trust in any of his required declarations of disclosure.leslie filed a motion for sanctions for terry failure to disclose the two largest assets in the estate.she referenced her earlier declarations,in which she declared terry had failed to disclose two of the largest assets,one of which was the medical trust.the other asset appears to have been terry other employment benefits and,in particular,his accrued vacation and sick leave.the trial court never addressed the motion.
the medical trust is a community asset.similar to a nonvested pension and other contingent retirement benefits,the medical trust benefits are property rights because they represent a form of deferred compensation for services rendered.in this case,they are a contractual right derived from terry employment agreement with the city and earned by him while married to leslie.they are thus a divisible community property asset.
generally,all property acquired by a spouse during marriage before separation is community property.see.under the leading case of in re marriage of brown cal d brown,and its progeny,such property may include the right to retirement benefits accrued by the employee spouse as deferred compensation for services rendered.id.at.this is the case whether or not the right to retirement benefits is vested in the sense of surviv ing discharge or voluntary termination,and whether or not it is matured in the sense of amounting to an unconditional entitlement to immediate payment.id.at.what is determinative is not any abstract terminology of this sort id.at,but rather a single concrete fact time.the right to retirement benefits represent s a property interest to the extent that such a right derive s from employment during marriage before separation,it comprise s a community asset id.at.in re marriage of lehman cal th,lehman.
the community has an interest in the medical trust to the extent the monthly payments were made on terry behalf while he was married to leslie.in this case,that would be all payments made into the trust by the city from the trust conception until terry and leslie separated on march.
however,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by reserving jurisdiction to divide and value the community property interest at a later date.upon dissolution of a marriage,the trial court has broad discretion in the division of the community property interest in a spouse pension rights and can exercise its discretion in either of two ways.the trial court may either determine the present value of community property rights and award them to one spouse with offsetting community or other assets to the other commonly called the cash out method,or it may divide the community interest in kind between the spouses,reserving jurisdiction to supervise future payments to each spouse.brown,supra,cal d at.in re marriage of bergman d,bergman.
because it is not possible to develop comprehensive guidelines for trial courts to follow in deciding whether to cash out or divide in kind community interests in pensions or other deferred compensation,and because this decision is reached primarily by the weighing of equitable and factual considerations,appellate courts should not second guess the exercise of the broad discretion of trial courts in the absence of a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.citations.bergman,supra,d at.
there is no clear showing the trial court abused its discretion in reserving jurisdiction.the community interest in the medical trust is difficult to value as of the date of separation and even as of today.at separation,terry was not vested in the benefit.by trial,terry had vested,but contingencies exist that could greatly affect the benefit value.the benefit does not mature until terry retires,and the amount of the benefit depends on the number of years terry works for the city and the number of years the city contributes to the trust.even after the benefit matures,the benefit is contingent on terry filing claims for reimbursement of his covered medical expenses or insurance premiums.because terry is still working and can not be forced to retire,because he continues to earn this benefit since the parties separated,and because the benefit when matured is still contingent,the community estate interest can not easily be valued at the present time.
in addition,relying on a present actuarial value could result in a substantially unequal division.terry could die before the benefit matures,or he could retire before his right matures at the highest benefit level available.in either of those circumstances,leslie would have received an unequal share of the asset if it was paid out now on its present cash value.moreover,neither party submitted actuarial evidence of present value,and the trial court was not obligated to order terry to fund that cost.because of these uncertainties,the court did not abuse its discretion by reserving jurisdiction on the division and valuation of the medical trust.
leslie claims the court erred by reserving jurisdiction indefinitely.see bergman,supra,d at.but family code section expressly empowers the trial court to reserve jurisdiction to make a property division at a later time.in re marriage of kilbourne d,re predecessor statue.moreover,under the circumstances of this case,the court reservation of jurisdiction was not truly indefinite.retirement was not too far distant.terry was eligible to begin earning retirement under pers at age.at the time of trial,terry was years old,had been employed with the city since,and he planned to work at least a total of years,or until.
in any event,this asset seems the type of asset best left to the trial court reserved jurisdiction.by reserving jurisdiction in order to perform an division upon terry retirement,the trial court equally divided the risk that the benefit will fail to mature,and it deferred the asset valuation until the major contingency,terry retirement,is resolved.whether to divide a contingent community asset by valuation or by partition upon reserved jurisdiction lies within the trial court sound discretion brown,supra,cal d at,and the court did not abuse that discretion by reserving jurisdiction on the medical trust.
we do,however,conclude the court erred when it failed to consider leslie request for sanctions against terry for his failure to disclose the medical trust in either of his preliminary or final declarations of disclosure.after terry conceded he had not disclosed the medical trust,and leslie protested the lack of disclosure,the trial court stated terry was not obligated to disclose it if it was his position the asset had no value.this was incorrect.
a party preliminary declaration of disclosure must identify all assets in which the declarant may have an interest,regardless of the characterization of the asset as community or separate property,subd.c.for purposes of this requirement,the term a sset includes any real or personal property of any nature,whether tangible or intangible,and whether currently existing or contingent,subd.a.this is so whatever the declarant opinion of value.the medical trust qualified as an asset terry was required to disclose.
if a party fails to comply with the disclosure requirements,the trial court shall impose money sanctions against the noncomplying party.sanctions shall be in an amount sufficient to deter repletion of the conduct or comparable conduct,and shall include reasonable attorney fees,costs incurred,or both,unless the court finds that the noncomplying party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust,subd.c.
on remand,the trial court is directed to hear and rule on leslie motion for sanctions for terry failure to disclose the medical trust 
vacation pay 
the trial court ruled terry accrued vacation pay was not a community property asset because it could not be valued and divided.terry had accrued vacation time of hours,the maximum he could earn.if cashed in,it would be worth some,but it can be cashed in only at the time of retirement.the court also noted that by the time terry retires,all of the maximum hours will have accrued after separation and become his separate property.the court thus ruled the asset had no present value.
leslie contends the trial court erred in not dividing the vacation pay.she claims vacation pay is a form of community property wages that should be divided as part of a dissolution proceeding.we review the trial court determination as to characterization independently lehman,supra,cal th at,and we agree with leslie claim.
it is established that vacation pay is not a gratuity or a gift,but is,in effect,additional wages for services performed.citations.suastez plastic dress up cal d.the right to a paid vacation,when offered in an employer policy or contract of employment,constitutes deferred wages for services rendered.id.at.once vested,paid vacation time can not be forfeited.
consequently,like any other form of deferred compensation,accrued vacation benefits are a property interest which,to the extent earned during marriage and before separation,are divisible community property at marriage dissolution.citation.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
terry originally contended that accrued vacation is not a community asset under the rule of in re marriage of lorenz d,lorenz.in that case,the second appellate district held accrued vacation pay was not a community asset because it could not be exchanged for cash upon the date of separation.however,the court did not discuss labor code section,which provides an employee must be paid for vested vacation time upon termination of employment.as a result,the lorenz court did not consider whether vacation pay could be valued currently based on the fact the employee spouse could receive cash for it on termination.thus,lorenz does not apply here.
because the evidence showed that terry was eligible to retire at the time of trial but had chosen not to,and because terry can cash in his accrued vacation pay when he retires,the only thing preventing terry accrued vacation pay from having immediate cash value to him at the time of trial was his decision to continue working.these facts bring the case within the rationale of the supreme court decision in in re marriage of gillmore cal d gillmore.in gillmore,the husband was eligible to retire but wanted to keep working.the wife sought an order requiring him to pay her share of the retirement benefits he could be drawing,but the trial court refused.the supreme court reversed,stating as follows under the cases and statutory law,husband can not time his retirement to deprive wife of an equal share of the community interest in his pension.it is a settled principle that one spouse can not,by invoking a condition wholly within his control,defeat the community interest of the other spouse.citations.id.at.
the gillmore court explained,compensation is possible here because the value of wife interest is known to the court.also,the only condition to the payment of the benefits,husband retirement,is entirely within his control husband claim that he is being forced to retire misses the point.he is free to continue working.however,if he does so,he must reimburse wife for the share of the community property that she loses as a result of that decision.his claim that the court lacks jurisdiction to order him to make payments to wife because it lacks jurisdiction over his separate property also lacks merit.husband alone will make the decision to use separate property to reimburse wife,when and if he decides not to retire.his situation is not unlike that faced by a couple ordered to divide a house that they own as community property.if one of the spouses chooses to keep the house,he or she is free to use separate property to purchase the other interest.here,husband must divide his retirement benefits to wife.if he does not wish to retire,he must pay her an amount equivalent to her interest.gillmore,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
here,the only thing preventing leslie from receiving her share of the community interest in terry accrued vacation pay is terry decision to keep working,yet under gillmore,terry can not defeat leslie community interest in his accrued vacation pay by invoking a condition wholly within his control.moreover,as in gillmore,compensation is possible here because the value of leslie interest in the accrued vacation pay was established by the evidence,which equals hours of accrued vacation multiplied by terry pay rate at the time of trial per hour,divided in half.
the trial court thus erred in not finding the accrued vacation pay was a community asset and not dividing it based on its cash value at the time of trial,subd.a.indeed,at oral argument,terry conceded accrued vacation pay was a community asset that must be divided upon dissolution.we remand the case for the trial court to award leslie of,or,in the form of a reduction in the amount of her equalization payment.
the parties stipulated to,and the trial court entered,a qualified domestic relations order qdro that divided the amount of terry pers retirement account,at the time of separation,in half.the order was entered on may.leslie asserts she began receiving her pers benefits in september.leslie complains she was entitled to her share of pers benefits beginning on march,and she contends the loss of this income was waste.we disagree.
by statute,leslie pers allowance began to accrue either on the date she designated in her application to pers as the effective date,or the day after the trial court order if later,in this case may.leslie does not direct us to a copy of her application in the record,so we must assume the court order established her right to payment.in addition,the court order directed pers to establish leslie account as soon as administratively practicable after the date of the order.there is no evidence in the record pers did anything other than act as quickly as practicable.she has lost no pers benefits to which she was entitled.
accrued sick leave 
leslie contends the court erred when it refused to divide and value terry accrued sick leave because,upon retirement,terry can credit his accrued sick leave to pers for additional service credit.the community would have an interest in that leave to the extent it affects his retirement,and leslie fears terry may take steps that would reduce or eliminate his ability to receive full credit from pers at the expense of the community.the trial court reserved jurisdiction to address the accrued sick leave,and we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
additional background information 
terry accrues sick leave at the rate of eight hours per month without any cap.as of the time of separation,terry had accrued hours of sick leave.under the mou and upon retirement,terry accumulated sick leave is to be credited to terry pers retirement account for additional service credit except to the extent terry desires to convert any of his sick leave to cash.however,pers allows terry to earn no more than years of service credit.thus,if he works years,his accrued sick leave will not add any value to his pers retirement.if,on the other hand,he retires after years of employment and applies his accrued sick leave to pers service credit,he could receive nearly another year in retirement credit essentially the value of a year of salary for purposes of retirement.
in the event terry chooses to convert his sick leave to cash,he will not be reimbursed dollar for dollar.under the mou,he is limited to converting up to percent of his sick leave for a maximum amount of.terry testified was the maximum the city would pay for his sick leave.in addition,if terry becomes seriously ill before retiring,he could theoretically use all of his sick leave,leaving him with no accrued sick leave upon retirement to convert to cash or service credit.
leslie sought to have terry sick leave valued at the disposition as a part of terry retirement.she feared if this were not done,terry would credit his sick leave to pers,receive another year of service credit and a higher retirement allowance,and she would lose out on that benefit because she started receiving her portion of his pers benefits before he retires.
the trial court acknowledged that if terry credited sick leave to pers upon his retirement,any increase in his retirement would have a community property interest.terry counsel agreed,but he asked the court to retain jurisdiction over the issue to make any necessary adjustment to leslie upon terry retirement.in its judgment,the trial court retained jurisdiction over terry accrued sick leave,concluding its value could not be determined until terry retired.
on appeal,leslie challenges the court ruling in two respects its effect on her interest in terry sick leave as of the time of separation and her interest as of the time of terry future retirement.on the first point,she asserts the trial court did not err in reserving jurisdiction,but she is concerned terry could transmute any community property interest in the sick leave into his separate property before retiring.on the second point,she claims the court erred by not dividing and valuing the sick leave that could be credited to pers.she fears that if the community interest is not apportioned now,the community may lose its interest in the leave should terry work beyond years.
unlike other forms of deferred compensation,such as retirement or vacation pay,sick leave is compensation in lieu of wages when an employee absents himself from work due to illness.doyle doyle,doyle see also,subd.b.sick leave benefits paid while the employee is married are community property.doyle,supra.at.in this regard,accrued sick leave resembles disability insurance benefits.disability benefits are to compensate the disabled spouse for lost earnings earnings which would normally be separate property after dissolution.in re marriage of saslow cal d,saslow.disability benefits are treated as community property when paid during the marriage,but they are treated as separate property when paid after dissolution and before retirement,even though they were earned or paid for during marriage.see in re marriage of walker th,no community interest in calstrs disability allowance paid after dissolution but before disabled spouse retirement.
however,the community has an interest in any unused disability benefits at the time of retirement.that is because at that point,the payments are no longer in lieu of wages but are paid for purposes of retirement.saslow,supra,cal d at.
accrued sick leave is to be treated in the same manner.sick leave is community property when paid during the marriage,but when paid after separation but before retirement,it is separate property paid in lieu of wages.and just as the community has an interest in disability payments at the time of retirement,so too does it have an interest in accrued sick leave at the time of retirement.that is because at that point,the payments are no longer in lieu of wages but are paid for purposes of retirement.
were disability benefits and,in turn,sick leave benefits,treated as community property when accrued during marriage but paid after separation,the law could inequitably divide the property to the disabled spouse detriment.if postdissolution disability benefits are held to be community property,a young ablebodied will be able to work and retain all his or her earnings,and will in addition be entitled to half the disability benefits of the disabled.this might impose a grave hardship on the disabled individual,who not only may not be able to work,but who may also require special equipment or extraordinary care.saslow,supra,cal d at.for the same reasons,we hold that any interest in accrued and unused sick leave at the time of separation and prior to retirement is not community property.
thus,the trial court reservation of jurisdiction is to determine any community interest in terry accrued sick leave at the time of his retirement.here,upon retirement,terry may use his sick leave to purchase service credit with pers or he may sell it for up to.in either event,the trial court,by reserving jurisdiction on this issue,will be able to apportion and divide the community interest,whether it is an increase in leslie retirement allowance or a share of the cash proceeds.
leslie contends the trial court should divide the accrued sick leave into his retirement now otherwise,terry may work years and not be able to use the sick leave to acquire additional pers service credit.she claims by not dividing this interest now,we allow terry to transmute community property into separate property.this is incorrect.as we explained,the community has no interest in accrued sick leave except when benefits are paid during the marriage or upon retirement to the extent earned during the marriage.the court could reasonably conclude there are too many contingencies in play for it to determine now what the community value of terry accrued sick leave will be at his retirement.the value could possibly be zero if terry becomes seriously ill before retiring and is forced to use all of his accrued leave.in that circumstance,the community will bear the loss equally,as the sick leave benefits used would have been terry separate property.given this possibility,the court was well within its discretion when it retained jurisdiction over terry accrued sick leave.
deferred compensation 
terry had two deferred compensation accounts that,combined,totaled at least at the time of separation.the parties could not agree on how to divide them.terry proposed they be awarded to leslie if he received the family home.leslie proposed they be awarded to terry if she received the family home.
at trial,terry proposed the accounts be divided equally so that each party would bear his or her own tax consequences.leslie did not want an division because she would have to withdraw her portion,bear the tax consequences,and give her portion to terry as part of an equalization payment.the trial court ordered the accounts to be divided equally,indicating that if an item of property is divided equally,neither party has a basis for objecting to the division.leslie claims the court abused its discretion because its division resulted in leslie having to make an equalization payment,thereby losing the value she could have gained from this asset over time had she not been required to cash it out.
the court did not abuse its discretion.when parties are unable to agree on the disposition of community assets,the court must effect an equal division of the net community estate.the court has great discretion in achieving that result so long as it divides the community estate equally,except as may be otherwise provided by statute.that the division results in leslie having to make an equalization payment at the expense of an asset potential for future gain does not demonstrate the net estate was divided unequally.
other property division issues 
leslie challenges the manner in which the trial court treated other community and separate properties.specifically,she contends the court erred in its treatment of her exclusive use of the family home after separation,her interest in another home that was terry separate property before the marriage,animals,a pickup truck that was purchased before separation but sold afterwards,payment of a gym membership,costs of storing and moving terry belongings,allegedly undisclosed bank accounts,and loans made to the couple children.we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion on any of these items.
leslie use of family home 
leslie had exclusive possession and use of the family home,a community asset,for months from separation until judgment.the trial court determined the monthly rent would be.terry agreed leslie had paid taxes and insurance in the amount of.this left a total rental value of,half of which,the court found leslie owed to terry.
leslie claims the court made two errors.first,she asserts she actually paid in taxes and insurance while she possessed the property.her evidence does not support this claim.she submitted receipts from paying taxes and insurance while she possessed the property totaling.while she submitted copies of additional bills,she does not direct us to evidence showing she paid those bills.the court did not abuse its discretion in crediting leslie with in paid taxes and insurance.that was more than she proved.
second,leslie contends the trial court erred when it did not take into account the community responsibility for deferred maintenance.terry had estimated leslie possession of the home had created in waste.leslie argues that amount is a reasonable value of the necessary maintenance she deferred on the home because she could not afford it.she argues the trial court on remand should revalue the rental value to account for what should be terry contribution to the deferred maintenance.leslie,however,directs us to no evidence in the record supporting her claim for deferred maintenance.we thus affirm the court ruling on this issue.
separate property house 
two and a half years before marrying leslie,terry purchased a home,using his separate property for the down payment.after marrying,the parties lived in the home for seven years and paid the mortgage with community property funds.the parties sold the property.the court determined terry had a percent separate property interest in the proceeds from the sale of this property,net of the remaining mortgage.the parties used the proceeds from that sale to purchase and improve a parcel of raw land in durham.subsequently,the parties sold the land and,with the proceeds,purchased the home in which they lived until separating.the trial court determined terry was entitled to be reimbursed for his separate property contributions to the marital residence in the amount of.
leslie claims she is entitled to be reimbursed for the labor she provided to improving the first home originally purchased by terry.she contends she provided hours of labor to improving that home,and she should be compensated accordingly.
we are not aware of,and the parties have not cited,any published opinion holding a spouse physical labor on a residence bearing both separate and community property interests is a reimbursable separate property interest.leslie labor was an asset of the community.presumably,any improvements she made to the home while the couple lived there that increased the home value would have been reflected in the home value,and the community was compensated for that labor in the home sale.she is not entitled under the community property law to be reimbursed separately for her work.
leslie asserts that at separation,she and terry owned two horses,four dogs,and a cat.she contends the trial court erred when it refused to order terry to pay half of the cost of maintaining the animals after separation and after judgment.
the trial court,however,determined the animals were leslie separate property.the court did not expressly award the animals to leslie,but it awarded all personal property in leslie possession to leslie as her separate property.animals are considered the personal property of their owners.thus,the court awarded the animals to leslie as her separate property.as a result,terry is not required to pay any costs toward the upkeep of her separate property.
purchase and sale of pickup truck 
prior to separation,terry purchased a used pickup truck with community funds.he later sold the truck for a cash down payment and deposited the amount in a community bank account.he also received a note from the new buyer in the amount of.the court characterized the down payment and the note as community property.it divided the down payment as part of dividing the bank account,and it awarded the note to terry.
leslie contends the court erred.she asserts of community funds was used to purchase the truck.she claims the court valued the old truck at.she argues the court should have ordered terry to reimburse her based on half of the community property funds he used to purchase the truck.we can not tell where she derived her amounts of to purchase the truck or as owed to her.
leslie misunderstands how community property assets are characterized and divided.the court sole concern is the value of community property.how much that community property cost or how that property was used during the marriage is of no concern.the court characterized the truck as community property,and valued it based on its later sale.the court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
in addition,the trial court did not err by awarding the note to terry.the equal division of community property is determined based on the entire community estate,not each individual item.as the court explained to leslie,if the value of community property awarded to terry exceeded that awarded to leslie,the court would order terry to make an equalizing payment.the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the note to terry,as leslie,by receiving the house and other items,still received the greater share of the community estate.
gym membership 
a gym membership was paid for on february,days before the parties separated.leslie contends it was error not to divide the cost between the parties.the cost was never disclosed,but the previous year cost was.she claims terry owes her.
the court did not abuse its discretion in not allocating this expense.it was a community obligation when it was paid,and it was paid with community funds.
moving and storage of terry belongings 
after terry left the residence but did not retrieve his belongings,leslie moved them to the garage.she then paid a mover to move them.she argues terry owes her the full cost of the moving fees,plus a storage fee of for the time she stored his belongings in the garage.
leslie,however,incurred these costs on her own initiative.she did not obtain terry consent to pay to move his belongings.the court did not abuse its discretion by not charging terry for these costs.
allegedly undisclosed bank accounts 
leslie contends terry failed to disclose an account at the butte community bank,in which terry had been depositing disability payments.at trial,however,leslie agreed that the butte community bank account was terry separate property,as it was opened after the couple separated.she has no interest in that account.
loans to children 
the court awarded loans the couple had made to their adult children to leslie.leslie seems to question this award because she considered the loans to be gifts.at trial,however,leslie stipulated to the loans being awarded to her.she can not now complain of that award.
permanent spousal support 
the trial court awarded leslie per month in spousal support.leslie contends the court abused its discretion in ordering this amount.she asserts the court did not consider all of the mandatory support factors family code section required it to consider.she also claims the court erred by not considering the financial burden she incurred by receiving the house,the disparity of income between she and terry,years of alleged abuse,and the fact that part of the marital standard of living included savings.we disagree with her contentions.
the trial court is required to consider the factors contained in family code section,but the ultimate decision rests within the court broad discretion.a trial court exercise of discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless,as a matter of law,an abuse of discretion is shown,where,considering all the relevant circumstances,the court has exceeded the bounds of reason or it can fairly be said that no judge would reasonably make the same order under the same circumstances.citations.in re marriage of smith d,quoting hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,original italics.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its award of spousal support.it considered all of the relevant factors listed in family code section.it also considered the parties financial obligations,their disparity of income,and even the parties habit of saving.the court wrote this is a marriage of long duration and permanent spousal support will be awarded until death or remarriage of the supported party during the life of terry the parties are in their fifties and in good general physical health.considering leslie share of terry pension,which she can draw,permanent spousal support of per month is awarded.this would enable leslie to meet her needs measured by the standard of living established during the marriage.the court takes the expense of financing the residence into account,along with the amount of other assets and obligations in setting support at this level.
the court found the couple standard of living during their years of marriage was modest and frugal.they avoided debt.almost all discretionary funds were used to pay off the home and improve it.some additional funds were placed in savings and retirement accounts.because of the marital standard of living,terry had the ability to pay modest support from his salary to maintain leslie standard of living,taking into acco
