ever since and,the smedley children,left north carolina with their mother,daniela smedley,they have lived with only one of their parents.first,daniela took them to germany,where they stayed with her.later,during a visit to north carolina to see their father,daniela exhusband mark smedley,mark decided to keep them.in each instance,the parent not housing the children first mark and then daniela petitioned under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,a treaty designed to return children wrongfully removed from their habitual residence.
a german court denied mark hague petition,and a german appellate court affirmed,so daniela did not have to return the children to north carolina.after mark decided to keep them following their visit,the district court for the eastern district of north carolina accorded to the german appellate court decision.it therefore granted daniela hague petition,ordering the children return to germany.on appeal,mark argues that the district court erred in according comity.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the goals of the hague convention are to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,hague convention implemented through the enactment of the international child abduction remedies act,et.the convention often comes into play when one parent abducts a child from the child habitual residence to that parent home country in order to gain a favorable custody ruling.though the convention does not empower courts to address the merits of any underlying child custody claims,b,its primary operative provisions,found in articles,and,do allow them to consider abduction challenges.
under article,the removal or retention of a child is wrongful when it breaches a person rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident.hague convention.the hague convention does not define habitual residence.united states federal courts analyze a child habitual residence on a basis,taking into account first,whether the parents share an intent to make a particular country the child home,and second,whether enough time has passed for the child to acclimatize to the residence.see maxwell maxwell,cir.the underlying principle here is that a parent can not create a new habitual residence by wrongfully removing and sequestering a child.miller miller,cir citing diorinou mezitis,cir.
if a removal or retention is found wrongful,article provides that the child must be returned unless certain defenses apply.see hague convention.if a defense applies,return is discretionary.id.the defenses include the following the person who had care of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention,or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention there is a grave risk that return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm and the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.id.against that background,we now turn to the facts before us.
the smedleys married in in germany,where mark was stationed as a member of the united states army.their children,and,were born in and,respectively.except for approximately one year spent in tennessee,the family lived in bamberg,germany,until august,when mark was transferred to north carolina.he bought a house in swansboro and brought the family with him.
at this point,the parties stories diverge.daniela claims that marital tensions,which had surfaced in germany,were exacerbated in swansboro by her homesickness and isolation to such an extent as to lead to discussion of divorce.daniela maintains that she told mark she was returning to germany with the children permanently in may,and he consented.daniela and the children left on july of that year.because daniela had agreed to take four weeks to reconsider her decision,mark bought them tickets with a return date of august.mark told daniela that if she chose to stay in germany,he would try to relocate there to be close to the children.in late july,daniela informed mark via phone of her decision to remain in germany.
mark,on the other hand,denies that he and daniela ever discussed divorce and claims that the trip to germany was to be nothing more than a vacation.in his version,daniela decision to stay in germany came as a complete surprise he learned of it only after the late july phone conversation,about two weeks after she had already left north carolina.she had not told him of her intent in may,and he had not consented to a permanent move.
on september,mark obtained a temporary custody order from the district court of onslow county,where swansboro is located.in october,he filed a hague petition in germany seeking the children return.
the district court of bamberg denied mark hague petition.it based the denial in part on the findings of a family advocate.the court credited the advocate allegations that mark had physically abused and found that returning the children to north carolina would expose them to a serious risk of harm,one of the article defenses.
mark appealed the district court of bamberg decision to the bamberg higher regional court.there,daniela,the family advocate,and a representative from the office of children protection services of bamberg testified in person.mark,who was unable to attend because his passport was expired,testified through his lawyer.the court agreed with daniela that mark had consented to the move to germany,finding her testimony more credible than mark.as consent is another of the article defenses,the court held that daniela need not return the children without determining whether north carolina or germany was their habitual residence.
mark and daniela obtained a divorce under german law in may,and the children lived with daniela in bamberg until august.daniela agreed in june to let the children visit mark because they wanted a vacation and had not seen their father in two years.on august,mark picked the children up at ramstein air base in germany.he gave daniela a notarized document stating that he would return the children on or about august,with the exact date to depend on the availability of military flights.
expressing concerns over their dental care and schooling,mark kept the children in north carolina and informed daniela of his decision via facebook on august.he enrolled the children in the onslow county school system.
daniela filed a hague petition in the district court on april.in a comprehensive opinion,the district court,ruling that the bamberg higher regional court finding on consent was not wholly unsupported,accorded comity to that decision.
first,the district court concluded that the german court failure to determine the children habitual residence was not fundamentally unreasonable because the decision rested on what is akin to an affirmative defense in article a mark consent to the move.second,the district court reasoned that,based on the german court credibility determinations,the testimony supported the contention that mark had agreed to the trip with the knowledge that daniela and the children might not return.that the german court did not credit mark version of the story does not render its article a determination fundamentally unreasonable.third,the district court rejected mark argument that,because he did not formally manifest his,he did not consent to daniela decision,by noting that c onsent may be evinced by the parent statements or conduct,which can be rather informal.second alteration in original quoting nicolson pappalardo,cir.
having found that daniela did not wrongfully remove the children to germany and reasoning that they had acclimatized to life in germany between july and august,the district court found that germany was the children habitual residence at the time of their visit to north carolina because mark did not assert
