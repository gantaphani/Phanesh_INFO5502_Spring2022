july,review hearing 
at the first review hearing,held on july,the juvenile court ordered a second psychological evaluation and continued reunification services 
doctors elizabeth reichert and tylene cammack barry from uc davis medical center performed a psychological evaluation of mother in september and october,and generated their report on january.in preparing the evaluation,the doctors reviewed records including the disposition and status reports,vmrc evaluation records,the records from the parenting program,the visitation reports,and the assessment from another way.they also interviewed the agency social worker,the vmrc case manager,two people who provided mother with independent living supportive services,mother former therapist,and the minor head start and special education teachers.they also observed interaction between mother and the minor.
the uc davis doctors concluded that mother cognitive deficits,limited support system,and mental health issues including posttraumatic stress disorder and history of depression significantly impaired her functioning to the extent that she could not safely and adequately parent the minor.mother inflexible thinking and limited insight made it difficult for her to understand how her behaviors impacted the minor and impacted her ability to accurately identify the minor needs.these limitations were especially concerning considering the minor own delays and the high level of structure,support,and attention he required.although mother had completed her therapy and parenting classes,she was still unable to implement the strategies she had learned or identify areas of weakness in her ability to manage the minor behaviors.her limited awareness into her mental health issues impaired her ability to identify and respond to the minor needs,placing him at risk of neglect.the doctors opined that mother was not able to safely and adequately care for the minor but made recommendations for services to assist mother in increasing her overall functioning.

no evidence was presented at the hearing that challenged,much less contradicted,cammack barry expert testimony.the agency asked the court to terminate mother services,arguing that there was not a substantial probability that the minor could be safely returned to mother within months of the date of detention minor counsel agreed.
