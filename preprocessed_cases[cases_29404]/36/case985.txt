defendant guadalupe llanes appeals from an order denying his motion to set aside a judgment of paternity as untimely.he contends his motion was timely.alternatively,he argues plaintiff county of sacramento county should be estopped from asserting the motion is untimely because the california department of child support services cdcss posted letters on its website stating that previously established fathers,such as defendant,had until december,to file a motion to set aside a judgment of paternity,and he relied on those letters in filing his motion on december.defendant also seeks to challenge a finding by the child support commissioner that he was estopped from obtaining the relief he requests 
as we shall explain,the only issue that is properly before us is whether the trial court erred in determining defendant motion to aside a judgment of paternity was untimely.finding no error,we shall affirm the trial court order.
factual and procedural background 
in september,a default judgment was entered against defendant,naming him the legal father of the child.that judgment was confirmed in march.
on september,the legislature enacted article of chapter of the uniform parentage act assem.bill reg.sess,which sets forth procedures for challenging a judgment of paternity based on the results of genetic testing.stats,ch,et among other things,it allows any previously established father who is the legal father as a result of default judgment as of the effective date of section,to bring a motion to set aside or vacate a judgment establishing paternity within a period commencing with the enactment of section,subd.a.section took effect on january.stats,ch,cal,art.iv,subd.c.
on december,defendant filed a motion to set aside the judgment of paternity and requested the court order genetic testing.
the motion was heard by a commissioner at the hearing,defendant submitted a december,letter from cdcss to all directors,county administrators,and boards of supervisors,which was posted on cdcss public website.in that letter,cdcss stated,among other things,that a motion to set aside or vacate a judgment establishing paternity must be filed w ithin a period commencing on january,in the case of any previously established father who is the legal father as a result of a default judgment issued on or before january.defendant claimed he relied on the letter in filing his motion on december.
the commissioner found the motion was untimely because it was not filed within two years of september,enactment date.the commissioner also found defendant claim that cdcss december,letter induc ed him to believe that he had until to file the motion was not persuasive because the letter was addressed to local child support agencies,not the general public.finally,the commissioner concluded that defendant was estopped from obtaining the relief he requests because he was afforded a full and complete opportunity to participate in the earlier paternity proceedings,noting that blood tests were ordered,and the mother and child provided samples,but defendant did not.accordingly,the commissioner recommended defendant motion to set aside the judgment of paternity be denied.
on february,defendant filed a notice of objection to the commissioner findings and recommended order.he claimed the commissioner erred in concluding the term enactment as used in section,subdivision a,means the date the statute was enacted.he argued the word enactment as applied in this context is susceptible to a number of meanings referring to the statute legislative history,he argued the legislature intended the period to run from the statute effective date,january.citing to letters posted on cdcss official website,he also noted that cdcss interpreted the period as beginning to run on january,and directed local child support agencies not to oppose as untimely motions filed within two years of that date.he further argued that interpreting the period as commencing on the statute effective date was necessary to make the statute internally consistent.he reasoned that the law refers to persons who are established as parents as of the effective date of the section by default,and gives them a period in which to bring a motion however,should a person be established as a parent through a default judgment taken late in december,prior to the effective date of the section,they would not have the full period within which to move to set aside the default.finally,he urged that the commissioner finding that he was estopped from obtaining the relief he requests was beyond the scope of the hearing and the statute.
on february,the trial court issued a temporary order affirming the commissioner recommended order and set a hearing de novo.defendant filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support of his motion.the arguments set forth in the memorandum were substantially similar to those made in defendant objections to the commissioner findings and recommended order.
following the hearing de novo,on may,the trial court found defendant motion was timely,explaining that various problems arise if the period is interpreted as beginning to run on september,date the statute was enacted.first,the court noted that cdcss construed the period as commencing on january.second,it observed that if the enactment date is used,a previously established father has less than two years to challenge the judgment of paternity since the period would begin to run before the statute became effective.third,it found selecting the enactment date had a hollow ring to it since section was not passed as emergency legislation,which would have made it effective immediately.
on june,however,the trial court reconsidered its order,vacated it,and denied defendant motion to set aside the judgment of paternity as untimely.in doing so,the court relied on county of fresno sanchez th,d,which it interpreted as requiring a motion to set aside a judgment of paternity under subdivision a of section to be filed by september.the court also stated that i f either party wishes to set the matter for argument,they may do so by agreement or motion filed within days.
following a hearing on july,the trial court confirmed its june,order,noting confusion in sanchez construction needs to be addressed by the court of appeal.
defendant timely appeals from the court june,order,which was confirmed on july.
on july,while this case was pending on appeal,the legislature enacted senate bill sb,which amends section,subdivision a to provide that the period in which to bring a motion to set aside or vacate a judgment of paternity commences on january,bill reg.sess.the bill also added subdivision c,which states reconsideration of a motion brought under paragraph of subdivision a may be requested and granted if the following requirements are met the motion was filed with the court between september,and december,inclusive.the motion was denied solely on the basis that it was untimely.the request for reconsideration of the motion is filed on or before december.ibid.the amended version becomes effective january.cal,art.iv,subd.c.
following the enactment of sb,we requested the parties provide supplemental letter briefs addressing what effect,if any,the bill passage had on this appeal.defendant responded that while the bill may moot the timeliness issue of this appeal once it takes effect,he argued his motion was also denied on the ground of estoppel.original italics.the county agreed that t he issue of the timeliness of defendant appeal will be moot as all of the reconsideration requirements of sb will have been met.sb does not take effect until january,thus,while it appears defendant will be able to move for reconsideration at that time,that does not preclude him from challenging the trial court ruling,which was based on the current version of the statute.as we shall explain,the commissioner finding that defendant is estopped from obtaining the relief he requests was completely nullified by the trial court order and is not properly before us.
