kimberly appeals from an order terminating her parental rights to her infant daughter,athena p.she contends 
the petition failed to state a cause of action,or,alternatively,the jurisdictional allegations of the petition were not supported by substantial evidence.
the juvenile court denial of reunification services,based on its finding that they would be detrimental,was not supported by substantial evidence.
the juvenile court erred by finding that the sibling relationship exception to termination of parental rights did not apply.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold,as a threshold matter,that kimberly can still raise her contentions regarding the jurisdictional allegations of the petition in this appeal from the order terminating parental rights.we will further hold,however,that,if the petition failed to state a cause of action,the error is harmless at this point and that there was substantial evidence to support jurisdiction.
in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we find no other prejudicial error.hence,we will affirm.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the dependency proceedings regarding athena older 
kimberly has six children by her husband,antonio s.as of,kimberly was living with her boyfriend,thomas four of her six children were living with them the other two were living with kimberly parents,their maternal grandparents,michael and diana 
on september,thomas and kimberly were arrested.all six children were detained.on september,the department of public social services the department filed a juvenile dependency petition regarding them.as subsequently amended,it alleged 
failure to protect welf,subd.b,in that 
on september,while the children were in kimberly care,toxic chemicals and other items consistent with methamphetamine manufacturing had been found in a detached garage at the home

abuse of a sibling welf,subd.j solely as to the two children already living with their that the other children had been neglected,as defined in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b.
eventually,kimberly was convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine and felony child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison.her expected release date was may.thomas was likewise convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine and felony child endangerment and sentenced to six years in prison.he expected to become eligible for parole in.
on december,the juvenile court sustained the petition.it formally removed all six children from kimberly custody they were placed with the maternal grandparents.it ordered reunification services for kimberly.
b.the dependency proceedings regarding athena 
when kimberly was arrested,she was pregnant with a seventh child,this one by thomas.while in prison,she gave birth to athena.she sent athena to live with the grandparents.she attempted to create some kind of formal custody a temporary legal signing certain unspecified documents these documents,however,were never filed.
because athena siblings were dependents,and because there we re no c ourt issued documents authorizing athena current placement,the department decided to file a juvenile dependency petition as to athena.on march,athena was detained but placed with the grandparents.on march,the department filed a petition as to athena under the same case number as her siblings.as subsequently amended,it alleged 
failure to protect welf,subd.b,in that thomas had an extensive criminal history and was serving a prison sentence,leaving athena without care,support,or protection and 
failure to provide for support welf,subd.g,in that 
kimberly was incarcerated,her release date was unknown,and she was unable to provide athena with care and support and 
thomas was incarcerated,his release date was unknown,and he was unable to provide athena with care and support and 
abuse of a sibling welf,subd.j,in that a petition alleging that the other six children had been neglected,as defined in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,had been found to be true.
on june,at a contested jurisdictional hearing,the juvenile court sustained the allegations of the petition.
on august,at a contested dispositional hearing,the juvenile court formally removed athena from her parents custody.finding that reunification services would be detrimental to athena,it ordered that they not be provided.it set a hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section section hearing.
kimberly did not personally attend the dispositional hearing.the clerk was therefore required to give her mailed notice of the requirement of filing a petition for extraordinary writ review.welf,subd.l a cal.rules of court,rules e,d.the clerk failed to do so.
in november,the social worker reported that the grandparents wanted to adopt athena.they were also considering either adopting or becoming the legal guardians of the other six children.
on february,at a contested section hearing,the juvenile court found that athena was adoptable.it further found that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to her.it therefore terminated parental rights.
failure to state a cause of action 
kimberly contends the petition failed to state a cause of action,or,alternatively,the juvenile court jurisdictional finding was not supported by substantial evidence.essentially,she argues she did not fail to support athena within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision g because she provided for athena support by leaving her with the grandparents.she also contends her attorney failure to challenge the petition on this ground constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
appealability 
preliminarily,the department argues that kimberly can not challenge the jurisdictional findings in this appeal from the order terminating parental rights.
generally speaking,under the one final judgment rule,interlocutory or interim orders are not appealable,but are only reviewable on appeal from the final judgment.citations.in re matthew cal th,d,quoting rao campo d.code of civil procedure section,which applies in dependency cases citation,states upon an appeal from a final judgment or a postjudgment order,the reviewing court may review the verdict or decision and any intermediate ruling,proceeding,order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party italics added.in re brittany th,d.if an order is appealable,however,and no timely appeal is taken therefrom,the issues determined by the order are res judicata.citation.in re matthew,supra,at,d.
the first appealable order in the dependency process is the dispositional order.citation.in re daniel th,d,quoting in re benjamin th,d.the jurisdictional order is interlocutory and not appealable.hence,under these general rules,any challenge to the jurisdictional findings would have to be raised in an appeal from the dispositional order.in re sheila th,d in re tracy d.failure to appeal from an appealable dispositional order waives any substantive challenge to the jurisdictional findings.in re megan d,d.it might even waive any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising out of the jurisdictional hearing.compare in re th,d with in re meranda th,d.
here,however,at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court did not merely remove athena from kimberly custody it also denied reunification services and set a section hearing.when the referral order is made at the dispositional hearing,the traditional rule favoring the appealability of dispositional orders yields to the statutory mandate for expedited review.anthony superior court th,d.the dispositional order therefore was not appealable.it could be
