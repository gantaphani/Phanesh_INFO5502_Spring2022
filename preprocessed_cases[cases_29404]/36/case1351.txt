there was substantial evidence to support the juvenile court rulings that anthony did all he could reasonably do under the circumstances to demonstrate his commitment to andrew while the case was still at the family reunification phase,and his due process rights were thwarted by the dilatory behavior of the department caseworker.adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey in re julia th,d julia.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm.
procedural history and facts 
the juvenile court judge,emily stevens,was faced with conflicting evidence over whether anthony had once visited andrew earlier than he admitted knowing that the child existed.
proceedings and reports before anthony was named as a possible father 
according to the juvenile dependency petition and detention report,andrew mother,esmeralda,has a history of drug abuse.when andrew was born in may,both he and esmeralda tested positive for amphetamine.andrew half brother,was already in foster care as a dependent child of the court.andrew was immediately taken into protective custody and placed in the same foster home as esmeralda told the department caseworker that andrew father was a man named martin martin.she did not know martin address or whereabouts,and said he wanted a paternity test.
at the may,detention hearing,esmeralda again identified martin as the father.
the department report for the may,jurisdiction hearing was written by caseworker robert davis.esmeralda had told davis that martin wanted a dna test because there was a possibility he was not andrew biological father.
andrew was declared a dependent of the court at the may,proceedings.family reunification services and suitable placement with were ordered.one month later,the court found due diligence as to martin,whose whereabouts were unknown.
according to a january,report by davis,esmeralda still named martin as the alleged father while saying that he might not be the biological father.the birth certificate did not specify a father,but gave martin last name to andrew.davis report derived information regarding parental visits from reports by laura,a foster agency caseworker,which were attached to davis report.later in the proceedings,attention focused on a statement in report of november,that esmeralda and the possible father had visited andrew on an unspecified date,and a statement in report of august,that esmeralda and the maternal grandmother visited andrew on august.
at the january,review hearing,esmeralda complained that davis,the department caseworker,had not been returning her calls.judge stevens verified from the dates in davis report that he had not attempted to contact esmeralda in over six months.finding that the department had not provided esmeralda with reasonable services,the judge refused to terminate family reunification services,and continued the proceedings to may.
proceedings and reports once anthony appeared at court 
esmeralda and anthony arrived at court together on may,requesting that anthony receive dna testing.esmeralda told judge stevens that either martin or anthony might be andrew biological father anthony said he first learned from esmeralda a bout probably two months ago that he might be the father,and had talked to the worker about three weeks ago.the court signed an order for dna testing and ordered the department to assist anthony.andrew and had been transferred to the foster home of carmine and steven as a potential adoptive placement.the department requested a continuance,as davis had just returned from medical leave,and no report was available.the court demanded a report for the next scheduled hearing,june.
according to davis report for the june,permanency hearing,subd.f,esmeralda was homeless,seven months pregnant,and still using drugs.she now said that anthony rather than martin might be andrew father.anthony had not yet had the dna test.he had a criminal record,which included a prison sentence in for second degree burglary and a parole violation in for receiving stolen property.
attached to davis report was a february,foster agency report by,which indicated that the alleged father visited once during the previous quarter but never called or visited again.another attached document was a february,developmental evaluation by an organization called ties for adoption.it included a statement by the former foster mother,yolanda,that andrew biological parents had visited him three months earlier which would be november,and the child looked like his biological father.
at the june,hearing,counsel was appointed for anthony.he repeated his desire to take responsibility for andrew if he was the father,and complained about a continuing lack of cooperation from davis in providing the necessary paperwork for the dna test.andrew counsel said she had twice spoken to davis and had been unable to get him to act.judge stevens threatened to sanction the department if the testing was not done by the end of the month.since esmeralda had not complied with the case plan,family reunification services were terminated.anthony was instructed that,if testing showed he was the biological father,he could file a petition for modification under section.
the blood test results were available at a hearing on august.they proved that anthony was andrew biological father.a contested hearing to terminate esmeralda parental rights as to was scheduled for september.esmeralda and anthony were told that parental rights to andrew might be terminated at the section hearing which was scheduled for him on october.anthony requested visitation and full custody.andrew counsel opposed visitation because anthony had just appeared,and andrew was in a prospective adoptive home with judge stevens responded that it was the department that had caused the delay.she ordered an evaluation of anthony home,told his counsel to quickly file a section petition for modification,and denied visitation pending a decision on the petition.
proceedings on the section petitions 
anthony first section petition was filed on september.based upon the new evidence of the paternity test,he requested reunification services,unmonitored visitation,a release of andrew to him,and a finding that he was the presumed father.
in an attached letter to the petition,anthony explained that in december,he happened to see esmeralda at a mcdonald restaurant.he had not seen her and had had no way to contact her for one and or almost two years.she told him she had given birth to a son,and he might be the father.at his request,she telephoned him within a couple of days,and he saw andrew.he then made repeated calls to the caseworker to try to arrange a dna test.the caseworker failed to set up the test and stopped answering messages that were left on his machine.after two months,anthony finally got the court date from a different social worker.he went to court and spoke to the judge,but still could not get cooperation from the caseworker.he told the judge about the problems on the next court date.one hour later,the social worker contacted him four days later,the test was performed 
davis report for the october,hearing recognized that the dna test results proved that anthony was andrew biological father.esmeralda had given birth to another baby boy in august and had continuing drug problems.andrew had lived in the foster adoptive home of carmine and steven since march,was thriving there,and was bonded to carmine and steven and to his brother,b.the report described carmine and steven as two professionals in their who have been in a committed relationship for over years and live in a home.davis recommended termination of the biological parents parental rights and adoption as andrew permanent plan.
at the october,proceedings,judge stevens considered anthony section petition before considering termination of parental rights.anthony told the court that he wanted full custody.he was employed and currently supported two other children,ages seven and three,who lived with their mother.he picked them up on saturday night and dropped them off on sunday night.anthony mother,who was present,joined in his request,as did esmeralda.andrew and the department opposed anthony petition.
after discussing the competing interests in detail,judge stevens found that anthony was the biological father but not the presumed father.she denied the section petition because it was not in andrew best interest to remove him from the adoptive home and the with whom he had lived since birth.the section proceedings were rescheduled for november.
two days later,judge stevens brought the parties back to court,out of concerns with the fairness of her ruling.dates,she noted that the hearing to determine a permanent plan for andrew pursuant to section,subdivision f had occurred in may.andrew and were placed with the prospective adoptive parents on march.andrew counsel told the judge that anthony had telephoned her on april or april to ask for the date of the next court hearing.
judge stevens believed that anthony had been truthful,had no way to get in touch with esmeralda for a long period of time,had attempted to establish paternity once he heard about andrew,and had his efforts thwarted by the department inaction,while the case was still in the family reunification phase.anthony was therefore instructed to file another section petition,which would be considered before parental rights were terminated.the presence of the department caseworker was requested for the next hearing.
anthony second section petition was filed on october.he alleged that the modification was in andrew best interest,because of his strong desire to integrate andrew into his family and provide for his future needs.he requested reunification services,unmonitored visitation,a release of andrew to him,and a declaration that he was the presumed father.
further details were provided in a declaration from anthony under penalty of perjury,which was attached to the second section petition.he described the chance meeting with esmeralda at a mcdonald restaurant in december seeing andrew for the first time at a burger king restaurant in the first week of january and making repeated unsuccessful efforts thereafter to get cooperation from the department on paternity testing 
at the november,proceedings on the second section petition,counsel were present for esmeralda,anthony,andrew,the department,and carmine and steven,who were in the process of adopting,and sought permission to appear as de facto parents.the department log records from december to october did not mention any contacts with anthony.davis was off on medical leave,and the social worker from the department who came to court had no knowledge of the facts.judge stevens therefore found true the facts in anthony declaration.
andrew counsel expressed concern that anthony said he learned about andrew in december,but there was documentary evidence that the biological father had visited andrew prior to that date.the judge questioned anthony,who said that he first visited andrew at the end of december or the beginning of january.esmeralda told the judge that she once took anthony,not martin,to visit andrew.she did not recall the month,but it was when andrew was barely born.both esmeralda and anthony recalled that the visit was at a burger king restaurant in the presence of the previous foster parent,yolanda 
judge stevens requested briefing from all counsel and continued the case to december.carmine and steven were granted de facto parent status.they agreed to work with anthony on monitored visits with andrew.the department was asked to investigate anthony background.
the department report for the pending proceedings on december,was written by a different caseworker,amy lambert.in a change of position,the department now recommended that anthony be offered family reunification services.his visits with andrew had been appropriate.investigation verified that he had a good relationship with his two other children and regularly paid child support to their mother.he was employed,lived by himself,and had arrangements for his mother to provide babysitting if he obtained custody of andrew.
briefs in opposition to anthony petition were filed by carmine and steven and by andrew.they included a new statement,dated december,from the foster agency worker.said that on august,the former foster parent,yolanda,monitored a scheduled visit between esmeralda and andrew.esmeralda brought with her a man who m she identified as andrew father.contacted the department caseworker,davis,and told him the alleged father had attended this visit.
carmine and steven also attached a new declaration,dated december,from yolanda a.she stated that she was present when anthony and esmeralda visited andrew at a burger king restaurant on an unspecified date in august.
andrew written opposition to anthony petition requested an evidentiary hearing on anthony efforts to assert his parental status,based on december,statement about an august,visit.
at the december,proceedings,anthony and esmeralda were present with counsel,along with carmine and steven,their counsel,and counsel for andrew,and the department.judge stevens indicated that,before they went on the record,the parties had gone through the files and discussed the various factual discrepancies.anthony had stated off the record that his first contact with the caseworker was in december or january it might have been october or earlier than november when he first visited andrew,but he did not think so.his relationship with esmeralda was just casual.esmeralda counsel told the judge that esmeralda had repeatedly told her she had no idea how to get in touch with anthony before they happened to meet at the mcdonald restaurant.
judge stevens found that was mistaken when she said in her december statement that anthony visited andrew on august,because more contemporaneous report of august,stated that the august,visit was by esmeralda and the maternal grandmother.the judge recognized the conflict between anthony current statement that he found out about andrew in december and his statement at the may,proceedings that he first learned about andrew two months previously.the judge was unhappy with the vagueness of the facts,including inaccuracies in the reports and anthony lack of a good recollection of time.
in the middle of the extensive arguments,andrew counsel requested a continuance to bring in and have a full evidentiary hearing.judge stevens denied the request on the grounds that testimony by would not resolve the discrepancies anthony statements would not change if he were put under oath and the parties had agreed when they went through the case file at the prehearing conference that nothing more needed to be done to develop the record.none of the other counsel thought a continuance was necessary.
judge stevens then ruled that anthony had difficulty with time,but was not lying.somebody was mistaken about the august visit.the important thing was that,beginning at least in january,anthony had made repeated efforts to contact the caseworker.he had not known about the hearing in january,and had even called andrew counsel for help.he came to the first court hearing for which he had a date,and got the dna test as soon as the department made the necessary referral.most importantly,the department ignored anthony while the case was still in the reunification phase.anthony had done what he was supposed to do and had been prevented by the department from assuming the role of a parent.therefore,the section petition and request to start reunification services were granted.
at proceedings on january,mediation was set up to combine the plans for transition which had been prepared by the department and by carmine and steven.the court was overwhelmed with the effort of anthony,carmine and steven to act in andrew best interest on visitation.it refused to stay implementation of the plan while an appeal was in progress.
carmine and steven filed a petition for writ of supersedeas in which andrew joined.on march,this court stayed the portion of the juvenile court previous orders that provided for the final transition of andrew to anthony home,and denied the petition in all other respects.
discussion 
at the hearing on the second section petition,judge stevens was presented with a factual morass regarding whether anthony visited andrew sooner than december,when he said he reestablished contact with esmeralda and learned of andrew existence the record and case law support the judge determinations that anthony had a poor memory for dates but was not lying,and his strenuous efforts to determine paternity beginning in january justified granting his petition,as he had demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities while the case was still at the reunification stage.
section,subdivision a allows a parent to petition to change or modify a previous order upon grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence.the petition must allege why the requested change is in the best interest of the dependent child,subd.b.t he burden of proof is on the moving party to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is new evidence or that there are changed circumstances that make a change of placement in the best interests of the child.in re stephanie cal th,d.the petition is addressed to the sound discretion of the juvenile court and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.in re jasmon cal th,d,in re stephanie,supra,at,d.
sections and require that if a child may not safely be returned to the child parents within a maximum of months from removal from the parents care,the trial court must terminate reunification efforts and set a section hearing.julia,supra,th,d.
u p until the time the section hearing is set,the parent interest in reunification is given precedence over a child need for stability and permanency.in re zacharia cal th,d,zacharia,quoting in re marilyn cal th,d,julia,supra,th,d.
a biological father is not entitled to custody under section,or reunification services under section if he does not attain presumed father status prior to the termination of any reunification period,but he may move under section for a hearing to reconsider the juvenile court earlier rulings based on new evidence or changed circumstances.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
only a presumed father,not one who is merely a natural father,is entitled to reunification services.julia,supra,th at,d zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
a natural father can become a presumed father if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.however,it may be impossible for him to do so,such as where the mother prevents it,or the county department of social services has taken custody of the child.in re jerry th,d see also kelsey,supra,cal th,d.therefore,the statutory distinction between natural fathers and unwed fathers violates the federal constitutional right to due process if it is applied to an unwed father who made a sufficient,timely,and full commitment to his parental responsibilities,absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.zacharia,supra,at,d,kelsey,supra,at,d.
if an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental,financial,and federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.the focus is on whether the natural father has done all that he could reasonably do under the circumstances to demonstrate his commitment to the child.kelsey,supra,at,d,julia,supra,th at,d.
the correctness of the trial court rulings here is demonstrated by comparing anthony actions to those of the biological fathers in zacharia,supra,cal th at page,d,and julia,supra,th at pages,d.
zacharia found insufficient efforts by the biological father on these facts the mother,wendy,lived with a man named lee before and after the baby was born.wendy initially identified lee as the father.however,nine months before the baby birth,she had at least a dozen acts of sexual intercourse over a period with her high school sweetheart,javan.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.javan knew where wendy was at all times and had no reason to think their relationship had not resulted in a pregnancy.he learned of the baby existence and his possible paternity when wendy left lee and came to live with him.he came forward about four months later to request a paternity hearing,so that wendy would not lose her baby at the review hearing.he was incarcerated for a probation violation about a month later,made no further parenting efforts,and would be unable for six months to have even a trial visit with the child.id.at,d.the zacharia court concluded that the facts did not entitle javan either to custody or to reunification services.id.at,d.
in julia,division six of this court found sufficient efforts by the biological father on these facts the mother,trisha,identified a man named jose as the baby father.after a paternity test ruled him out,she named two other possible fathers,rueben and ramon.ramon was the only one of the three who did not deny paternity.he had had little reason to think he was the father,as trisha was promiscuous,they had only two acts of sexual intercourse during a casual relationship,and she had identified jose as the father.ramon was living out of state,and first contacted the caseworker a few weeks after the worker tried to reach him at his mother house.from the first contact,he expressed a desire to have a relationship with the baby,if a paternity test showed he was the biological father.julia,supra,th at,d.he came to court and told the same thing to the judge.the court ordered a paternity test,but terminated reunification services before the testing occurred,and later terminated ramon parental rights.three or four months had passed between ramon request for the test and the actual test,due to an unreasonable delay by the social service department.id.at,d.the julia court reversed,as the denial of reunification services to ramon contravened the statutory dependency scheme and denied ramon his federal constitutional rights to due process and to parent his child.id.at,d.
the facts here are more like julia than zacharia,as they involved timely,repeated efforts to establish paternity,which were thwarted by the social worker.as the trial court found,anthony came forward in a timely manner during the reunification stage,and did all that he could reasonably do under the circumstances to demonstrate his commitment to andrew.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.although anthony was inconsistent about dates,he established that there was no response to his repeated calls and visits to the department office,apparently because the caseworker was having medical problems.
carmine and steven maintain that anthony can not qualify as a kelsey father because there was no evidence he was thwarted by the mother in his attempts to establish a relationship with the child.they ignore anthony statement,which the trial court believed,that he had no way to contact esmeralda after their relationship ended.if he could not contact the mother,he could not establish a relationship with the child.that is a major factual distinction between this case and zacharia,supra,cal th at page,d,where the biological father knew where the mother lived following their sexual relationship.
there are other important bases for distinguishing this case from zacharia d.the biological father there lived with the biological mother,and his articulated basis for coming forward was to prevent the biological mother impending loss of parental rights.he had a drug problem,was incarcerated for drug use,would not be able to even visit the child for six months,and had only vague plans of how he would care for him.zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.here,in contrast,the department investigation showed that anthony was steadily employed,had appropriate visits with andrew,was a good father
