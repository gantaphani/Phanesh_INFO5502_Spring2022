jesse father,a parent of three children made dependents of the juvenile court in proceedings initiated in december of,appeals from a order of january,denying his motion for modification welf,all unspecified section references are to that code,appointing his parents guardians of the children,and vacating the dependencies.he claims no substantive error in any aspect of the order itself but claims it is void because of a procedural error committed months earlier,when a referee dispositional order on a supplemental petition removed the children from the home of their mother,jacque mother,without being countersigned by a juvenile court judge as required by section.we will reject his challenge.
background 
petitions for jessie age four,jacob age two and jasmine age months were filed by the contra costa county social service department department first on december.father and mother had lived together for years with the two older children in the home of the paternal grandparents,gary and melanie father had moved out in february,months before the petitions were filed,and the youngest child,jasmine,was born in april with positive toxics screens for methamphetamine and amphetamine.each petition alleged as failure to provide,subd.b the toxics screens b,and that mother had been offered a voluntary family maintenance case plan but failed it b by having dirty tests and being expelled from a drug treatment program for nonattendance.she was now in a residential program,and the children were faring well in the care of the grandparents.father visited them at the grandparents home and used the home for mail and messages,but did not live there.
both parents appeared with counsel,and on january,mother admitted the petitions as amended to delete elaboration on her plan failures.at a dispositional hearing before referee bruce stirling on february,the children were adjudged dependents and ordered to remain in mother,the grandparents home,with visits for father.father voiced interest in having custody should foster care become necessary but had no job or stable residence at that time.
mother did poorly in her residential program and left it without permission on may,leaving behind jasmine,who had evidently come to live with her there.mother disappeared for a time.supplemental petitions for each child hereafter referenced in the singular filed on may alleged an ineffective prior disposition.the children were detained the next day but placed with the paternal grandparents,where they had been before.mother and father each appeared for the detention hearing.
on june,the supplemental petition was sustained by referee stirling on mother admissions to having left and been discharged from a residential program,having left jasmine in the care of another resident,and having patch tests positive for methamphetamine.it appears that mother had not returned to the grandparents home but lived for a time with a sister in vallejo and then with her own mother.she contemplated entering another residential drug program.father had no known address.he visited the children but otherwise had made little progress on his reunification plan.
at a dispositional hearing on june,referee stirling continued the dependencies,made removal findings by clear and convincing evidence,subd.c,placed care of the children under department supervision,and set a review hearing.the parents were advised of their rights to seek rehearing,but neither one did.the dispositional order was signed by the referee but not countersigned by a juvenile court judge a failure that undergirds all of father arguments on this appeal.neither parent appealed from that order.
by the time of a review as initially set for january,mother had relapsed repeatedly,and father had made little progress,amid reports that he,too,was abusing drugs.the department recommended terminating services for both parents as to the two younger children,jacob and jasmine,setting a hearing selection and implementation for them,and continuing services for both parents only as to jesse.then in february,responding to late progress made by father,the department changed its recommendation to extending services for him as to the younger children.by an order of february,judge lois haight adopted the full recommendations ending services only for mother as to the younger children and set a month review.no appeal was taken.
by the month review,the recommendation was to terminate all services and set a hearing for all three children.father progress had stalled,and it surfaced that he had been arrested in for possessing methamphetamine and a ninja star,and had been convicted and placed on probation.mother was in jail for a drug offense.the children were thriving in the grandparents care,and the grandmother had been ruled a de facto parent.neither parent appeared personally at the review hearing held on july before judge haight.father whereabouts were unknown to his counsel.the court denied counsel requests for a continuance and family maintenance for father.it then followed the recommendations and set a hearing.each parent filed a defective petition for writ review of that order cal.rules of court hereafter cited by rule only,rule b,raising any issue about lack of countersigning on the june dispositional order,and this court dismissed their petitions in an unpublished opinion.
father thereafter filed a modification motion,seeking further services or family maintenance,and the matter was heard and denied at the hearing of january,before judge haight.father favored foster care and was the only party not supporting the department report recommendations for guardianship with the,vacation of the dependencies,and dismissal of the petitions.the judge followed those recommendations,also issuing letters of guardianship,and father appeals from the hearing order.
discussion 
section states,no order of a referee removing a minor from his home shall become effective until expressly approved by a judge of the juvenile court.father urges that the june dispositional order on the supplemental petition which was made by a referee,removed the children from a parent home and was not countersigned to show approval by a juvenile court judge never became effective,was void,and rendered all later orders void as well,including the hearing order from which he appeals.
the department claims father lacks standing see generally in re caitlin th,d in re jasmine th,d,because he raises no substantive arguments against the appealed from order and was not entitled to a removal order back in june since he had not lived with the children for months prior to the disposition months before the original petitions in re angelica d.in re katrina d,that is,since the removal was from mother home,not his own.alternatively,we are urged that father waived any right to challenge the removal by not appealing from the dispositional order years ago,in june,and can not attack it on this appeal of the january order.we conclude that waiver applies and,thus,do not reach the question of father standing.either argument,if successful,would require a dismissal of the appeal.in re charmice th,d waiver in re carissa th,d standing.
the waiver rule as applied in dependency cases flows from section,under which the dispositional order is an appealable judgment,and all subsequent orders are directly appealable without limitation except for post orders setting a hearing,which are subject to writ review rule b and related limitations,subd.l.a consequence of section is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.in re meranda th,d in re janee th,d.in other words,a challenge to the most recent order entered in a dependency matter may not challenge prior orders for which the statutory time for filing an appeal has passed.steve superior court th,d.the rule serves vital policy considerations of promoting finality and reasonable expedition,in a carefully balanced legislative scheme,and preventing sabotage of the process through a parent attacks on earlier orders.in re janee,supra,at,d.
father attempts just such a sabotage.he could have appealed the dispositional order of june the six month review order of february,but did not.he did seek writ review of the month review order of july,which included a setting order made reviewable by rule b,but did not attempt,even at that late stage,to attack the lack of countersigning of the dispositional order.he makes that argument for the first time now,on an appeal from a january order establishing grandparent guardianship and dismissing the dependencies.clearly,with three appealable prior orders in his wake,he can not be allowed to sabotage the process now and,as he requests,return the case to a fictional state where the children were never removed from a parent custody.
father offers this answer to the waiver problem because the june disposition order was never countersigned so as to become effective,it was void and subject to attack anytime,on any subsequent appeal,and invalidates all later orders in the dependency,including the one from which he now appeals.he cites no authority directly on point but relies on in re heather d.heather,where on a mother appeal from permanency planning orders,the court of appeal held dispositional orders issued by a temporary judge months earlier null and void for failure to stipulate in writing mother had stipulated orally to his authority to act,at,relying on cal,art.vi,and rule.the court reversed the latest orders,reasoning.the voiding of the orders made by the temporary judge also affects the subsequent orders contingent upon continuing the minor as a dependent child of the court,including the orders appealed from.all subsequent proceedings were dependent for their validity upon the validity of the order adjudging the minor a dependent child of the court since there would have been no dependent status to continue absent the previous adjudication.id.at.
we find that reasoning flawed.first,heather was expressly disapproved in its premise that the requirement is jurisdictional the supreme court has since held that the requirement,while constitutionally derived,is directory only and that parties,by otherwise stipulating,to a referee acting as temporary judge waive any objection based on failure to strictly comply.in re richard cal d,fn,d.second,heather did not consider the waiver rule and its vital policy considerations for dependency cases the holding effectively allowed a parent to sabotage the process with a challenge that could have been raised earlier.third,we are not persuaded,at least in our context,by heather voidness rationale.
under our constitution,the legislature may provide for the appointment by trial courts of record of officers such as commissioners to perform subordinate judicial duties cal,art.vi,and the legislature responds in the welfare and institutions code that t he judge of the juvenile court may appoint one or more referees to serve on a or basis and that a referee shall hear such cases as are assigned to him or her by the presiding judge of the juvenile court,with the same powers as a judge of the juvenile court,except that a referee shall not conduct any hearing to which the state or federal constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy apply unless all of the parties thereto stipulate in writing that the referee may act in the capacity of a temporary judge,italics added in re mark cal d,referees are subordinate judicial officers empowered to hear and decide many matters in the first instance.the limitation does not apply in dependency proceedings.in re roderick th,fn,d in re carina d.even in delinquency proceedings,where it does apply,failure to secure a stipulation does not divest a referee of jurisdiction to act rather,the stipulation is only necessary to give his or her acts finality.in re roderick,supra,at,d.
nonjurisdictional impact is also indicated here,for the statute says a referee removal order is not effective until approved by a judge it does not say the order is void or invalid if not approved.this construction also comports with the surrounding statutes of which section is a part and must be reconciled.see generally renee superior court cal th,d.
all orders by a referee are subject to de novo review by a juvenile court judge should a party seek a rehearing within days after service of the order or a judge grant rehearing on his or her own motion within days.thus while section provides that a referee removal order is not effective until approved by a judge,section goes on to provide except as provided in section authorizing judges to require approval for other orders as well,all orders of a referee other than those specified in section shall become immediately effective,subject also to the right of review by rehearing as hereinafter provided,and shall continue in full force and effect until vacated or modified upon rehearing by order of the judge of the juvenile court.in a case in which an order of a referee becomes effective without approval of a judge of the juvenile court,it becomes final on the expiration of the time allowed by section for application for rehearing,if application therefor is not made within such time and if the judge of the juvenile court has not within such time ordered a rehearing pursuant to section.italics added.
thus the term effective in section connotes not a conferral of jurisdiction but the point at which the order may be carried out,and this is reflected in a case not cited to us that said of the predecessor statute,former section t he approval of a referee order is a safeguard against summary removal of the child from the custody of his parent or guardian.approval of the order is not grounded upon a rehearing on the merits,it is merely an evaluation of the custody aspect of the order,keeping in mind that an application for a rehearing may be filed by a parent or guardian of the child.citation.otherwise the referee order would become effective immediately and the child would be subjected to the psychological trauma of a change of custody which might be reversed if a rehearing is granted.in re dale d.rejecting a claim of double jeopardy.the supreme court has observed of the implementing rule requiring approval within two judicial days former rule b,now rule b this rule,enacted to insure that such orders become operative without undue delay,further provides that the approval of a referee order by a judge in these circumstances is not a rehearing on the merits.citation.as the advisory committee comment to the rule explains,the approval provision of former section now was intended only as a requirement that the referee order be countersigned by a juvenile court judge,thereby attesting to the authenticity of the order.citation.according to the comment,the approval procedures are,in effect,a requirement for a second signature,by a judge,before the referee order becomes effective,operative.in re john cal d.
no published opinion seems to have squarely held whether failure to comply with section is jurisdictional.but see in re rashad th,d resolving such an issue in unpublished part of opn.one decision,however,has held that a violation of the implementing rule former rule b,now rule b,is not jurisdictional t he rule does not,could not,specify the order becomes void if not approved within that period.this is a rule of procedure only it is to give immediate effect to the referee order,which is not effective until the juvenile court judge signs it.citation.thus the one day delay here simply delay ed the effective date when the minor could lawfully be removed from his parents home.in re robert d.the unspoken premise of that holding is that the rule could not have jurisdictional consequences ibid.because the judicial council,having authority to promulgate only rules not inconsistent with statute cal,art.vi,would be going beyond the intent underlying the statute see discussion in in re richard,supra,cal d at,d.
this implicit view of judge approval as nonjurisdictional and directed only to implementing the order,was stressed more recently as follows section provides that n o order of a referee removing a minor from his home shall become effective until expressly approved by a judge of the juvenile court.citation.t he requirement of appro
