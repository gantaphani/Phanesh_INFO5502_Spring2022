the supreme court has recognized two kinds of immunity applicable to public officials sued for damages under.most officials receive only qualified immunity,which protects them from liability for the performance of discretionary functions when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.buckley,at.quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.the court has also determined,however,that some officials perform special functions which deserve absolute protection from damages liability.id.at.quoting butz economou,d.where absolute immunity is deemed appropriate,an official is protected from all suits attacking conduct within the scope of the immunity,even if the official is alleged to have acted in bad faith.see moore valder.
the court has recognized as special functions deserving of absolute immunity those that are similar to functions that would have been immune when congress enacted.buckley,at.even where there is a tradition of absolute immunity for a given function,the court further considers whether history or purposes nonetheless counsel against recognizing the same immunity in actions.id.at.quoting tower glover,d.in making these determinations,the court applies a functional approach,looking to the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.id.quoting,respectively,burns reed,d and forrester white,d.
in imbler pachtman,the supreme court followed this general approach in holding that a criminal prosecutor is immune from damages under for initiating a prosecution and presenting the state case.imbler pachtman,d.the court first found the immunity of prosecutors for such functions to be well settled,and then concluded that the same considerations of public policy that underlie the rule likewise countenance absolute immunity under.id.at.these considerations included the concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor energies from his public duties,and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.id.at.such unfounded litigation,the court feared,could be expected with some frequency,for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the state advocate.id.at.see also buckley,at.burns,at.
the supreme court extended imbler beyond the context of criminal prosecutions in butz economou,holding absolute immunity applicable to agency attorneys in administrative enforcement proceedings.butz,at.butz concerned a plaintiff who controlled a company registered with the department of agriculture as a commodity futures commission merchant.the department sought to revoke or suspend the company registration by filing an administrative complaint and conducting administrative proceedings before an agency hearing examiner.plaintiff responded by suing senior department officials and the department attorney who had prosecuted the proceeding.id.at.
in analyzing the defendants immunity claims,butz first recounted the historical immunity of prosecutors previously discussed in imbler,and particularly noted the precedents extending absolute immunity to parties participating in the judicial process judges,grand jurors,petit jurors,advocates,and witnesses.id.at.emphasis added see also burns,at.like witnesses,prosecutors and other lawyers were absolutely immune from damages liability at common law for making false or defamatory statements in judicial proceedings emphasis added.employing the functional approach described above,the court declared that agency officials performing certain functions analogous to those of a prosecutor should be able to claim absolute immunity with respect to such acts.butz,at.
the butz court then turned its attention to two classes of defendants.considering first those officials responsible for the decision to initiate or continue a proceeding subject to agency adjudication,id.at.the court held the decision to initiate administrative proceedings against an individual or corporation is very much like the prosecutor decision to initiate or move forward with a criminal prosecution,id.at.as with prosecutors,the court explained,t he discretion which executive officials exercise with respect to the initiation of administrative proceedings might be distorted if their immunity from damages arising from that decision was less than complete.id.and as with the decision to prosecute,there is a serious danger that the decision to
