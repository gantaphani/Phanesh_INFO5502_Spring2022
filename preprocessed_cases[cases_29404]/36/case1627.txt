in this case,we review two orders entered in a marital dissolution action.one order modifies spousal support and the other awards sanctions.
in the first order,the trial court retroactively reduced the husband spousal support obligation and allowed him a partial recovery of his support overpayments.both parties challenge that order.arguing against the husband recovery of any support overpayments,the wife asserts that the trial court should have retroactively applied the statute in force at the time modification was ordered.by,the husband seeks full reimbursement of all overpayments he argues for retroactive application of a later amendment to the statute.as we explain below,we agree with the husband view.we therefore reverse the support modification order and remand with instructions to the trial court to give retroactive effect to the most recent amendments to the governing statute.
in the second order,the trial court awarded attorneys fees to the husband as a sanction against the wife.she challenges that award on procedural grounds.we find no error and affirm the fee award.
facts and procedural history 
nick petropoulos husband and voula petropoulos wife divorced after a marriage.a dissolution was granted in september.
in june,robert redding was appointed as a special master to make findings and recommendations regarding the parties income and assets for purposes of property division and spousal support.after lengthy hearings on the matter,the special master filed his findings and recommendations.among other things,he recommended the division of the parties seven residential real properties,with the result that each party would own at least two properties with a rental income stream.the special master also concluded that husband should pay wife per month as spousal support,based on the marital standard of living and on the parties respective incomes.the trial court adopted the special master recommendations in february.
in november,husband sought a reduction in his spousal support obligation.wife filed a to increase the spousal support husband was paying her.
in september,the court again appointed robert redding as a special master,this time to determine the parties income and assets for purposes of the spousal support modification motions.the hearing on that reference took place over the course of four days in october and november.partway through the special master hearing,the parties attended a court case management conference,at which husband sought to expand the ongoing reference to include credibility determinations.the court granted husband request,and on october,it ordered the special master to make findings regarding the parties credibility.wife moved for reconsideration of that order,but the court denied her motion.
the special master filed his findings in may.those detailed findings included determinations of the parties assets and debts,as well as their respective incomes for,and.the special master also made explicit findings that wife was not credible and that her conduct frustrated settlement.
thereafter,the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the spousal support motions,which took place over the course of three days in july and august.the judge entertained testimony from both husband and wife,from husband expert,and from the special master.the judge then heard argument from both parties before taking the matter under submission.
at the evidentiary hearing,the trial court also gave the parties a briefing schedule for submitting the issue of attorneys fees.so far as the record discloses,neither party requested a separate hearing regarding fees.
on august,the court issued its order modifying spousal support.in that modification order,the court reduced husband spousal support obligation by varying amounts for,and.the court determined that husband was entitled to reimbursement for the support overpayments he had made during the years,but it concluded that husband was not entitled to recoup overpayments made in because the amended statute then in effect prohibited reimbursement.
as to attorneys fees,the court august order stated that the fee issue would be deemed submitted when the parties filed declarations.both sides submitted declarations thereafter.the court issued its order regarding attorneys fees on october.that order directed wife to pay husband in attorneys fees as a sanction.
wife filed a timely appeal from the court orders of august and october.husband the august order to the extent it denied him reimbursement for support overpayments made in.
the following issues are before us 
did the trial court misapply the governing statute in determining husband right to recover support overpayments this issue is raised both by wife on appeal and by husband on.
did the trial court improperly delegate its judicial authority by ordering and relying on the referee credibility findings,as wife contends in her appeal 
did the trial court deprive wife of her right to a hearing on the issue of sanctions,as she claims 
is husband entitled to an award of attorneys fees on appeal,as he asserts 
discussion 
we discuss each issue in turn.
right to recover support overpayments 
wife and husband both assert that the trial court erred in applying the governing statute,family code section in her appeal from the august order,wife claims that it was error for the court to reimburse husband for support overpayments made in,and.that claim is based on her contention that the trial court should have retroactively applied the statute then in place,which prohibited reimbursement of overpayments.in his,husband urges retroactive application of the statute as subsequently amended,which permits the recovery of overpayments that result from retroactive reduction or termination of support.
standard of review 
the parties dispute over which version of the law to apply requires us to determine and interpret the governing statute and to apply that statute to undisputed facts.we are thus presented with a question of law,which we review de novo.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,earley superior court th,d.
evolution of the statute 
the parties disagreement over the governing statute has its origins in recent statutory amendments.resolving that dispute requires an appreciation for how and when the statute changed while the parties for support modification were pending.for that reason,we begin by briefly describing the statute evolution.
original enactment as originally enacted,former section provided for the retroactivity of orders modifying or terminating support,but the statute was silent on the permissibility of recovering excess payments 
version former section was amended by legislation passed in as relevant here,the legislation,which became effective january,added subdivision c.the amendment prohibited support obligors from recouping any overpayments resulting from a retroactive reduction or termination of support.
version legislation enacted less than a year later rewrote section,subdivision c that amendment,which became effective on january,completely reversed the provision effect.in contrast to the predecessor provision,the current subdivision allows the court to order repayment of excess support following a retroactive reduction.
to resolve the issue presented in this case,we must determine which version of the statute applies and whether it applies retroactively.as noted above,wife argues for retroactive application of the version of the statute,while husband urges retroactive application of the version.
retroactivity 
in response to both parties contentions,we first observe that there is a and presumption against the retroactive application of statutes.in re marriage of bouquet cal d.it is a widely recognized legal principle,specifically embodied in section of the civil code,that in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary statutory enactments apply prospectively.evangelatos superior court cal d.
in determining legislative intent,we begin with the words of the statute.lundquist reusser cal th,d.here,the statute is silent regarding its prospective or retroactive application.but the statutory language does not furnish the only resource at our disposal.in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.a statute may be clothed with retroactive effect despite the silence of its language on the issue and the presumption against retroactive application,citing in re estrada cal d.where the statute is silent,the courts address all pertinent factors when attempting to divine the legislative purpose.a wide variety of factors may illuminate the legislative design,such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy,and contemporaneous construction.citations.in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at,thus,on occasion,the presumption of prospectivity has given way where the legislative history or the context of the enactment provided a sufficiently clear indication that the legislature intended the statute to operate retrospectively that we found it appropriate to accord the statute a retroactive application.evangelatos superior court,supra,cal d at,citing marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d,and mannheim superior court cal d.absent a sufficiently clear indication of legislative intent,however,courts will apply the almost universal rule that statutes are addressed to the future,not to the past.evangelatos superior court,supra,cal at,quoting winfree nor.pac.ry.
to determine whether the legislature signified an intent that this statute operate retroactively with sufficient clarity,we look to the legislative history of the two recent amendments to section.
version section,subdivision c,was added by assembly bill session,effective january.that provision expressly denied support obligors the right to recoup overpayments.but nothing in the legislative history of assembly bill sheds light on the legislature reasons for adding subdivision c.
version subdivision c was amended during the next legislative session as part of assembly bill session.as noted above,that amendment resulted in a complete reversal of the prior law.where the former provision prohibited recoupment of excess payments,the current provision allows it.the statute current iteration is the product of senate floor amendments to assembly bill made on september.according to the senate rules committee,those amendments would allow the court to order the support obligee to repay any amounts paid by the obligor in excess of the modified order.this amendment is necessary to fix a mistake from a bill that was enacted last year.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,digest,emphasis added.with those amendments in place,the senate approved the bill on september,and sent it to the assembly.the assembly concurred in the senate amendments then passed the bill.as noted in the assembly concurrence,the senate amendments also add a provision relating to retroactivity of child support upon modification of a support this provision is intended to address a concern arising due to a last minute amendment to ab concurrence in,ab,as amended,comments.
the legislature acknowledgement that the latest amendment was needed to address a concern and to fix a mistake suggests that it intended retroactive application.that suggestion gains vitality when considered in the context of the evolution of this statute the first express provision governing recovery of overpayments was added to the statute by the mistaken legislation.in other words,the current,corrected version of the provision appears to be the very one the legislature intended to enact in the first place.the legislative history of this enactment thus clearly signals an intent that the statute be applied retroactively.see,in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at.significantly,we find no conflicting indicia in the legislative history to counter the suggestion that retroactive application was intended.ibid.in short,the only indicators of legislative intent ascertainable in this case call for the retroactive application of the amendment.ibid.these indicators are sufficient to overcome the presumption against retroactive application.ibid.we conclude,therefore,that the legislature intended retroactive application of the version of section,subdivision c.
in reaching that conclusion,we are not unmindful of the special distinct from the merits of the substantive legal change embodied in the new are frequently triggered by the application of a new,improved legal principle retroactively to circumstances in which individuals may have already taken action in reasonable reliance on the previously existing state of the law.evangelatos superior court,supra,cal d at.the presumption of prospectivity assures that reasonable reliance on current legal principles will not be defeated in the absence of a clear indication of a legislative intent to override such reliance.id.at.see also,in re marriage of fabian cal d.in this case,however,we find no basis for reliance because there was no established legal doctrine governing reimbursement of support overpayments prior to enactment of the,mistaken enactment of the version of section.but,in re marriage of van sickle d.error to order reimbursement where support obligor did not request modification.we therefore consider this an appropriate case in which to give effect to the legislature apparent intent.
the legislature intent notwithstanding,we may not give a statute retroactive effect if doing so offends constitutional principles.in re marriage of buol cal d.in determining whether a retroactive law contravenes the due process clause,we consider such factors as the significance of the state interest served by the law,the importance of the retroactive application of the law to the effectuation of that interest,the extent of reliance upon the former law,the legitimacy of that reliance,the extent of actions taken on the basis of that reliance,and the extent to which the retroactive application of the new law would disrupt those actions.citations.in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at.
statutes can be applied retroactively if such a retroactive application is necessary to subserve a sufficiently important state interest.marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at.important state interests include the legislature abiding supervision of marital property and dissolutions.id.at.this is particularly true where the legislation aims to rectify an injustice.the state interest in the equitable dissolution of the marital relationship supports this use of the police power to abrogate rights in marital property that derived from the patently unfair former law.ibid.in this case,the former law may be characterized as patently unfair to the extent it prevented support obligors from collecting adjudicated overpayments.conversely,nothing in the amended statute takes away any entitlement belonging to wife.see,san bernardino county indus.acc.com.cal.
given the state important interest in ensuring that family support is equitable,we conclude that giving retroactive effect to the version of the statute is an appropriate exercise of legislative authority.
application to this case 
we have determined that the version of section,subdivision c,should be applied retroactively.we further conclude that that version of the statute governs the parties rights in this case,since those rights have not been finally adjudicated in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at.see also,younger superior court cal d,chapman farr d.
applying that statute here,it is apparent that the trial court had the statutory authority to order reimbursement of the support overpayments for the entire period from the filing of husband modification motion in until its determination nearly three years later,including for the year.it is equally apparent that the trial court did not appreciate its authority to make such an order.we therefore remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to exercise its discretion under section,subdivision c,as currently enacted,taking into account all the factors set forth in that provision.
determinations by the special master 
wife next takes issue with the trial court reliance on the findings of the special master as they relate to credibility.wife claim of error on this point is.first,she argues that a reference for credibility is an unauthorized delegation of judicial power.second,she asserts that the trial court improperly relied on the referee credibility findings 
standards of review 
wife first claim,that a credibility reference is in excess of a referee authority,presents a question of law for our independent review,murphy padilla th,d.wife second claim,that the trial judge improperly relied on the referee in this case,is based on the factual record.we measure that claim against the substantial evidence rule,indulging all reasonable inferences to uphold the court order.jordan city of santa barbara th,d.
reference to the special master 
by statute,a court may direct a special reference on a question of fact.code civ.a reference by the trial court involves the sending of a pending action or proceeding,or some issue raised therein,to a referee for hearing,determination and report back to the court.the procedure is most commonly employed where complicated accounts can more conveniently be examined or taken outside of court,and to resolve discovery disputes or certain types of family law issues.citations.jovine fhp,th,d.the trial court may order a special reference without the parties consent.id.at,d.in such cases,the authority of the referee or special master is limited to resolving specific questions of fact.ibid.the referee factual findings are advisory recommendations only they are not binding unless the trial court adopts them.ibid.accord,estate of beard th,d kim superior court th,d.nevertheless,the referee recommendations are entitled to great weight.citations.estate of beard,supra,th at,d.
in this case,the special master was ordered to assess the parties credibility.wife challenges that aspect of the reference as improper,a challenge we reject.as,referees necessarily make credibility determinations.see,in re rose cal d.they act properly and within their authority in doing so.in re rosoto cal d,holt kelly cal d.
reliance on the referee findings 
we also reject wife contention that the trial court improperly relied on the referee credibility findings.the court explicitly recognized that it was not bound by the special master findings and unequivocally stated that it would make its own credibility determinations.the court had ample opportunity to make independent credibility assessments during the evidentiary hearing it conducted,which took place over three court days and which included testimony by husband,wife,and the special master,de guere universal city studios,th,d.
on this record,there is no factual or legal basis for wife claim that the reference resulted in an unauthorized delegation of judicial power.
the court assessed attorneys fees against wife as a sanction,pursuant to section that statute advances the policy of the law to promote settlement and to encourage cooperation which will reduce the cost of litigation.in re marriage of quay th,d.family law litigants who flout that policy by engaging in conduct that increases litigation costs are subject to the imposition of attorneys fees and costs as a sanction.ibid.accord,in re marriage of burgard th,d.
wife does not dispute the court statutory authority to impose sanctions,nor does she challenge the evidentiary basis for the court exercise of that authority in this case.as grounds for reversal,wife asserts only that the statute requires notice and a hearing,which the trial court did not provide.in addition,she argues,the trial court failed to consider whether the sanctions it ordered impose an unreasonable financial burden on her.
standards of review 
wife assertions regarding the statute notice and hearing requirements require us to interpret section.those assertions therefore present a question of law for our independent review.california teachers san diego community college,supra,cal d at.in assessing wife further contention that the trial court failed to consider the financial burden of its sanction award,we indulge all reasonable inferences to uphold the trial court order.see,jordan city of santa barbara,supra,th at,d dolan buena engineers,th,d.we will not interfere with the order for sanctions unless the trial court abused its broad discretion in making it.in re marriage of burgard supra,th,d.see also,childs painewebber incorporated th,d code civ.
notice and hearing 
the relevant portion of the statute provides as follows an award of attorney fees and costs as a sanction pursuant to this section shall be imposed only after notice to the party against whom the sanction is proposed to be imposed and opportunity for that party to be heard,subd.b.see,in re marriage of hublou d,footnote.decided under predecessor statute.
with respect to the notice requirement,wife claims at no time did the trial court indicate or comment upon its intention to consider section sanctions.as the record indicates,however,wife was well aware that she was subject to such sanctions even if the trial court did not expressly say so.first,the order expanding the special master charge included an express reference to section sanctions,as did the order denying wife request for reconsideration of the expansion.thereafter,the special master found that wife had engaged in conduct that would justify sanctions against her under section.those findings were before the court.in addition,in an application filed prior to the court hearing,husband requested that the court award fees based on wife conduct.wife filed a response to that request in which she asserted that she should not be sanctioned under.wife repeated that assertion in her trial brief,again with an express citation to section.finally,at the hearing itself,at least one explicit reference to section was made during the discussions about the procedure for submitting the fee issue.in short,this record clearly demonstrates that wife had adequate notice that she might be sanctioned under section.see,in re marriage of quay,supra,th at,d on cow hollow properties d.code civ.pro,in re marriage of reese guy th,d code civ.proc.
having concluded that wife was given sufficient notice,we next consider whether wife was accorded an adequate opportunity to be heard.section does not specify the nature of the hearing it contemplates.we observe,however,that the opportunity to be heard does not necessarily compel an oral hearing.see,lewis superior court cal th,d,oral argument not required for peremptory writs.but see titmas superior court th,d,tjx companies,superior court th,d,and cases cited therein.california courts have concluded that use of the terms heard or hearing does not require an opportunity for an oral presentation,unless the context or other language indicates a contrary intent.lewis superior court,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,even if a hearing is required,due process does not necessarily require that a motion for sanctions for alleged misconduct during a hearing be heard on a separate and later hearing date.in re marriage of quinlan d.see also,monex international,peinado d.request for sanctions under code civ,properly heard with summary judgment motion lavine hospital of the good samaritan d.request for sanctions under code civ,properly heard with motion to compel discovery.t he scope of a hearing on an application for sanctions is within the trial court discretion,as with motions generally.lavine hospital of the good samaritan,supra,d at.
in any event,we need not decide here whether a separate oral hearing is required before sanctions are imposed under section,for we conclude that wife waived such a hearing in this case.in reaching that conclusion,we note first the lack of any evidence in the record that wife requested a separate hearing on the sanction issue.we also note wife apparent acquiescence in the trial court briefing schedule for written submission of the fee issue.finally,it does not appear from the record that wife moved for reconsideration or for a new trial on the fee issue.under the circumstances,she has waived any objection she may have had on that ground.see,jansen associates,d.
consideration of financial burden 
we next consider wife contention that the trial court erred by failin
