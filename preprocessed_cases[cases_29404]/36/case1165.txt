while a marital dissolution proceeding was pending,a wife brought a separate civil action against her husband and two accounting firms.the wife claimed her husband failed to make two interim monthly payments required under the terms of a stipulation and order in the dissolution proceeding,and further claimed his conduct constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress.the wife also sought a declaration that the husband and the accounting firms were required to provide her with tax returns and related documents she had previously sought in the dissolution proceeding.under precedent precluding parties to dissolution proceedings from engaging in family law waged by other means neal superior court th,d,we affirm the trial court judgment of dismissal.
after the trial court in the civil action sustained the husband demurrer,the husband sought sanctions in the family law court.the family law court granted the husband motion,ordering the wife to pay to the husband as sanctions under family code section,and ordering the wife and her attorneys to pay that sum to the husband as sanctions under code of civil procedure section.we affirm the trial court order.
factual and procedural background 
janet burkle and ronald burkle were married in.after burkle filed a petition for marital dissolution in june,the burkles agreed to attempt a reconciliation.in november,they executed a postmarital agreement resolving all present and future financial issues between them.they lived together for several more years.in june,burkle again filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in which she asserted the postmarital agreement was void and unenforceable.the parties stipulated to the appointment of retired judge stephen lachs to hear and determine all issues and disputes arising out of the postmarital agreement and their marital relationship,including child custody,child and spousal support,and property rights.
in december,judge lachs issued an order finding the postmarital agreement valid and enforceable,and this court affirmed the order.in re marriage of burkle th,d.while the litigation over the postmarital agreement was pending,the burkles stipulated to the entry of an order by judge lachs.among other matters,the order required burkle to continue to pay burkle per month,payable on the first day of each month,beginning on april.the monthly payments were unallocated,and were subject to future allocation by the court,either as a credit against the payments due from burkle to burkle under the postmarital agreement,or as spousal support,or as child support,or as some combination of the above.the stipulated order was filed august,as was a judgment of dissolution as to status only.
eight days later,burkle filed a civil action against burkle and the burkles accountants,ernst young llp and kpmg llp.she alleged that on or about june,burkle telephoned her and told her he knew she had incurred some unusual expenses and had decided to give her an extra,which would be subject to future allocation,like the other payments.burkle then withheld the payments due on july and august,allegedly because he believed burkle had instigated an internal revenue service irs audit or investigation,a belief he later admitted was erroneous.burkle complaint further alleged she did not know whether an irs audit or investigation was conducted or pending she did not have complete and unredacted copies of her joint tax returns and her demands for copies of the tax returns in the dissolution proceeding resulted only in her receipt of redacted copies from burkle.her complaint asserted causes of action for enforcement of judgment and for intentional infliction of emotional distress against burkle,and sought payment of the plus interest,as well as compensatory and punitive damages on her tort claim.in a cause of action for declaratory relief,she sought a declaration that burkle and the accountants were obligated to provide her with information about the existence vel non of any irs investigation and with unredacted copies of all joint tax returns and related workpapers.
burkle and the accounting firms filed demurrers to the complaint,together with requests for judicial notice of documents filed in the dissolution proceeding.the trial court sustained each demurrer without leave to amend.judgment of dismissal was entered.
meanwhile,after burkle filed her civil action,burkle served burkle counsel with a copy of a motion for sanctions he intended to file in the dissolution proceeding if she did not voluntarily dismiss the civil action.see code civ,subd.c.when she did not do so,burkle filed his motion for sanctions before judge lachs.after the trial court in the civil action sustained burkle demurrer,a hearing was held before judge lachs on the sanctions motion.judge lachs found that by filing her civil action,burkle knowingly acted in a manner which frustrated the policy of the law to reduce litigation costs and encourage cooperation between litigants and attorneys.he ordered her to pay represents burkle attorney fees and costs in connection with the civil burkle as sanctions under family code section.judge lachs also found burkle contentions with respect to the proper forum for her action were frivolous,and ordered her and her attorneys to pay to burkle as sanctions under code of civil procedure section.
burkle filed appeals from the judgment of dismissal in the civil action and from judge lachs order awarding sanctions.this court consolidated the two cases for purposes of decision.
discussion 
burkle lawsuit against her husband and the burkles accountants is a textbook example of an improper attempt to wage family law by other means neal superior court,supra,th at,d neal.when a dissolution proceeding is pending,neither party to that proceeding has the right to file a separate civil action to enforce an interim support order issued in the dissolution proceeding.the same rule applies to filing a purported tort action arising from conduct that relates to the interim support order and,but for the dissolution proceeding,would not have occurred.neither thomas thomas cal d,upon which burkle relies,nor any other precedent may be read to support a contrary conclusion.accordingly,the trial court properly sustained the demurrers of burkle and the accounting firms without leave to amend.because precedent precluded burkle from filing a separate civil action,the subsequent award of sanctions by judge lachs was not an abuse of discretion.we affirm both the judgment in the civil action and judge lachs order.
a.the civil action.
burkle demurrer.
in neal and several other cases,the courts have made it clear that family law cases should not be allowed to spill over into civil law neal,supra,th at,d.neal directed the trial court to sustain an demurrers to her former husband causes of action for breach of contract,fraud,abuse of process and declaratory relief.the court observed that almost all events occurring in family law litigation can be reframed as civil law actions,and that it is incumbent on courts to examine the substance of claims,not just their nominal headings.ibid.neal continued 
the instant case is a perfect example.the husband has sued his for breach of contract simply because she allegedly did not comply with the terms of a family law judgment.he has sued for fraud based on statements made at the family law osc he has sued her for abuse of process based on false representations in family law court.he has sued her for declaratory relief based on the dispute in the family law case over whether he has paid what he owes under the family law judgment.in substance this case is a family law osc with civil headings.id.at,d.
burkle suit against burkle tracks the neal case in all relevant particulars.she has sued burkle simply because he allegedly did not comply with the terms of a family law order.neal,supra,th at,d.as in neal,burkle civil complaint is essentially about whether burkle paid the money that the family law order obligated him to pay,and the substance of burkle claims against burkle all stem directly from the family law case.ibid.burkle suit is even more egregious because she sued over an interim order in a pending proceeding.in short,this case is a family law osc with civil headings ibid,and burkle was required to address her claims to the family law court.see also th,d o nce again this court confronts a family law case which has been allowed to metastasize into something else when the fraud claim is predicated on misrepresentations of value of community stock made in the process of dissolution,the remedy is the traditional one of timely seeking to set aside the judgment or marital settlement agreement in the appropriate forum,not a securities fraud suit askew askew th,d trial court erred in failing to dismiss husband civil action,which sought to preempt the family law court from determining issues it already had jurisdiction to determine and which were the province of the family law court in the first place.
despite the ample precedents,burkle insists she has the option of bringing a separate civil action to enforce the family law court interim support order.she claims that her civil action,unlike those in neal and other cases,is an action to enforce the stipulated judgment requiring ron to pay her a month for each of july and august,and is governed by thomas thomas,supra,cal d at pages.for multiple reasons,burkle is mistaken.
first,the order she seeks to enforce is not a judgment but is an interim order for the payment of monies expressly subject to future allocation by the family law court.the only judgment so far entered in this case is the judgment of dissolution as to status only.
second,nothing in thomas thomas suggests that the principle established in neal,askew and other cases does not apply to burkle.in thomas,a divorce final judgment of the trial court thomas superior court d,was entered in butte county requiring the husband to pay the wife alimony.the husband defaulted in his payments for over five years,and the wife brought suit in los angeles county,where both parties then resided.the trial court granted an ordinary money judgment,but refused to incorporate any provision for future installments of alimony.thomas thomas,supra,cal d at.the supreme court reversed the trial court judgment,observing that the purpose of the action was to obtain a continuing judgment enforceable by contempt in los angeles county where both parties lived,and the wife was entitled to a decree directing payment of amounts due and to become due under the butte county judgment.id.at.thomas plainly has no bearing on this case.thomas involved the enforcement of a final judgment,and enforcement was sought in a different court because both parties had moved to that location.it is not possible to read thomas as authorizing a spouse in a pending dissolution proceeding in los angeles to file a separate civil action,also in los angeles,to enforce an interim support order that is expressly subject to future allocation in the dissolution proceeding 
third,no other authorities support the propriety of burkle civil action.she insists that not all disputes must be resolved in family court,and that spouses may bring tort and contract actions against each other.of course,that is a correct statement of the law,because interspousal immunity no longer exists.however,the principle has no application when a dissolution proceeding is pending,and it certainly has no application when a spouse is attempting to enforce an interim order in a pending dissolution proceeding we thus have no occasion in this case to draw a line between spousal cases that might properly be brought in a separate civil action and those that may not burkle lawsuit clearly falls on the far side of any line that might conceivably be drawn.her dissolution proceeding is still pending,and her complaint arises from an interim support order in that very proceeding,in which there has been no final judgment,and over which the family law court clearly has jurisdiction.other cases on the subject merely serve to demonstrate the propriety of the trial court disposition in this case.for example 
in neal and,the separate civil actions were improper even though they were filed after final judgments in the family law proceedings had been entered,rather than during the pendency of the dissolution proceeding.
in askew,the family law court already had subject matter jurisdiction to divide the community property,so the civil trial court in which the husband brought a separate action had no jurisdiction to determine the character of five properties the husband claimed were his separate property.askew,supra,th at,d,original italics.
in bidna rosen th,d,the husband could not bring a malicious prosecution action based on six totally meritless ex parte applications and orders to show cause filed by his wife in their family law proceedings.
see also greene superior court cal d,because of continuing jurisdiction of santa barbara divorce court over its custody awards,san francisco court had no jurisdiction in mother action to appoint a guardian,and kresteller superior court d.court which granted divorce had primary,continuing jurisdiction to modify its decree,and wife independent action seeking child support in another court was precluded divorce court which rendered decree ordinarily is in a better position to make a determination whether there has been a change of circumstances.
in the face of these authorities,burkle does not cite a single case permitting a spouse to file a separate civil action over matters arising out of an order in a pending dissolution doubt because no such authorities exist.
we do not suggest by our resolution of this case that former spouses are required to bring any disputes with each other to the family court that presided over their dissolution proceeding.as pointed out,if the husband had sold the wife some worthless prototypical stock their status as spouses would not preclude her from recovering,supra,th at,d.the wife in,however,want ed the special benefits of disclosure which come with being a spouse,and want ed them in a transaction that would not have taken place except that it was required by the family code,but does not want the confines of the traditional family law remedy.ibid.similarly,burkle obtained the benefit of an interim support order,in a transaction that would not have occurred outside the family law court,but she seeks a remedy outside the family law court.neal,askew,and other authorities clearly tell us she can not have it.
finally,burkle insists she is entitled to bring a separate tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on burkle conduct in retracting the additional payment he proffered.she may not do so.as neal observes,we must examine the substance of a claim rather than its nominal heading neal,supra,th at,d,and it is clear that the propriety of burkle conduct was a matter for the family law court.see bidna rosen,supra,th at,d husband could not bring malicious prosecution claim arising out of family law proceedings and was consign ed to various family law remedies,which conspicuously do not include punitive damages and damages for emotional distress the remedy for egregious conduct in family law court is for the family law bench to nip it in the bud with appropriate sanctions.further,even if a separate civil action were permissible,the conduct alleged by burkle is not,as a matter of law,c onduct so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.davidson city of westminster cal d,see,superior court th,d g enerally,conduct will be found to be actionable where the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor,and lead him to exclaim,outrageous.this is not a case where reasonable jurors might differ on whether the conduct alleged meets the applicable standard.
in sum,no authority supported burkle filing of a civil action against burkle over matters within the purview of the family law court,and the trial court properly dismissed her claims.
the demurrers of the accounting firms.
burkle action against ernst young and kpmg is similarly defective.she sought a declaration that the accounting firms were obligated to provide her with information about the existence vel non of any irs investigation and unredacted copies of all joint tax returns and related workpapers.her claims against the accountants are,in substantial part,a repetition of disputes previously brought before judge lachs.burkle seeks the same documents in this action that she sought in her marital dissolution action.deposition subpoenas for the production of business records were served on the accounting firms in the dissolution proceeding both accounting firms filed objections to those subpoenas and burkle failed to pursue the matter by seeking to compel their production.having failed to do so,she may not now seek the same documents by filing an action in another department of the same court.see plant insulation fibreboard d.under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction,when two superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties,the first to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction the rule does not require absolute identity of parties,causes of action or remedies sought if the first court has the power to bring before it all the necessary parties,application of the rule is not precluded merely because the parties in the second action are not identical.in this case,while the accounting firms are not parties to the dissolution action,the family law court had full power to require them to respond to burkle subpoenas relating to the tax returns,and could likewise require them to produce information on the alleged irs audit.see,schnabel superior court cal th,d,when one spouse in a marriage dissolution proceeding seeks discovery from a third party,court is required to balance the need for discovery against the privacy interests of the third party.accordingly,because the family law court had the power to require production of the records,which burkle demanded in connection with the marital dissolution,she was required to seek relief in the marital dissolution proceeding,not in a new action for declaratory relief.see also general of america ins.lilly d.under code of civil procedure section,court may refuse to exercise power to grant declaratory relief where such relief is not necessary availability of another form of relief will usually justify the refusal,which is within the trial court discretion.the demurrers of the accounting firms were properly sustained without leave to amend.
b.the sanctions order.
the relevant terms of the statutes under which judge lachs awarded sanctions are these 
family code section allows the court to base an award of attorney fees and costs on the extent to which the conduct of each party or attorney furthers or frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation and,where possible,to reduce the cost of litigation by encouraging cooperation between the parties and attorneys,subd.a.an award under section is in the nature of a sanction,and is payable only from the property or income of the party against whom it is imposed,subds.a c.
code of civil procedure section allows sanctions to be imposed upon attorneys who present to the court claims,defenses or legal contentions not warranted by existing law,and allows sanctions against parties and attorneys when pleadings are presented primarily for an improper purpose,such as to harass or cause a needless increase in the cost of litigation.code civ,subds.b,c.
a trial court award of sanctions is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.guillemin stein th,d applying code of civil procedure section in re marriage of petropoulos th,d applying family code section.
burkle asserts several reasons for reversal of the sanctions order.none has merit.
first,burkle argues her contentions about the propriety of a separate civil action were correct,and in any event certainly arguable,so that her attorneys had both the right and the duty to make them on her behalf.as should be apparent from part of this opinion,we do not agree.precedents such as neal and askew clearly preclude a party to a pending marital dissolution proceeding from bringing a civil action against the other spouse over matters of which the family law court has jurisdiction,and burkle civil suit was indistinguishable from those precedents.burkle attorneys were well aware of the applicable precedents,because burkle earlier had filed another civil action against burkle,whose demurrer in that case was likewise sustained by another judge who expressly cited both neal and askew.burkle attempt to differentiate her civil action as the enforcement of a judgment,rather than a dispute clearly within the province of the family law court,was specious and plainly not warranted by existing law code civ,subd.b.
second,burkle contends that code of civil procedure section does not authorize a court in a marital dissolution proceeding to impose sanctions for conduct that occurred in a separate civil action.she cites no authority for this proposition,stating likewise without section is manifestly designed as a tool to allow courts to regulate the conduct of parties and lawyers who appear before them in cases they are handling we do not doubt that in most cases,sanctions are and should be awarded by the judge before whom the sanctionable conduct occurred,but this principle,like most rules of law,is not absolute.in this case,an exception to the usual rule is clearly in order for a number of reasons 
no jurisdictional requirement exists preventing an award by a different judge.indeed,we can easily posit,reassignment,and so which a different judge might necessarily rule on such a motion.moreover,in neal the court expressly directed the family law court to make an appropriate attorney fee award in the wife favor for having been dragged through this unnecessary excursion in the civil court.neal,supra,th at,d.while neal cited family code section,neal nevertheless demonstrates that the conduct justifying sanctions need not occur before the judge imposing the sanctions.code of civil procedure section contains no intimation to the contrary,and we see no basis for inferring a different conclusion as a jurisdictional matter.
in this case,the conduct precipitating the sanctions is the act of filing an action in a court where it clearly does not belong,in order to avoid litigating the matter before the family court judge who made the support order in the first place and who was thoroughly familiar with the parties and the issues.in this situation,it is difficult to see how the judge in the civil action would be in a better position than the family law judge to determine the propriety of sanctions for burkle conduct.indeed,it seems to us the reverse is true.moreover,the family law judge is the judge authorized to decide the propriety of an award of sanctions under family code section.to hold the family law judge can not award sanctions under civil procedure code section for the very same conduct for which he can award sanctions under family code section would be inefficient,unnecessary,and contrary to common sense 
no doubt there are cases where the judge in whose court the sanctionable conduct occurred is the only appropriate judicial officer to award sanctions.but this would be so only when it is necessary for the judge awarding sanctions to make a subjective finding of bad faith to justify the sanctions order.see orange county of child support services superior court th,d orange county sanctions award under code of civil procedure section required a finding of subjective bad faith imposition of sanctions by a judge who did not preside over the contempt proceeding was vacated because she improperly drew conclusions about the state of mind of the lawyer against whom sanctions were imposed without having been present at the proceeding m ore importantly,the commissioner who presided was in a much better position than the judge to decide whether the lawyer conduct was sanctionable.by contrast,under section,whether an action is frivolous,as judge lachs found,is governed by an objective standard.orange county,supra,th at,d.section requires only that the conduct be objectively unreasonable guillemin stein,supra,th at,d,citation omitted.moreover,judge lachs was in a bett
