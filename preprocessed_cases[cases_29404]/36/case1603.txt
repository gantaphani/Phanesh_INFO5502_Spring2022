introduction 
this is an unusual dependency case in which there are appeals from opposite sides.remberto,the father of five children with his now estranged wife kimberly,appeals from an order adjudicating him to have committed sexual abuse on his eldest daughter.specifically,he was found to have fondled her breasts and asked her to take pictures of him nude.the five children,by contrast,appeal from the same order,because the trial court found untrue other allegations of sexual abuse,including an allegation that remberto had actual sexual intercourse with the eldest daughter.
the two appeals raise several disparate issues,but one central problem predominates the nature of the pleadings in juvenile dependency cases.as we explain below,the findings that emerge in the wake of juvenile dependency petitions must be construed in terms of their actual substance variations between what was alleged and what was proved at the hearing are governed by the established civil law concerning amendments according to proof.accordingly,we affirm the order adjudicating the children to be within subdivision d of section of the welfare and institutions code but reverse it so far as the trial court did not consider one particular allegation of sexual abuse because it erroneously denied a motion to amend the pleading according to proof.
ii.history of the case 
remberto and his wife kimberly have five children,whose ages in march were,and.the children were detained in august based on allegations of physical abuse,specifically remberto having struck the children numerous times with his hands,belts,belt buckles and other objects,including a board.but there were also allegations of sexual abuse by remberto against jessica,the eldest daughter,who told a social worker in may in an interview precipitated by domestic violence that remberto had touched her on her private parts and had once,while drunk,rubbed her chest under her clothing.
in november,the court not the same judge as the one who made the order from which these appeals have been taken sustained the jurisdictional petition under subdivisions a serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally and b serious physical harm as a result of inadequate supervision of section,but not subdivision d sexual abuse.in fact,the trial judge rejected jessica testimony,saying,i think she has been coached by more than one person and i ca find that there was any sexual intent.in the wake of the jurisdictional order,the parties stipulated to a dispositional order in which the children were placed with their mother kimberly,who was now separated from remberto remberto would have only monitored visitation.
in april,however,jessica was interviewed by members of the child abuse service team cast.she described to the interviewers various kinds of sexual abuse by remberto in addition to the touching which she had mentioned in the april interview.these acts included french kissing,exposure to pornography,and sexual intercourse.a physical exam neither negated nor substantiated sexual abuse.a psychology evaluation was similarly inconclusive 
the interview resulted in the filing by the social service agency,on may,of a subsequent petition pursuant to section.because the precise nature of the allegations plays a central role in the legal analysis of the case,we set them forth in the margin,verbatim all the acts alleged occurred prior to the august detention.
the hearing on the subsequent petition began in july,with the court setting a briefing schedule on the question of res judicata.in august the court decided that,under blanca superior court,supra,th,d,it should treat the section subsequent petition as a section modification petition.counsel stipulated to waiving any defects in so proceeding,and the court took testimony.jessica testified that,at various unspecified times since she was nine,she had sexual intercourse with her father,but that on one occasion she was unsure if there was any penetration.she also testified that he showed her a pornographic magazine,that he asked her to take pictures of him naked,that he asked her to masturbate him,that he would try to french kiss her,and that he had put his hand down her shirt and rubbed her breasts.remberto did not testify.
the trial judge did not believe most of jessica allegations,but did believe two of them.specifically,he found that there was sexual abuse pursuant to these four allegations,and specified,and of the section petition.of those four,as the reader can see from examining them in footnote,only two of the allegations implicated actual acts of sexual abuse namely,that remberto had asked his daughter to take photographs of him without his clothes on,and had fondled her breasts with his hands,with skin to skin contact.the net result of the court findings was an order removing jessica from her mother home and permitting visitation by remberto only at jessica consent under the supervision of a therapist.
iii.discussion 
remberto.the insufficient evidence argument 
remberto presents two arguments on evidence and res judicata.we deal with the insufficiency argument now.
what remberto brief presents under the rubric of insufficient evidence is somewhat of a misnomer.remberto devotes only minimal attention to the proposition that the record lacks evidence to support the trial court determination that he sexually abused jessica.he basically points to some confusion on her part as to how many times he asked her to take pictures of him naked and the exact circumstances under which he put his hand down her shirt.we may make short shrift of this aspect of his argument.such quibbles do not render a child testimony in a sexual abuse case unreliable.see in re lucero cal th,d.
but another aspect of the argument is more problematic.remberto asserts that the actual allegations in the section petition could not support a finding under section,subdivision d,because all that was alleged was that jessica reported such and such,not that anything actually happened.
remberto factual premise is correct.the various allegations are all written in terms of what jessica reported,not what remberto actually did.the only exceptions are,which states only innocuous facts,and,which alleges that the mother should have known of the sexual abuse of the child,but which sets forth no actual facts to support the insinuated assumption that there was sexual abuse.the argument forces us to examine the nature of pleadings in the juvenile dependency context.
a.the nature of pleadings in dependency court 
the basic pleading device in a dependency case is a petition.it may be an original petition,a subsequent petition for children who are already dependents when there are new facts or circumstances that bring them within a category of section other than those under which the original petition was sustained,or a supplemental petition when there are facts which indicate that a previous disposition is not appropriate.
on occasion,appellate courts have noted with a certain shock that a dependency petition appeared to have been written by a layperson.see in re fred d.in re nicholas th,fn,d.in other contexts the preparation of court pleadings on behalf of a third party by a layperson without lawyer supervision would be the unauthorized practice of law.but a specific statute,section,provides that juvenile court proceedings are commenced by the filing with the court by the social worker,of a petition.emphasis added.the inference is that the social worker may actually write the document,not just take it down to the clerk filing window.
of course,in light of the exigencies under which dependency petitions are prepared,an urgent need to protect children who might be in real danger when the petition is filed,it is hard to imagine any other procedure.deputy county counsels in large urban areas,often assigned to cover specific courtrooms,do not always have the time to rewrite the facts that social workers bring them.
the substantive requirements for the preparation of a dependency petition as prescribed by the legislature are set forth in subdivision f of section.that statute requires a dependency petition to contain a concise statement of facts,separately stated,to support the conclusion that the child upon whose behalf the petition is being brought is a person with the definition of each of the sections and subdivisions under which the proceedings are being instituted.
section governs what a juvenile court must do in the wake of a hearing on a petition.it provides that after hearing the evidence on a petition,the juvenile court shall make a finding,noted in the minutes of the court,whether or not the minor is a person described by section and the specific subdivisions of section under which the petition is sustained.
in addition to making the general findings described in section,juvenile courts are also required,by the rules of court,to make specific findings on each of the allegations in an original,subsequent or supplemental petition.california rules of court,rule a provides that if a parent denies the allegations of the petition,the court shall hold a contested hearing and determine whether the allegations in the petition are true.a few paragraphs later,the rule states that i f the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the allegations of the petition are true,the court shall make findings the allegations of the petition are true.cal.rules of court,rule f.conversely,i f the court determines that the allegations of the petition have not been proved by a preponderance of the evidence,the court shall make the following findings the allegations of the petition are not proved.cal.rules of court,rule h.california rules of court,rule sets up the same process for subsequent and supplemental petitions.rule d provides that for both subsequent and supplemental petitions,at the conclusion of the hearing the court shall find whether the allegations of the petition are or are not true.
b.the court found actual child abuse,not merely reports of it 
on occasion,social workers have been known to write petitions that do not state facts showing a child falls within one of the categories or descriptions set forth in section.the court of appeal has held that in such cases,in order to protect the due process rights of parents,a parent may challenge the legal sufficiency of the petition by a motion akin to a demurrer.in re fred,supra,d at.in re nicholas,supra,th at,d in re alysha th,d.and,on occasion,parents have demurred successfully to dependency petitions,nicholas,supra,th at,d allegations of emotional problems suffered by teenager were insufficient because there was no causal link to parents.
as the fred court explained,it has been held specifically that n otice of the allegations upon which the deprivation of custody is predicated is fundamental to due process accordingly,a parent must be given notice of the specific factual allegations against him or her with sufficient particularity to permit him or her to properly meet the charge.in re fred,supra,d at,quoting in re d,fred court emphasis.
the problem we face in the case before us is the tension between the specific factual allegations in the section subsequent petition,which merely alleged reports of abuse,and the finding of the trial court,which adjudicated the children to be within subdivision d of section,an adjudication which necessarily implies actual sexual abuse or the real possibility of actual sexual abuse,not merely a child imagined reports of it.
this tension may be resolved by reference to the stages of dependency litigation at which the petition or subsequent petition or supplemental petition are relevant.in the initial pleading stage,the role of the petition is to provide meaningful notice that must adequately communicate social worker concerns to the parent.see in re fred,supra,d at.if the parent believes that the allegations,as drafted,do not support a finding that the child is within one of the descriptions of section,the parent has the right to bring a motion akin to a demurrer.see generally id.at.
here,for example,if remberto really thought that the trial court would find his children to be within subdivision d of section merely because his eldest daughter had reported abuse,he could have brought a motion akin to a demurrer to correct any ensuing uncertainty.civ,subds.e pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute cause of action or f pleading is uncertain.instead,he waived any defects in procedure,and litigated the merits.indeed,in points and authorities on the res judicata issue,remberto lawyer construed the statements in the section petition as direct allegations of abuse,not just reports of it 
however,after a hearing on the merits has been held on the petition,the focus must necessarily be on the substance of the allegations found true by the juvenile court,not idiosyncratic particulars of the social worker precise language.anything less would allow parents to hold linguistic deficiencies in the petition as a kind of trump card by which they could attack a finding that a child fell within one of the descriptions of section,even though that finding was supported by substantial,indeed overwhelming evidence.
here,it is fair to evidenced by remberto own attorney points and authorities on the res judicata the substance of the paragraphs in the section petition found true by the trial court was that there was actual child abuse,not just the fact that a child believed she had been abused it follows,therefore,that the trial court order was based on actual sexual abuse specifically,that remberto had requested his daughter to take photographs of him without his clothes on and that he had fondled her breasts and therefore the children were properly adjudged to be within subdivision d of section 
the res judicata argument 
the original petition contained allegations of sexual abuse,but the original trial judge found them not to be proved.on appeal,remberto argues that the hearing on the second petition relitigated the same claims as the original petition,in contravention of the doctrine of res judicata 
the problem of the relitigation of child abuse claims has been addressed in blanca superior court,supra,th,d.the blanca court reviewed three decisions,in re carmaleta cal d,cynthia superior court cal th,d,and in re nathaniel d.the court concluded from those decisions that collateral estoppel effect should not be given at a hearing when the parents continue to deny that molestation ever happened and new evidence supports the denial.blanca,supra,th at,d.
here,the trial judge on the section petition noted that he was presented with a kind of blanca in reverse.on appeal,however,remberto counsel attempts to distinguish blanca,saying blanca involved substantial new evidence that cast doubt on the original jurisdictional finding,while here,supposedly,there was only a rehash of old evidence.
we disagree.new disclosures of child abuse,substantively different from previous disclosures,do constitute new evidence.
it is true that a set of allegations under subdivision d of section,which speaks only generically of sexual abuse,had been litigated with the original petition.and if jessica disclosures in the april interviews only reiterated those allegations,remberto might have a point.
he does,because one of the more horrible aspects of an adult sexual abuse of a child is typically the inculcation by the adult within the child of a reluctance to report the abuse to others,people roscoe d.noting expert may testify that as a class victims of molestation typically are reluctant to disclose or discuss the sordid episodes see also in re lucero,supra,cal th at,d,testimony of child abuse specialist that children recant reports of abuse to protect themselves and their families 
because victims of child molestation may not make complete disclosures of the extent of abuse initially,it would be too broad an application of collateral estoppel to hold that further disclosures could not be the subject of some sort of jurisdictional hearing to do so would be to penalize children who are too shy or reticent to disclose the full extent of their sexual abuse prior to the initial dependency petition.in effect,the damage done to the victim would be compounded by a wrong perpetrated by the invariable warning to the child not to tell.
here,jessica disclosed much more in her interview after the hearing on the original jurisdictional petition than she did before,the sexual intercourse,the pornographic exposures,the french kissing the new disclosures must necessarily,then,have constituted new evidence of different acts of abuse from those previously litigated.
b.the minors appeal 
the trial court should have allowedthe petition to be amended according to proof 
the minors have brought their own appeal,making two contentions.we begin with the one that is meritorious first,related as it is to our previous discussion regarding the role of pleadings in the juvenile dependency court.
as mentioned above,the subsequent petition had alleged that remberto had,on numerous occasions prior to august,penetrated his daughter vagina with his penis.some of jessica actual testimony,however,was to the effect that remberto had touched her vagina with his penis rather than penetrated her vagina.county counsel proposed to amend the subsequent section petition according to proof by substituting the word touching in the place of penetrating,but the trial court denied the request,largely because of its decision to treat the subsequent section petition as a section modification petition.
section is structured in such a way that a court must first examine whether the alleged change of circumstances or new evidence would even merit a hearing.much of the case law in the area centers around whether the trial court erred in not granting such a hearing at all.the trial judge noted this peculiarity of section,and concluded from it that he had no power to amend the petition according to the proof already received.said the trial judge,a is based on what has been presented in the petition.
regardless of whether the trial court was correct in proceeding under section,or should have stayed the course under section,it erred in not allowing amendment of the petition according to proof both section and provide for petitions.under section,the basic rules of amendment set forth in the code of civil procedure at section et apply to petitions and proceedings under the juvenile court law.there is nothing in section that exempts section modification petitions from the basic rules of amendment as spelled out in the code of civil procedure.
given the haste with which petitions are sometimes drafted,and section statement that only a concise statement of facts is required,the ability to amend according to proof plays an important role in the overall dependency scheme.if a variance between pleading and use the traditional term of art from the civil law see witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleadings,is so wide that it would,in effect,violate due process to allow the amendment,the court should,of course,refuse any such amendment 
the basic rule from civil law,however,is that amendments to conform to proof are favored,and should not be denied unless the pleading as drafted prior to the proposed amendment would have misled the adversarial party to its prejudice.see south bay building enterprises,riviera,th,d.here,it can not be seriously maintained that remberto would possibly have prepared his defense differently if the allegation had been that he had touched his daughter vagina with his penis,as distinct from penetrated.the basic allegation was there,and any variance between touching and penetrating could not have misled him to his detriment.both allegations are heinous,and entail the intimate violation of a child.
on the other hand,the refusal to allow an amendment according to proof was prejudicial to the minors.the reason is this it meant that the trial judge never considered the truth or falsity of whether remberto had touched,as distinct from penetrated,jessica vagina 
the ramifications of a finding on that issue,one way or the other,are significant for the future course of this dependency,as well as for any future dependencies involving remberto.as things now stand,for example,there has been no finding of severe sexual abuse,as defined in section,subdivision b severe sexual abuse includes contact,which can result in a total denial of reunification services.by not allowing the amendment,the trial court avoided consideration of a question that directly implicates future services.
here,allegations of sexual abuse were grave remberto was alleged,by his daughter,to have done things that would,under section,utterly preclude reunification.there was evidence of such things at the hearing.further,there was only minimal prejudice to remberto if the amendment had been allowed,because the nature of the allegation penetration and of the proof touching were quite similar.we therefore must conclude that the decision not to allow the amendment according to proof was an abuse of discretion.the case must be remanded to allow allegation to be amended,and for the court to consider whether that allegation,as amended,is true 
the trial court was notrequired to find the other allegationsof abuse to be true 
the minors last point is essentially a sufficiency of evidence argument.they claim there was no rational basis for the trial court to conclude that the remaining allegations of sexual abuse were not true.
the issue is a tough one,because we agree with the minors and county counsel that substantial evidence would have supported finding the remaining allegations to be true.but credibility is governed by more than just the words transcribed by a court reporter.a trier of fact is free to disbelieve a witness,even one uncontradicted,if there is any rational ground for doing so.see blank coffin cal d,see also guerra balestrieri d,the trier of the facts is not required to believe everything that a witness says even if uncontradicted.
we can think of two rational reasons why the trial judge was not required to believe everything that jessica said.the first is the flip side of our point about progressive disclosures,and is general.the traumatic nature of some sexual abuse,in conjunction with multiple interviews by adults,may prompt a child to exaggerate in a case like this.only the trial judge as a trier of fact is in a position to separate the truth from the exaggeration,sometimes revealed by things like verbal hesitancy and body language which are not picked up in a reporter transcript.
the second reason is specific to this case.the trial judge was familiar with a psychologist report that not only refused to find that remberto had probably molested his children,but which warned against counseling that was focused on the alleged the psychologist word sexual abuse.given such equivocation from the examining psychologist,it follows that the trial judge could rationally treat jessica testimony with at least a little skepticism.
iv.disposition 
the order is affirmed to the extent that it finds the children came within subdivision d of section,and to the extent that it finds the substance of allegations,and of the section petition to be true.it is affirmed to the extent that it finds the substance of the allegations d,and not to be true.
the order is reversed to the extent that it finds allegation not to be true.the matter is remanded to the trial court to consider whether the substance of allegation,as county counsel proposed to amend it,is true or false.
all statutory references in this opinion are to that code unless otherwise specified.
in contrast to the psychologist in blanca superior court th,d,who actually came to a legally useful conclusion,the psychologist here ducked the issue.most of her report was a retelling of what members of the family had told her.her only conclusion on the subject of whether remberto had molested his children was this unfortunately,it can be extremely difficult to ascertain and evaluate all factors surrounding allegations of child sexual abuse.at the present time,remberto visitations with his children need to remain monitored by a reliable adult.clearly,as suggested by the reference to monitoring immediately following the reference to sexual abuse,the psychologist was not willing to sign off on remberto probably not having committed child molestation.but then again,a paragraph later,the psychologist downplayed the probabil
