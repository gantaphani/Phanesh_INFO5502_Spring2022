we granted review in this case,as well as in elisa superior court,cal th,d,wl,and kristine lisa,cal th,d,wl,to consider the parental rights and obligations,if any,of a woman with regard to a child born to her partner in a lesbian relationship.
in the present case,we must decide whether a woman who provided ova to her lesbian partner so that the partner could bear children by means of in vitro fertilization is a parent of those children.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that family code section,subdivision b,which provides that a man is not a father if he provides semen to a physician to inseminate a woman who is not his wife,does not apply when a woman provides her ova to impregnate her partner in a lesbian relationship in order to produce children who will be raised in their joint home.accordingly,when partners in a lesbian relationship decide to produce children in this manner,both the woman who provides her ova and her partner who bears the children are the children parents.
on march,petitioner filed a petition to establish a parental relationship with twin girls born to respondent,her former lesbian partner.alleged that she is the biological parent of the minor children because s he donated her egg to respondent,the gestational mother of the children.moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that,although and were lesbian partners who lived together until this action was filed,explicitly donated her ovum under a clear written agreement by which she relinquished any claim to offspring born of her donation.
on april,filed a motion for custody of and visitation with the twins.
a hearing was held at which testified that she first considered raising a child before she met,at a time when she did not have a partner.she met in october,and they became romantically involved in june.told that she planned to adopt a baby as a single mother.applied for adoption in november.and began living together in march,and registered as domestic partners in san francisco.
visited several fertility clinics in march,to inquire about artificial insemination and she attempted artificial insemination,without success,on occasions from july,through november.accompanied her to most of these appointments.testified that she and planned to raise the child together,while insisted that,although was very supportive,made it clear that her intention was to become a single parent.
in december,consulted with mary martin at the fertility practice of the university of california at san francisco medical center ucsf.first attempts at in vitro fertilization failed because she was unable to produce sufficient ova.in january,martin suggested using ova.then asked to donate her ova,explaining that she would accept the ova only if would really be a donor and would be the mother of any child,adding that she would not even consider permitting to adopt the child for at least five years until she felt the relationship was stable and would endure.told that she had seen too many lesbian relationships end quickly,and she did not want to be in a custody battle.and agreed they would not tell anyone that was the ova donor.
acknowledged that she agreed not to disclose to anyone that she was the ova donor,but insisted that she only agreed to provide her ova because she and had agreed to raise the child together.and selected the sperm donor together.denied that had said she wanted to be a single parent and insisted that she would not have donated her ova had she known intended to be the sole parent.
on march,signed a form on ucsf letterhead entitled consent form for ovum donor known.the form states that agrees to have eggs taken from my ovaries,in order that they may be donated to another woman.after explaining the medical procedures involved,the form states on the third page it is understood that i waive any right and relinquish any claim to the donated eggs or any pregnancy or offspring that might result from them.i agree that the recipient may regard the donated eggs and any offspring resulting therefrom as her own children.the following appears on page of the form,above signature and the signature of a witness i specifically disclaim and waive any right in or any child that may be conceived as a result of the use of any ovum or egg of mine,and i agree not to attempt to discover the identity of the recipient thereof.signed a form entitled consent form for ovum recipient that stated,in part i acknowledge that the child or children produced by the ivf procedure is and shall be my own legitimate child or children and the heir or heirs of my body with all rights and privileges accompanying such status.
testified she received these two forms in a letter from ucsf dated february,and discussed the consent forms with during february and march.stated she would not have accepted ova if had not signed the consent form,because wanted to have a child on her own and believed the consent form protected her in this regard.
testified to the contrary that she first saw the ovum donation consent form minutes before she signed it on march.admitted reading the form,but thought parts of the form were odd and did not pertain to her,such as the part stating that the donor promised not to discover the identity of the recipient.she did not intend to relinquish her rights and only signed the form so that we could have children.despite having signed the form,thought she was going to be a parent.
ova were withdrawn from on april,and embryos were implanted in on april.and told m father about the resulting pregnancy by announcing that he was going to be a grandfather.the twins were born on december.the twins birth certificates listed as their mother and did not reflect a father name.as they had agreed,neither nor told anyone had donated the ova,including their friends,family and the twins pediatrician.soon after the twins were born,asked to marry her,and on christmas day,the couple exchanged rings.
within a month of their birth,added the twins to her health insurance policy,named them as her beneficiary for all employment benefits,and increased her life insurance with the twins as the beneficiary.did not do the same.
referred to her mother,as well as parents,as the twins grandparents and referred to sister and brother as the twins aunt and uncle,and nieces as their cousins.two school forms listed both and respondent as the twins parents.the children nanny testified that both and were the babies mother.
the relationship between and ended in march,and filed the present action.in september,and the twins moved to massachusetts to live with mother.
the superior court granted motion to dismiss finding,in a statement of decision,that knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently executed the ovum donor form,thereby acknowledging her understanding that,by the donation of her ova,she was relinquishing and waiving all rights to claim legal parentage of any children who might result from the in vitro fertilization and implantation of her ova in a recipient in this case,a known recipient,her domestic partner testimony on the subject of her execution of the ovum donor form was contradictory and not always credible.
and agreed prior to the conception of the children that would be the sole parent unless the children were later adopted,and told prior to her ovum donation that she would not consider an adoption by until some years later.and agreed in advance of the ovum donation that they would not tell others of genetic connection to the children they also agreed that if and when it became appropriate they would consider how to inform the children and they abided by this agreement until late.
by voluntarily signing the ovum donation form,was donating genetic material.her position was analogous to that of a sperm donor,who is treated as a legal stranger to a child if he donates sperm through a licensed physician and surgeon under family code section,subdivision b.the court finds no reason to treat ovum donors as having greater claims to parentage than sperm donors 
the court accepts the proposition that a child may have two legal mothers and assumed it to be the law in its analysis of the evidence herein.
claim to presumed parenthood rests upon her contention that she has met the criteria of family code section,subdivision d has failed to establish either that she received the twins into her home or that she held them out as her natural child ren.although treated the twins in all regards as though they were her own and there can be no question but that they are fully bonded to her as such,the children were received into the parties home as children and,up until late,both parties scrupulously held confidential petitioner natural,in this case,her genetic relationship to the children.
is not estopped by her conduct the court finds that petitioner was not misled by any such conduct that she knew that respondent did not intend thereby to confer parental rights upon her 
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment,ruling that did not qualify as a parent because substantial evidence supports the trial courts factual finding that only intended to bring about the birth of a child whom she intended to raise as her own.the court observed that the status of is consistent with the status of a sperm donor under the uniform parentage act,treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived.citation.having concluded that the parties intended at the time of conception that only would be the child mother,the court concluded that the parties actions following the birth did not alter this agreement.the court of appeal concluded that if the parties had changed their intentions and wanted to be a parent,their only option was adoption.
we granted review.
discussion 
asserts that she is a parent of the twins because she supplied the ova that were fertilized in vitro and implanted in her lesbian partner,resulting in the birth of the twins.as we will explain,we agree that is a parent of the twins because she supplied the ova that produced the children,and family code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,which provides that a man is not a father if he provides semen to a physician to inseminate a woman who is not his wife,does not apply because supplied her ova to impregnate her lesbian partner in order to produce children who would be raised in their joint home 
the determination of parentage is governed by the uniform parentage act upa.et as we observe in the companion case of elisa superior court,supra,cal th,d at,at,the upa defines the p arent and child relationship,which extends equally to every child and to every parent,regardless of the marital status of the parents.
in johnson calvert cal th,d,we determined that a wife whose ovum was fertilized in vitro by her husband sperm and implanted in a surrogate mother was the natural mother of the child thus produced.we noted that the upa states that provisions applicable to determining a father and child relationship shall be used to determine a mother and child relationship insofar as practicable.johnson calvert,supra,at,d,citing former,now.we relied,therefore,on the provisions in the upa regarding presumptions of paternity and concluded that genetic consanguinity could be the basis for a finding of maternity just as it is for paternity.johnson calvert,supra,cal th at,d,in re marriage of buzzanca th,d.under this authority,genetic relationship to the children in the present case constitutes evidence of a mother and child relationship as contemplated by the act.citations.johnson,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal in the present case concluded,however,that was not a parent of the twins,despite her genetic relationship to them,because she had the same status as a sperm donor.section b states the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician and surgeon for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived.in johnson,we considered the predecessor statute to section b,former civil code section.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,fn,d.we did not discuss whether this statute applied to a woman who provides ova used to impregnate another woman,but we observed that in a true egg donation situation,where a woman gestates and gives birth to a child formed from the egg of another woman with the intent to raise the child as her own,the birth mother is the natural mother under california law.id.at,fn,d.we held that the statute did not apply under the circumstances in johnson,because the husband and wife in johnson did not intend to donate their sperm and ova to the surrogate mother,but rather intended to procreate a child genetically related to them by the only available means.johnson,supra,at,d.
the circumstances of the present case are not identical to those in johnson,but they are similar in a crucial respect both the couple in johnson and the couple in the present case intended to produce a child that would be raised in their own home.in johnson,it was clear that the married couple did not intend to donate their semen and ova to the surrogate mother,but rather permitted their semen and ova to be used to impregnate the surrogate mother in order to produce a child to be raised by them.in the present case,contends that she did not intend to donate her ova,but rather provided her ova so that could give birth to a child to be raised jointly by and hotly contests this,asserting that donated her ova to,agreeing that would be the sole parent.it is undisputed,however,that the couple lived together and that they both intended to bring the child into their joint home.thus,even accepting as true version of the facts which the superior court did,the present case,like johnson,does not present a true egg donation situation.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,fn,d.did not intend to simply donate her ova to,but rather provided her ova to her lesbian partner with whom she was living so that could give birth to a child that would be raised in their joint home.even if we assume that the provisions of section b apply to women who donate ova,the statute does not apply under the circumstances of the present case.an examination of the history of b supports our conclusion.
the predecessor to section b,former civil code section,was enacted in as part of the upa.stats,ch.section,subdivision b,of the model upa states the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician for use in artificial insemination of a married woman other than the donor wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived.the comment to this portion of the model act notes that this provision was not intended to solve all questions posed by the use of artificial insemination this act does not deal with many complex and serious legal problems raised by the practice of artificial insemination.it was though t useful,however,to single out and cover in this act at least one fact situation that occurs frequently.west.laws ann.parentage act,com.to.
although the predecessor to section was based upon the model upa,the california legislature made one significant change it expanded the reach of the provision to apply to both married and unmarried women.section is derived almost verbatim from the upa as originally drafted,with one crucial exception.the original upa restricts application of the nonpaternity provision of subdivision b to a married woman other than the donor wife.citation.the word married is excluded from subdivision b of section,so that in california,subdivision b applies to all women,married or not.thus,the california legislature has afforded unmarried as well as married women a statutory vehicle for obtaining semen for artificial insemination without fear that the donor may claim paternity,and has likewise provided men with a statutory vehicle for donating semen to married and unmarried women alike without fear of liability for child support.jhordan mary d,fn.omitted.
under the model upa,a man who donated semen that was used to impregnate a woman who was married to someone other than the donor would not be considered the father of the resulting child.but the provision would not apply,and the semen donor would be considered the father of the child,if the woman impregnated was unmarried.therefore,this provision of the model act would not apply if a man provided semen that was used to impregnate his unmarried partner in order to produce a child that would be raised in their joint home,and the man would be considered the father of the resulting child.
in adopting the model act,california expanded the reach of this provision by omitting the word married,so that unmarried women could avail themselves of artificial insemination.this omission was purposeful.as originally introduced in,senate bill reg.sess.proposed adopting verbatim the language of the model upa and,thus,would have limited the reach of former civil code section to married women.bill reg.sess,as introduced.on may,however,the bill was amended in the senate to delete the word married.
it is clear,therefore,that california intended to expand the protection of the model act to include unmarried women so that unmarried women could avail themselves of artificial insemination.but there is nothing to indicate that california intended to expand the reach of this provision so far that it would apply if a man provided semen to be used to impregnate his unmarried partner in order to produce a child that would be raised in their joint home.it would be surprising,to say the least,to conclude that the legislature intended such a result.the colorado supreme court considered a related issue and reached a similar conclusion.
in in interest of,the colorado supreme court addressed a colorado statute identical to section b,which applied to both married and unmarried women.at issue were the parental rights,if any,of a man who provided semen to a physician that was used to impregnate an unmarried friend of the man.the man claimed that the woman had promised that he would be treated as the child father.the court recognized that the model upa addressed only the artificial insemination of a woman married to someone other than the semen donor,adding that the parental rights of a semen donor are least clearly understood when the semen donor is known and the recipient is unmarried,supra,at.the court concluded that the statute did not apply when a man donated semen to an unmarried woman with the understanding that he would be the father of the resulting child w e conclude that the general assembly neither considered nor intended to affect the rights of known donors who gave their semen to unmarried women for use in artificial insemination with the agreement that the donor would be the father of any child so conceived.the statute simply does not apply in that circumstance.id.at.
the colorado supreme court was thus faced with a situation in which a man provided semen,through a physician,to an unmarried friend who allegedly had promised that the man would be the father of the resulting child.the court concluded that the model upa,and the colorado statute based upon it,were not intended to apply to such circumstances.we are faced with an even more compelling situation,because and were more than friends when provided her ova,through a physician,to be used to impregnate they lived together and were registered domestic partners.although the parties dispute whether both women were intended to be parents of the resulting child,it is undisputed that they intended that the resulting child would be raised in their joint home.neither the model upa,nor section b was intended to apply under such circumstances 
as noted above,genetic relationship with the twins constitutes evidence of a mother and child relationship under the upa johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d,and,as explained above,section b does not apply to exclude as a parent of the twins.the circumstance that gave birth to the twins also constitutes evidence of a mother and child relationship.johnson calvert,supra,cal th at,d.thus,both and are mothers of the twins under the upa 
it is true we said in johnson that for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.but as we explain in the companion case of elisa superior court,supra,cal th,d at,at,this statement in johnson must be understood in light of the issue presented in that case our decision in johnson does not preclude a child from having two parents both of whom are women.
justice werdegar dissent argues that we should determine whether is a parent using the intent test we developed in johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.in johnson,an embryo created using the sperm and egg of a married couple was implanted in a surrogate mother.it was undisputed that the husband was the father of the resulting child,but the wife and the surrogate both claimed to be the mother.we recognized that both women have adduced evidence of a mother and child relationship under the wife because she is genetically related to the child and the surrogate because she gave birth to the we rejected the suggestion that,under the circumstances of that case,the child could have two mothers,leaving the child with three parents.id.at,fn,d.in order to determine which woman was the child sole mother under the upa,we looked to their respective intents because two women each have presented acceptable proof of maternity,we do not believe this case can be decided without enquiring into the parties intentions id.at,d.
as the dissent acknowledges,a child can have two mothers.thus,this case differs from johnson in that both and can be the children mothers.unlike in johnson,their parental claims are not mutually exclusive.acknowledges that is the twins mother.does not claim to be the twins mother instead of,but in addition to,so we need not consider their intent in order to decide between them.in re marriage of moschetta th,d johnson intent test does not apply when t here is no tie to break.rather,the parentage of the twins is determined by application of the upa.is the twins mother because she gave birth to them and also is the twins mother because she provided the ova from which they were produced.
justice werdegar dissent claims that we are changing the law by creating a new rule for determining whether a woman who supplies an ovum is the mother of the resulting child.dis.opn.of werdegar,post,d at,at.we are not.nothing in johnson suggests that the intent test applies in cases not involving surrogacy agreements,and the dissent agrees that the linchpin of the decision in a child can not have two not apply here,d at,at.we simply hold that section b,which creates an exception to the usual rules governing parentage that applies when a man donates semen to inseminate a woman who is not his wife,does not apply under the circumstances of this case in which supplied ova to impregnate her lesbian partner in order to produce children who would be raised in their joint home.because the exception provided in section b does not apply,parentage is determined by the usual provisions of the upa.as noted above,under the upa,genetic relationship to the twins constitutes evidence of a mother and child relationship.johnson calvert,supra,cal th,d.
it would be unwise to expand application of the johnson intent test as suggested by justice werdegar dissent beyond the circumstances presented in johnson.usually,whether there is evidence of a parent and child relationship under the upa does not depend upon the intent of the parent.for example,a man who engages in sexual intercourse with a woman who assures him,falsely,that she is incapable of conceiving children is the father of a resulting child,despite his lack of intent to become a father.
justice werdegar dissent states that predictability in this area is important,but relying upon a later judicial determination of the intent of the parties,as the dissent suggests,would not provide such predictability.the present case is a good example.justice werdegar dissent concludes that did not intend to become a parent,because the superior court found on the basis of conflicting evidence that she did not,noting that w e must defer to the trial court findings on this point because substantial evidence supports them.dis.opn.of werdegar,post,d at,at.had the superior court reached the opposite conclusion,however,the dissent presumably again would defer to the trial court findings and reach the opposite conclusion that is a parent of the twins.rather than provide predictability,therefore,using the intent test would rest the determination of parentage upon a later judicial determination of intent made years after the birth of the child.
justice werdegar dissent cites troxel granville,d for the proposition that we can not recognize as a parent without diminishing existing parental rights.dis.opn.of werdegar,post,d at,at.the high court decision in troxel has no application here.neither nor claim to parentage preceded the other.claim to be the twins mother because the twins were produced from her ova is equal to,and arose at the same time as,claim to be the twins mother because she gave birth to them.
the superior court in the present case found that signed a waiver form,thereby relinquishing and waiving all rights to claim legal parentage of any children who might result.but such a waiver does not affect our determination of parentage.section provides regardless of its terms,an agreement between an alleged or presumed father and the mother or child does not bar an action under this chapter.see in re marriage of buzzanca,supra,th,d it is well established that parents can not,by agreement,limit or abrogate a child right to support.a woman who supplies ova to be used to impregnate her lesbian partner,with the understanding that the resulting child will be raised in their joint home,can not waive her responsibility to support that child.nor can such a purported waiver effectively cause that woman to relinquish her parental rights.
in light of our conclusion that section b does not apply and that is the twins parent together with,based upon genetic relationship to the twins,we need not,and do not,consider whether is presumed to be a parent of the twins under section,subdivision d,which provides that a man is presumed to be a child father if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.
unlike the majority,i would apply the controlling statutes as written.the statutory scheme for determining parentage contains two provisions that resolve claim to be a parent of the twins born to under one provision,a man who donates sperm for artificial insemination of a woman to whom he is not married is not the father of the resulting child,subd.b.under the other provision,rules for determining fatherhood are to be used for determining motherhood i nsofar as practical.because donated her ova for artificial insemination and implantation in another woman,and knowingly and voluntarily signed a document declaring her intention not to become a parent of any resulting children,she is not a parent of the twins.
in,and began living together as a couple,and some months later they registered as domestic partners.had long wanted to become a mother but had been unsuccessful in conceiving.she eventually pursued in vitro fertilization,but her body failed to produce sufficient ova.her physician then suggested that she obtain ova from,her partner.orally agreed that she would donate ova,and that would be the only parent of any resulting child unless were later to become a parent through a formal adoption.evidenced her intent that was to be the sole parent by signing the ova donor form,which provided that she renounced any claim to her donated ova,a fetus,or a child born from her ova.
donated her ova,which were fertilized with sperm from an anonymous donor and implanted in,who ultimately gave birth to twin girls.the twins lived with the couple for five years.after the couple separated,petitioned the superior court for establishment of a parental relationship with the twins,and for rights to custody and visitation.
after a hearing,at which considerable evidence was presented,the superior court dismissed parentage action.describing testimony about her misunderstanding of the ova donor form as not always credible,the trial court found that and had agreed prior to the conception of the children that would be their only parent.the court observed that intent to be the sole parent responsible for the support and maintenance of any children born of the ova implanted in her uterus was evidenced when she signed the ova recipient form acknowledging that the children produced by the in vitro fertilization procedure would be her children with all the rights and privileges accompanying such status.the court also noted that had failed to show that she had no choice but to sign the standard form provided by the in vitro fertilization clinic,and that she could not have donated her ova under a different agreement in which she was designated as an intended parent of any child born to hence it ruled that had voluntarily relinquished any claim to being a mother of any children born to 
the court further ruled that did not meet the statutory definition of a presumed mother,subd.d elisa superior court,cal th,d at,at elisa,because she had failed to meet both prongs of the statutory test receiving the children into her home,and holding them out as her natural children.although had received the twins into her home,she had not held them out as her natural children indeed she had not disclosed to others her genetic connection to the twins until,when the couple relationship began to falter.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court.
the court of appeal held that had made a voluntary and informed choice to donate her ova to,and that status with respect to any child born as a result of the ova donation was analogous to that of a sperm donor,who,by statute,is treated as if he were not the natural father of any child conceived as a result of the sperm donation.the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician and surgeon for use in artificial insemination of a woman other than the donor wife is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived,subd.b.by analogy i would apply that statute here.section states that i nsofar as is practicable the provisions applicable to a father and child relationship are to be used to determine a mother and child relationship.
here it is practicable to treat a woman who donates ova to a licensed physician for in vitro fertilization and implantation in another woman in the same fashion as a man who donates sperm to a licensed physician for artificial insemination of a woman to whom he is not married.treating male and female donors alike is not only practicable,but it is also consistent with the trial court factual finding here that intended to donate ova to so that would be the sole mother of a child born to her.
as the majority here explains,california legislature has drafted the sperm donor statute in such a way as to allow unmarried women to use artificial insemination to conceive,and to permit them to become the sole parent of any child so conceived,if they use sperm that the donor has provided to a licensed physician,ante,d at,at.here,used sperm donated in that fashion,ensuring that the sperm donor would have no claim of fatherhood to any child to whom she gave birth.this she was entitled to do under california law.jhordan mary d.
i recognize that california law does not expressly address the maternal status of ova donors.but,as i have explained in the past,the uniform parentage act,as codified in our family code,remains the only statutory guidance this court has in resolving this case.johnson calvert cal th,d,dis.opn.of kennard,johnson.accordingly,as i said earlier,i would apply the sperm donor statute to women who donate their ova in compliance with section,subdivision b.as the trial court here explained position was analogous to that of a sperm donor,who is treated as a legal stranger to the child if he donates sperm through a licensed physician and surgeon.like the trial court,i see no reason to treat ovum donors as having greater claims to parentage than sperm donors.
the analogy between sperm and ova donors is not new.indeed,in johnson,supra,cal th page,footnote,d,this court signalled its view that an ova donor would not be treated as the child mother.johnson held that in a true egg donation situation,where a woman gestates and gives birth to a child formed from the egg of another women with the intent to raise the child as her own,the birth mother is the natural mother under california law.ibid.nearly two years after that decision,in this case undertook in vitro fertilization with ova from 
in the years since this court decision in johnson,supra cal th,d,an unknown number of californians have made procreative choices in reliance on it.for example,in the companion case of kristine lisa,cal th,d,a lesbian couple obtained a prebirth stipulated judgment declaring them to be the joint intended legal parents italics added of the child born to one of them,language they presumably used in order to bring themselves within johnson where the preconception intent to be come a parent is the determinative inquiry.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.we do know that prebirth judgments of parentage on behalf of the nonbiologically related partner of a child biological parent have been entered in this state,and that such judgments were touted to couples as less expensive and time consuming than second parent adoption.doskow,the second parent trap parenting for couples in a brave new world juv,fns.citing judgments entered in san francisco,los angeles,and san luis obispo counties see also mak,partners in law,law.how will today majority holding affect the validity of the various procreative choices made in reliance on johnson the majority decision offers no answers.
the majority desire to give the twins a second parent is understandable and laudable.to achieve that worthy goal,however,the majority must rewrite a statute and disregard the intentions that the parties expressed when the twins were conceived.the majority amends the statute by inserting a new provision making a sperm donor the legal father of a child born to a woman artificially inseminated with his sperm whenever the sperm donor and the birth mother intended that the resulting child would be raised in their joint home,even though both the donor and birth mother also intended that the donor not be the child father,ante,d at,at,italics added.finding nothing in the statutory language or history to support this construction,i reject it.relying on the plain meaning of the statutory language,and the trial court findings that both and intended that would be the only parent of any children resulting from the artificial insemination,i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which in turn affirmed the trial court,rejecting claim to parentage of the twins born to 
the majority determines that the twins who developed from the ova donated to have two mothers rather than one.while i disagree,as i shall explain,with that ultimate conclusion,i agree with the majority premise that a child can have two mothers.our previous holding that for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother johnson calvert cal th,d,johnson must be understood in the context in which it married couple who intended to become parents and provided their fertilized ova to a gestational surrogate who did not intend to become a,thus understood,may properly be limited to cases in which to recognize a second mother would inject an unwanted third parent into an existing family.when,in contrast to johnson,no natural or adoptive father exists,two women who intend to become mothers of the same child may do so either through adoption sharon superior court cal th,d,or because both qualify as natural mothers under the uniform parentage act,et upa,one having donated the ovum and the other having given birth see johnson,at,d.
while scientific advances in reproductive technology now afford individuals previously unimagined opportunities to become parents,the same advances have also created novel,sometimes heartbreaking issues concerning the identification of the resulting children legal parents.declarations of parentage in this context implicate complex and delicate biological,personal,legal and social policy considerations.for these reasons,courts have sought above all to avoid foreseeable disputes over parentage with rules that provide predictability by permitting the various persons who must cooperate to bring children into the world through assisted reproduction to determine in advance who will and will not be parents,based on their expressed and voluntarily chosen intentions.see,johnson,supra,cal th,d.
precisely because predictability in this area is so important,i can not agree with the majority that the children in this case do in fact have two mothers.until today,when one woman has provided the ova and another has given birth,the established rule for determining disputed claims to motherhood was clear we looked to the intent of the parties.i n a true egg donation situation,where a woman gestates and gives birth to a child formed from the egg of another woman with the intent to raise the child as her own,the birth mother is the natural mother under california law.johnson,supra,cal th,fn,d.contrary to the majority apparent assumption,to limit johnson holding that a child can have only one mother to cases involving existing families does not require us to abandon johnson intent test as the method for determining disputed claims of motherhood arising from the use of reproductive technology.indeed,we have no other test sufficient to the task.
furthermore,to apply johnson intent test to the facts of this case necessarily leads to the conclusion that is a mother and is not.that intended to become the the only the children to whom she gave birth is unquestioned.whether for her part also intended to become the children mother was disputed,but the trial court found on the basis of conflicting evidence that she did not.we must defer to the trial court findings on this point because substantial evidence supports them.represented in connection with the ovum donation process,both orally and in writing,that she did not intend to become the children mother,and consistently with those representations subsequently held the children out to the world as but not her own.thus constrained by the facts,the majority can justify its conclusion that is also the children mother only by changing the law.this the majority does by displacing johnson intent least for the purposes of this the following new rule a woman who has supplied her ova to impregnate her lesbian partner in order to produce children who would be raised in their joint home,ante,d at,at see also,d at,at,is a mother of the resulting children regardless of any preconception manifestations of intent to the contrary.
i find the majority reasons for not applying the johnson intent test unpersuasive.the majority criticizes the test as basing the determination of parentage upon a later judicial determination of intent made years after the birth of the child,ante,d at,at.but the task of determining the intent of persons who have undertaken assisted reproduction is not fundamentally different than the task of determining intent in the context of disputes involving contract,tort or criminal law,something courts have done satisfactorily for centuries.the expectation that courts will in most cases accurately decide factual issues such as intent is one of the fundamental premises of our judicial system.indeed,the majority itself expresses willingness to continue applying the johnson intent test to determine whether gestational surrogacy agreements are enforceable.this position leaves no plausible basis for refusing to apply the same test to determine whether ovum donation agreements are enforceable.ovum donation and gestational surrogacy agreements are two sides of the same coin each involves an ovum provider,a gestator,and an agreement about who will become the parent or parents of any resulting offspring.indeed,when two women divide in this way the genetic and gestational components of motherhood,only an examination of their intent permits us to determine whether we are dealing with an ovum donation agreement,a gestational surrogacy agreement,or neither.if courts can perform one of these tasks acceptably,they can also perform the other 
no more persuasive is the majority suggestion that to respect the formally expressed intent of the parties to an ovum donation agreement is prohibit
