charisma charisma and kristina kristina were a same sex couple who began dating in july,moved in together in august,and registered as domestic partners with the state of california in january in december,the couple decided they wanted to have children and kristina would be the first to try to become pregnant.following several months of effort,kristina became pregnant by artificial insemination and gave birth to amalia in april.in july,kristina moved out of the home she shared with charisma,taking amalia with her.kristina appeals from the trial court orders declaring charisma a presumed parent of amalia and establishing a schedule for reunification of charisma and amalia.among other things,we reject kristina contentions that charisma did not parent amalia for a sufficient period of time to be declared a presumed parent under family code section,subd.d hereafter section d and we hold kristina has not shown the trial court orders violate her constitutional rights to equal protection and due process.in a,charisma contends the court misunderstood the scope of its authority with respect to allocation of her travel expenses for the reunification process.the has merit.we affirm the trial court orders except as to allocation of the travel expenses,which we reverse and remand to provide the court an opportunity to exercise its discretion 
background 
after deciding they wanted children,charisma and kristina contacted a sperm bank,jointly filled out the required paperwork to obtain sperm from an anonymous donor,and pursued their goal of kristina becoming pregnant through artificial insemination.charisma assisted kristina in the insemination process.the couple kept a joint journal regarding the process,in which kristina was referred to as mommy and charisma was referred to as momma.
after five months of attempts at insemination,charisma ordered two additional vials of sperm in early july.on the evening of july,charisma used one vial to inseminate kristina at home the next morning kristina took the second vial to a doctor who inseminated her through intrauterine insemination.one of these two inseminations resulted in kristina becoming pregnant.
amalia was born in april.charisma was present for the birth and cut the umbilical cord.on the birth certificate,signed by kristina,amalia was given a hyphenated last name that was a combination of charisma and kristina last names.the couple brought amalia into their home and shared parenting responsibilities for the first six weeks of her life.at that point,kristina returned to work and charisma cared for amalia during the day she also provided care at night.
in july,approximately seven weeks after kristina returned to work,she moved out of the home she shared with charisma,taking amalia with her.since then,and before the trial court ordered reunification in,kristina allowed charisma to see amalia on only two occasions in the summer of.in the summer of,kristina moved to texas with amalia 
in may,charisma filed a petition to establish a parental relationship with amalia.the trial court denied the petition,concluding that charisma lacked standing to bring the action under the uniform parentage act upa et.charisma kristina th,d charisma i.charisma appealed,and this court reversed in june,concluding that charisma had standing to establish parentage under the upa despite the fact that she lacked a biological relationship to amalia.charisma i,at,d,citing elisa superior court cal th,d,elisa.because the trial court did not have the benefit of the elisa decision at the time of its initial ruling,this court remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination,in light of elisa,whether charisma is a presumed parent under section d and,if so,whether this is an appropriate case in which to rebut the parentage presumption.charisma i,at,d.
on remand,the trial court found that charisma is a presumed parent and that the presumption had not been rebutted.the court appointed custody evaluators who reported that adoption of a reunification plan would be appropriate.in may,the court adopted a plan for gradual reunification of charisma and amalia through joint therapy sessions in texas with a therapist.
discussion 
substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the section d parentage presumption is applicable 
under the upa,an interested person may bring an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of a mother and child relationship,subd.a.section d provides that a man is presumed to be the father of a child if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.as explained in adoption of michael cal th,d,an unwed father rights and duties substantially depend on whether he is a presumed father within the meaning of section.citations.t o become a presumed father,a man who has neither married nor attempted to marry his child biological mother must not only openly and publicly admit paternity,but must also physically bring the child into his home.see also in re spencer th,d spencer.in elisa,supra,cal th at pages,d,the court held that a biological mother former same sex partner may be declared a presumed parent under a application of section d.see also charisma i,supra,th at,d.
in elisa,the el dorado county district attorney filed a complaint to establish that elisa was the parent of twins born to her former partner,emily,and to order elisa to pay child support.elisa denied she was the children parent.elisa,supra,cal th at,d.it was undisputed that elisa participated in the artificial insemination of emily with the understanding that they would raise the resulting child or children as coparents,and they did in fact coparent the children in a common family home for over one and years.id.at,d.the court pointed out that section,subdivision a,states that provisions applicable to determining a father and child relationship shall be used to determine a mother and child relationship insofar as practicable,and concluded elisa could be considered a presumed parent under section d.elisa,at,d.the case was not an appropriate action to rebut the presumption of parentage with evidence that there was no biological relationship between elisa and the twins because to allow the presumption to be so rebutted would be contrary to the public policy favoring a child having two parents to provide emotional and financial support.id.at,d,see also charisma i,supra,th at,d.
on remand from charisma i,supra,th,d,charisma bore the burden of proving she is a presumed parent under section d by a preponderance of the evidence.spencer,supra,th at,d glen superior court th,d.on appeal,we review the trial court determination under the substantial evidence standard w e are bound to uphold the trial court judgment so long as the record is free from prejudicial error and the judgment is supported by evidence which is substantial,that is,of ponderable legal significance,reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value citations.howard owens corning th,d.under that standard,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.citations.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.even in cases where the evidence is undisputed or uncontradicted,if two or more different inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence this court is without power to substitute its own inferences or deductions for those of the trier of fact,which must resolve such conflicting inferences in the absence of a rule of law specifying the inference to be drawn.we must accept as true all evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence tending to establish the correctness of the trial court findings and decision,resolving every conflict in favor of the judgment.citations,at,d.
kristina evidentiary objections 
kristina objected below to aspects of declarations filed by charisma,on the grounds of lack of personal knowledge and lack of foundation.however,the trial court never ruled on her objections.where a party fails to obtain a ruling from the trial court,the objections generally are not preserved on appeal.bussard minimed,th,fn,d.appellate courts sometimes decline to apply that rule where the party unsuccessfully pressed for a ruling below,but kristina failed to do so in this case see siam kizilbash th,d party orally requested a ruling and obtained a blanket ruling of sorts city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d party made two oral requests for rulings.citing thomas quintero th,d,kristina argues this court may consider her objections even though she failed to obtain a ruling below.however,that case held only that reviewing courts may consider evidentiary objections for the first time on appeal where the lower court disposed of the motion on a legal ground not requiring a consideration of the evidence presented.id.at,d.the court acknowledged the general rule that a party forfeits objections to evidence where the party fails to obtain a ruling from the trial court.id.at,d.because the trial court actually and necessarily considered the evidence presented,kristina objections have been forfeited.
in any event,the specific evidentiary objections asserted on appeal are either without merit or relate to evidence unnecessary to support the trial court judgment.kristina argues there is no basis to conclude she authored or authorized a birth announcement,but the announcement is relevant to show that charisma held out amalia as her child,regardless of kristina participation or knowledge.kristina argues there was inadequate foundation to admit various and postings from internet chat rooms,mostly related to the efforts to conceive amalia,and that various declarants made assertions about care charisma provided for amalia without personal knowledge.however,as discussed below,the record provides overwhelming support for the trial court findings that charisma actively participated in amalia conception and cared for amalia following her birth,including averments in charisma declaration and kristina own admissions.accordingly,kristina was not prejudiced by any error in admitting the challenged evidence below.
charisma claim to presumed parent status is not defeated by the limited duration of her parenting of amalia 
kristina argues that charisma did not parent amalia for a sufficient period of time to satisfy section d.
whether section d requires charisma to show she parented amalia for an extended duration is a question of statutory interpretation we decide de novo.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.the primary objective in statutory interpretation is to determine and give effect to the underlying legislative intent.code civ.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual,ordinary meanings and,if possible,giving each word and phrase significance.curle superior court cal th,d,young gannon th,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.estate of griswold cal th,d.section d,read charisma i,supra,th at,d,provides that a man or woman is presumed to be a natural parent of a child if he or she receives the child into his or her home and openly holds out the child as his or her natural child.on its face,the statute contains no durational requirement it does not,for example,state that the child must be received or held out for a significant period of time.
without deciding the issue before this court,prior decisions have addressed the durational issue in defining the term receives.the use of receives in section d has its origins in civil code former section,which addressed the adoption of an illegitimate child by the father.that section provided the father of an illegitimate child,by publicly acknowledging it as his own,receiving it as such,with the consent of his wife,if he is married,into his family,and otherwise treating it as if it were a legitimate child,thereby adopts it as such and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimate from the time of its birth,former,repealed by stats,ch.when the legislature enacted the upa in,it replaced the concept of legitimacy with the concept of parentage and replaced civil code former section with the language now in section d.adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey.
the court in kelsey addressed the receiving requirement,both and.in that case,the alleged father did not physically receive the child into his home because the birth mother sought to put the child up for adoption.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.the court considered the alleged father argument that constructive receipt of the child is sufficient when the mother prevents actual receipt.id.at,d.the court rejected that argument as a matter of statutory interpretation,because the plain language of the statute contemplates actual receipt rather than attempted receipt or constructive receipt.id.at,d.in the course of its analysis,the court discussed a case,in re richard cal d,which suggested that constructive receipt might be sufficient.kelsey,at,d.kelsey declined to adopt that suggestion,pointing out that in richard the father had in fact received the child into his home,albeit briefly.the court therefore was not faced with the question before us,whether constructive receipt is sufficient when the mother prevents actual receipt.kelsey,at,d.
kelsey also pointed out that under the scheme there was a policy of liberal construction in favor of finding legitimation,so that children did not end up without a legal father.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.the court stated there was no need to strain to find a father through the doctrine of constructive receipt because in the case before it there were two competing fathers,so the child would end up with a legal father in any event.ibid.although the court declined to liberally construe the requirement in the case before it the court did not suggest that actual receipt of a child for a significant duration is required.to the contrary,the court discussed michael jamie cal d,in which the biological father sought temporary custody of the child in order to establish his presumed parentage claim.the court favorably quoted the decision as follows michael is a natural father,not a presumed father,because he has not yet received eric the child into his home.citation.if,however,he actually acquired physical custody,he could receive eric into his home and thereby acquire the status of a presumed father.citations.thus the present controversy,although nominally about the temporary custody of eric pending the adoption proceeding,will probably determine the fate of the proposed adoption.kelsey,at,d,quoting michael,at,see also kelsey,at,d,stating that the superior court had the authority to grant petitioner custody of his child so that he could qualify as a presumed father.the clear implication is that the receiving requirement is a necessary formality,but not one that requires receipt for any particular duration.
moreover,as previously mentioned,the use of the term receives in section d originates in the use of the term receiving in civil code former section.as kelsey explained,under the cases it was sufficient if the alleged father briefly received the child into the home.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.we presume the legislature was aware of the judicial interpretations of the receiving element at the time it adopted the upa.people harrison cal d,the legislature is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial decisions already in existence,and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof.citation.where a statute is framed in language of an earlier enactment on the same or an analogous subject,and that enactment has been judicially construed,the legislature is presumed to have adopted that construction.citation.if the legislature had intended to require an alleged parent to live with a child for an extended period of time,it would likely have used a different term than receives or added an express durational requirement.but kristina presents no analysis of the statutory language or legislative history supporting a conclusion that the legislature intended so fundamental a change.
none of the cases kristina cites suggests section d imposes a durational requirement to obtain presumed parent status.in brian ginger th,d,two men had competing claims for presumed father status the court referred to the duration of one man parenting,but did not suggest there is a durational requirement.county of los angeles sheldon th,d,also referred to the duration of one man parenting in comparing two alleged fathers.the court in miller miller th,d did not emphasize the duration of parenting in applying section d.in that case,a man was denied presumed parent status because he had not clearly held the child out as his own and because there was a conclusive presumption that the mother former husband was the father.miller,at,d.in spencer,supra,th,d,the man seeking presumed father status was equivocal in asserting his parental relationship and left the home once the mother stopped supporting him.id.at,d.in in re th,d,the man seeking presumed father status was found to have molested the child.id.at,d.the court in in re nicholas cal th,d,addressed rebuttal of the parentage presumption,not the requirements of section d.
in re th,d,does characterize cohabitation for a period of one to three months as exceedingly small,but it does not suggest that section d contains a durational requirement.instead,the court reversed the trial court presumed parenthood finding because the evidence supporting the finding was secondhand,the minor did not live with or visit the alleged father in the man own home,and there was little evidence the man held himself out as the minor father.in re,at,d.moreover,in re ultimately adopted an expansive interpretation of the receives requirement,in holding the trial court erred in refusing to find a second man a presumed father,even though the minor never actually lived with the man.the court reasoned the record is clear that the minor never actually lived with however,when a mother and father of a child are not inclined to live with each other,their child often lives with only one of the parents and visits the other although the minor was not received into home to live with him on a basis,he was involved with the minor from the very beginning,with mother blessing.he took this interest in the minor even though he was not convinced she is his biological daughter.thus,when his own son,came to visit him,so also did the minor child,whom the record shows was bonded with id.at,d.
lacking authority supporting her interpretation,kristina essentially asks us to judicially rewrite the statute to impose a durational requirement that is absent from the plain language of section d that we can not do.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.we conclude that receipt of the child into the home must be sufficiently unambiguous as to constitute a clear declaration regarding the nature of the relationship,but it need not continue for any specific duration.this conclusion is consistent with the public policy favoring a child having two parents to provide emotional and financial support,which prior courts have emphasized in interpreting the upa.elisa,supra,cal th at,d,see also librers black th,d whenever possible,a child should have the benefit of two parents to support and nurture him or her.although cohabitation for an extended duration may strengthen a claim for presumed parent status,section d does not require that cohabitation or coparenting continue for any particular period of time 
substantial evidence supports the trial court findings that charisma received amalia into her home and openly held out amalia as her natural child 
in addition to arguing that charisma did not parent amalia for a sufficient duration,kristina more generally challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court findings that charisma received amalia into her home and openly held out amalia as her natural child,as required to establish presumed parentage under section d.
as relevant to the receives element,after amalia birth in april,charisma and kristina brought amalia into their apartment and shared parenting responsibilities for the first six weeks of her life.for the next seven weeks,charisma cared for amalia during the day,and also provided care at night.kristina seems to suggest that the apartment was not charisma home because there is no evidence both of their names were on the lease.however,she presents no authority or reasoned argument that charisma needed to present such proof to satisfy section d.substantial evidence shows the apartment was charisma home kristina in her declaration averred they shared an apartment for almost five years and the apartment was our common residence charisma referred to the apartment as their shared home and averred they obtained renter insurance in both their names and the apartment manager averred they lived there together.kristina disputes the amount and quality of charisma care of amalia and contributions to the household.but,as the trial court reasoned,there may be disagreements or discrepancies between the parties as to how much care was given by charisma or the quality of that care.the court does not particularly find that to be relevant in terms of whether or not she,in fact,received the child into her home.it is clear to the court from the evidence that was submitted that charisma did care for the child after the child was born.
the following evidence showed that charisma openly held amalia out as her natural child charisma was present during amalia birth and cut the umbilical cord she gave amalia a hyphenated last name including her name on amalia birth certificate she brought amalia into her and kristina shared home she held herself out as amalia mother in a birth announcement,a baby shower,a gift registry,an online message board for women trying to conceive,and communications with various people,including the nurse at a well baby visit,a visiting former,and strangers in the street she shared in the care of amalia until kristina went back to work and she cared for amalia after kristina returned to work until kristina moved out with amalia.
clearly,kristina is mistaken in asserting the evidence showed only that charisma told a few people that amalia was her baby.the evidence showed that charisma openly and publicly asserted her parentage in various forums and to numerous people.kristina points to no evidence demonstrating any equivocating on the part of charisma regarding her parentage spencer,supra,th at,d,and she presents no authority or reasoned argument that any particular number or sorts of public acknowledgments are necessary to satisfy section d.
instead of discussing the particular facts showing that charisma received amalia into her home and held her out as her natural child,kristina argues broadly that charisma failed to present sufficient evidence of a parental relationship to qualify as a presumed parent under section d.she cites in re,where the court stated in determining whether a man has receiv ed a child into his home and openly h eld out the child as his own citation,courts have looked to such factors as whether the man actively helped the mother in prenatal care whether he paid pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so whether he promptly took legal action to obtain custody of the child whether he sought to have his name placed on the birth certificate whether and how long he cared for the child whether there is unequivocal evidence that he had acknowledged the child the number of people to whom he had acknowledged the child whether he provided for the child after it no longer resided with him whether,if the child needed public benefits,he had pursued completion of the requisite paperwork and whether his care was merely incidental.citations.in re,supra,th at,d.in re does not require an alleged parent to show each and every one of these factors exists.instead,it lists the types of factors trial courts may consider.in this case,the trial court considered the appropriate factors in determining that charisma is a presumed parent and there was ample evidence of a parental relationship between charisma and amalia to support the trial court determination 
kristina attempt to analogize this case to spencer fails.in that case,the alleged father,leonard,lived with the mother at the time of the birth but not at the time of conception.spencer,supra,th at,d.it was unclear who the biological father was because the mother was a prostitute at the time of conception.ibid.leonard was present at the child birth,and lived with the child and the mother for two years.ibid.during that time,leonard told some people he was the father,the child called him daddy,and leonard cared for and disciplined the child.id.at,d.however,leonard did not have his name placed on the birth certificate and he was equivocal in asserting his parental relationship while they lived together.ibid.in particular,when a social worker visited the apartment,leonard specifically told the worker he was not the child father.id.at,d.he cared for the child for two months while the mother was incarcerated,but when the mother stopped receiving welfare payments during another period of incarceration,leonard separated from her and left the child with a friend of the mother.ibid.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court rejection of leonard presumed parentage claim,concluding that t he evidence permitted the conclusion that leonard did not receive the child into his home,but instead that mother permitted leonard to reside in her home,and that leonard residence with the child was not demonstrative of leonard commitment to the child but reflected that leonard acted out of personal convenience and.id.at,d.the court also concluded that a trier of fact could conclude leonard actions,as a whole,were not sufficient to satisfy the requirement that leonard openly and publicly admit paternity.citation.id.at,d.the present case is unlike spencer w.the record overwhelmingly supports the trial court findings that charisma welcomed amalia into her shared home with kristina and consistently acknowledged her parental relationship and responsibilities to the child.
we also reject kristina attempt to analogize this case to in re sarah th,d sarah.there,the child was the product of an extramarital affair between the mother and the alleged father,paul.id.at,d.although paul told a few friends and family that he was the biological father,he did not assist the mother during the pregnancy,did not seek to have his name listed on the birth certificate which listed the mother husband name,and did not inform the mother husband of the child biological paternity.id.at,d.the court of appeal concluded the evidence supported the trial court finding that paul was not a presumed father.id.at,d.in contrast,the evidence in this case uniformly showed charisma held amalia out as her natural child at every appropriate opportunity.
it is important to note that in the two cases kristina principally relies upon,spencer and sarah,the courts of appeal were reviewing trial court decisions rejecting presumed parentage claims.spencer,supra,th at,d sarah,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the reviewing courts were obliged to make all inferences in favor of the trial court findings that the alleged fathers had not established their presumed parentage claims.in this case,we are obliged to make all factual inferences in favor of the trial court finding that charisma made the showing required by section d.that finding is amply supported by the evidence in the record 
ii.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding there is no basis to rebut the parentage presumption in this case 
section,subdivision a,provides that a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.thus,kristina bore the burden below of rebutting the presumption that charisma was amalia parent with clear and convincing evidence.comino kelley th,d.the determination of whether the presumption has been rebutted is within the discretion of the trial court.elisa,supra,cal th at,d.
in an appropriate case,clear and convincing evidence that an alleged parent has no biological tie to the child may defeat presumed parent status.see elisa,supra,cal th at,d.in elisa,the court concluded the case was not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption of presumed parenthood with proof that elisa is not the twins biological parent.id.at,d.the court stated it was unnecessary to remand to permit the superior court to exercise its discretion because it would have been an abuse of discretion to conclude the presumption could be rebutted because elisa actively participated in causing the children to be conceived with the understanding that she would raise the children as her own together with the birth mother,she voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood after the children were born,and there are no competing claims to her being the children second parent.id.at,d,see also id.at,d.
in charisma i,this court instructed the trial court that,if it found charisma is a presumed parent of amalia under section d,it should then determine whether the facts identified in elisa on the rebuttal issue are true.we explained if the trial court finds that charisma is a presumed parent and finds true all of the facts outlined in elisa on the rebuttal issue,those findings support a conclusion that this is not an appropriate case to allow rebuttal of the presumption of charisma parenthood in other words,the evidence that she has no biological tie to amalia does not rebut the presumption.absent other facts justifying rebuttal of the presumption citation,any other conclusion would be an abuse of discretion.citation.charisma i,supra,th at,d.
substantial evidence supports the trial court determination that the elisa factors are present in this case 
the trial court made findings on the elisa factors to support its conclusion that kristina had failed to rebut the presumption of parenthood under section d substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that charisma actively participated in amalia conception with the understanding she would parent amalia with kristina.charisma and kristina were in a romantic relationship and registered domestic partners in california at the time amalia was conceived.after the couple decided to have children,they contacted a sperm bank and jointly filled out the required paperwork to obtain sperm from an anonymous donor.the sperm bank patient registration form lists kristina as the patient and charisma as her spouse partner,and indicates they are registered domestic partners.the couple provided charisma credit card information for billing purposes and both women signed the form.both charisma and kristina signed a consent form for therapeutic insemination and a release form for home insemination.charisma completed the sperm bank donor selection form listing donor choices and both women physical characteristics.charisma placed two of the orders for sperm there were three orders in total,one of which included the sperm that impregnated kristina.
for five months,charisma actively participated in kristina artificial insemination efforts the couple kept a joint journal regarding the process,in which kristina was referred to as mommy and charisma was referred to as momma.in the journal both women describe their excitement at the prospect of parenthood.the journal also contains statements such as we decided to try to inseminate today.in another entry,charisma describes in detail her effort to learn how to perform the insemination and how she blundered the first attempt.after kristina became pregnant,her mother addressed to charisma and kristina to the mommies.charisma communicated with her,a of kristina,an online community of other women trying to conceive,and others regarding her and kristina efforts to have a child.
kristina disregards this overwhelming body of evidence in asserting that the trial court substantially relied upon statements in emails made and postings from online chat rooms without evidence of kristina authorship.and,despite kristina protestations,even these postings are relevant to charisma understanding and intentions.even absent these postings,substantial evidence plainly supports the trial court finding.as in elisa,supra,cal th at page,d,charisma actively assisted kristina in becoming pregnant with the expressed intention of enjoying the rights and accepting the responsibilities of parenting the resulting child.
substantial evidence also supports the trial court finding that charisma voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood after amalia was born she was present during amalia birth and cut the umbilical cord she gave amalia a hyphenated last name including her name she brought amalia into her home she held herself out as amalia mother to various people in various forums she shared in the care of amalia until kristina went back to work and she cared for amalia after kristina returned to work until kristina moved out with amalia.kristina concedes that charisma watched amalia after she returned to work,but she disputes the amount and quality of charisma care and contributions to the household.we must accept the trial court resolution of this factual dispute.howard owens corning,supra,th at,d.
again,an underlying theme of kristina argument is that the trial court should have found the parentage presumption rebutted because charisma did not parent amalia for a long period of time.while the duration of parenting could be relevant to the rebuttal analysis,there is no specific durational requirement.kristina points out that in elisa,supra,cal th at pages,d,the alleged parent played a substantial parental role for years.however,the court did not suggest it would be appropriate to rebut the parentage presumption solely because there is no lengthy period of parenting.in fact,the court holding omits any reference to a durational requirement.of the three factors outlined by the court,only the voluntarily accepted the rights and obligations of parenthood factor id.at,d,is one in which duration could arguably be of any relevance.but,despite the fact that elisa had parented the children for years,the supreme court elected not to describe the factor with language including a temporal dimension,such as for a significant period of time.moreover,it is undisputed that it was kristina unilateral conduct in moving out with amalia that prevented charisma from parenting amalia for a longer period of time.accordingly,this is not a case where the short duration of parenting reflects negatively on an alleged parent commitment to establishing a parental relationship.the relatively short period that charisma parented amalia is not alone a basis to rebut the parentage presumption 
the trial court decision is by the evidence.
b.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that no other facts justified rebuttal of the parentage presumption 
in charisma i,supra,th at page,d,this court indicated that rebuttal of the parentage presumption would not be an abuse of discretion,even if all the elisa factors are present,if other facts justified rebuttal of the presumption.we cited in re,supra,th at page,d,in which the court concluded that conduct antithetical to the parental role can justify rebuttal of the presumption id.at,d.
kristina argues the trial court erred in failing to find the presumption rebutted based on a single photograph of amalia that charisma posted online.the claimed objectionable photograph is one of dozens included in an online photo album.it depicts a newborn,naked amalia from the neck down,apparently in the hospital because of the presence of monitors and cords.the baby genitalia are visible,although the photograph does not emphasize the genitalia.kristina also refers in passing to two other photographs posted online,which depict her breastfeeding amalia one of kristina breasts is partially visible in both photographs.the circumstances of the online posting of the photographs are unclear.in a declaration,charisma averred that she and kristina jointly agreed to create an online photo album after the birth of amalia,and that album was the only place where we kept photos of amalia.the link to the album was shared only with family and friends,although others could find it if they searched by name kristina averred that she was upset when she learned that the photographs were online and that she contacted the newark police department,which requested that charisma remove the pictures from the internet.charisma complied.the breastfeeding photographs are not graphic and the photograph of amalia is not child pornography at most charisma demonstrated an isolated instance of poor judgment in including those photographs in a large group of appropriate photographs posted online 
the evidence presented by kristina is not comparable to the evidence justifying rebuttal of the parentage presumption in in re,supra,th,d.there,the alleged father,marvin,was a registered sex offender who had been convicted of three counts of lewd conduct with and girls and sentenced to six years in prison.id.at,d.the minor was years old and declared a dependent of the juvenile court based on an allegation that she was at substantial risk of being sexually abused due to marvin history of molesting other children and reports of his inappropriate conduct with the minor.ibid.the court concluded that,although the parentage presumption may have arisen based on marvin acting in a paternal role since the minor was three,the juvenile court did not err in concluding the presumption was rebutted by his conduct.id.at,d.the court emphasized that marvin had deceived the minor mother regarding his criminal convictions and the juvenile court had found true the allegations of molestation by clear and convincing evidence.id.at,d.marvin conduct was antithetical to a parent role and was a blatant violation of parental responsibilities.it more than counterbalanced the factors favoring marvin presumed father status.ibid.nothing comparable was presented to the trial court in this case.kristina has not shown the court erred in rejecting her suggestion to rebut the parentage presumption based on charisma alleged unsuitability as a parent.
finally,kristina contends extending presumed parent status to charisma is not consistent with the purposes of the parentage presumption.kristina principally relies on elisa,supra,cal th,d,where el dorado county was seeking to force the alleged parent to provide financial support to the children.kristina interprets elisa too narrowly the case does not suggest that lack of a present need for financial support justifies rebuttal of the presumption.the presumption furthers the general public policy favoring a child having two parents,rather than one,as a source of both emotional and financial support.id.at,d,see also kristine lisa,supra,cal th at,d,referring to the public policy favoring that a child have two parents rather than one kristine david th,d p ublic policy and common sense endorse,where possible,creation of a legal parent and child relationship,with the attendant responsibilities and privileges,fn.omitted librers black,supra,th at,d whenever possible,a child should have the benefit of two parents to support and nurture him or her.it may be especially important to apply the presumption where the public would otherwise bear the support obligation elisa,at,d,but that is not a necessary condition to application of the presumption.it is reasonable to conclude amalia will benefit,either now or in the future,from the additional financial and emotional support a second parent can provide,even if she would not otherwise become a public burden 
kristina also contends it is inconsistent with the purposes of the presumption to extend presumed parent status to an individual who has not demonstrated a commitment to creating a substantial familial relationship with a child.assuming that to be true,the trial court found charisma did demonstrate such commitment,and the court findings are supported by substantial evidence.kristina additional argument that an extended period of parenting is necessary to demonstrate that commitment is not supported by section d or the case law,as explained previously.
iii.kristina constitutional claims are without merit 
a.this court will exercise its discretion to decide the constitutional claims 
in charisma i,supra,th at page,d,because this court remanded for further factual findings,we declined to address kristina claim that it would violate her federal constitutional rights were we to conclude that charisma is amalia parent under the upa.although kristina raised those claims in the previous appeal,she failed to raise them on remand.charisma contends the constitutional claims have been forfeited.see,newton clemons th,d g enerally,issues raised for the first time on appeal which were not litigated in the trial court are waived,fn.omitted.on the other hand,california courts have held that constitutional issues can be raised for the first time on appeal in various circumstances.citation.bonner city of santa ana th,d bonner,disapproved on another ground in katzberg regents of university of california cal th,d.
typically,courts exercise their discretion to allow issues to be raised for the first time on appeal when the issue is purely legal and presented to the court on undisputed facts,and involves a matter of public interest.bialo western mutual ins.th,d.in this case,the parties do dispute the facts regarding the conception and parenting of amalia,and those facts are relevant to kristina challenge to section d.however,the factual determinations relevant to kristina challenge are encompassed within the trial court findings that charisma is a presumed parent and the presumption should not be rebutted.accordingly,resolution of the constitutional claims requires only that we apply the law to the facts found by the trial court in these circumstances,we have discretion to consider the claims.see hittle santa barbara county employees retirement cal d,fn,new legal claim properly considered on appeal where relevant evidence was fully presented to the trial court people williams cal th,d,claim forfeited where there is a critical factual dispute that the trial court never was asked to explore or resolve.there is no unfairness to charisma in considering kristina constitutional claims because charisma already had full opportunity and incentive to develop the relevant factual record.as in bonner,supra,th at page,d,the question is one of pure law presented in a context where the factual situation is no different from that established by the evidence in the trial court.citation.
because kristina constitutional claims are a matter of substantial public interest in this rapidly evolving area of family law,we exercise our discretion to decide the claims presented by kristina on appeal in light of the trial court factual findings.
kristina equal protection claim is without merit 
kristina contends the trial court order violates the federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection because she was accorded disparate treatment on the basis of gender.broadly stated,equal protection of the laws means that no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws enjoyed by other persons or other classes in like circumstances in their lives,liberty and property and in their pursuit of happiness.citation.in determining whether such a deprivation has occurred,the court ultimate task is to examine the validity of the underlying purpose,and the extent to which the disputed statutory classification promotes such purpose.citations.people wutzke cal th,d.as a foundational matter,however,all meritorious equal protection claims require a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.citation.in other words,neither the fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the united states nor the california constitution citations precludes classification by the legislature or requires uniform operation of the law for persons who are different with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law.citations.id.at,d.
kristina argument she was accorded disparate treatment on the basis of gender rests on two court of appeal decisions in which men were denied presumed parent status,spencer,supra,th,d and sarah,supra,th,d.kristina contends she is similarly situated to the mothers in those cases and she was accorded disparate treatment because of the sex of her.boldface type omitted.
we have already rejected kristina attempt to analogize this case to spencer and sarah to summarize,in spencer,the alleged father did not have his name placed on the birth certificate,he was equivocal in acknowledging his paternity,and he abandoned the child when the mother stopped supporting him.spencer,supra,th at,d.in sarah,the alleged father did not assist the mother during the pregnancy,did not seek to have his name listed on the birth certificate,and did not inform the mother husband of his paternity claim.sarah,supra,th at,d.for the reasons stated previously,the present case is distinguishable from spencer and sarah 
kristina has not shown that a similarly situated biological mother opposing a petition to establish presumed parentage would be treated differently under the law if the alleged parent,lacking a biological connection to the child,were a man instead of a woman.in other words,kristina has not shown that a case involving a man in charisma circumstances would be decided any differently under the law.see elisa,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of kennard,pointing out that a man similarly situated to the mother in the case also would have been declared a presumed parent.kristina equal protection claim is without merit.
kristina due process claim is without merit 
kristina contends the trial court ruling,declaring charisma a presumed parent over kristina objections as the fit biological mother,violated her federal and state constitutional rights to due process.in particular,citing troxel granville,d troxel,kristina contends that recognizing charisma as a parent violated her fundamental parental right to rear amalia.
in troxel,the united states supreme court struck down on due process grounds a visitation order under a washington statute that allowed a ny person to petition a superior court for visitation rights at any time and authorized the court to grant such visitation rights whenever visitation may serve the best interest of the child.troxel,supra,at.under the statute,granville,a single mother,was required to permit her children paternal grandparents to visit the children on a schedule imposed by the trial court.id.at.the supreme court explained that the fourteenth amendment due process clause not only guarantees fair process but also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.troxel,at.see also dawn,supra,cal th at,d.the court,in a plurality opinion written by justice,concluded the nonparental visitation order was an unconstitutional infringement on granville fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody and control of her two daughters.troxel,at.
troxel is inapposite.there,the court considered a nonparental visitation statute troxel,supra,at.at issue here is a statute determining the identity of amalia parents.unlike the order in troxel,the order declaring charisma a parent of amalia by definition did not extend rights to a nonparent.moreover,as in,supra,cal th at page,d,neither charisma nor kristina claim to parentage preceded the other.in that case,the california supreme court rejected an analogy to troxel,reasoning claim to be the twins mother because the twins were produced from her ova is equal to,and arose at the same time as,claim to be the twins mother because she gave birth to them,at,d.in this case,kristina and charisma decided to have a child together,they jointly pursued the goal of kristina becoming pregnant,and charisma was present at the birth and cut the umbilical cord.kristina parentage claim arises from the fact that she gave birth to amalia.elisa,supra,cal th at,d.and,at the time of the birth,charisma had an inchoate parentage claim because she actively consented to,and participated in,the artificial insemination of her partner with the understanding that the resulting child would be raised by kristina and her as coparents.elisa,at,d,see also id.at,d.charisma parentage claim was not legally complete until she accepted amalia into her home,but it arose at the same time as kristina claim.because charisma ultimately satisfied the legal standards for presumed parent status and her showing was not rebutted,declaring her a parent is not giving parental rights to an unrelated individual it is recognizing the parental role that existed from birth.see sharon superior court cal th,d,rejecting analogy to troxel in second parent adoption context and stating that former same sex partner with no biological connection to child is not just any person citation she is a prospective adoptive mother.
although kristina fails to frame the issue in this fashion,her true complaint is that the state has seen fit to declare a person without a biological connection to amalia a parent.this involves a different liberty interest than at issue in troxel and other cases cited by kristina in those cases,the identity of the parents was not in dispute.troxel,supra,d stanley illinois,d prince massachusetts.the distinction is critical because the courts have required in cases a careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.citations.washington glucksberg,d glucksberg see also dawn,supra,cal th at,d.this careful description is concrete and particularized,rather than abstract and general.dawn,at,d.kristina claim is essentially that as the biological mother,and in the effective absence of a biological father,she has a fundamental right to decide whether amalia has a second parent.however,she presents no authority or reasoned argument that a state infringes on a biological parent substantive due process rights by extending parental status to a nonbiological parent in the circumstances of this case.see michael gerald,d plur.opn.of scalia,state did not violate biological father constitutional rights by denying him an opportunity to rebut a presumption that husband of mother was father i t is a question of legislative policy and not constitutional law whether california will allow the presumed parenthood of a couple desiring to retain a child conceived within and born into their marriage to be rebutted.it may be that there are different circumstances in which such an order would be unconstitutional,but any such determination would require a careful analysis of the specific facts and interests involved in the case.see troxel,at.
not only has kristina failed to present relevant authorities and analysis regarding the actual asserted liberty interest at issue,but she fails to address the complex balancing of competing interests glucksberg,supra,at.necessary to resolution of substantive due process claims,despite the fact that this court identified some of the potential competing interests in charisma there,we pointed out that a rule that allowed the biological mother to unilaterally deny presumed parent status would potentially implicate the constitutional rights of the person seeking such status citation and the constitutional rights of the child in the establishment of the relationship citation.charisma i,supra,th at,d see also kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,holding that it would violate an unwed father constitutional rights to allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father.we also pointed out that s uch a rule would be contrary to the public policy favoring that a child has two parents rather than one.citation.charisma i,at,d.finally,an assessment of the weight of kristina interest in denying parental status to charisma would need to take into account kristina own conduct prior to and immediately after amalia birth,which led charisma to understand that she would be a parent.
we point out these competing interests and considerations to elucidate the fallacy of kristina simplistic analogy to troxel,supra,d,and to demonstrate the complexity of a substantive due process claim based on the actual liberty interest affected by the trial court order.however,because kristina has failed to provide citations to authority and reasoned argument regarding the balancing of interests necessary to resolve that due process claim,we deem the argument waived.badie bank of america th,d.this is particularly appropriate in light of the admonition from the united states supreme court that constitutional protections in this area are best elaborated with care.troxel,at.see also in re marriage of harris,supra,cal th at,d,we should be very careful in identifying the scope of the due process interest in parenting.
we conclude kristina has failed to meet her burden of showing that the order declaring charisma to be amalia second parent was an unconstitutional infringement of her state and federal rights to substantive due process.see dawn,supra,cal th at,d,courts must always presum e the constitutional validity of legislative acts and resolv e doubts in favor of the statute.
vi.charisma 
the custody evaluators recommended a gradual process to reestablish charisma relationship with amalia,including joint therapy sessions in texas with a therapist.in its tentative order following the april trial regarding custody and visitation,the trial court ordered the parties to equally share the costs of the reunification process,including the therapist fees and charisma airfare costs to travel to texas.after kristina objected,the court concluded it lacked authority to require kristina to pay a share of charisma travel costs because there was no child support order and kristina was not technically a move away parent.the court also stated that forcing kristina to bear a portion of the travel costs would be punitive,which was a reference to kristina argument that forcing her to bear a portion of the costs would be a punitive penalty against her exercise of her constitutional right to travel.the court required charisma to bear percent of the travel costs.
in her,charisma contends the trial court erred in concluding it lacked authority to order the parties to share the travel expenses.she argues the court had broad discretion to apportion the costs of visitation in the best interests of the child.we agree.in the proceeding at issue,to determine custody and visitation issues in a upa action,subd.f,the court had the widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child,subd.b.see also burgess,supra,cal th at,d.the court was required to consider all the circumstances bearing on the best interest of the minor child.burgess,at,d,see also,subd.f.one relevant consideration was the state policy encouraging frequent visitation.section,subdivision b,provides the legislature finds and declares that it is the public policy of this state to assure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents have ended their relationship,and to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing in order to effect this policy charisma points out that,were she forced to bear the entire financial burden,the cost of airfare could interfere with her ability to frequently visit amalia in texas.
in burgess,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court discussed the trial court authority to fashion visitation orders,stating the trial court has broad discretion to modify orders concerning contact and visitation to minimize the minor children loss of contact and visitation with the noncustodial parent in the event of a move,by increasing the amount of visitation with the noncustodial parent during vacations from school,allocating transportation expenses to the custodial parent,or requiring the custodial parent to provide transportation of the children to the noncustodial parent home.italics added see also in re marriage of lamusga cal th,d,trial courts must be permitted to exercise their discretion to fashion orders that best serve the interests of the children in the cases before them.although the quoted text in burgess is phrased in the language of a case,in which a parent who has sole physical custody under an existing judicial c
