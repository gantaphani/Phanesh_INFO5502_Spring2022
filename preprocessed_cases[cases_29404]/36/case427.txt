this case considers the notice required before imposing a condition of supervised release.
wise was convicted in of a crime of dishonesty.she obtained the birth certificate of a person who had been born around the same time as herself,but who had died as a child.using the birth certificate,she got a montana identification card in the dead child name.wise then went to the social security office in great falls,montana and applied for a social security number,claiming somewhat implausibly she was years old that she had never had a driver license,and that neither she nor a spouse had ever filed income tax returns or been claimed as a dependent on a federal tax return.the staff of the social security office suspected fraud.they contacted the montana bureau of vital statistics in helena and learned that the person wise claimed to be had been dead for years.investigators learned from the postmaster in winston,montana that wise had applied for a post office box under the phony name.although wise tried to hide her identity by wearing a red wig and sunglasses,the postmaster and a customer recognized her and saw her leave in a car with the vanity license plate r r wise.
wise was indicted under for two counts of lying to the federal government for her lies to the social security administration and the postal service.she pled guilty to the first count in exchange for dismissal of the second.at the change of plea,wise told the judge that she had committed the crimes because her husband,who was in prison,had warned her that her former husband,also in prison,whom she had put there for molesting her children,would soon be released,and that she needed to change her identity so that he could not find her and her son.
the presentence report revealed a bizarre history.in,wise had called the missoula county sheriff office and asked a deputy to monitor what she claimed would be a meeting between her and a burglar who had promised to return some of her stolen jewelry at the frenchtown grade school.a deputy sheriff showed up to watch the transaction,but when nothing had happened for minutes,he drove toward where wise was waiting.as he approached,he heard a gunshot and saw wise by her truck,holding a gun that was pointed at him.wise then ran into an alley and motioned for the deputy to follow.when the deputy found wise,he told her to drop her gun,but she instead raised it,pointed it at him,and ignored the deputy commands to drop the gun until he threatened to shoot her.wise claimed she had followed a masked man who had confronted her at the school but who had fled into the alley when he saw the deputy car.the police later followed some footprints in the alley to a nearby residence where an individual admitted that he had made a deal with wise to sell her some stolen jewelry for at the grade school,but that he ran away after he saw the deputy car and wise began shooting.after a hung jury on a felony assault charge,wise was allowed to plead to misdemeanor negligent endangerment.nine years later in,wise pled guilty to transferring unauthorized articles into the townsend,montana jail.
these crimes,and other offenses such as leaving the scene of an accident,did not raise wise criminal history level beyond that of a first offender for purposes of the sentencing guidelines.but there was more.the family history section of the presentence report disclosed that wise had married gary arnold savage,her second husband,and a felon whom she had met while he was in jail.wise reported savage for sexually abusing her three children from her first marriage,but when a warrant was issued for savage arrest wise ran away with him and the children.they were eventually apprehended in california when wise was arrested for shoplifting.savage pled guilty to the sexual abuse and was sentenced to months imprisonment.
in,while savage was serving time for sexually abusing her children,wise was caught smuggling child pornography to him in prison.according to the presentence report,wise took pictures of a minor female child,disrobed,and provided the pictures to gary savage,and that she also took pictures of another minor child and her own children,partially clothed or in minimal clothing,and attempted to provide those pictures to savage.the report also states that wise encouraged at least one minor female child to sleep disrobed with herself on numerous occasions.these events prompted the state to remove the three children from wise custody and to give custody to their father,wise first husband.wise was barred from any physical visitation with her children until she completed counseling and demonstrated that she was fit to be a parent.
wise was referred for psychiatric evaluation in.she told the psychiatrist that if any sexual things happened with the children,the kids are making it up,or that it was a satanic deal in which savage lost his memory.the psychiatrist concluded that wise was quite close to being frankly psychotic,that she was severely disturbed,and that she should not have custody of the children at all.
but wise kept visiting savage and was caught in trying to mail him a card that contained several photos of a minor female.she also tried to bring a female child to prison to visit savage.in addition,the missoula county sheriff department got a report in that wise had attempted to grope a boy genitals,and had asked an girl to photograph wise posing nude.
wise divorced savage and married again.she had another daughter with her third husband,then divorced him,fought for custody of her daughter,and then let two years go by in which she did not visit her daughter.she also put savage on the daughter birth certificate,rather than the name of the girl father.wise then married her fourth husband,a violent felon whom she had met in prison while visiting savage,and had another child,a son named ricky.though the allegations had not been confirmed,the presentence report states that the montana department of health and human services offices in great falls and bozeman have received allegations that ricky is being physically and emotionally abused.
wise lurid history,however,did not generate any criminal history points,so wise stayed at the low end of the sentencing guidelines,with a range of zero to six months.neither side filed any objections to the presentence report,so the judge accepted its findings.defense counsel argued for probation so that wise could care for her son ricky.the government recommended six months because of the sophistication of the scheme.defense counsel,however,argued that wise mental and emotional problems showed that her crime had not been a well thought out scheme,and suggested probation with mental health treatment.the judge imposed a six month sentence.
this appeal arises,not out of the six months,but out of two special conditions that the judge attached to the supervised release period to follow wise six months of incarceration.the presentence report had not listed these special conditions among its recommendations,and counsel had no written or oral notice,so far as the record shows,that the court would be considering them.
one condition number nine prohibits wise from having contact with children,including her son,without approval of the probation office,and subjected the custody of her son to the state office that provides for dependent children 
the defendant shall not be allowed to reside in the home,residence,or be in the company of any child under the age of without prior approval of united states probation.the montana department of public health and human services dphhs shall approve the custody and contact with the defendant minor son,richard ricky nelson wise.
the other condition number eight prohibits wise from possessing pornography and other sexually stimulating material 
the defendant shall not possess any pornographic,sexually oriented or sexually stimulating materials,including visual,auditory,telephonic,or electronic media,and computer programs or services.
at sentencing wise objected to condition number nine,regarding contact with children and custody of her.wise appeals imposition of both conditions.
