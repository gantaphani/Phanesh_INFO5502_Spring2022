introduction 
appellant maria del la luz perez perez appeals the trial court denial of the renewal of her domestic violence restraining order dvro against respondent job francisco torres hernandez torres hernandez.perez alleges that the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard in denying her petition.she asserts the court erroneously concluded that there must be new evidence of abuse or threatened abuse to renew the order,and torres hernandez past abuse or violations of the existing order did not support renewal the evidence of new abuse must be physical in nature and evidence of torres hernandez abuse of the couple children was not relevant to the dvro renewal.we agree the court erred in all of these respects,and reverse with directions to grant renewal of the dvro.
factual and procedural background 
in february,perez filed a request for a dvro against torres hernandez to stay away from her and their two children,eight and daughters,as well as perez son from a previous relationship.perez and torres hernandez had been in a relationship for years and perez claimed many instances of physical and emotional abuse by torres hernandez.she wrote on the request for the dvro that torres hernandez was going to kill her and take her children away.in her declaration,she recounted an incident where torres hernandez became angry and yelled fuck you bitch at her in front of the children.she said the following day,torres hernandez called her hundreds of times.a few days later,torres hernandez came into her home while she was gone,and without her permission.later that same day,in the middle of the night,torres hernandez again broke into her home while everyone was sleeping.he startled a friend who was sleeping on the couch and rushed out.she said that she was afraid because torres hernandez was capable of becoming violent and had hit her many times in the past.
the court held a hearing and both perez and torres hernandez testified.the court issued a restraining order preventing torres hernandez from doing the following things to perez h arass,attack,strike,threaten,assault sexually or otherwise,hit,follow,stalk,molest,destroy personal property,disturb the peace,keep under surveillance,or block movements.the order provided sole physical custody of the children to perez,and weekend visitation with torres hernandez.the restraining order expired on march.
in september,perez filed a petition to modify the restraining order to include protection for her three children.perez claimed that during torres hernandez visits with the children,he had physically abused them.after a visit with torres hernandez,their younger daughter had bruising on her chest.the daughter told perez that torres hernandez was angry and hit her.torres hernandez was arrested after the incident.
perez explained that torres hernandez had been abusive to her throughout their relationship but had not previously hit the children.she said that since the restraining order was issued,torres hernandez had hit the children with his hands or objects,including shoes.he had previously hit the younger daughter causing bruising on her lip.perez claimed that torres hernandez also hit her son with a belt causing a welt on his leg.
the court suspended visitation between torres hernandez and the younger daughter and ordered supervised visitation with the older daughter.the court amended the order to prohibit torres hernandez from making contact with perez including phone calls,and text messages.
in february,perez petitioned the court for a permanent renewal of the restraining order.perez alleged that torres hernandez had repeatedly violated the order.he called her from an anonymous number but identified himself as the caller and told her to stop going to court and to stop asking for child support.she also alleged that torres hernandez was facing child abuse charges for hitting their younger daughter.
the court held a contested hearing on march.at the outset,torres hernandez explained that the criminal case for his conduct toward his daughter had been dismissed.when asked by the court,perez explained that the district attorney office had told her that the charges were dropped because their daughter was too young to testify against torres hernandez.
perez testified that she sought to have the restraining order extended permanently because i have a lot of fear of him.she said she feared physical abuse both against herself and her children.even with the restraining order in place,he had continued to call her,text her,and threaten her.he had also mistreated their daughters.she explained torres hernandez had hit their younger daughter on the chest causing bruising.
during perez testimony,the court initially advised her counsel that any testimony about the abuse towards their daughter was not relevant.the court stated the standard to renew or extend the order has to do with whether she has a reasonable apprehension of future abuse.the abuse is as to her as opposed to the children.counsel argued it was relevant to perez reasonable apprehension of future abuse and she was seeking to modify the order to add the children as protected parties.
the court then allowed further testimony.perez testified that torres hernandez had hit their younger daughter once with a shoe,and hit her on another occasion causing a swollen lip.he had also grabbed the older daughter causing a red mark on her wrist.perez stated he is a very aggressive person,and i,frankly,have a lot of fear for my own safety and that of my children.she said the fact he hit her children made her more afraid of him because he had broken the law.
she testified that she received a call from torres hernandez in november and he threatened her,saying fuck you,bitch,and told her to stop going to court to ask for support and custody of their daughters.she said it made her very fearful because he was not supposed to call or text her.he also sent her a text after the call,from an anonymous number,but it made reference to the content of the prior call.she said the text made her feel scared and helpless.he sent her texts on february,the date the criminal charges for hitting their younger daughter were dismissed.the first text stated ha,ha,ha.poor kids for having a crazy mom like you.was it worth putting your kids through all that trouble and end up with nothing she received another anonymous text that said the kids pay the consequences,and remarked that he was about to have the son he always wanted.perez testified that text messages created a lot of fear.
when she found out the criminal charges had been dismissed,she felt v ery scared,very terrified,because now he feels that he can break the law.
perez testified that she did not want him bothering her,calling her,or sending her messages because she was very scared because he has been doing things that have affected me.she stated she was afraid torres hernandez would cause her future physical harm if the order were not renewed.she said that she felt helpless because in spite of the fact that there a restraining order,he continues to do that and because the law has been able to stop him.so i feel helpless and fearful at the same time.
the court asked perez if she had been threatened since the restraining order had been issued,and she responded that his calls were threatening.she said that he told her you going pay for it.she was not sure exactly what he can do,but i afraid.
counsel sought to introduce the testimony of perez father,who had seen the bruising on the younger daughter,but the court excluded the testimony as redundant.
torres hernandez denied contacting perez by phone or sending her text messages.he claimed perez was making these claims in order to get a green card.
the court found there is no basis to extend this order on a permanent basis.i find that there is insufficient evidence as to a reasonable belief of continued abuse.there is no evidence before the court that there has been actual abuse within the time period that the restraining order has been issued.the court found that the abuse,if true,had been toward the children,but that was irrelevant as to the abuse alleged by perez because it does not speak to any abuse that perez has been subjected to.perez has been subjected to annoying phone calls.i would let it rise to the level of a pattern of harassment,but the phone calls are intended to annoy her.
the court stated it did not find torres hernandez testimony to be particularly persuasive,and there may be some credibility issues.the court found that torres hernandez made the phone calls and sent the text messages in violation of the restraining order,but that this was not enough to extend the dvro.
the court stated abuse is not merely simply annoying or harassing occasional harassing phone calls intended to annoy the other person.abuse is not exerting your rights under the law to say,you know if you keep going to court,you may lose out.the kids may they tired of putting up with a crazy mother.stating an opinion does not rise to the level of a threat of violence or actual infliction of violence.abuse must be violence or the infliction of violence on an individual.therefore,there was insufficient evidence of a reasonable belief of continued abuse to support extension of the order.
since at the time of the hearing the dvro was set to expire in a few days,and given the court denial of the requested renewal,it did not consider the request that the order be modified to include the children as protected parties.
discussion 
the purpose of the domestic violence prevention act dvpa is to prevent acts of domestic violence,abuse,and sexual abuse and to provide for a separation of the persons involved in the domestic violence for a period sufficient to enable these persons to seek a resolution of the causes of the violence.under the dvpa,abuse means intentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury sexual assault placing a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or another or engaging in behavior that could be enjoined pursuant to section.section includes molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,and battering harassing,telephoning,contacting,either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise,coming within a specified distance of,or disturbing the peace of the other party,subd.a.
section,subdivision a provides in the discretion of the court,the personal conduct,and residence exclusion orders contained in a court order issued after notice and a hearing under this article may have a duration of not more than five years,subject to termination or modification by further order of the court either on written stipulation filed with the court or on the motion of a party.these orders may be renewed,upon the request of a party,either for five years or permanently,without a showing of any further abuse since the issuance of the original order,subject to termination or modification by further order of the court either on written stipulation filed with the court or on the motion of a party.italics added.
standard of review 
the appropriate standard of review was recently set forth by the second district court of appeal in eneaji ubboe the trial court ruling on a request to renew a dvro is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.citation.an abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling exceeds the bounds of reason.citation.but,the exercise of discretion is not unfettered in such cases.citation.all exercises of discretion must be guided by applicable legal principles,however,which are derived from the statute under which discretion is conferred.citations.if the court decision is influenced by an erroneous understanding of applicable law or reflects an unawareness of the full scope of its discretion,the court has not properly exercised its discretion under the law.citation.therefore,a discretionary order based on an application of improper criteria or incorrect legal assumptions is not an exercise of informed discretion and is subject to reversal.citation.citation.the question of whether a trial court applied the correct legal standard to an issue in exercising its discretion is a question of law citation requiring de novo review citation.eneaji ubboe th,eneaji.
in reviewing the denial of a dvro request,we determine whether the trial court applied the correct legal standard to the issue in exercising its discretion,which is a question of law for this court.gou xiao th,gou,quoting gonzalez munoz th.
renewal of a dvro does not require proof of abuse during the time period since the restraining order was issued 
section makes it unnecessary for the protected party to introduce or the court to consider actual acts of abuse the restrained party committed after the original order went into effect.it would be anomalous to require the protected party to prove further abuse occurred in order to justify renewal of that original order.if this were the standard,the protected party would have to demonstrate the initial order had proved ineffectual in halting the restrained party abusive conduct just to obtain an extension of that ineffectual order.ritchie konrad th,ritchie.a trial court is vested with discretion to issue a protective order under the dvpa simply on the basis of an affidavit showing past abuse.nakamura parker th.
here,after the contested hearing,the court stated there is no evidence before the court that there has been actual abuse within the time period that the restraining order has been issued.but,as set forth above,renewal does not require a showing of any further abuse since the issuance of the original order,subd.a,for the order to be renewed.eneaji,supra,th at the trial court erred in concluding that the denial was appropriate because nothing happened in the three years since the restraining order.the key consideration for the court is not the type or timing of abuse,but whether the protected party has a reasonable fear of future abuse.a trial court should renew the protective order,if,and only if,it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected party entertains a reasonable apprehension of future abuse.ritchie,supra,th at.
perez testified that torres hernandez telephone calls and text messages made her feel scared and helpless,particularly in light of the course of misconduct that led to the original restraining order.she said that the restraining order had not stopped him so she felt fearful and helpless.she described torres hernandez as an aggressive person capable of violence,and testified that she feared for her own safety and the safety of her children.
perez testimony established a reasonable apprehension of future abuse.torres hernandez had continued to contact and threaten her even with the dvro in place.while he did not physically abuse perez after the order was issued,he had physically abused their children and perez son.as detailed below,this abuse was relevant to the continuance of the order.
here the court decision was guided by a misunderstanding of the applicable legal principles so it could not properly exercise its discretion,and we must reverse.eneaji,supra,th at the trial court exercise of discretion must be guided by applicable legal principles derived from the statute under which that discretion is conferred.
c.the court erroneously found that torres hernandez violations of the dvro were not abuse under the statute 
not only did the court err by requiring a showing of ongoing harassment to extend the order,but the court also concluded there must be a showing of abuse constituting violence or the infliction of violence on an individual.the court incorrectly concluded that the evidence must show violence or an actual infliction of violence in order to renew the dvro order.
to the contrary,the definition of abuse under the dvpa is much broader.annoying and harassing an individual is protected in the same way as physical abuse.because of an amendment in,protective orders can be issued because of persistent unwanted phone calls or letters which fall into the same category as molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,battering,or harassing the protected party.that pattern of unwanted phone calls or letters may support the same set of prohibitions in the initial protective order as one predicated on a series o
