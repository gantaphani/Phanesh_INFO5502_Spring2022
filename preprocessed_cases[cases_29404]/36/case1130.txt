plaintiff and appellant yesem asfaw mother appeals from the judgment pursuant to which defendant and respondent zeman woldberhan father is required to pay monthly child support in the amount of.mother contends the trial court erred in calculating child support payments in failing to order father to pay of the children uninsured medical expenses and in failing to make the child support payments retroactive to the filing of mother initial order to show cause.we conclude that the trial court properly refused to make child support payments retroactive to the filing of the initial order to show cause,but reverse and remand with instructions to recalculate the child support payments and to make an order concerning payment of the children uninsured medical expenses.
factual and procedural background 
according to the original petition for dissolution of marriage,mother and father were married on june,and had two children addis,born november and mikias,born november.the couple legally separated on march,and mother filed the petition for dissolution on may.on july,father filed a response and request for dissolution of marriage based on irreconcilable differences,and nullity of marriage based on prior existing marriage.on august,the court made various custody and support orders.
the following years were contentious.a bifurcated trial commenced on august,and on that date a judgment of nullity was granted evidence was completed on october.in a judgment filed november,the trial court awarded parents joint legal and physical custody of the children with mother home being the children primary residence and mother having sole responsibility for decisions regarding medical and psychological treatments.
on november,the trial court filed a memorandum of intended decision re child support.adopting the dissomaster printout as its findings,the trial court ordered father to pay monthly child support,retroactive to september,in the amount of.
mother requested a statement of decision regarding,in pertinent part,father actual gross income from the apartments he owns,father actual business expenses attributable to the apartments,father income from all sources available for child support and father net income,after taxes,available for child support.pursuant to the trial court order,father prepared a proposed statement of decision.mother objected to the proposed statement.
in a statement of decision filed february,the court found,in pertinent part,as follows father gross income from the apartments was in father business expenses for attributable to those apartments was father owns only percent of one of the apartments father actual gross annual income from a parking lot he operated was per month father lease of the parking lot is a valid transaction gross income from the parking lot is attributable to father for purposes of calculating child support father business expenses attributable to the parking lot is per month annually the business expenses listed by father on attachment to his june,income and expense declaration were legitimate the monies father received from selling or refinancing real properties held in his name were paid to the interests of others who held an interest in the properties and so there were no funds the court could consider as income available to pay child support father monthly sources of income from which to pay child support were a net profits from the parking lot and b income from apartment rentals and father net monthly income was.
in a judgment filed that same day,the court found father time with the two minor children is percent father has gross monthly income of mother has gross monthly income of and mother has monthly child care expenses of.based on those findings,the court ordered father to pay child support in the amount of per month mother and father to each pay of the children private school tuition for the school year and father to pay mother attorney fees in the amount of.
mother filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
child support 
mother contends the trial court erred in calculating child support.she argues depreciation of father rental properties should not have been used to reduce father business income,and the evidence was otherwise insufficient to support the finding that father gross monthly income was only.we agree that depreciation is not properly deductible under the relevant family code annual gross income and section annual net disposable income because of incorrect treatment of depreciation and for other reasons,the trial court findings regarding father gross monthly income are not supported by the evidence.
depreciation of rental property in calculating child support 
in an attachment to his income and expense declaration filed june,father averred that the income derived from his rental properties was.judicial council form.from that sum,he subtracted in expenses,including depreciation of.he thus claimed of net income derived from his rental holdings.the trial court found the declared business expenses,including the depreciation allocation,were legitimate and appropriate business expenses of father,and calculated child support based on father net income as reduced by those expenses 
we have found no reported california opinion that addresses the propriety of deducting depreciation from annual gross income under these circumstances our analysis of the statutory language,the stated california policies attendant to a parent child support obligations,and the available authorities on the subject,causes us to conclude that depreciation is not deductible,and that the trial court erred in this respect.
i standard of review 
as in the trial court,we must determine whether depreciation is allowable under the statutory framework by which child support is calculated in california.typically,an appellate court review of child support orders is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion.see,in re marriage of chandler th,d.however,when an issue on appeal is strictly the interpretation of a statute,we traditionally exercise de novo review.sonoma state university workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.in the context of child support orders,the rule is no different.see in re marriage of pearlstein th,d interpretation of definition of income in re marriage of cheriton th,d cheriton.hence,we review independently the trial court order.
ii the statutory framework 
court ordered child support in california is,for the most part,a creature of statute.see cheriton,supra,th at,d child support is a highly regulated area of the law.sections and at issue here are part of division,part,article of the family code.see statewide uniform guideline,west ann.ed.foll.et seq.the legislature expressed intent is that the uniform guidelines are necessary to ensure that state law remains in compliance with federal regulations for child support guidelines.courts have the power to depart from the guidelines only in the special circumstances set forth in article.in implementing the statutory scheme,the legislature declared that the courts shall adhere to the principles enumerated in the family code.even where the legislature has expressly afforded the courts discretion,the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.citations.in re marriage of butler gill th,d see in re marriage of leonard th,d trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the child support law in re marriage of muldrow d.
the actual amount of child support to be paid by the higher earning parent is determined by a formula,the components of which require the computation of each parent annual gross income and annual net disposable income.mejia reed cal th,d,mejia.annual gross income is generally defined in section as income from whatever source derived.see in re marriage of henry th,d.net disposable income,in turn,is computed by deducting from annual gross income amounts actually attributable to certain specified expenses.
fueling our interpretation of the statutory guidelines are various policies which the legislature has identified.in its broadest formulation,california has a strong public policy in favor of adequate child support.cheriton,supra,th at,d.more specifically 
the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.
a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a.
each parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.
children should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children,subd.f.
iii sections and 
whether depreciation is deductible in calculating net disposable income under the statutory scheme implicates essentially an income statute,and an expense statute.in interpreting these sections we must,of course,ascertain the intent of the legislature,preferably from the statutory language itself.garcia superior court th,d.if the words are clear and unambiguous,we need look no further.ibid.
we start our inquiry with section since its net disposable income is an element of the actual child support formula.as we will explain,our time with that provision is brief.section lists a number of items that are to be deducted from annual gross income in determining net disposable income tax payments,fica contributions,union dues and retirement benefits,health insurance premiums,other child support,expenses,and hardship deductions.neither party suggests that depreciation expense falls within any of these categories thus,if statutory support for the deduction of depreciation is to be found,it must came from that part of section which refers to annual gross income.we turn to section,for it is there that annual gross income is given meaning.
with one exception not relevant here,section defines annual gross income as income from whatever source derived.it identifies rents as one of examples of covered income,subd.a.also relevant is subdivision a which states that income includes income from the proprietorship of a business,such as gross receipts from the business reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the business,subd.a.there is no mention of depreciation.
since rental income is expressly included as annual gross income under section,subdivision a,and business operating expenditures are deductible under a,the question before us is does depreciation of rental property constitute an expenditure required for the operation of husband business 
father answer is succinctly put in his reply brief,and it comes with a concession that the statutory language is not particularly helpful 
it would appear,without specifics from the legislature as to what to do with depreciation,there is ample support for the allowance of deductions of a depreciation expense in family code.
mother contends that gross income may not be reduced by depreciation.
as the relevant statutes are silent on the treatment of depreciation,we must look elsewhere to ascertain legislative meaning.see pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,where statute is ambiguous courts may look to other indicia of legislative intent.
iv legislative history of sections and 
where the literal language of a statute is not dispositive,we consider its legislative history to see if that process informs our interpretation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining legislative intent.citation.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.
family code section,added in,is derived from former civil code section,which was enacted in.stats,ch.section continues former civil code section f without substantive change.cal.law revision com,west ann,foll.we,therefore,review the legislative history of section.
on march,was introduced to establish a uniform standard for the establishment of the minimum amount of child support that shall be awarded,based on a specified formula.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as originally proposed,would have added as section to the civil code the following in determining the ability of parents to pay the minimum award and to calculate the actual payments to be made by each parent,all of the following provisions shall apply a the total gross annual income of each parent shall be determined.this shall include income from all sources except child support payments actually received and public assistance payments issued on the basis of a needs determination test.b the net disposable income of each parent shall then be computed by deducting from his or her total gross income the actual amounts attributable to only the following items state and f ederal income taxes.deductions under the federal insurance contributions act.union dues.health insurance premiums,limited solely to those insurance plans providing coverage to the children for whom the support payments are being computed.prior child support payments,based on proof of the amount actually paid.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.was later amended three times in the assembly in ways not relevant to the present controversy.
in comments before the california state senate judiciary committee on december,george magid,a member of the board of directors of the organization equal rights for fathers,criticized proposed civil code section,subdivision a for vagueness total gross income needs to be defined.is it the committee intent to equate the gross receipts of a person who operates a business as a sole proprietor with gross income or only the net income from the business i suggest it should be the net income,as that is the only appropriate amount to measure a sole proprietor income and it with someone else on a salary.
an undated document that appears to be staff recommendations for amendments to section stated as follows current status section in the current version of ab describes the procedures for computing the mandatory minimum award from the parent gross income amendment vi deals with more technical problems in this section.problems gross annual income as it is currently defined would include all receipts from a business but would not allow for justifiable deductions for the expenses of this business such as for inventory or rent.solution staff proposes the following amendment to section.section as amended b the annual net disposable income of each parent shall then be computed by deducting from his or her annual gross income the actual amounts attributable only to the following items,after which the remainder is adjusted to reflect the monthly net disposable income of each parent expenses directly incurred in carrying on a trade or business as defined in the california revenue and tax code section.deductions for property held for the production of rents and royalties as defined in california revenue and tax code section.italics added.
in,at the time ab was wending its way through the legislative process,california revenue and taxation code section,the statute cited in the staff report,provided adjusted gross income shall be defined by section of the internal revenue code in turn,internal revenue code section provided adjusted gross income of an individual is gross income reduced by various deductions,including those attributable to property held for the production of rents or royalties.revenue and tax code section,subdivision b expressly referred to internal revenue code section a.that section allowed as a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion,wear and tear including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence of property used in the trade or business,or of property held for the production of income.
if the staff recommendations had been enacted,section would have included a deduction for depreciation in determining annual net disposable income given the express references to the tax code definitions of adjusted gross income.but the staff recommendations were not adopted into law.instead,later amendments to completely reorganized sections and.part of the reorganization moved annual gross income from section to section which then read,in relevant part a the annual gross income of each parent shall be determined and then adjusted to obtain the annual net disposable income the annual gross income means income from whatever source derived,except as specified in subdivision b,and includes,but is not limited to,all of the following income from a private business,such as gross receipts from the business reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the business.italics added.it is the italicized language which remains operative today 
we conclude that the legislative history,although not dispositive,tends to point toward disallowing depreciation as a deduction from income in calculating child support.first,the legislature earlier had before it language which by express mention of revenue and taxation code section and indirect references to internal revenue code sections and a would have allowed depreciation of property used in the trade or business and property held for production of income.if enacted,this rule would have applied to the depreciation claimed by father here.the proposed language,however,was rejected in favor of a provision which makes no reference to either depreciation or the tax code sections dealing with the subject.
second,section as found in the earlier versions of ab used the phrase expenses directly incurred in carrying on a trade or business.in its final enactment the statute read expenditures required for the operation of the business.this change suggests a limiting of broad language from the earlier draft.although a review of the dictionary definitions of expenditure and expense reveals some commonality and overlap,expenditure is derived from to expend which means to pay out or distribute spend to consume by use.webster new internat.dict.an expense,in an accounting sense,means an item of outlay incurred in the operation of a business enterprise allocable to and chargeable against revenue for a specific period.id.at.as the fourth district distinguished the terms in a different context the word disbursement means funds paid out,and the word disburse means to expend or pay out.webster new internat.dict.the word expense is defined as cost or the financial burden involved typically in a course of action.webster,supra,at.ferrell county of san diego th,d.using these definitions,an expenditure involves the paying out of something,usually cash,for,by way of example,rent,equipment or inventory.by contrast,an expense is the cost of doing business and may or may not involve an actual payment of money.an expenditure of money obviously reduces the amount of money available to pay child support not necessarily so for an expense.here,father does not contend that his depreciation deduction reflected an actual payment of money.
although we find the legislative history helpful,it is not conclusive.thus,we turn to other markers of legislative intent.
v consideration of section in light of related provisions of the welfare and institutions code and the california code of regulations 
in addition to a statute history,we also may interpret one statute in light of related legislation.a statute is not to be read in isolation it must be construed with related statutes and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citation.hicks legg associates th,d.this exercise is designed to allow statutes to be harmonized,both internally and with each other.pang beverly hospital,th,d.statutes in one code may be considered with those in another code.estate of burden agnew th,d legislation on the same or similar subjects may be examined to ascertain the legislature probable intent see also in re mark d.civil code interpreted in light of welfare and institutions code.
our review of certain provisions in the welfare and institutions code and the california code of regulations ccr assists us in our understanding of section.parents of disabled children who receive certain state services are required to pay a portion of the costs of those services according to the parents income.see welf,parents of minor children receiving care or who reside in a state hospital,subd.b parents of developmentally disabled children who reside in the home.ccr,title,sections and prescribe the procedures for determining the amount parents are required to contribute under the respective welfare and institutions code programs.in calculating a parent share,no deduction from income is allowed for depreciation.thus,ccr section states i ncludible income from the operation of a business or from is the net income after deducting business expenses.however,depreciation,amortization,and depletion shall not be allowed as business expenses deductions.ccr section uses nearly identical language income from the operation of a business or from is the net income after deducting business expenses.depreciation,amortization,and depletion shall not be allowed as business expense deductions.
there are no reported cases on these provisions,but the regulations reflect a legislative determination that depreciation should not be taken into account in deciding the amount a parent must pay for these programs.admittedly the state interest in reducing its participation in public assistance programs is not necessarily coextensive with its interest in ensuring fairness in child support payments under the family code.nevertheless,the essential question raised in both situations is whether it is appropriate to reduce income by amounts attributable to the depreciation of certain assets.in the former,the answer is an express no,and that assists us in our decision here.
vi treatment of depreciation in calculating child support in other states 
although apparently one of first impression in our state,other jurisdictions have grappled with whether depreciation is to be taken into account in child support awards.see,treatment of depreciation expenses claimed for tax or accounting purposes in determining ability to pay child or spousal support,and cases cited.in some states the question is largely answered by statute.see ohio,subd.c alaska rules civ,rule,com.iii b.in other states where the statutory scheme is silent or incomplete,the courts necessarily have made the determination.see labar labar,baker baker app.div,stoner stoner.
in stoner stoner,supra,the connecticut supreme court surveyed case law in other jurisdictions and observed three different basic approaches to the problem,namely,that depreciation is a book figure which does not involve any cash outlay nor reduce actual dollar income and,therefore,should not be allowed as a deduction that depreciation diminishes capacity and leads to the eventual replacement of the asset involved thereby warranting its deduction and that depreciation should not categorically either be deducted as an expense or treated as income,but rather that the extent of its inclusion,if any,should depend on the particular circumstances of each case.citations.at.
irrespective of which of the three approaches are utilized,appellate decisions on the subject generally recognize that depreciation is an accepted business expense for tax and other purposes,and any reduction in the income factor of the support equation necessarily reduces the amount available for support of a child 
cases denying depreciation tend to focus on the realities of depreciation in the context of cash available for child support.for example,the connecticut supreme court ultimately concluded that its trial courts maintained discretion to consider depreciation.in stoner stoner,supra,the court affirmed a trial court order denying a downward adjustment to income for depreciation expense.in distinguishing depreciation from out of pocket expenses,the court explained depreciation is a mere book figure which does not either reduce the actual dollar income of the parent or involve an actual cash expenditure when taken.on the contrary,it represents additional cash available to the parent by permitting substantial tax deductions and,ultimately,tax savings.at.similarly,the pennsylvania court in mcauliffe mcauliffe,observed that calculation of a party income in the context of determining support payments must reflect actual available financial resources and not
