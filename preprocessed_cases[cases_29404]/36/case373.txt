hershel oscar rosenbaum rosenbaum and his children appeal the district court order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.
rosenbaum was arrested as he stood outside a fair selling promotional tickets that he had received for free from a radio station.he was wearing a with the logo of the station his children,ages eight and four,were standing beside him.he was arrested for abuse,neglect or endangerment of a child,and obtaining money under false pretenses.officers walked his children across the street to the car where their mother was waiting.on the way,they told the children that what their father did was wrong,that you know what your father did was wrong,and that he was going to jail for what he had done.rosenbaum spent eight hours in jail and was released on bail.he had in fact not violated any statute.there is no scalping law in nevada no other charge applied to his conduct.the charges against him were ultimately dropped.
rosenbaum and his children brought a suit against washoe county,county sheriff dennis balaam,county deputy sheriff lieutenant james forbus forbus,and michael haley,for damages resulting from the unlawful arrest.they claimed a violation of two constitutional rights the right to be free from unlawful arrest under the fourth and fourteenth amendment,and the substantive and procedural due process right to family integrity under the fourteenth amendment.they also brought state claims for libel,assault,battery,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,false arrest,and false imprisonment.
the county defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity,and the district court granted the motion.the district court held that while the arresting officer,forbus,did not have probable cause to arrest rosenbaum,he was entitled to qualified immunity because a criminal statute,collecting for benefit without authority,which was offered by the defendants to justify the arrest,was ambiguous.
significantly,the statute on which the district court relied in finding qualified immunity was unknown to forbus at the time of the arrest.it has no published authority or legislative history.while there is a factual dispute about when the county defendants found this statute,it is clear that it was found at some point after the arrest and even after rosenbaum was released.the rosenbaums allege that it was the district attorney who found it after this section case was brought,almost two years after the arrest.the county defendants claim that it was officer forbus who found the statute.a westlaw search of nevada law found not a single reference to this statute other than in this case.
the district court further held that while the officer comments to the children were offensive,they did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court ruling on qualified immunity for the unlawful arrest and affirm the district court ruling on the right to integrity of the family.
background 
rosenbaum received free promotional tickets for the nevada state fair from the reno radio station kozz.on august,rosenbaum stood across the street from the entrance to the fair with his children and sold the tickets for the discounted price of per ticket.he was wearing a with the kozz logo at the time.
deputy sheriff forbus responded to a complaint by fair personnel that an individual was attempting to sell free promotional tickets.he spoke with kozz,the radio station that distributed the free tickets and sponsored the event,and was told that no one had been authorized to sell tickets for a profit.he then spoke with three witnesses who had bought tickets from rosenbaum.he called for back up and approached rosenbaum.rosenbaum first denied and then admitted to selling the tickets.forbus placed him under arrest.
rosenbaum two children were escorted to their mother,who was in a parked vehicle a short distance away.forbus and perhaps other officers told them that what their father had done was wrong,that you know what your father did was wrong,and that their father was going to jail for what he had done.
rosenbaum was booked on felony charges for abuse,neglect,or endangerment of a child and for obtaining money by false pretenses,as well as on a misdemeanor charge for obtaining money under false pretenses.he was released on bail the following day.the washoe county district attorney office would later charge rosenbaum only with one felony count of obtaining money by false pretenses and then drop the charge.
this lawsuit was filed on august.the rosenbaums complaint asserts nine causes of action false arrest,unlawful detention,false imprisonment and malicious prosecution pursuant to the fourteenth amendment and violation of substantive and procedural due process right to familial integrity,and of liberty interest to rear children without unreasonable government interference libel based on a august,press release requesting information about rosenbaum and the sale of the tickets libel based on a august,press release assault battery intentional infliction of emotional distress negligent infliction of emotional distress false arrest and false imprisonment.they seek damages in an amount in excess of on each of these causes of action.
the county defendants moved for summary judgment on july.the district court granted summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity in an unpublished decision on february.rosenbaum washoe county,wl.having dismissed the federal claims,the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent state claims.id.at.the rosenbaums appealed to this court on march.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court ruling on summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity de novo.mcsherry city of long beach,cir,cert.denied.summary judgment will be granted or affirmed where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in making this determination,we will consider all of the facts in the light most favorable to rosenbaum.see scott harris.
discussion 
the court applies a analysis to determine whether officials are entitled to qualified immunity whether the facts alleged show that the officer violated a constitutional right and if so,whether that right was clearly established at the time of the event.see ashcroft.these two questions may be considered in either order.pearson callahan.the linchpin of qualified immunity is the reasonableness of the official conduct.anderson creighton,w hether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,the rosenbaums allege that the officials violated two constitutional rights the right to be free from unlawful arrest and the substantive due process right to family integrity.we will consider each in turn,addressing first whether the right was violated and then whether the law was clearly established such that the official would have been on notice that his conduct was unlawful.
unlawful arrest 
it is well established that an arrest without probable cause violates the fourth amendment and gives rise to a claim for damages under.borunda richmond,cir.an officer who makes an arrest without probable cause,however,may still be entitled to qualified immunity if he reasonably believed there to have been probable cause.see ramirez city of buena park,cir.
in the context of an unlawful arrest,then,the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis can be summarized as whether there was probable cause for the arrest and whether it is reasonably arguable that there was probable cause for arrest that is,whether reasonable officers could disagree as to the legality of the arrest such that the arresting officer is entitled to qualified immunity.jenkins city of new york,cir noting that an officer will not be entitled to qualified immunity if officers of reasonable competence would have to agree that the information possessed by the officer at the time of arrest did not add up to probable cause we will consider each question in turn.
probable cause 
an officer has probable cause to make a warrantless arrest when the facts and circumstances within his knowledge are sufficient for a reasonably prudent person to believe that the suspect has committed a crime.crowe county of san diego,cir,cert.denied.the analysis involves both facts and law.the facts are those that were known to the officer at the time of the arrest.the law is the criminal statute to which those facts apply.
this case raises the question of which criminal statute should be considered in the probable cause analysis.the district court cited devenpeck for the proposition that there will be probable cause so long as the facts known to the officer give rise to probable cause for any criminal offense.rosenbaum,wl,at emphasis added citing devenpeck alford.the district court then analyzed probable cause under three criminal statutes,including one that was found after the defendant was released and perhaps after this suit was brought,and with which neither rosenbaum,nor apparently anyone in the statute history,was ever charged.rosenbaum,wl,at.the district court ultimately found no probable cause.id.at.
while we do not agree with the district court that the nevada criminal statute collecting for benefit without authority should be considered in evaluating probable cause in this case,we do agree that the facts do not support probable cause for any crime even under that statute.we first address devenpeck and then turn to each of the offenses offered by the defendants to justify the arrest.
limits of devenpeck 
devenpeck permits retrospective analysis of probable cause.the court held that the crime for which there was probable cause need not be the one that the officer stated at the time of the arrest.id.at.indeed,according to devenpeck,the offense on which the post hoc analysis is based need not even be closely related to the crime stated by the officer at the time of the arrest or charging.id.at.it is perfectly permissible for an officer or district attorney to later determine the appropriate statute under which to charge a defendant.
this case,however,raises a question that devenpeck did not address while a retrospective analysis of probable cause is appropriate,can an arrest without a warrant be justified after the fact with any statute even one that is so remote and obscure as to not be within any reasonable officer arsenal of criminal offenses the district court did not ask or address this question.
the concern in devenpeck was that the constitutionality of an arrest should not depend on the experience of the arresting officer.the rule that the offense establishing probable cause must be closely related to,and based on the same conduct as,the offense identified by the arresting officer at the time of arrest,the court explained,would render the constitutionality of arrests subject to the experience of the arresting officer.id.at.an arrest made by a knowledgeable,veteran officer would be valid,whereas an arrest made by a rookie in precisely the same circumstances would not.id.at.but here it is likely that no reasonable officer,no matter how experienced,would have known of,collecting for benefit without authority.there is no evidence that anyone has ever been charged with this crime in nevada.indeed,even in this case,once the officials had discovered the crime,rosenbaum was never charged or prosecuted with it.
it can not be that probable cause for a warrantless arrest exists so long as the facts may arguably give rise to probable cause under any criminal statute on the books even if the crime is buried deep in a tomb and never charged or prosecuted.if it were so,officers could arrest without a warrant under virtually any set of facts and later search the legal archives for a statute that might arguably justify it.such an approach would be inconsistent with the fourth amendment fundamental requirement that searches be cabined by the requirement of reasonableness.
to be clear,our holding is narrow while the crime for which there is probable cause need not be related to the crime for which an individual is arrested without a warrant,the crime must be reasonably within the arsenal of crimes that officers enforce in the state 
no probable cause for any offense 
in any event,in this case,the district court held and we agree that the facts known to forbus did not give rise to probable cause for any offense,even the offense of collecting for benefit without authority.when forbus arrested rosenbaum,he knew the following facts forbus had received a complaint by state fair personnel that an individual was attempting to sell free promotional tickets to the fair.he had spoken with kozz,the radio station that distributed the free tickets and sponsored the event,and was told that no one had been authorized to sell the tickets for a profit.forbus saw rosenbaum standing with his children,wearing a with the kozz logo.forbus spoke with three witnesses who confirmed that they had purchased tickets for each.when he approached and spoke with rosenbaum,rosenbaum first denied but then admitted to having sold tickets.
the county defendants acknowledged that there was no probable cause for abuse,neglect or endangerment of a child.they proposed that there was probable cause for two offenses obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of.now codified at.stat.and collecting for benefit without authority in violation of now codified at.stat.
obtaining money by false pretenses 
section,obtaining money by false pretenses,provides 
a person who knowingly and designedly by any false pretense obtains from any other person money with the intent to cheat or defraud the other person,is a cheat,and,unless otherwise prescribed by law,shall be punished.
the elements of this crime are the intent to defraud,a false representation,reliance on that representation,and that the victim is defrauded.barron state.in this case,however,there was no evidence to suggest that rosenbaum intended to defraud his customers or that he was misrepresenting himself.he was openly selling promotional tickets,that he had received for free,for a price of.his customers received exactly what they paid for they were not victims of fraud.this is not a case,for example,where someone was selling counterfeit or fake tickets.the district court held,supported by the record,that these facts do not give rise to probable cause for obtaining money under false pretenses.
collecting for benefit without authority 
section,collecting for benefit without authority,provides 
a person who sells one or more tickets to any ball,benefit or entertainment,or asks or receives any subscription or promise thereof,for the benefit or pretended benefit of any person,association or order,without being authorized thereto by the person,association or order for whose benefit or pretended benefit it is done,shall be punished.
the county defendants argue that rosenbaum appeared to be holding himself out as a representative of kozz because he was wearing their.he appeared,they argue,to be selling tickets for the benefit of kozz.and because he was unauthorized to do so,he appeared to be violating this statute.this interpretation assumes that the statute makes it a crime to sell tickets for the pretended benefit of another.
the district court,however,interpreted the statute differently.the district court reasoned and we agree that the purpose of the offense is to protect charities from fraud.rosenbaum,wl,at.the district court noted that there is no published authority,state or federal,that construes the provision,nor is there any legislative history that clarifies its terms.id.as such,the district court was obliged to predict how the nevada supreme court would have interpreted the statute.id.the district court
