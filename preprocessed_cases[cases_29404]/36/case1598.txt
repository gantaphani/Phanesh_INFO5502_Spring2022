i have carefully thought about the reasons for keeping or giving up my child.i have discussed the adoption plan of my child with the adoption agency,and i have decided giving up my child to the agency for adoption is in the best interest of my child.i have read and understand the statement of understanding and the relinquishment document.i do not need any more help or time to make my decision.i have decided to relinquish my child permanently to bethany for adoption and i am signing this freely and willingly.
less than one inch below box,dolores signed the form,stating she had understood and agreed to the statements she had initialed and then also signed the form again approximately two inches below that.
dolores also signed a free will declaration,a form used by bethany,which stated 
i,dolores declare under penalty of perjury that i am making the decision to place my child for adoption through bethany of my own free will and based on the full and complete knowledge of all my parenting options.i further declare that i am not being coerced by anyone into making this decision.
when dolores deposition was taken on may,she testified it was her intent when she signed the relinquishment that the child be adopted.dolores understood at that time that her rights to the child would be terminated when the relinquishment was filed with dss.dolores understood that relinquishing the child meant giving him up permanently for adoption.dolores testified she understood the meaning of each of the advisements in the boxes she did initial and affirmed it was her intent that day to give up her right of custody to the child.

ii.processing the relinquishment 
on about february,lori wallbridge of dss confirmed receipt of the relinquishment.wallbridge refused to acknowledge the relinquishment because dolores had not initialed box on the sou.dss requested an affidavit from the birth mother so it could acknowledge the relinquishment.
the denial of acknowledgment was faxed to bethany on about february.when johnson reviewed the denial,she believed she could solve the problem by providing a letter affidavit.
as of march,dolores wanted the adoption to proceed.in the middle of march,dolores decided to try and stop the adoption and looked for adoption information on the internet.
