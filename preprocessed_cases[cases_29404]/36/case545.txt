the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b section b,generally protects from tort liability any publication made in connection with a judicial proceeding.we must decide whether the privilege protects a letter that a supervisor of a county victim witness program wrote in connection with a family law proceeding that involved visitation rights.the letter provided information regarding whether one of the persons being considered for visitation had molested his nephew a decade earlier.we conclude that the litigation privilege does protect the letter.we must also decide whether the privilege protects against a cause of action based on california constitutional right to privacy.consistent with our frequent statement that the privilege protects against all tort causes of action except for malicious prosecution,including those alleging invasion of privacy,we also conclude that the privilege does extend to causes of action based on the constitutional right to privacy.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which reached the same conclusions.
facts and procedural history 
because neither party petitioned the court of appeal for a rehearing,we take our facts largely from that court opinion.richmond shasta community services dist.cal th,d,see cal.rules of court,rule c.
in,laura and charles reported to the shasta county sheriff office that charles brother,plaintiff jacob,had molested their son,the investigating officer interviewed and believed that a molestation had occurred,but the case was not prosecuted because of young age and inability to communicate adequately.laura applied to the county victim witness program victim witness,a subdivision of the district attorney office,for victim benefits on behalf.victim witness is authorized to compensate a victim of any criminal act,even if there was no prosecution or conviction.see,subd.a.to determine whether benefits are payable,victim witness reviews medical and police reports and other documents and decides,using a preponderance of the evidence standard,whether a crime occurred.victim witness approved laura claim and,as a result,received worth of counseling services.victim witness transferred information regarding the case into a statewide vox computer database.was identified in the vox system as the victim of a molestation by his uncle jacob.the system listed date of birth but had no space for the perpetrator birth date.
in,laura and charles were divorced.then laura married todd no relation to charles or jacob,while charles married stephanie todd and stephanie had been married to each other but also were divorced in.todd and stephanie had three biological sons together the three sons.as a result,charles and stephanie lived together with the three sons,while charles biological son with laura lived with todd and laura.all of the children were minors at the time.when charles and laura were divorced,they stipulated that would have no contact with either his uncle jacob or his paternal grandparents the grandparents.similarly,stephanie and todd dissolution decree prohibited contact between their three sons and jacob and the same grandparents.
stephanie and charles became unhappy with the court order prohibiting contact between the three sons and jacob or the grandparents.consequently,an ongoing dispute existed in todd and stephanie family law proceedings regarding whether the three sons should be able to visit jacob and the grandparents.on february,stephanie now charles wife filed an order to show cause in tehama county superior court asking the family law court to permit visitation between the three sons and jacob and the grandparents due to the financial and emotional hardships the existing visitation restrictions caused the stepfamilies.
on february,laura now todd wife came to the victim witness office in shasta county,crying and distraught.she told victim witness advocate carol gall and gall supervisor,defendant stephanie lloyd,that a court hearing was scheduled that day in tehama county in which the judge would decide whether her son would have contact with his uncle jacob.she asked them to help her by writing to the court.as a result,lloyd signed and gave laura a letter that is at the heart of this litigation sometimes referred to as the february letter.
gall obtained information from the vox system indicating that jacob had molested his nephew,and that had received in victim witness benefits.vox also indicated that criminal proceedings were closed due to insufficient evidence.gall then wrote a letter for lloyd signature.dated february,and written on the shasta county district attorney office stationery,the letter was addressed to whom it may concern.it stated in november,laura came into our victim witness center and established a claim for her son who was a victim of child molestation.was a victim of his uncle jacob case which was investigated by shasta county sheriff department.the incident took place at address.the family has used all of victim witness benefits for counseling due to the crime,which was.lloyd signed the letter,listing her title as victim advocate supervisor.
lloyd assumed that jacob was an adult at the time of the molestation because the vox system referred to him as uncle and did not indicate he was a minor.both she and gall understood that the letter would be presented to a judge in family law court in tehama county.lloyd used the salutation,to whom it may concern because she did not know the judge name and thought using dear judge or your honor would sound awkward.in fact,the tehama county court proceeding involved visitation questions regarding the three sons and jacob and the grandparents,and it did not directly involve visitation between jacob and however,laura felt that if the order were dropped as to the three sons,removal of jacob prohibition on visiting would inexorably follow.indeed,charles had already sought to lift the restriction on contact between jacob and because the three sons and usually traveled together for family visitation purposes.
laura gave the letter to her husband todd,who attached it to his declaration opposing stephanie request to modify visitation and filed it in tehama county superior court.when stephanie saw the letter,she gave it to jacob.
in july,jacob filed this lawsuit against defendants county of shasta and lloyd.the lawsuit stated several causes of action including,as relevant here,one for invasion of privacy based on the february letter.a jury trial ensued.at the end of plaintiff case,defendants moved for a nonsuit based on section b litigation privilege.the trial court ruled that the privilege protected the letter and dismissed all causes of action except the one for invasion of privacy.it also ruled that jacob state constitutional privacy interests overrode the litigation privilege and denied the nonsuit as to the invasion of privacy cause of action based on the california constitution.at the end of trial,the jury rendered a verdict in jacob favor of against defendants.the trial court entered judgment accordingly.
defendants appealed.the court of appeal held that the litigation privilege protected the letter against all of the causes of action,including the one based on the constitutional right of privacy.it reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to grant the motion for nonsuit in its entirety and enter judgment in favor of defendants.we granted plaintiff petition for review.
ii.discussion 
section b defines a privileged publication as including one made i n any judicial proceeding the trial court ruled that this litigation privilege attached to the february letter,and that it protected defendants from liability for all causes of action except for one based on the state constitutional right of privacy.the court of appeal held that the privilege protected defendants from liability for all of the causes of action,including the constitutionally based one.plaintiff contends that both the trial court and the court of appeal erred in finding the letter privileged at all.he argues the litigation privilege does not protect the letter from any of the causes of action.he also contends that,even if the litigation privilege attaches to the letter,it does not extend to the constitutional right of privacy.he argues that section b,being a mere statute,must yield to the constitutional right to privacy.
we discuss these two contentions in order.
whether the litigation privilege protects the february letter 
we have discussed the basic principles underlying section b litigation privilege in many cases.the privilege applies to any publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation,even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is involved.silberg anderson cal d,quoted in rusheen cohen cal th,d.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson,supra,at.
the purposes of section,subdivision b,are to afford litigants and witnesses free access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions,to encourage open channels of communication and zealous advocacy,to promote complete and truthful testimony,to give finality to judgments,and to avoid unending litigation.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at,d.another purpose is to promote effective judicial proceedings by encouraging full communication with the courts.flatley mauro cal th,d.to further these purposes,the privilege has been broadly applied.it is absolute and applies regardless of malice.rusheen cohen,supra,at,d,silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,see also ribas clark cal d,albertson raboff cal d.indeed,the privilege extends even to civil actions based on perjury.rusheen cohen,supra,at,d,kachig boothe d.the resulting lack of any really effective civil remedy against perjurers is simply part of the price that is paid for witnesses who are free from intimidation by the possibility of civil liability for what they say.ribas clark,supra,at,quoting prosser,law of torts ed.
the february letter fits squarely within this privilege.as the court of appeal explained,it constituted a communication.it was made in the context of a judicial proceeding,a pending case in tehama county.lloyd,who was the custodian of information relevant to the action,was a.finally,the letter furthered the objects of the litigation,since the information it conveyed had relevance to a family law visitation dispute.the court of appeal elaborated on this latter point one issue before the family law court was whether a judicially imposed restriction on jacob having contact with todd sons should be lifted.the fact that victim witness,a county agency,had determined that jacob molested his minor nephew was relevant to and connected with that issue and therefore the litigation.
we add that when a court must make very difficult and critical decisions regarding child visitation,it should receive the maximum amount of relevant information.accordingly,case law is clear that section b absolutely protects litigants and other participants from being sued on the basis of communications they make in the context of family law proceedings.wise thrifty payless,th,d.in obos scripps psychological associates,th,d,the court noted that obviously informing the children counsel and therapist of the allegations regarding the mother boyfriend,and inquiring as to their veracity,furthered the goal of ascertaining which custodial arrangement was in the children best interests.similarly,in this case,providing information regarding whether one of the persons considered for visitation rights had previously molested his nephew obviously furthered the goal of ascertaining which visitation arrangement was in the children best interest.consistent with the general policies behind the litigation privilege,public agencies like victim witness must be permitted to provide such information without fear of being harassed by derivative lawsuits.
arguing against this conclusion,plaintiff notes,correctly,that the privilege protects only against communicative acts and not against noncommunicative acts,ribas clark,supra,cal d at,privilege applies to testimony,which is communicative,but not to alleged earlier illegal eavesdropping,which is noncommunicative.because the litigation privilege protects only publications and communications,a threshold issue in determining the applicability of the privilege is whether the defendant conduct was communicative or noncommunicative.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at,d,quoting kimmel goland cal d.however,if the gravamen of the action is communicative,the litigation privilege extends to noncommunicative acts that are necessarily related to the communicative conduct stated another way,unless it is demonstrated that an independent,noncommunicative,wrongful act was the gravamen of the action,the litigation privilege applies.rusheen cohen,supra,at,d.
plaintiff argues that,for these purposes,this action is based on the county noncommunicative conduct in accessing the data through the vox system and disclosing it to the victim mother.we disagree.lloyd conduct in accessing the vox system,by itself,was noncommunicative,but that act which plaintiff does not even contend was unlawful is not the gravamen of the action.as the court of appeal explained,the gravamen of jacob invasion of privacy claim was not lloyd noncommunicative conduct in accessing data through the vox system and disclosing it to the victim mother.the alleged injury stems from the publication of the information in a judicial proceeding,thereby exposing it to public view.moreover,because the cause of action is based on a communicative act,the litigation privilege extends to those noncommunicative actions which are necessarily related to that communicative act.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at,d.
citing welfare and institutions code section,plaintiff also argues that,because he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged molestation,the information obtained from the vox system was confidential and could not be released without a prior court order.thus,he continues,the letter broke confidentiality laws and,accordingly,is not privileged.the court of appeal expressed doubt that lloyd broke any confidentiality laws.it explained jacob relies exclusively on welfare and institutions code section,which,in february,shielded from public view any petition filed in juvenile court or other documents filed in that case or made available to the probation officer in making his or her report,or to the judge,referee,or other hearing officer,former subd.a,as amended by stats,ch,text in former subd.a redesignated as subd.e see also historical and statutory notes,west ann.welf.supp.foll.however,because a juvenile court case was never opened as a result of the investigation,defendants do not appear to have violated the provisions of that section,and thus jacob argument is flawed at its inception.citing superior court cal d,plaintiff challenges the court of appeal conclusion that welfare and institutions code section application depends on the existence of a juvenile court proceeding.we need not resolve this question,for we agree with the court of appeal primary conclusion that the litigation privilege protects the february letter even if we assume that the disclosure violated juvenile record confidentially laws.
as noted,the cases describe the litigation privilege as absolute,regardless of malice,and extending even to perjury.but the cases also contain language that appears to make the privilege less than absolute.as stated in a representative case the language is oft repeated the privilege applies to a publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding and to a communication by litigants or other participants authorized by law.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,italics added.plaintiff argues that,because the letter broke confidentiality laws,it was not permitted by law and lloyd was not authorized by law to communicate the information to the court.the same sort of argument could be made regarding
