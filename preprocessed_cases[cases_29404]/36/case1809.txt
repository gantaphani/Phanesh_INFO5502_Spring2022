following a lengthy hearing on the petition of edward bates to modify custody,the trial court terminated norma bates custody of the minor child,awarded custody to edward,and restricted norma visitation rights pending a professional evaluation.the court also denied edward petition to terminate unallocated maintenance and support based on an alleged continuing conjugal relationship between norma and another man.prior to the hearing,the court denied norma constitutional challenge to section a of the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act act ilcs a west and,at trial,read and relied on the written report of the child representative appointed pursuant to that statute.norma appealed,edward,and the appellate court affirmed.d.we granted norma leave to appeal.edward seeks.we now affirm.
background 
the parties were granted a judgment of dissolution,incorporating a joint parenting agreement,on july.the agreement provided that the minor child,would reside primarily with norma,subject to edward defined rights of visitation.the agreement mandated the involvement and cooperation of both parents in best interests,and both parents were ordered to use their best efforts to foster the respect,love and affection of toward each parent and to cooperate fully in implementing a relationship with that would give her the maximum feeling of security that may be possible.the judgment further provided that edward would pay unallocated family support to norma until one of several described events,including the death of either party,the remarriage of norma,or the cohabitation of norma on a resident,continuing,conjugal basis as determined by a court after notice and a hearing.
on march,norma filed a petition for modification of visitation and other relief,alleging that edward had breached the joint parenting agreement and that was experiencing extreme anxiety and distress following contact with her father.she also requested appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to section a of the act ilcs a west.in an agreed order,attorney john bush was appointed as the child representative.the record is silent as to why a child representative was appointed,rather than a guardian ad litem as requested by norma.
on march,edward petitioned the court for a rule to show cause why norma should not be held in contempt for denying him all contact with,including by telephone,beginning around january.edward petition claimed that norma failed to discuss decisions regarding activities with him that she unilaterally transferred to a different school without prior notice to or discussion with edward and that she repeatedly denigrated edward in the presence of on may,edward petitioned to modify the judgment for dissolution,including custody,asserting the same grounds as a willful violation of the judgment of dissolution and the joint parenting agreement.edward also sought termination of the unallocated family support,alleging that norma had cohabited on a resident,continuing,conjugal basis with another man.the matter was set for trial on all issues on december.
pursuant to section b of the act ilcs b west,the court appointed gerald blechman to evaluate the postjudgment visitation dispute and to make a recommendation for its resolution.after interviewing,blechman became concerned about her emotional stability and suggested to the court that she be referred to roger thatcher for therapy.thatcher began his involvement as a therapist in september.
on october,blechman sent his evaluation to the court and to all attorneys,including the child representative.the report recounted diagnostic interviews with and her parents,a collateral interview with kristin la scala a daughter of edward,and psychological testing administered to norma and edward.blechman concluded that norma had induced alienation of from her father and that this had taken a significant toll on mental health.he recommended immediate intervention to restore the relationship.he suggested family therapy two or three times a week with edward and,and a strong admonishment to norma to cooperate with the program,including ceasing any form of abuse allegations against edward.
at the request of edward,the court,pursuant to supreme court rule,required norma to submit to a psychological examination by robert shapiro.after conducting three clinical interviews and psychological testing on norma in october and november,shapiro submitted his written report,admitted in evidence at trial.he concluded that most of the psychological testing was invalid because norma answers produced results indicative of an individual who is purposely trying to deceive and present herself as virtuous.he recounted that norma reported she was afraid of edward caring for because he was an alcoholic who was always drunk.
norma also reported that did not enjoy her visitations with edward.at the time of his evaluation of norma,had not visited her father since january.norma acknowledged that she called the police in florida on three occasions while was visiting edward there during the christmas holiday in because she could not reach and was worried about her safety.shapiro concluded that the presence of police during this vacation disrupted the quality of the vacation and served to remind of her mother omnipotence.he could not confirm the existence of parent alienation because he had not evaluated the child,the relationship,and the relationship.
at the request of norma,the court appointed patrick kennelly,a licensed clinical psychologist with a practice in the treatment of alcoholism,to conduct an examination of edward pursuant to supreme court rule.he conducted three interviews with edward in october and administered psychological testing and alcoholism screening tests.he furnished a written report,concluding that edward had no evidence of psychological disorders and that the testing showed no indication of alcoholism.
the child representative proceeded with an investigation and filed a written report with the court on november.the parties also conducted extensive discovery.
on january,the court ordered blechman to conduct a reevaluation concerning whether the recommended steps were successful in improving relationship with her father.he filed an updated evaluation on january,concluding that norma was still manipulating and recommending that sole custody of be given to edward,with supervision of norma visitation by a professional familiar with parental alienation syndrome.he also recommended continued psychotherapy for and her father for the foreseeable future and strongly recommended that norma seek psychotherapy.
pretrial motions 
on december,norma filed a number of motions.she moved to dismiss edward petition to modify custody pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west,alleging the failure of edward to present affidavits establishing a reason to believe physical,mental,moral or emotional health was seriously endangered by the present environment,as required by section of the act ilcs west.
norma next filed a motion to bar the testimony of richard gardner,edward disclosed expert witness,on the ground that the subject matter of his testimony,parental alienation syndrome pas,did not meet the reliability requirements set out in frye united states.
norma then filed a motion to order child representative to testify or in the alternative to strike his recommendations and for declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of ilcs.the motion claimed that norma right to due process of law would be denied if the child representative were allowed to present his report with no attendant right to him.the motion asked the court either to strike and disregard the recommendations of bush,or to order him to submit to deposition and to testify in the case,or to declare the statute unconstitutional on its face as applied to norma perez.
finally,norma filed a motion pursuant to section a of the code ilcs a west to dismiss edward petition to modify custody on the ground that edward had improperly asserted the privilege when his physical and mental health were at issue.
edward filed written responses to those motions,asserting,inter alia,that norma had filed dispositive motions less than days before trial,in violation of a local rule.the motions were called for hearing on the first day of trial and decided the following day.
on december,the court denied norma section motion,finding that edward verification of the pleading was sufficient and noting that norma had participated in extensive discovery without objection.on january,the court allowed edward to file an affidavit in support of his petition to modify custody,noting that it asserted no changes in the facts alleged in the petition.norma section a motion was stricken because of its late filing,without prejudice to her right to raise the assertion of privilege issue at trial.
the court struck norma motion to bar the testimony of gardner as untimely.however,the court treated it as a motion in limine and also ordered a frye hearing,to commence on january.
the court found that the child representative report was in the nature of a prejudgment or a pretrial pleading and not evidence,but the court sealed the report.the court reasoned that the pretrial submission of the report did not implicate the challenged provisions of section of the act,and the court accordingly denied norma request to declare the statute unconstitutional.
on december,edward filed an amended motion to bar witnesses,including jeffrey johnson,a physician designated as an expert by norma,because of late disclosure and failure to comply with the requirements of supreme court rules f and g rs.f,g.the court entered an order barring johnson from testifying because his report had not been identified and filed in a timely fashion.the court also denied norma motion in limine to bar edward from testifying at trial because of his assertion of privilege,observing that she failed to file a motion to compel answers to the deposition questions.
the frye hearing 
edward,as proponent of the pas testimony,proffered three expert witnesses and articles from publications as exhibits.norma proffered no witnesses and no exhibits.
christopher barden,an attorney and a psychologist licensed in minnesota and texas,testified that he is familiar with pas and that he believed everyone in the social sciences field is familiar with the term.he characterized pas as a useful and clear description of a set of symptoms or clusters,commonly seen in child custody proceedings,when one parent is actively involved in turning a child against the other parent.
barden testified that pas is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community.he based his opinion on his clinical experience and on his extensive perusal of publications referencing the syndrome.publications are journals and other compendiums where research articles are reviewed for accuracy and methodology by a panel of experts in the relevant field.barden identified several articles submitted by richard gardner and other authors describing and authenticating pas.copies of these articles were admitted in evidence.in barden opinion,the concept of pas is not novel,having been first referenced in by the american psychological association.although pas is not described in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,fourth edition,published by the american psychiatric association in,barden did not believe that fact indicated rejection of the syndrome,noting that another revision of the dsm is expected by.
richard gardner,a psychiatrist and a clinical professor of child psychiatry,also testified.he referenced several books on pas and an index of articles on pas written by his peers.he has written published articles on pas.he described pas as a disorder arising primarily,if not exclusively,in the context of child custody disputes.it results from the combination of one parent programming or brainwashing a child into a campaign of denigration against the other parent,and the undue indoctrination of the child by the programming parent with his or her own inflated contributions.this combination,in his opinion,results in pas.gardner testified that pas is generally accepted in the relevant psychiatric and psychological communities.
robert shapiro,a clinical psychologist licensed in illinois and a member of the board of evaluators,used by the du page county circuit court to evaluate families in custody disputes,also testified that pas was generally accepted by the relevant psychological community,observing that i do know anybody who does accept it.shapiro himself has diagnosed pas many times and has testified often in court on the subject.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court found that the principle of parental alienation syndrome is sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field.
numerous witnesses testified,either in person or by evidence deposition,at the trial beginning on february,and continuing intermittently until its conclusion on april.among the witnesses were evaluators,retained experts,treating practitioners,as well as the parties,family members,police officers,and private investigators.
roger hatcher,therapist,was called as a witness by edward.he is a licensed psychologist and is the practice director at psychcare associates in aurora.he found mental health to be severely compromised.she was acutely and severely distressed with major symptoms of anxiety and panic relating to edward caused by norma influencing the child against her father.he found no evidence that any of her distress was caused by edward.if not for therapeutic intervention,she was headed for an increasingly severe psychiatric crisis.after a series of sessions with and interviews with both parents,hatcher set up a visitation schedule.after the visits,condition improved and her relationship with edward was better.
shapiro,who conducted the rule evaluation of norma,identified three occurrences consistent with alienation norma series of phone calls to florida during visitation with edward norma registering in school under the surname perez,and norma failure to maintain scheduled visitation with her father.
kennelly,who conducted the rule examination of edward,concluded that edward showed no evidence of major psychological disorders.he testified that edward test results for alcoholism were insignificant.
blechman,the court section b evaluator,testified that fit the typical criteria for pas.her complaints about her father did not appear to be valid.although she would obsessively repeat the same accusations against her father,she could provide no explanation when pressed for particulars.in blechman opinion,had false memories suggested or created by norma.although told him that her father struck her during the florida vacation,he chose not to believe her.based on his interviews with the parties,his observations,and his conversations with hatcher,he opined that residential custody of should be awarded to edward,subject to supervised visitation by norma with a professional present.
richard gardner testified regarding pas and the alleged alcoholism of edward.he did not conduct clinical interviews with or norma,but rendered hypothetical opinions based on his review of documents,reports,depositions and information conveyed to him by edward.among the materials reviewed were blechman reports and notes,letters from hatcher,police reports from florida,and the report of child representative john bush.
gardner defined pas as a psychiatric disorder arising in the context of a child custody dispute.in this disorder,one parent programs or brainwashes a child into a campaign of denigration against the other parent,even though that other parent is generally good and loving.the denigrating custodial parent inflates his or her own contributions,and pas arises as a result of a combination of both the undue denigration and the inflated heightening of the custodial parent contributions.in gardner opinion,exhibited classic signs and symptoms of pas in the moderate category.he concluded that therapy for the child would be useless as long as she lived with her mother.gardner also concluded that edward is not an alcoholic and that his possible consumption of some alcohol did not interfere with his parenting.
edward testified that had been taken out of her previous school without his knowledge,and he was required to go to court in september to learn her new school,home address,and phone number.edward also testified concerning the florida visitation incident.he described the trip he took with to florida in december of as apparently a happy and good one for her.he observed that on december,while was speaking with her mother on the telephone,she appeared to become agitated.a sheriff deputy soon arrived,spoke with,and also spoke with norma on the telephone.no official action was taken.at approximately the following morning,the same deputy arrived and said he had been called by norma.he conferred with edward,who showed him to room,where she was sleeping.the deputy again left,without taking any action.at another deputy arrived,spoke with edward and,and left without taking any action.
edward account of these events was essentially corroborated by richard young,the deputy who first arrived.his testimony was in the form of an evidence deposition taken telephonically at the instance of bush,the child representative.the deposition was taken during trial,with leave of court,and over norma objection.counsel for all parties participated in the deposition.norma objected to the testimony because deputy young was not disclosed as a witness as required by the court pretrial order.the objection was overruled,and deputy young deposition was read into evidence.he testified that he was dispatched as a result of a teletype message from illinois,requesting a check on the child welfare.he could discern no physical injury or abuse to,and she made no claim that edward had harmed her,although she seemed upset when he arrived.he returned later that night in response to another teletype message from illinois,requesting another welfare check and asking for to call her mother.since the child was sleeping,edward told him he would have her call her mother in the morning.
edward related that after january,ceased being animated and vocal with him,instead becoming withdrawn and difficult to engage in conversation.on numerous occasions he telephoned norma residence seeking to speak with,but his calls went unanswered or unreturned.
norma claimed edward was drinking and abusing during the florida trip,thus occasioning her telephoning the police.she admitted,however,that police found no evidence of either intoxication or abuse.norma claimed that she always let speak with edward when he telephoned or left a message for.her telephone records revealed,however,no return calls to edward home or cell phone numbers.further,although she claimed that visitation between edward and did not occur in only because of edward preference,several letters were introduced demonstrating that edward continuously requested his scheduled visitation during that time.
several witnesses,including family members and private investigators,testified as to the frequency and amount of edward alcohol consumption.edward admitted drinking wine frequently and rum and coke occasionally,but denied being intoxicated or drinking in presence.he said that his last alcohol consumption was about,and that he had quit drinking because it had become an issue.
the court declined to conduct an in camera interview with on the issue of whether she was abused by edward in florida because there was a meaningful risk of putting the child in a position of blaming herself for the outcome of the case.the court noted that i ca possibly put that child through it.i not going to have her come into this courtroom.
norma admitted knowing parmod malik,an airline pilot,for to years,and said they planned on getting married some day.she moved into a home in charles owned by malik,and admitted that malik stayed overnight there with her on occasion since january,and that they had sexual relations on two of his visits.nonetheless,they maintained separate residences and have not vacationed together.neither norma nor malik keeps personal belongings in the home of the other.each is responsible for his or her own expenses and home maintenance,and they do not commingle any funds.although norma admitted writing checks to malik,she claimed they were rental payments on the charles home.a private investigator employed by edward testified that he observed malik and norma kissing and hugging on several occasions.he also saw malik enter norma home several times,but did not see him leave.
at the close of the hearing,child representative bush offered his sealed report in evidence.the court allowed its admission over norma objection that it contained hearsay and that she had been denied the right to bush.
bush report described his interviews with,edward,and norma,and various school and medical records provided by the parties,as well as his observations of visitations between and edward.related to bush that she enjoyed the florida trip and denied that any abuse occurred.said she did not want to visit edward because he gets drunk and she feared he would hurt her.she described recollections of edward coming home drunk and poking her in the eyes and stepping on her toes when she was smaller.she admitted she has never seen him drink alcohol and could not articulate any reason for her fears.additionally,bush attached the first written report of blechman and the written report of mark goldstein,a psychologist who had completed a child custody evaluation prior to the judgment of dissolution.the report concluded with bush recommendation that physical custody of be transferred to edward.
the trial court found that edward had proved,by clear and convincing evidence,that present environment seriously endangered her physical,mental,moral or emotional health,and that it was in best interests that edward be awarded sole custody immediately.the court abated visitation between and norma until further order of court,finding would be seriously endangered by visitation.the court directed edward and to continue therapy with hatcher and directed edward not to consume alcohol until further order of the court.the court denied edward petition to terminate unallocated support and discharged the rule to show cause against norma.the court found no just cause to delay enforcement or appeal,pursuant to supreme court rule a a.
in announcing the ruling,the trial court said that it was based on its review of the pleadings and orders in the file,the exhibits,the substance and credibility of the expert testimony,the substance and credibility of the parties testimony,and the testimony of nonparty witnesses,as well as its review of the child representative report.the court said it would throw out the words parental alienation syndrome,basing its findings instead on the standard set out in section a of the act ilcs a west,namely,the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the parents and child.norma appealed and edward.
the appellate court,in an opinion published in part,affirmed both the change of custody and the denial of edward petition to terminate unallocated support.d at.we allowed norma petition for leave to appeal.edward seeks on the termination of support issue.we also granted leave to justice for children,a national child advocacy organization,and to richard ducote,a member of the louisiana bar,to file amicus curiae briefs in support of norma.
in her petition for leave to appeal,norma raised four points relied on for reversal.those points,as described in her petition,were the trial court committed reversible error in ruling that section of the act ilcs west was constitutional and in admitting and considering the child representative report,and in modifying custody the trial court should not have permitted the child representative undisclosed witness deputy young to testify the trial court committed reversible error in failing to interview the minor child and the trial court committed reversible error in failing to bar the parental alienation syndrome testimony of gardner.in her brief,norma asserts additional grounds for reversal the trial court rulings on the section and motions,the order barring johnson from testifying,and the limitation of the scope of another witness testimony.
supreme court rule b provides that a party petition for leave to appeal shall contain a statement of the points relied upon for reversal of the judgment of the appellate court.b.failure to raise an issue in the petition for leave to appeal may be deemed a waiver of that argument.federal deposit insurance.adherence to rule b is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of an issue it is a principle of administrative convenience.dineen city of chicago.in this case,however,we will consider only the points raised in the petition for leave to appeal.the additional points urged as grounds for reversal in norma brief were thoroughly and thoughtfully discussed in the unpublished portions of the appellate court opinion,and we find no sufficient justification to overlook the administrative requirements of rule in this instance.we therefore deem those arguments to be waived.hansen baxter healthcare.we turn now to the issues properly preserved for review.
section and procedural due process 
norma argues that section of the act is unconstitutional as applied in her case because she was denied the opportunity to the child representative,who functioned as both an advocate and a fact finder and whose written report was relied on by the trial court in its findings.the standard of review of the constitutionality of a statute is de novo.people masterson.statutes are presumed constitutional,and the party challenging the validity of a statute has the burden of clearly establishing that it is unconstitutional.in re curtis.the strong presumption of constitutionality requires courts to construe statutes in order to uphold their constitutionality whenever reasonably possible.hill cowan.
section provides,in pertinent part 
a duties.in any proceedings involving the support,custody,visitation,education,parentage,property interest,or general welfare of a minor or dependent child,the court may,on its own motion or that of any party,and subject to the terms or specifications the court determines,appoint an attorney to serve in one of the following capacities 
as a child representative whose duty shall be to advocate what the representative finds to be in the best interests of the child after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case.the child representative shall have the same power and authority to take part in the conduct of the litigation as does an attorney for a party and shall possess all the powers of investigation and recommendation as does a guardian ad litem.the child representative shall consider,but not be bound by,the expressed wishes of the child.the child representative shall not disclose confidential communications made by the child,except as required by law or by the rules of professional conduct.the child representative shall not be called as a witness regarding the issues set forth in this subsection.ilcs a west.
in his written report,child representative bush described his observations of visitation between edward and,recounted version of the events in florida as well as her recollections of edward coming home drunk and poking her in the eyes and stepping on her toes when she was smaller.the report was admitted in evidence,but norma was unable to bush on his observations and the basis for his recommendations because of the clear statutory prohibition against calling him as a witness.thus,norma argues that she was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard on a matter implicating a fundamental liberty interest,thereby violating her right to procedural due process of law as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,amend.xiv and section of article i of the illinois constitution.const,art.i.
the appellate court construed the statute to allow calling the child representative as a witness if the representative directly witnesses relevant facts and circumstances used to support a recommendation,because the representative has then stepped out of his attorney role.d at.in that instance,the court reasoned,the representative has become a witness who may be called and questioned at trial,as any other witness,under the terms or specifications as determined by the court.the appellate court held that section a does not deny a party procedural due process and is not unconstitutional because it can be interpreted to allow a party to request disclosure by the child representative of underlying factual matters or to the child representative when the representative acts as a witness.d at.the court further held that this interpretation may be reconciled with rule of the illinois rules of professional conduct,prohibiting an attorney from being both a witness and an advocate for his client,because in such circumstances the court is authorized,under section a,to appoint another attorney to represent the child.d at.
the appellate court held that the trial court erred in denying norma request to examine bush,to the extent that the representative recommendation was based on his observations as a witness.the court reasoned,however,that the error was harmless because it did not play a significant role in the trial court ruling.the trial court recited that it would consider the report for what it worth along with many other factors and,therefore,any error in considering the report was not prejudicial.d at.
norma argues before us that the appellate court statutory construction is unreasonable because it disregards the express,unambiguous language prohibiting calling the child representative as a witness regarding the issues set forth in section a.edward argues that the statute limits those issues to the expressed wishes of the child,confidential communications made by the child,and the training and experience of the child representative.according to edward,there is no express prohibition on questioning the representative on the factual basis for his recommendations or on his observations in coming to a particular recommendation.
the challenged statute provides that the child representative duty shall be to advocate what the representative finds to be in the best interests of the child after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case,and further provides that the representative shall possess all the powers of investigation and recommendation as does a guardian ad litem.ilcs a west.
we agree with norma that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous.the issues set forth in section a clearly include the duty to advocate what the representative finds to be in the child best interests and the power to investigate and recommend in the manner of a guardian ad litem.where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,a court must give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language without resort to other tools of statutory construction.raintree homes,village of long grove.the representative observations and conversations with the parties,witnesses,and were clearly within the statutory ambit barring him as a witness.thus,the appellate court statutory construction was error,and we must address the issue of whether procedural due process requires allowing the representative to be called as a witness.
in mathews eldridge,d,the supreme court held that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.mathews,at.at,d at.
the private interest involved here is the right of parents to the companionship,care,custody,and management of their children.in lassiter department of social services,d,the supreme court held that right to be an important interest,warranting deference and protection,absent a powerful countervailing interest.we have also recently held that one of the fundamental rights protected under the fourteenth amendment is the right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children without unwarranted state intrusion.see wickham byrne.further,in in re andrea,a case involving termination of parental rights,this court held that parents have a fundamental due process right to the care,custody and control of their children.
in norma case,her right to the companionship,care,custody,and management of was seriously impacted.custody of the child was taken from her and,for a period of time,she was denied any visitation.these changes seriously and unfavorably altered norma previous unfettered exercise of her custodial rights.we hold,therefore,that a fundamental liberty interest is implicated in this case.
next,we must consider whether the statutory prohibition against calling the child representative as a witness created a risk of erroneous deprivation of norma custodial rights.the representative findings,conclusions,and recommendations were all adverse to norma interests.without the important tool of,norma means of challenging his observations,conclusions,and recommendations were impaired.we have held that the opportunity to witnesses and to inspect the evidence offered against a party are part of guaranteeing the exercise of due process before an administrative tribunal.balmoral racing club,illinois racing board.this is no less so in a custody hearing in a trial court.a child representative is empowered by section a to make a recommendation after reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case and to conduct his own investigation.the representative,like any other witness,is not immune from error in observation and from inadvertent bias.the proper weight to be given the report of a child representative may be influenced by many factors,including his training and experience,the contacts between the representative,the parties,and the child,and the existence of any bias or tendency to favor one gender of parent over the other.is likely to affect the trial court assessment of the worth of the representative recommendations in many cases.
in people ex rel.bernat bicek,this court upheld a constitutional challenge to the enforcement of the domestic relations act of,ch,pars.through.a section of that statute granted unlimited authority to a master in chancery to investigate all matters relating to an inquiry,but provided no means to rebut any evidence adduced in the investigation,either by or presentation of contrary evidence.noting that little,if any,protection was afforded parties from arbitrary recommendations based on ex parte evidence from witnesses without,we held this to be a clear violation of due process of law.bernat,at.
the statute in the case before us suffers from the same infirmities as the statute in bernat.a custodial parent challenging an adverse recommendation is deprived of perhaps the most effective means of doing so because the statute expressly prohibits the right to the child representative.clearly,this created a serious risk of erroneous deprivation of norma custodial rights.thus,the second factor in the mathews analysis is satisfied.
allowing would impose no fiscal or administrative burdens on the state,and it is not inimical to any government interest we can perceive.the third mathews factor is,therefore,also satisfied.
the representative report was received in evidence,read,and relied on by the trial court and,thus,norma right to procedural due process was denied.we therefore hold that section a is unconstitutional as applied in this case.
even though the application of the statute unconstitutionally deprived norma of her due process right to child representative bush,that holding is not dispositive,for even errors of a constitutional dimension may be harmless.see people lofton.we still must determine whether the deprivation of her right to bush requires reversal of the trial court modification of custody.
modification of custody 
section of the act allows modification of a prior custody judgment,absent consent,only if the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,upon facts that have arisen since or were unknown at the time of prior judgment,that modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child.ilcs west.the trial court found that present environment seriously endangered her physical,mental,moral or emotional health and that a substantial change in circumstances had been proved by clear and convincing evidence.the court expressly considered the standards for determining best interests set out in section of the act,including the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child.ilcs a west.the court based its conclusion that a change in custody was warranted on a review of all the testimony and evidence,including the representative report and its assessment of witness credibility.
the standard of review of custody modification judgments is the manifest weight of the evidence.in re marriage of cotton.the trial court is in the best position to review the evidence and to weigh the credibility of the witnesses.cotton,at.in determining whether a judgment is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence,the reviewing court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee.in re marriage of divelbiss,d.where the evidence permits multiple reasonable inferences,the reviewing court will accept those inferences that support the court order.nemeth banhalmi,d.a custody determination,in particular,is afforded great deference because the trial court is in a superior position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and determine the best interests of the child.in re marriage of gustavson,d.
all of the expert testimony supports the conclusion that norma had consistently failed to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between and edward.blechman,the clinical psychologist,testified that norma had engaged in a systematic pattern of undermining edward with and that only a change of custody to edward was in the child best interests.shapiro,the psychologist who evaluated norma at the court request,found that norma was openly distrustful and untruthful in standardized testing and that she did not encourage a close relationship between and edward.hatcher,the therapist,described acute emotional distress in caused by the mother activities,requiring a change in custody.he found no evidence that edward had neglected or harmed the child in any way,physically,emotionally,or psychologically.gardner,edward retained expert,testified that norma had alienated from her father and that a change of custody was warranted.
although evidence of edward drinking,including his own admissions,was admitted,kennelly,who evaluated edward pursuant to norma rule request,could find no evidence that edward was alcoholic or psychologically impaired in any way.the court,in its judgment modification,nevertheless directed edward to abstain from the use of alcohol until further order.
the court announced that it found norma testimony to be inventive,untruthful,manipulative,and.it found that she did not recognize or take responsibility for her actions and the resultant damage done to the child and the child relationship with her father.
despite the clear manifest weight of the expert testimony and the credibility assessments properly made by the trial court,norma asserts that the admission of the representative report tainted the entire proceedings.she points to no statements in the report,however,that are inconsistent with the evidence at trial.our review of the report confirms that it is merely cumulative of the testimonial and documentary evidence.norma makes no argument before us on the effect the denial of her right to bush had on the outcome of the trial.she complains that the report is riddled with hearsay,yet she does not identify the purported hearsay statements and she does not describe any prejudicial effect resulting from the report admission.a reviewing court is entitled to have issues clearly defined with relevant authority cited.see sterling finance management,ubs painewebber,d.further,supreme court ru
