in this bifurcated marital dissolution proceeding,maureen manfer appeals from an interlocutory order establishing the date of separation under family code section we conclude that although the court correctly found on the basis of substantial evidence that the parties private conduct demonstrated a complete and final break in their marital relationship in june,it erroneously applied an outsider viewpoint standard to defer the date of separation to march,after the parties had revealed to the world their hitherto secret that the marriage was over.
although we review the result,not the trial court reasoning woolridge electric,d,th supp,fn,here we must observe the statement of decision clearly indicates the court relied on in re marriage of baragry d.baragry to conclude that regardless of the parties subjective intentions and the objective evidence relating thereto,the date of separation depends on whether society at large would consider the parties separated.in his respondent brief,samuel vigorously argues the propriety of that standard.but baragry does not establish such a test,and the application of it would work untold mischief in the lives of married couples who,for whatever innocent reason,agree to keep private the end of their relationship until they deem public disclosure appropriate.the test does not ask what the public thinks,but whether at least one of the parties intended to end the marriage and whether there was objective conduct bespeak ing the finality of the martial relationship.in re marriage of hardin th,d hardin.under that standard,the court selection of a march,date of separation,rather than some nine months earlier,is erroneous as a matter of law.

discussion 
legal standards pertaining to the date of separation 
because t he earnings and accumulations of a spouse while living separate and apart from the other spouse,are the separate property of the spouse,subd.a,the date of separation can be of considerable consequence with regard to the parties property rights although the statute does not define date of separation or specify a rule for determining it,and although there is no definitive authority setting forth a single standard to be employed or a comprehensive list of factors to be considered,a number of courts have attempted to enunciate guidelines.
makeig united security bk,makeig refers to that condition where the spouses have come to a parting of the ways and have no present intention of resuming the marital relations and taking up life together under the same roof.baragry,supra,d at page,inquires whether the parties conduct evidences a complete and final break in the marital relationship.in re marriage of von der nuell th,d,construes baragry to hold commencement of the separation period requires not only a parting of the ways with no present intention of resuming martial relations,but also,more importantly,conduct evidencing a complete and final break in the marital relationship.in re marriage of norviel th,d norviel,reiterates baragry formula,but adds,by at least one creditable definition,living separate and apart means residing in different places and having no intention of resuming marital relations.id.at,d.the norviel court concludes,spouses must be living separate and apart in order to separate.citation.living separate and apart requires the contemporaneous conjunction of intent to separate and conduct evidencing that intent.at the threshold,the required conduct includes some objectively ascertainable form of physical separation.id.at,d.
all of these definitions are useful,but we find the standard articulated by another panel of this court more than years ago most helpful t he date of separation occurs when either of the parties does not intend to resume the marriage and his or her actions bespeak the finality of the marital relationship.there must be problems that have so impaired the marriage relationship that the legitimate objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there is no reasonable possibility of eliminating,correcting or resolving these problems.hardin,supra,th at,d.the hardin court further teaches,all factors bearing on either party intentions to return or not to return to the other spouse are to be considered.citation.no particular facts are per se determinative.the ultimate test is the parties subjective intent and all evidence relating to it is to be objectively considered by the court.id.at,d,italics added.stated differently,the ultimate question to be decided in determining the date of separation is whether either or both of the parties perceived the rift in their relationship as final.the best evidence of this is their words and actions.the husband and the wife subjective intents are to be objectively determined from all of the evidence reflecting the parties words and actions during the disputed time in order to ascertain when during that period the rift in the parties relationship was final.id.at,d.
the evidence 
date of separation is a factual issue to be determined by a preponderance of the evidence.in re marriage of peters th,d.our review is limited to determining whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.in re marriage of de guigne th,d.in its statement of decision,the court expressly found there was a preponderance of evidence that the manfers private conduct evidenced a final and complete break in their marital relationship in june of.that factual finding is supported by substantial,essentially undisputed evidence and the court other factual findings.inter alia,the court found samuel moved out of the family residence in june samuel and maureen did not have sexual relations with one another after june they did not commingle money or support one another after that time maureen had no present intent to resume the marriage after that time neither maureen nor samuel sought marriage counseling after that time they lived separate and apart after that time they agreed at that time to hide the separation from their family and friends and they had a parting of their ways in june.other undisputed evidence showed samuel leased an apartment june,and five days later,after the couple quarreled and maureen concluded the marriage was over,samuel moved into that apartment there is no doubt the court factual findings regarding maureen subjective intent and the objective evidence of a final and complete break in the relat
