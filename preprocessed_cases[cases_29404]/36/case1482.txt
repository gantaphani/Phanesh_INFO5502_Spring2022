opinion on rehearing 
the trial court assigns an order to show cause hearing involving a domestic restraining order and several other related issues to a commissioner for hearing.the attorney representing one of the parties will not stipulate to the commissioner and moves the court to vacate the assignment.the trial court denies the motion and assigns the case to the same commissioner for a hearing,and findings on any matter of fact upon which information is required by the court.
this broad and imprecise order does not state the specific facts the commissioner is to decide.the order is like sending someone to the market to get food without a shopping list.we therefore grant a writ of mandate vacating the order.

the commissioner as a referee 
there are two kinds of reference hearings general and special.in a general reference hearing,the referee,with the consent of the parties,hears and decides the entire controversy.a trial court nonconsensual general reference constitutes an unconstitutional abdication of judicial authority.murphy padilla th,d.
a special reference,in contrast,is limited to specific fact determinations.jovine fhp,th,d.a court may appoint a referee without the consent of the parties w hen a question of fact,other than upon the pleadings,arises upon motion or otherwise,in any stage of the action,subd.a.although the findings and recommendations made by a commissioner at a special reference hearing are advisory and not binding,great weight is given to the commissioner opinion.in re marriage of petropoulos th,d.

the commissioner made recommendations to the trial judge on issues of spousal and child support,and attorney fees.the trial judge then granted an interlocutory judgment of dissolution,which incorporated the findings and recommendations of the referee.the appellate court reversed the judgment because it concluded that reference of a contested divorce action is neither permitted by section nor section.in re marriage of galis,supra,d at.
