background 
appellant came to the united states illegally from honduras sometime in,at the age of.he initially lived with his paternal aunt,maria,in the washington,area but he had conflicts with her and apparently ran away in he was picked up by ice in texas in the summer of,and put in a shelter operated by southwest key programs,a private,nonprofit providing services for unaccompanied and undocumented minors appellant was reunified with his aunt in laurel,maryland,after she signed a sponsorship agreement and affidavit of support in july,pursuant to section of the homeland security act of.b.in the affidavit,maria stated under penalty of perjury she intended to provide legal representation,economic support,education,schooling,and everything deemed necessary during minor stay in the united states.under the sponsorship agreement,orr agreed to place appellant into maria care and custody in return for her legally enforceable agreement to,among other things,p rovide for the physical,mental,and financial of the minor,to ensure the minor presence at future ice proceedings pertaining to him,and to obtain written permission from ice if she decided to transfer appellant custody to another person.because maria was not a member of appellant immediate family,she was also required by orr to obtain an official,notarized letter of consent from the minor parents granting custody of the minor.
appellant ran away again in march,and came to california by himself.he initially lived with friends until he met his year old girlfriend in the summer of,and began living with her and her mother in oakland sometime after that.he came to the attention of the agency in march,when he got into a fight with an adult male at the house and the police were called.after learning appellant was years old,the police took him into protective custody and referred him to the alameda county children assessment center.appellant girlfriend was seven months pregnant with his child at the time of this event.on march,a petition was filed pursuant to section b alleging appellant was at substantial risk of serious physical harm or illness as a result of the failure or inability of his parent or legal guardian to supervise or protect him adequately.he was initially placed in a temporary foster home by the agency.at the detention hearing,the court agreed with the agency recommendation the minor be detained while the agency continued its investigation 
on april,appellant told his foster parent he was going out to visit his girlfriend,and never returned home.he remained unaccounted for until april,when he was arrested in san francisco for selling cocaine.a section petition was filed in san francisco city and county charging appellant with a felony drug count.at appellant juvenile court hearing in san francisco on april,he admitted to a reduced felony charge of being an accessory after the fact to the commission of a felony.the judge ordered the minor criminal case transferred to alameda county for disposition,and the minor was placed at the alameda county juvenile justice center juvenile hall.on may,a disposition hearing was held on the section petition in alameda county.the probation department recommended the court find appellant legal residence to be in prince george county,maryland because his legal guardian lives in maryland,and he had no other family in the united states or ties to alameda county.the department recommended the matter be transferred back to san francisco city and county for disposition.the court declined to order a transfer.it ordered appellant detained in juvenile hall,and continued disposition of the delinquency matter pending a section hearing which was continued until may.
in an addendum report filed on may,agency social worker,kim yancy,recommended the jurisdiction hearing on appellant section petition,then scheduled for may,be continued until after the section proceedings were resolved.yancy provided documentation in the addendum report that appellant aunt in maryland had initiated guardianship proceedings for appellant in prince george circuit court in maryland in or,but the case did not advance due to his sudden departure from his aunt home in early.the attorney in the guardianship proceeding submitted a letter stating,due to appellant departure and absence from the state of maryland for approximately a year now,the state of maryland did not retain jurisdiction over him and we were unable to complete the guardianship process.the addendum report also attached copies of the sponsorship agreement,affidavit of support,and other documents signed in by appellant aunt when the department of homeland security released him to her custody.over the objection of appellant trial counsel,the jurisdiction hearing was continued in order to trail the section hearing set for may.
in a section report jointly submitted by the probation department and the agency on may,the agencies recommended the court find appellant residence was prince george county,maryland and the matter be transferred to the juvenile court in that county.the report cited the documents and information pertaining to maria sponsorship agreement with the department of homeland security as the basis for the agencies conclusion appellant legal residency was in maryland,not california.in a further memorandum to the court on may,the probation department requested appellant be detained in juvenile hall for release to ice.probation advised it had contacted ice about appellant,and ice had sent an immigration detainer requesting appellant be held in custody for hours.at the section hearing on may,the court ordered appellant to remain in juvenile hall if ice did not pick him up,and continued the disposition hearing until may.on may,appellant was released from juvenile hall into ice custody,and taken to an orr facility in seattle,washington.
in a second addendum report submitted in connection with the may jurisdiction hearing,the agency recommended the petition be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the report noted appellant was in the custody of ice in washington,and had an immigration hearing set for july,in baltimore,maryland,having missed his first immigration hearing which had been set for january in baltimore due to running away from the home of his immigration sponsor.at the hearing on may,the agency argued appellant aunt had to sign an affidavit promising to support him and to ensure his presence at custody hearings.he is not in custody and he has no legal connection to alameda county.he has a pregnant girlfriend and he was living with her family,but legally his mother is in honduras and his custodian is in maryland,and he is in the custody of the immigration service.there are a variety of reasons why it should be dismissed.appellant counsel objected to dismissal and argued appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue counsel advised he intended to present evidence appellant suffered abuse or neglect in honduras and that his aunt does not have legal custody of him,including social worker yancy about information she had concerning abuse or neglect,yancy contacts with appellant mother,and whether the court did have jurisdiction.the court agreed to schedule an evidentiary hearing,but advised it would not admit evidence it considered extraneous to the jurisdictional issue.
prior to the contested hearing on june,appellant trial counsel submitted a hearing statement in which he stated his intention to call yancy as his only witness,and served a subpoena for her appearance.the agency responded with a motion in limine to,among other things,limit the testimony appellant could seek from yancy.the motion stated yancy was the worker assigned to this matter until may,at which time the case was reassigned.as such,yancy should not be permitted to testify to events relating to this case that occurred after that date.furthermore,yancy should not be permitted to testify to facts that are not related to the issue of jurisdiction.the agency argued the only relevant facts were whether appellant was physically present in alameda county,whether he was in the custody of the agency,and whether he was a legal resident of alameda county,all questions which could only be answered in the negative,according to the agency.the agency maintained having to bring yancy in to testify would also have been prejudicial because yancy was not in agreement with the agency as to matters having nothing to do with the jurisdictional issue.the agency argued it would confuse and prejudice the proceedings to allow that irrelevant matter to be brought up.
at the hearing on june,appellant counsel argued the court had subject matter jurisdiction under the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea,which has been adopted in california in family code section et,because california would be considered appellant home state for purposes of the statute,subd.a.counsel sought to social worker yancy in part to establish appellant contacts with alameda county were sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the uccjea.the court held yancy testimony could not support a finding of subject matter jurisdiction in california,and dismissed the section b petition without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court explained its ruling as follows i do believe factually that this is appellant home state.he ran away from the east coast.he was living with his aunt.she had custody of him.she signed all of the papers saying that she would be his custodian.he ran away.he meets a nice girl,got her pregnant,was living with her family.that does make california his home state.it just does.so factually i find that this is not his home state.i do believe this court has jurisdiction over this issue.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellant contends the juvenile court erred in determining it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the governing provisions of the uccjea,and seeks reinstatement of his dependency case on that basis.he argues in the alternative he was erroneously denied the right to social worker yancy on issues relevant to subject matter jurisdiction in violation of his right to due process,and seeks reversal of the dismissal order and remand for a new jurisdiction hearing.
applicable law 
the uccjea is the exclusive method in california to determine the proper forum in child custody proceedings involving other jurisdictions.citation.a dependency action is a child custody proceeding subject to the uccjea.citations.the purposes of the uccjea in the context of dependency proceedings include avoiding jurisdictional competition and conflict,promoting interstate cooperation,litigating custody where child and family have closest connections,avoiding relitigation of another state custody decisions,and promoting exchange of information and other mutual assistance between courts of other states.in re jaheim th.
family code section provides a except as otherwise provided in section,a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if any of the following are true this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding,or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state.a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph,or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that this state is the more appropriate forum under section or,and both of the following are true a the child and the child parents,or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent,have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence.b substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child care,protection,training,and personal relationships.all courts having jurisdiction under paragraph or have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under section or.no court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraph,or.b subdivision a is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this state.c physical presence of,or personal jurisdiction over,a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a child custody determination.italics added.
the uccjea defines home state as the state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding a period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period,subd.g.a person acting as a parent is defined as a person,other than a parent,who has physical custody of the child or has had physical custody for a period of six consecutive months,including any temporary absence,within one year immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding and has been awarded legal custody by a court or claims a right to legal custody under the law of this state,subd.m.
we are not bound by the juvenile court findings regarding subject matter jurisdiction,but rather independently reweigh the jurisdictional facts.in re jaheim,supra,th at.
analysis of jurisdictional facts 
in the trial court,appellant counsel contended california was appellant home state under family code section,subdivision a.he argued appellant was living with family friends in oakland who were acting as his parents when this proceeding commenced on march.appellant pursues a different theory in this court.he contends california has subject matter jurisdiction as a matter of default under section,subdivision a,because neither california nor any other state or country would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraphs,or of subdivision a.the agency maintains subdivision a is inapplicable because maryland in fact has subject matter jurisdiction under the criterion specified in subdivision a.according to the agency,appellant aunt qualified as a person acting as a parent for purposes of the home state definition,and appellant unauthorized relocation to california in march can not divest her of that status.we agree with the agency.
as an initial matter,appellant correctly points out honduras does not qualify as his home state because he was not living there for the period preceding the filing of the dependency petition in this case.we disagree,however,with his further contention maryland must be ruled out as his home state f or the same reason.in our view,maryland would have jurisdiction under family code section,subdivision a because it was appellant home state on or within six months before the date this proceeding commenced.appellant aunt qualifies as a person acting as a parent for purposes of the home state definition in section,subdivision m,and he lived with her in maryland for at least six consecutive months.although appellant had run away to california by the time this proceeding commenced,his absence from maryland without his aunt permission after march was a temporary absence for purposes of section,subdivision g,at least until appellant was returned to the custody of ice on may,and the decision was made not to reunify him with his aunt.thus,maryland was appellant home sta
