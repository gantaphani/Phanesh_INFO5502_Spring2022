discussion 
code of civil procedure section does not preclude an award of attorney fees and costsa.overview 
husband contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award wife the attorney fees she requested in the osc he argues that the osc request for attorney fees was essentially a section motion for reconsideration of the october order denying such fees but that it did not meet the jurisdictional requirements of section.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that a section request for attorney fees that is filed after an earlier denial of such fees need not comply with section 
our analysis begins with the code of civil procedure.section specif ies the court jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions legis.counsel,bill,stats.summary.in pertinent part,it provides a when an application for an order has been made to a judge and refused in whole or in part,or granted any party affected by the order may,within days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,make application to the same judge or court that made the order,to reconsider the matter and modify,amend,or revoke the prior order.the party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown.b a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or in part may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances or law,in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts,circumstances,or law are claimed to be shown e this section specifies the court jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions,and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court,or for the renewal of a previous motion,whether the order deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final.no application to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.in gilberd ac transit th,d,the court held that section is the exclusive means for modifying,amending or revoking an order.that limitation is expressly jurisdictional.citation.
we next turn to the family code.section provides what appears to be a different method for seeking reconsideration of attorney fee orders in family law cases.it provides generally that in deciding whether to award attorney fees,the court is to determine the ability to pay and consider the respective incomes and needs of the parties in order to ensure that each party has access to legal representation ibid.it then states from time to time and before entry of judgment,the court may augment or modify the original award for attorney fees and costs as may be reasonably necessary for the prosecution or defense of the proceeding or any proceeding related thereto,italics added.
we continue our analysis with some familiar principles of statutory interpretation.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself under the rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning however,the rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved under the legislative history.citation.armato,supra,th at,d,internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.interpretations that lead to absurd results or render words surplusage are to be avoided.people loeun cal th,d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.further,we do not determine the meaning of a statute from a single word or sentence.instead,we construe the words and sentences in context and in the light of the statutory scheme.department of industrial relations lee th,d.in reconciling two apparently inconsistent statutes,a specific statute is properly treated as an exception to a more general one.medical board superior court th,d,citing san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors cal th,d.finally a statute should be construed to avoid implied repeal of another statute.department of personnel administration superior court th,d.
as we explain below,application of statutory construction rules that favor specific legislation over the more general,disfavor implied repeal,harmonize statutes on similar subjects,and make paramount legislative intent,compel us to conclude that the trial court properly utilized section and not section in making its attorney fees award.our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that courts have been cautious in applying section outside of civil actions and that not all provisions of the code of civil procedure apply to family law matters.
section applies as the more specific statute such a construction avoids implied repeal.
sections and are at odds with each other in several respects,the most fundamental of which is the former requirement that application for reconsideration be brought within days of the entry of the original order,subd.a,a provision absent from section.the latter permits an award of attorney fees to be augmented or modified from time to time.the only reasonable interpretation of the from time to time language is that application to augment or modify an attorney fees award in a family law matter may be brought at any time,not just within days of the original order.kaiser easton d.additionally,unlike section,subdivisions a and b,both of which require a showing of new or different facts,circumstances or law,a section application may be made if fees are reasonably necessary for the prosecution or defense of the proceeding or any proceeding related thereto a moving party need not show changed events.
in an effort to harmonize what appears to be two inconsistent statutes,we are mindful of the rule that,repeal by implication is disfavored.we assume that in enacting a statute the legislature was aware of existing,related laws and intended to maintain a consistent body of statutes.citations.thus,there is a presumption against repeals by implication they will occur only where the two acts are so inconsistent that there is no possibility of concurrent operation,or where the later provision gives undebatable evidence of an intent to supercede the earlier the courts are bound to maintain the integrity of both statutes if they may stand together.citations.department of personnel administration superior court,supra,th at,d.
a review of the historical precedents to sections and is thus helpful to our understanding of which statute applies in the present setting.code of civil procedure section is derived from former code of civil procedure sections and,which were originally enacted in sections and were repealed and replaced with former section in stats,ch.former section was repealed,and current section was enacted in.stats,ch.in,section was amended to add,among other things,subdivision e,which provides that section specifies the court jurisdiction with regard to reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions stats,ch.prior to this amendment,section was not jurisdictional.josephson superior court d.moore moore d,pacific states grant.in,section was amended again to add subdivision g,making the section applicable to all applications for interim orders.stats,ch.
family code section has similar bloodlines.it is derived from former civil code section which was also enacted in.section at that time read while an action for divorce is pending the court may,in its discretion,require the husband to pay as alimony any money necessary to enable the wife to support herself or her children,or to prosecute or defend the action.codes of california acts amendatory,section was amended to give the court discretion to vary,alter or revoke orders made pursuant to that section.codes of cal.acts amendatory,ch.various amendments not relevant to our discussion here followed until,when section was rewritten,and the provision for pendente lite attorney fees was included in newly enacted former civil code section.stats,ch,and hangen hangen d.by,former civil code section read during the pendency of any action for divorce upon an order to show cause or motion,and if such relief is requested in the complaint,cross complaint or answer,the court may order the husband or wife to pay such amount,as may be reasonably necessary for the cost of maintaining or defending the action and for attorney fees and from time to time and before entry of judgment upon application as aforesaid,the court may augment or modify the original award,if any,for costs and attorney fees as may be reasonably necessary for the prosecution or defense of the action or any proceeding relating thereto stats,ch,italics added.in,section was replaced by former civil code section stats,ch,which in turn was replaced in by former civil code section.stats,ch.these statutory changes were.finally,family code section replaced section in.stats,ch.
thus,provisions in the code of civil procedure for obtaining reconsideration of civil orders in general,and provisions in the civil code and later the family code for obtaining modification of prior orders awarding pendente lite attorney fees,have coexisted for some years.each time the legislature amended,repealed or added provisions to the reconsideration statute and to the laws providing for modification of attorney fee awards,we assume it was aware of the provisions of the other statute.in particular,we note that during the regular session,the legislature both enacted former civil code section stats,ch,and amended former section stats,ch.accordingly,it is unlikely that the legislature impliedly repealed any part of either statute.department of personnel administration superior court,supra,th at,d.
unlike the judicial guesswork inherent in implied repeal analysis,another facet of statutory construction is more firmly rooted and also suggests section is unaffected by section.that rule is that statutes superficially in seeming conflict can be reconciled by giving effect to the statute that is more specific and ignoring the more general statute.
here,section is narrowly tailored to apply only to attorney fee orders and only to attorney fee orders in family law matters.these subjects are not expressly addressed in section,which on its face applies to all orders.san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors,supra,cal th at,d,medical board superior court,supra,th at,d.we,thus,conclude that section,being more specific,applies to the present situation to the exclusion of section.
section is not universally applied to proceedings outside of civil actions.
our conclusion that section does not apply to family law attorney fee orders is supported by other cases that recognize the statute limitation notwithstanding its facial breadth.for example,interim rulings in criminal cases are excepted from application of section.people castello th,d.nor does section apply in dependency proceedings,where welfare and institutions code section provides that a ny order made by the court in the case of any person subject to its jurisdiction may at any time be changed,modified,or set aside,as the judge deems meet and proper,subject to such procedural requirements as are imposed by this article.in in re jamika th,d,the court held that welfare and institutions code section and california rules of court,rule impose the relevant procedural requirements for a section motion and compliance with section was unnecessary.but see forslund forslund,supra,d at.
other provisions of the family code dealing with reconsideration also do not incorporate section.for example,section provides a motion by a parent for reconsideration of an existing child custody order shall be granted if the motion is based on the fact that the other parent was convicted of a crime in connection with falsely accusing the moving parent of child abuse.in the california practice guide family law,the authors observe though the statute uses the language motion for reconsideration,it is not made subject to the section jurisdictional limitations governing motions for reconsideration generally citation.legislative history indicates that section is meant,in effect,to provide for an automatic rehearing of child custody orders that are tainted by a parent false child abuse accusation for which he or she is subsequently convicted.the statute provides no time limit on the grant of su
