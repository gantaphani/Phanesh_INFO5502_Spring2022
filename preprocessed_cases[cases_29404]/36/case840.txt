following the death of his,william schopfer father shared custody of his daughter,jennifer,with her stepfather,daniel bonebrake stepfather.pursuant to a court order,father also paid stepfather each month in child support.four months before jennifer was expected to graduate from high school,however,and a month before she was to turn,father moved to reduce his child support obligation to zero.the trial court denied his motion.
on appeal,father contends the trial court erred in denying his request to modify support because under subdivision a of family code section and plumas county of child support services rodriquez th,d rodriquez,the court lacked authority,as a matter of law,to order third party support absent an express agreement.father also contends that because jennifer was no longer a minor,neither he nor stepfather had primary physical responsibility for her for any period of time and therefore,under edwards edwards th,d edwards,it was error for the trial court to maintain the previous guideline support order when timeshare could no longer be calculated.
we reject both arguments.first,we conclude neither section a nor rodriquez required the trial court to modify father child support obligation to zero because,as the trial court found,father agreed to pay guideline child support to stepfather a year earlier,when the court made the order for per month in support,and thus section a was satisfied.second,we conclude that a guideline child support order made during a child minority that remains in effect after the child birthday because the child is a high school student need not be modified simply because neither party has custody of the child after she turns.accordingly,we will affirm the trial court order denying father motion.
factual and procedural background 
father and barbara schopfer now deceased were the parents of jennifer,born august.from the case no.and title,it appears mother commenced this proceeding to dissolve the marriage in.judgment was presumably entered sometime thereafter,and mother apparently married stepfather after that.
in,mother apparently assumed sole physical custody of jennifer and father was ordered to pay mother per month in child support.
in august,mother died.at that time,a motion by father relating to custody and visitation was pending.meanwhile,father continued to make his child support payments for six weeks after mother death.
in october,about the time father stopped paying child support,stepfather filed his own motion relating to custody and visitation both custody motions were resolved in december,when the court gave joint legal and physical custody of jennifer to father and stepfather.at that time,both parties acknowledged jennifer was living with stepfather,and the order provided that father custodial time with her was subject to her agreement.
in the months that followed,jennifer did not spend any time with father.probably based on this fact,stepfather sought the assistance of the department of child support services the department in securing child support from father,and in april the department filed a motion for child support on behalf of stepfather.
in his response to that motion,father did not mention section a,nor did he oppose paying child support to stepfather on any other basis.instead,he specifically requested that the court order him to pay stepfather per month in guideline child support.
at a hearing in june,the court ordered father to pay stepfather per month in child support beginning in may with arrears back to october.the court guideline support calculation was based on jennifer spending percent of her time with stepfather and zero percent with father just as father proposed guideline support calculation had been.
in august,at the recommendation of jennifer therapist and drug counselor,stepfather enrolled jennifer in boarding school in oregon.father approved of the placement following jennifer enrollment,stepfather was in contact with jennifer counselors on a weekly or biweekly basis,consulting with them on her academic and behavioral progress.additionally,stepfather spoke with jennifer about her activities by telephone at least weekly.between october and february,he visited with her on three weekends,and in june jennifer spent a week at home with him.during this time,father had no physical contact with jennifer.jennifer also intended to come back to stepfather home for visits in august and september and intended to return to stepfather house following her graduation in december.
in july,father filed an order to show cause osc seeking to modify the prior order for child support to zero.relying on rodriquez,he argued there is no statutory authority for the court to award child support to a custodian.he also argued that because jennifer was now years old and in boarding school,the tuition for which was paid out of her mother estate,a continued order for support to stepfather was inequitable.
stepfather opposed father request,arguing that father had a duty to support jennifer until she graduated from high school,which he anticipated would occur in december.stepfather also asserted that the support he received for jennifer had been used to help pay her boarding school tuition,which had been over in the previous months.
at the hearing on father motion in august,the court requested additional briefing on edwards,which had been published four months earlier.in his brief,father relied on edwards to argue that because jennifer was years old,neither he nor stepfather had primary physical responsibility for her and therefore guideline child support was inappropriate.stepfather argued that edwards was distinguishable because,unlike the adult child in edwards who was in college,jennifer had not yet graduated from high school.
in september,the court heard further argument on father motion.the court then implicitly denied the motion,ruling as follows the court finds that the facts in the present case can be distinguished from the rodriquez case.father agreed to pay guideline support in responsive pleadings filed on and orders made in.the court finds that the child attendance at boarding school does not impact father ongoing obligation.father appeals from that order.
discussion 
father contends the trial court erred in denying his request for modification of the prior child support order.we review orders granting or denying a request for modification of a child support order for abuse of discretion.citations.the trial court exercise of its discretion must be informed and considered citations,and the trial court may not ignore or contravene the purposes of the law.citation.to the extent father challenges the trial court factual findings,we review the findings for substantial evidence,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed in the trial court.rodriquez,supra,th at,d.questions of law,however,are subject to the independent review of this court.ibid.
section a was satisfied here because father agreed to pay guideline child support to stepfather 
relying on section a and rodriquez,father contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to reduce child support to zero because he was not bound to compensate stepfather for the support of jennifer.he is wrong.
section a provides that a parent is not bound to compensate the other parent,or a relative,for the voluntary support of the parent child,without an agreement for compensation.
in the trial court,stepfather took the position that his support of jennifer was voluntary when he asserted that d espite not having a duty to support jennifer,stepfather has been voluntarily contributing to jennifer emotional,physical,and financial wellbeing for many years.we question whether stepfather support of jennifer could be deemed voluntary for purposes of section a when he had joint custody of her under a court order.we need not answer that question here,however,because by the time the court ruled on father motion to modify support,jennifer had turned and neither party had custody of her we are aware of no authority that would impose a legal duty on stepfather to support the adult child of his deceased wife.thus,we agree stepfather support of jennifer following her birthday was voluntary.but that does not mean section a required the trial court to reduce father support obligation to zero.
father admits that under section he has a duty to support jennifer and under section that duty continues until she graduates from grade or turns,whichever occurs first.his contention is that under section a he is not bound to discharge that duty by paying child support to stepfather because he did not agree to compensate stepfather for stepfather support of jennifer.as the trial court properly found,however,father did agree to compensate stepfather when,in response to the child support motion the department filed against father on stepfather behalf in,father specifically requested that the court order him to pay guideline child support to stepfather.while it is true the amount of child support the court ordered was more per month than the guideline figure father had proposed,father did not appeal the court order,and the fact remains that father expressly consented to pay guideline child support to stepfather.that was all the agreement for compensation that was necessary to satisfy section a.by agreeing to pay guideline child support to stepfather and allowing a support order to be entered to that effect,father bound himself to compensate stepfather within the meaning of section a by complying with the support order.
nothing in rodriquez alters this conclusion.in that case,mother was awarded primary custody of the minor child and child support from father.rodriquez,supra,th at,d.eventually the child moved in with mother brother family the andersens and everyone agreed he could remain there until he completed high school.ibid.
initially,mother gave the andersens the child support father was sending her,along with some of her own money to cover the child expenses.rodriquez,supra,th at,d.later,however,mother stopped sending her own money and sent the andersens only the child support from father.ibid.the andersens then asked the plumas county department of child support services to assist them in obtaining an order of support against mother.ibid.the department filed a complaint for child support.ibid.
the trial court dismissed the department complaint because mother was the custodial parent.rodriquez,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that absent an agreement between mother and the andersens,mother was under no obligation to give money to the andersens for the child support.ibid.the court found no such agreement.id.at,d.the department appealed.ibid.
on appeal,this court concluded that nothing in the statutes permitting the county to establish or enforce child support orders suggests that third party,nonparent family members such as the andersens may enlist the local child support agency to prosecute an action to collect child support on their behalf.rodriquez,supra,th at,d.the court looked to section a this section,and its predecessor citation,have long been interpreted to deny compensation to intrafamily support arrangements of the type at issue here,unless the parties have an express agreement for support.rodriquez,at,d.
rodriquez does not assist father because there was no agreement for support in that case.here,in contrast,father specifically agreed to pay guideline child support to stepfather in.
father contends even if there had been an agreement in,that did not preclude him from arguing in that there should be no prospective support order because under subdivision a of section,with certain exceptions not applicable here,a support order may be modified at any time as the court determines to be necessary.father acknowledges that generally the moving party in a modification proceeding bears the burden of proof of showing changed circumstances that justify a new court order.in re marriage of bardzik th,d.he contends,however,that this case falls within the one exception to the changed circumstances rule,identified in bardzik,for modification of child support orders that do not conform to the guideline formula.in his view,t he support order did not meet the guideline once jennifer turned because there was no appropriate manner to calculate timeshare.
we will address father argument about jennifer turning and its effect on guideline support in more detail later in the opinion.for now,however,it is sufficient to say that this case does not fall within the exception to the changed circumstances rule on which father relies.in bardzik,the court explained that there is one instance where the moving party effectively bears no burden at all to show a change of circumstances,and that is where a previous child support order does not already conform to the guideline formula in family code section which would normally unless something has gone wrong be an order predating the adoption of section.section of the family code provides that the very existence of the guideline itself is enough by itself to modify an existing,support order to bring it into compliance with the guidelines set out in family code section.in re marriage of bardzik,supra,th at,d see the establishment of the statewide uniform guideline constitutes a change of circumstances.
here,father does not deny that the child support order he sought to modify postdated the establishment of the child support guideline.thus,he can not rely on the establishment of the child support guideline to satisfy the changed circumstances rule,which is all the exception discussed in bardzik allows.
in the alternative,father contends there were changed circumstances in this case sufficient for a modification of the prior support order because jennifer had reached the age of majority,was no longer residing with stepfather,and was no longer being supported by stepfather but rather by the trust set up for jennifer benefits after the passing of jennifer mother.none of these circumstances,however,relates to the basis for father modification motion presently at issue specifically,section a.even if some circumstances changed between the order and father modification motion,and even if one or more of those changes might have justified a modification of child support by altering the end result of the support calculation under the guideline formula,that does not mean father is suddenly empowered to belatedly assert section a as a bar to any child support order whatsoever in favor of stepfather.father had the opportunity to assert the bar of that statute in,when the department moved for child support on stepfather behalf,but he did not do so instead,he consented to pay guideline child support to stepfather.father attempt to raise the bar of section a now,after he already agreed to pay stepfather child support in,effectively amounts to a collateral attack on the support order by way of a motion for modification,which is impermissible.see in re marriage of mulhern d.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the trial court did not err when it refused to modify father child support obligation to zero based on section a.
the trial court did not err in requiring father to pay child support past jennifer birthday,despite her attendance at boarding school 
relying on edwards,father contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to modify the prior order for support because jennifer was attending boarding school and was no longer a minor.we disagree.
in edwards,the parties agreed that,subject to modification by the court,father would pay child support until the child turned years old or completed college.edwards,supra,th at,d.after the child turned and moved away to college on a full financial aid package,father moved to terminate child support or reduce it to zero.id.at,d.the trial court reduced father support obligation from to per month pursuant to the guideline formula,assigning father zero percent responsibility as part of the calculation.id.at,d.
on appeal,t he essential issue presented wa s the applicability of the statutory support guideline to a competent adult child who has moved away to college.edwards,supra,th at,d.the appellate court concluded that,under the circumstances presented,the guideline formula,by its terms,wa s inapplicable.ibid.in reachi
