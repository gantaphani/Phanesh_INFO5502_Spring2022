in,california law first recognized the domestic partnerships of couples and certain couples who chose to share one another lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring,subd.a.since that time,the legislature has repeatedly acted to expand the rights and responsibilities of domestic partners.this case concerns one of those rights,a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death.
the cause of action is a creature of statute,and standing to sue is governed by code of civil procedure section steed imperial airlines cal d.the decedent in this case,andrew lee howard,died in may of.on that date,section specified that a cause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent personal representative on their behalf a the decedent surviving spouse,children,and issue of deceased children 
as of january,however,section subdivision a was amended to include not just spouses and children,but domestic partners as defined in family code section.it was after that date,in may of,that howard domestic partner,appellant karl bouley,filed this suit for medical malpractice against respondents long beach memorial hospital,valley view internal medicine,and george kooshian,david amin,and amy stone.
respondents demurred to the suit on the ground that appellant did not have standing to sue,that is,that the case was governed by section as it existed when howard died,not as it existed when the suit was filed.the trial court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the case.we find that on the plain language of the statute and the legislative history,the amendments to section were intended to operate retroactively.further,effective january,while this case was on appeal,section was again amended.now,new subdivision f of section provides that notwithstanding paragraph,for a death occurring prior to january,a person may maintain a cause of action pursuant to this section as a domestic partner of the decedent by establishing the factors listed in paragraphs to,inclusive,of subdivision b of section of the family code,as it read pursuant to section of chapter of the statutes of,prior to its becoming inoperative on january.an examination of those amendments reveals that the legislature intended that these amendments,too,operate retroactively.we further find that there is no constitutional barrier to effectuating the legislative intent.we thus reverse 
discussion 
a retrospective law is one which affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions and conditions which are performed or exist prior to the adoption of the statute.citations.aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d.phrased another way,a statute that operates to increase a party liability for past conduct is retroactive.citations.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.the and amendments to section may fairly be said to be such statutes.
that is,however,only the beginning of the inquiry.if the legislature has clearly indicated its intent that the amendments operate retroactively,we must carry out that intent unless the constitution forbids.in re marriage of bouquet cal d,aetna cas.surety.acc,supra,cal d at.a statute retroactivity is,in the first instance,a policy determination for the legislature and one to which courts defer absent some constitutional objection to retroactivity.citation.myers philip morris companies,supra,cal th at,d.
here,the legislative intent is unmistakable.in subdivision d,section provides that this section applies to any cause of action arising on or after january.with that language,the legislature unambiguously provided that the amendments must be applied to this lawsuit.
it is true that subdivision d was not added to the statute to address the amendments.instead,it was added in as urgency legislation stats,eff.may,in order to undo the unintended consequences of amendments,in which the legislature had inadvertently deprived certain parents of the right to sue.wedding,cal.wrongful death statute correcting an unintended mistake,mcgeorge.
that bit of history is not determinative.the legislature is presumed to be aware of existing law people cruz cal th,d,and may certainly be presumed to know the full text of the laws it is amending.the legislature was free to remove subdivision d from the statute once it served its original purpose,or to amend it to specify that it did not apply to the amendments.the fact that the legislature chose not to do so can only lead us to conclude that the legislature intended that subdivision d would apply to the amendments,making those amendments retroactive.people bouzas cal d.
further,appellant also has standing to sue because the amendments to section so provide.section subdivision f explicitly applies to a death occurring prior to january,and provides that a person may maintain a cause of action pursuant to this section as a domestic partner of the decedent by establishing the factors listed in paragraphs to,inclusive,of subdivision b of section of the family code,as it read pursuant to section of chapter of the statutes of,prior to its becoming inoperative on january.howard died prior to january.appellant has alleged that he and howard were domestic partners under the version of family code section operative prior to january,thus,under the plain language of the statute,appellant may sue for wrongful death.
respondents make two arguments to the contrary.they point out that the statute also provides that the amendments are not intended to revive any cause of action that has been fully and finally adjudicated by the courts,or that has been settled,or as to which the applicable limitations period has run,subd.f.respondents then argue that this case was fully and finally adjudicated when the trial court dismissed it after demurrers were granted,and that the statute of limitations ran on the case before january.
the arguments are not persuasive.the trial court might have finished its work on the case,but it was not finally adjudicated by the legislature used the that time.instead,it came to us for further adjudication.hellinger farmers group,th,d case has not been litigated to finality for purposed of amendments to code of civil procedure section if notice of appeal has been filed.an action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed code civ.t he judgment of the trial court is not final until we dispose of the case.metcalf international,th,d.
as to the statute of limitations,this case was filed within the statute.no new statutory period began to run while we or the trial court were deciding a legal issue in the case.
the history of the amendments is consistent with the express language.those amendments were part of of the legislative session.as introduced,the bill did not amend section.it was a cleanup bill to the domestic partner rights and responsibilities act of,legislation which greatly expanded the scope of domestic partner rights and responsibilities.senate judiciary committee analysis.the provisions relating to section were added in the senate.the senate floor analysis explains that apparently courts have interpreted the amendment made by ab to section of the civil code the amendments,as applied to deaths prior to its effective date of january,in different and conflicting ways.these amendments to ab clarify the application of the ab amendments to those wrongful death actions.the amendments will not affect actions that have been adjudged or settled or where the statute of limitations has run.
thus,the intent behind the amendments to section is consistent with the legislative efforts in this area since the legislature wished to expand the rights of domestic partners and to allow all domestic partners to enjoy the benefits of the expansions of the law.
having determined the legislative intent,we turn now to the constitutional question,whether there is a constitutional barrier to effectuating the legislative intent.r etroactive application of a statute may be unconstitutional if it is an ex post facto law,if it deprives a person of a vested property right without du
