mother seeks writ relief from orders terminating her reunification services at the review hearing and setting the matter for a welfare and institutions code section hearing and were removed from mother when the children were five and years old,respectively,based on mother substance abuse issues,criminal activity,and the condition of her home.mother contends she was statutorily entitled to months of services and that period could be shortened only on the filing of a section petition.we conclude mother was entitled to months of services except under the circumstances specified in section,subdivision a.the juvenile court did not terminate services in accordance with these statutory provisions.we therefore grant mother writ petition.
background 
the del norte county department of health and human services department received a referral from law enforcement after officers searched mother residence and found mushrooms,meth pipes,marijuana paraphernalia,concentrated cannabis,brass knuckles and butterfly knives.it also appeared the occupants were hoarders,as there were large piles of items.some of the piles were over seven feet tall,presenting a hazard to the children.mother was arrested for possession of a controlled substance,possession of drug paraphernalia,possession of marijuana over grams,possession for sale,receiving stolen property,and carrying a dirk or dagger.two days later,mother tested positive for methamphetamine,benzodiazepines,and marijuana.and were immediately removed from her custody.
the department filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging failure to protect the children,leaving them without support,and abuse of a sibling under section.the petition further alleged mother has a substance abuse problem that impairs her ability to adequately supervise and care for the children,and she engages in criminal activity that places the children at substantial risk of physical emotional harm.the court ordered and detained,and ordered that mother receive parenting education,random drug screening,substance abuse assessment and any recommended treatment.the court also ordered supervised visitation.
in subsequent reports,the department noted mother substance abuse was causing clouded judgment as to what is an appropriate environment and care for her children.despite her admitted daily marijuana and occasional methamphetamine use,mother continued to deny she had a substance abuse problem stating she only uses meth to do yard work.
prior to the review hearing,the department filed a report stating mother had not involved herself in any of the services offered,apparently because she was a medical marijuana user and thus was not eligible for substance abuse treatment.nor did mother apparently think these programs would help her address a methamphetamine habit.the report further advised mother had just accepted a plea deal to resolve charges based on her keeping a drug house,whereby she would be sentenced to eight months in state prison and thereafter be on probation,subject to drug testing.the department expressed hope that,having been required to participate in drug treatment in prison,she would comply with testing and program requirements on probation.mother also had agreed to complete a mental health assessment and to attend parenting classes.the department therefore recommended that services be continued.
about two weeks later,the department filed an addendum.the department newly recommended services be terminated because mother had,in fact,been sentenced to months in state prison and it was unknown what services would be available or offered while she is incarcerated.the department can not recommend an additional six months of services if mother is to be unable to comply with her case plan requirements.
at the contested review hearing,mother counsel advised the court mother had actually been sentenced to months in state prison.the department,in turn,explained it would have recommended continued services if mother was going to be released prior to the end of the review period,but that was no longer the case.at that point,the juvenile court stated it was obvious the department witness is incorrect.on a sentence,said the court,mother would do eight months,plus she had credits for time already served.it was apparent none of the participants at the hearing knew exactly how long mother would be incarcerated,or what programs would be available to her in prison.the court commented,i think state prisons have services.but what i seen,generally,have not been particularly good services and do frankly,are as good as what available here.
ultimately,the juvenile court made numerous findings,including adequate services were provided,mother had simply not engaged in services,there was an extremely low likelihood of reunification prior to the dependency hearing,mother had not provided a safe and secure home,the services that would be available to her in prison would be inadequate to overcome her many serious problems,and the minors need for permanency.the court ordered services terminated and set the matter for a permanency hearing under section.
discussion 
applicable welfare and institutions code provisions 
section,subdivision a,provides that where a detained child is three years of age or older,months of reunification services shall be provided to the parent,subd.a a.subdivision a provides the framework for terminating services prior to the end of the period.it states in relevant part any motion to terminate reunification services prior to the hearing set pursuant to subdivision f of section the permanency hearing,which is to be held no later than months after the child enters foster care for a child described by subparagraph a of paragraph a child three years of age or older shall be made pursuant to the requirements set forth in subdivision c of section,subd.a.it further states that such a motion shall not be required for the court to terminate services prior to the permanency hearing if,at the review hearing,the court finds by clear and convincing evidence one of the following a that the child was removed initially under subdivision g of section and the whereabouts of the parent are still unknown.b that the parent has failed to contact and visit the child.c that the parent has been convicted of a felony indicating parental unfitness,subd.a a,b,c see generally in re th.
subdivision c of section,in turn,provides,in relevant part any party,including a child who is a dependent of the juvenile court,may petition the court,prior to the dependency hearing to terminate reunification services provided under subdivision a of section only if one of the following conditions exists a it appears that a change of circumstance or new evidence exists that satisfies a condition set forth in subdivision b or e of section justifying termination of reunification services.b the action or inaction of the parent or guardian creates a substantial likelihood that reunification will not occur,including,but not limited to,the parent or guardian failure to visit the child,or the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,subd.c a,b.the court can terminate services only if it finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that reasonable services have been offered and one of these two conditions exist,subd.c see,supra,th at.
disentitlement doctrine 
the department advances three arguments in support of the juvenile court orders.it first maintains mother is foreclosed from seeking writ relief under the disentitlement doctrine.while it is true,a reviewing court has inherent power to dismiss an appeal when the appealing party has refused to comply with the orders of the trial court,citation i n dependency cases,the doctrine has been applied only in cases of the most egregious conduct by appellant that frustrates the purpose of dependency law and makes it impossible for the court to protect the child or act in the child best interests.see in re kamelia th father absconded with minor guardianship of melissa th grandparents absconded with minor adoption of jacob th mother abducted child.in re th.
this is not such a case.mother made some,albeit minimal,attempt to comply with her case plan.she contacted mental health services and made some effort to visit the children.the department,itself,observed mother seemingly loved her children and exhibited some motivation in progressing with her plan,and it initially recommended that services be continued.it subsequently recommended termination because mother faced a prison sentence.in short,mother conduct does not rise to the level of flagrant disobedience and contempt that would justify disentitlement to pursue her appellate remedies.in re,supra,th at.
discretion to terminate services 
the department secondly maintains juvenile courts have inherent discretion to terminate services at any time,whether or not a section petition has been filed.the department relies on in re aryanna th aryanna and in re derrick th derrick.
in aryanna,the father appealed from an order terminating his parental rights to an infant.at the review hearing,the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set the matter for a section hearing.aryanna,supra,th at.since the child was under three,a,rather than a,period of reunification services applied.id.at.on appeal,the father maintained he was entitled to a full six months of services and the only way that period could be shortened was by way of a section petition.aryanna,at.the court of appeal affirmed the early termination of services.it declined to read section as setting forth mandatory time periods,stating the statutes governing reunification services must be considered in light of the juvenile dependency system as a whole and the overall objective of that system is the protection of abused or neglected children.aryanna,at.thus,r eading sections,subdivision a,and,subdivision e,together,the court concluded the juvenile court has the discretion to terminate the reunification services of a parent at any time after it has ordered them,depending on the circumstances.id.at.
this conclusion was supported,said the aryanna court,by the language of section,subdivision a,which at that time stated,with respect to a child under three,that services may not exceed six months.this established a maximum time period,not a minimum entitlement.aryanna,supra,th at.the court also pointed to section,subdivision e,which provides if the child is not returned to the parent at the review hearing,the juvenile court shall order that services be initiated,continued or terminated.subd.e.the court observed a review hearing may,in fact,be held earlier than six months after the initial dispositional hearing.aryanna,supra,th at.
the aryanna court recognized the importance of reunification services can not be gainsaid and the law favors reunification whenever possible.aryanna,supra,th at however,reunification services constitute a benefit there is no constitutional entitlement to those services.ibid.it,therefore,remains within the discretion of the juvenile court to determine whether continued services are in the best interests of the minor,or whether those services should be ended at some point before the statutory period has elapsed.id.at.
in derrick,a child over the age of three appealed from a review hearing order denying his request to terminate services for his mother and to set a section hearing.following the reasoning of aryanna,the court of appeal concluded juvenile courts also have discretion in cases involving children over the age of three to terminate services prior to the hearing.derrick,supra,th at.the court called the periods set forth in section,default periods.this statutory language establishes a approach based on the dependent minor age.if the child is under three,the default position is six months of reunification services.if the child is over three,the default position is months.for both categories,the outer limit is months.derrick,at.but none of these time periods,said the court,is immutable.id.at.there is no absolute right to receive the maximum amount of statutorily fixed services in any and all circumstances made clear by the no fewer than situations in which the juvenile court is not required to order any reunification services.ibid.nowhere,observed the court,is it provided that a minimum of months of services is required,quoting in re david th.and since,it has been established that a motion pursuant to section may be used to ask the juvenile court to terminate services earlier.ibid.
the derrick court pointed out the language of section provided,in connection with a child three or over,that reunification services shall not exceed months,and section,subdivision e provided if a child was not returned to a parent at the hearing,the court was to determine whether reasonable services had been provided,and either commence,continue or terminate services.derrick,supra,th at.these seemingly conflicting directives are harmonized by the aryanna formula months of services will ordinarily be provided for a parent of a dependent child over the age of three,but services may be discontinued in the rare case when the likelihood of reunification is,for whatever reason,extremely low.ibid.
the derrick court was also of the opinion the legislature could not have intended,much less commanded,that services be provided where,by all indicators,it would be futile,as in the case before it,where the parent was on the run from law enforcement.derrick,supra,th at.i t would ill serve the needs of the dependent child to be hostage to a fugitive parent,particularly one with an abysmal record of failure at reunification.id.at,quoting aryanna,supra,th at.
however,the year after derrick was decided,the legislature amended sections and.the assembly committee on human services report explained the author intent was to afford parents a minimum emphasis added of months of reunification services for children under three and months of reunification services for children over the age of three.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics and parenthetical in original.it further explained,recent appellate cases allowing termination of reunification services prior to the end of these timeframes see analysis of cases below circumvent due process requirements and are inappropriate.ibid.the report went on to specifically identify aryanna and derrick as holding the statutory time periods were not minimum periods,but rather set an outside limit on services and the court could terminate those services any time after it ordered them.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,at.by contrast,prior appellate court decisions had characterized the and timeframes as minimum periods of time during which parents were entitled to reunification services.ibid.the report also observed that another court,prior to aryanna and derrick,had held the statutory time periods could properly be cut short by way of a section petition.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,at see shelia superior court th.
the report stated that,a s amended,this bill would continue to allow courts to change,modify or set aside initial orders for reunification services,but would narrow the instances in which the court could use this discretion to those in which changed circumstances or new evidence,if available at the time of the disposition hearing,could have lead the court to bypass reunification services.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,at.
the report also noted that the argument in opposition to the legislation was that services would have to be provided whether or not the parent has shown any progress in reunification,and the practical ramification of having mandatory times for reunification would be a delay in permanency for children.assem.com.on human services,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,at.in other words,the opposition voiced the same policy reasons that drove the courts in aryanna and derrick to conclude the statutory language did not establish mandatory reunification time periods and juvenile courts retained inherent discretion to terminate services prior to the statutorily designated periods.
there can be no question,then,that the
