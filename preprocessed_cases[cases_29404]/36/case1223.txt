tryphena,mother of aaliyah,appeals from two juvenile court orders an order denying a petition for modification under welfare and institutions code section and an order terminating parental rights.mother asserts the court abused its discretion in denying her section petition by disregarding significant factors that compelled either the child return to mother custody or further family reunification services.mother further asserts the court erred in terminating parental rights because the parental relationship exception under section,subdivision c a applies we affirm.
mother was years old and a dependent child of the court when she gave birth to aaliyah in january.after her birth,aaliyah resided with mother at anne group home,a residential placement with specialized services for teens who are pregnant or have children.
the record indicates a long period of unstable behavior by mother,not the least of which was her neglect and refusal to take care of aaliyah,despite the juvenile court extensive efforts to avert loss of mother parental rights.
in august,when aaliyah was seven months old,the los angeles county department of child and family services department filed a petition under section,subdivision b on aaliyah behalf.the petition as amended alleged that mother was a minor herself and had only a limited ability to care for her child and that she had left aaliyah unattended without adult supervision and in a poor state of hygiene the court ordered aaliyah to be detained in foster care with monitored visits for mother.
the department provided documentary evidence,supported by mother admissions,that she was frustrated with caring for her baby,screamed at and neglected the baby,had limited ability to care for the baby,was chronically noncompliant with placement rules and regulations and needed work with anger management in relation to her peers.
in october,the juvenile court found the amended petition to be true and declared aaliyah a dependent of the juvenile court.the court ordered six months of reunification services for mother and ordered her to attend individual counseling to address case issues including anger management.the court allowed weekly monitored visits between mother and aaliyah and gave the department discretion to liberalize and increase the visits.
at mother request,aaliyah was placed in the home of mildred mildred,who was an extended family member and then caretaker of mother sister.at this time,anne was providing mother with a number of services,including parenting education,individual and group counseling,medical care,staff support,sex education and family planning,individual educational counseling,an school,food,a clothing allowance,passes for visits with aaliyah as well as with mother family and transportation assistance.
in march,the department reported to the court that mildred had asked the department to remove aaliyah and her aunt from mildred home after mother made unfounded allegations that mildred was neglecting aaliyah.the department reported that mother was showing overall improvement,but she was not complying with the rules and regulations at her placement.she continued to have issues with anger management,of going awol absent without leave and inappropriate interaction with her peers.during this period,mother had monitored visits with aaliyah and had begun attending to aaliyah needs during the visits.
in june,mother case manager at anne testified that although mother behavior had recently improved,her behavior was inconsistent and she had been struggling.nonetheless,the court found that mother had made substantial progress towards alleviating and mitigating the causes that had required aaliyah placement.over the department objections,the juvenile court ordered aaliyah to be placed with mother and ordered the department to provide mother with further family maintenance services.
the court imposed several conditions in placing aaliyah with mother mother was to remain at anne,continue in its structured program of parenting,participate in mommy and me classes and continue to attend alateen meetings.the court determined the permanent plan would be aliyah return to the home of her mother with termination of jurisdiction as the goal.
mother,however,did not do well after aaliyah returned to her care.approximately four months later,in october,the department filed a supplemental juvenile dependency petition alleging mother was unable to continue caring for aaliyah.mother had again neglected aaliyah and then reportedly had gone awol with her,only to call a relative the following day to request that she come and get the child.mother told the social worker she wanted aaliyah back in foster care and no longer wanted to care for the child.the juvenile court ordered aaliyah to be detained in shelter care and ordered the department to provide mother with monitored visits and family reunification services.
in early december,the department reported that mother had gone awol from anne in november and was still awol as of the date of the report.the report detailed numerous instances of mother neglecting aaliyah.mother had told other residents she wanted her freedom,was frustrated with aaliyah and was going to have aaliyah taken away.mother told staff members she wanted to give aaliyah back.she told another resident that she loved her new boyfriend so much that she could keep aaliyah and be with him.the court modified its june order and directed that aaliyah remain a dependent and suitably placed in shelter care.
in january,the court sustained an amended supplemental petition stating that mother was unable to continue to provide ongoing care for her child.the court found the previous court disposition had not been effective in aaliyah rehabilitation or protection.the court allowed mother a minimum of twice weekly monitored visits with her child.
in march,the juvenile court determined mother had only inconsistently complied with the case plan and terminated mother reunification services because the time for such services had run.however,over the department objection,the court ordered the department to provide mother with family reunification like services.the court terminated its june home of order and directed that aaliyah be suitably placed.the court allowed mother visits of no less than twice a week or as frequent as possible in a neutral setting.
from march to may,mother regularly visited aaliyah without incident.she behaved appropriately with the child and was attentive,alert and nurturing.however,the department reported to the court that mother current caregiver had reported behavioral problems with mother leading to the possibility mother would need a new placement.
the court convened a number of permanency planning hearings under section.for a permanency planning hearing in july,the department reported that aaliyah,then two years old,was a happy,smiling,talkative,highly intelligent and easily engaged child.the foster mother had considered adopting aaliyah,but she decided against doing so because of the possibility of having future contact with mother.mother initially had visited her child consistently but for the last two months had frequently failed to show up for visits or to call and cancel.the department reported that the inconsistency in mother visitation had traumatized aaliyah emotionally and psychologically because she was old enough to associate the visitation site with an expectation of seeing her mother.mother again had told the social worker that she did not want to take care of aaliyah and wished to have her adopted.mother had also called the former foster mother,mildred,and asked her to adopt aaliyah.the department informed the court that mildred was now willing to provide a permanent home for aaliyah under a permanent plan of adoption and to allow mother to visit the child after adoption so long as mother behaved appropriately.
in september,the juvenile court had a second permanency planning hearing.for the hearing,the department further reported that mother was temporarily in a group home but would not be allowed to stay past her impending birthday due to her inappropriate behavior,lack of motivation and chronically going awol.since the court visitation order in march,mother had vacillated between consistency and total.mother had made only a fraction of the minimum number of allowed visits to aaliyah and frequently had failed to show up or call.pursuant to court order,the department had made arrangements for mother and aaliyah to participate in a parent and child interactive program.the provider had reported that mother had attended only three of eight scheduled visits.the court admonished mother about her lack of compliance,stating you are doing practically nothing.you are sitting at home watching tv.are you seriously trying to get your child back you better get more serious about it,young lady.you go out and get a job and you go to school on a regular basis.the court authorized the department to gradually transition aaliyah back into mildred home.
in october,the court held a third permanency planning hearing.mother again was awol and did not appear.the department reported that mother was now years of age and residing in the unauthorized home of her maternal grandmother,in whose custody mother had conceived aaliyah.mother was three months pregnant with a second child,and the expected baby father davione was incarcerated for possession of a firearm.the department informed the court that mildred was now a licensed foster caretaker and still willing to adopt aaliyah.the court ordered aaliyah to be placed in mildred home and ordered the department to complete a home study for mildred.the matter was continued to january for another permanency planning hearing.
in january,the court held a fourth permanency planning hearing and set a contested permanency planning hearing for march to determine whether adoption,foster care or guardianship should be the appropriate plan.
in march,mother filed a section petition seeking modification of the court march order terminating her family reunification services and setting a hearing on selection and implementation of a permanent plan.mother asked the juvenile court to either return aaliyah to mother custody or grant mother further reunification services.in the event the court denied such relief,mother requested that the court order a bonding study to aid in her contest of the permanency plan.
mother alleged changed circumstances,stating that she had returned to anne in late december and had since been complying with its rules and programs.she also alleged that she was addressing her parenting and case issues through individual therapy and had visited aaliyah during the last month.she indicated that she was successfully attending school and working toward a high school diploma.she further had taken or completed independent living skills classes,and anne was willing to facilitate appropriate living arrangements for aaliyah.
the court set mother petition for modification for a hearing to be held in april.
in march,for the fifth section hearing,the department informed the court that aaliyah was doing very well in mildred home.she was developing on target and appeared mentally and emotionally stable.a further report indicated a home study had been completed on mildred,and the child appeared to be well bonded with her.in an interim review report,the department also noted that aaliyah appeared to be thriving in mildred care and was now calling mildred mom.mildred was providing the child with a nurturing,stable environment.the child appeared to be well dressed,well groomed,happy and healthy.the department reported that since aaliyah placement with mildred in december,mother had visited the child four times,in february and march.before that,when aaliyah was in her prior foster home,mother had not visited from september to december.the department recommended that the court deny mother section petition and terminate parental rights.the court further continued the permanency planning hearing to april.
the juvenile court heard mother section petition on april and.mother did not testify at the hearing regarding her changed circumstances as the court found there was no good cause to merit hearing her direct testimony in lieu of her testimony,mother submitted her written declaration as documentary evidence.in her declaration,mother stated that she had become a responsible,respectable woman who wanted the opportunity to care for and be a role model for my daughter.she stated she had made significant changes in her life and was now ready to take care of her daughter.
on april,after considering mother declaration,the juvenile court denied mother petition,indicating her declaration only served to show how much time she has wasted in her life.the court also denied mother request for reunification services and further request to either place aaliyah with mother or change the child placement.however,over the department objections,the court continued the permanency planning hearing and ordered a bonding study to be performed for the specific purpose of determining whether termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.
the appointed psychologist,daniel kramon,submitted a bonding study pursuant to the juvenile court order.kramon personally interviewed mother and observed aaliyah and mother interacting at his office.he noted aaliyah had spent a substantial amount of time in three homes over the course of her young life.she spent approximately the first seven months of her life with mother,six months with mildred,months with foster mother,five months with mother again,one month with after that and,finally,the last five months with mildred.in kramon opinion,it was reasonable to conclude that during each of these placements,some type of bond was formed with each primary caretaker.he observed that mother related to aaliyah in a loving,natural,engaging and thoroughly appropriate manner,but it was likely aaliyah had also formed a close bond with mildred and mildred two granddaughters that resided in her home.he opined it was likely that aaliyah closest bond existed with the caretaker with whom she has resided for the last several months.
kramon concluded that,although there apparently was an affectionate closeness between aaliyah and her mother,the basic link of trust that is imperative for a close bond does not exist to the extent that it likely exists between aaliyah and mildred.he admitted this conclusion had an assumptive aspect because he had not been able to observe the child and mildred together kramon thought aaliyah was progressing well and was likely thriving in mildred home.he stated that to remove her from this home,especially at a stage in her development where she has acquired a high degree of communication and relating skills,could be emotionally deleterious for her.he believed if parental rights were terminated,there might be some disappointment on aaliyah part because she reportedly looked forward to contacts with mother,but it would not be substantially detrimental to aaliyah as she had only limited contact with mother since october.on the other hand,if aaliyah were to be removed from mildred home,where she felt safe and secure,there likely would be a significant risk of emotional or psychological distress as well as a further disruption to the bonding process that could result in serious emotional harm.kramon concluded the benefits of aaliyah remaining in a secure and loving home outweighed the consequences of terminating parental rights.
on may,the juvenile court held the sixth and final hearing on the selection of a permanent plan.mother new baby boy was one and months old at this time and placed with her at anne.mother testified she had moved into anne in december and had resumed visiting aaliyah in february.mother admittedly did not visit aaliyah from september to february,stating she was going through a lot of problems.she stated she had been immature and was thinking about anyone at the time but myself.she had asked mildred to adopt aaliyah because she thought she did have a chance of getting aaliyah back.mother believed she had matured since then and opposed the permanent plan of adoption because she did not want aaliyah to feel abandoned as she herself had felt and did not wish aaliyah to beli
