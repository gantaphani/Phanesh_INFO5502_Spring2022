this appeal is the latest in a series of appellate challenges to juvenile court orders made in this dependency proceeding it is brought by the mother of four dependent children.
in this appeal,the mother challenges her lack of party status in the habeas corpus proceeding below,which this court ordered to examine the father claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the jurisdiction and disposition phases of the underlying dependency proceeding.the father asks us to dismiss this appeal,asserting lack of standing,forfeiture,and mootness.he also defends the trial court decision on the merits.
so far as we are aware,no authority addresses the issue of standing in this particular procedural context.addressing the question as one of first impression,we conclude that the mother lacks standing to prosecute this appeal.we therefore grant the father motion to dismiss on that ground.
overview of dependency law 
as an aid to understanding the procedural history of this case,we begin with a brief overview of dependency law.
statutory objectives 
the legislature has provided for juvenile court jurisdiction over dependent children.welf,et the primary goal of the dependency statutes is to ensure the safety,protection,and of children who are at risk of abuse,neglect,or exploitation,while preserving the family whenever possible.in re david th,d.
ii.juvenile court proceedings 
in dependency proceedings,there are generally four phases detention and jurisdiction disposition the provision of services for reunification or family maintenance,accompanied by periodic review hearings and either a permanent plan for the child placement outside of the parent home or termination of the dependency.see in re matthew cal th,d,see generally,cynthia superior court cal th,d.once the juvenile court assumes dependency jurisdiction,it has broad authority to modify orders in the best interests of a dependent child,see also cal.rules of court,rule.
iii.representation 
under statutory law and court rules,an indigent parent in a dependency proceeding has a right to appointed counsel where placement is an issue,subd.b in re kristin th,d.there is also a due process constitutional right to representation by counsel on a basis when the result of the hearing may be termination of parental rights.in re arturo th,d.all parties who are represented at dependency proceedings are entitled to competent counsel,subd.a.this court previously has approved the use of habeas corpus petitions in dependency proceedings to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.in re kristin,at,d.
factual and procedural background 
we summarized the history of this case in a prior appeal,unpublished opinion filed may.we include relevant portions of that summary here,followed by a synopsis of subsequent events.
family history 
four children are involved in this case a boy and his three younger sisters they were born in,and,respectively.
the parents,gail and paul,married in california in.they moved to colorado in.the couple separated in and subsequently divorced.gail returned to california in with all four children,and paul moved here the following year.paul has remarried and has a second family,which includes his wife amber,her two sons by a previous marriage,and two daughters born to the couple.
at the time gail left for california in,colorado authorities were investigating a disclosure by middle daughter then three and a half years old that her father penis had touched her vagina.by then,gail had also learned that son may have been sexually abused by paul father,a convicted child molester.
starting in,gail and paul were engaged in a custody dispute over the children.that dispute resulted in periodic orders for supervised visitation,custody evaluations in and,and a investigation of the disputed sexual abuse allegations against paul.that investigation began in but it was never completed because this dependency intervened.
dependency proceedings 
in may,a referral was made to santa clara county department of family and children services the department.that referral followed middle daughter report of recent sexual impropriety by her brother.in september,the department received another referral,this one based on son violence toward middle daughter.further investigation by the department revealed that son also was aggressive and sexually inappropriate toward his other sisters,and that gail was not always able to stop him from harming the girls.the department was also aware of middle daughter disclosure of molestation and of the allegation that son may have been sexually abused.
in september,the department filed petitions alleging grounds for dependency jurisdiction as to all four children.the petitions asserted that gail and paul had failed to protect the children that the children were suffering or were at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage that the children had been sexually abused and that the children were at substantial risk of abuse or neglect because a sibling had been abused or neglected,subds.b,c,d,j.
all four children were detained.son was removed from gail physical custody and was placed with maternal relatives in san diego.
jurisdiction and disposition 
starting in november,the juvenile court conducted a combined jurisdiction and disposition hearing.all parties were represented by counsel.sexual abuse was a central issue.over the course of the lengthy contested hearing,the court received extensive documentary and testimonial evidence.the court announced its decision at the close of the hearing on december.its formal jurisdictional and dispositional order was entered in january.
the juvenile court sustained jurisdiction as to all four children.in doing so,it made three specific factual findings that son had engaged in sexual impropriety with middle daughter in may that paul father had unmonitored access to son and had molested him and that paul had touched middle daughter vagina with his penis in or before.the court sustained the allegations of each of the four petitions.
in its dispositional orders,the court declared all four siblings dependent children.with respect to the girls,gail retained custody,subject to supervision by the department.as to the boy,the court concluded that removal was necessary,and it continued his placement with relatives in san diego.the court ordered services for the parents,including parenting classes,counseling,and psychological evaluations.the court also ordered supervised visitation between paul and his children.
paul appealed,challenging both the jurisdictional and the dispositional orders.we affirmed,filed may.we concluded that sufficient evidence supported the juvenile court specific factual findings and its assumption of jurisdiction.we also determined that the court did not err in removing son from parental custody and placing him with relatives out of county.
at the same time,however,we reviewed paul petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which challenged the jurisdictional and dispositional orders on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel,and we issued an order to show cause,returnable in the superior court,as to that claim,order filed may.we later modified the order to show cause,to include an order for appointment of counsel,order filed may.
postdisposition hearings 
following disposition,the parties returned to the juvenile court for numerous review hearings and other proceedings.
review may 
in a report prepared for the review hearing,the department social worker recounted paul failure to comply with any services,with the exception of two visits with his son.the social worker recommended that there be no visitation between the father and the children until the father apologizes to the children,takes responsibility for his actions towards them and submits to the court orders.
in may,the juvenile court conducted the review hearing.paul appeared in propria persona.he disputed the earlier jurisdictional finding that he had molested middle daughter,which prompted the court comment that it would not relitigate the factual issue.paul also vehemently objected to the social worker recommendation that visits be suspended until he apologizes and takes responsibility for the harm to his children,saying i can tell you when that will happen.never.never.never.
by formal order filed on may,the court adopted the social worker recommendations,with corrections as noted.the court thus terminated paul visitation with all four children,and it prohibited paul from physical contact or communication of any kind with them.the court continued services to both parents,and it set a review hearing for november.
paul challenged the foregoing orders in his second appeal.we affirmed,finding sufficient evidence to support them,opinion filed may.
further review hearings december 
the review hearing set for november was continued to the following month.paul continued to appear in propria persona,having been rebuffed in his attempts to obtain appointed trial counsel.the court received a report from the department,which indicated that the matter was before the court for a review of family girls review and son review.the department proposed orders included one that conditioned consideration of reinstating visitation between paul and any of the children on his completion of a psychological evaluation and a counseling program.at the december hearing,the court set a trial management conference for the following month.
at the continued hearing on january,the discussion first centered on son.based on the parties comments,the court identified two contested issues for trial concerning son and paul the continuation of reunification services and visitation.the court set a trial date in the matter,bifurcating the contested hearing in son case from the review hearing for the girls.
the court then turned to the review hearing for the girls.when the court asked paul whether he was ready to go forward on the girls case,he responded in the negative,explaining that he intended to file a modification petition.the court told him we can do that and we can still go forward today.paul indicated that he understood.the other parties submitted on the department recommendation.the juvenile court then adopted the department recommendations regarding the girls and it set the next family maintenance hearing for june.
the ensuing order was the subject of paul third appeal,which raised a procedural due process challenge to the conditions imposed on reinstatement of visitation with the girls.we struck the challenged portion of that order,opinion filed december.
petition for modification march 
in march,still acting in pro per,paul filed a verified petition for modification under section.in the form petition,paul specified that he was seeking to modify or set aside the orders made in may,after the review,which had terminated his visitation with the children and prohibited him from physical contact or communication of any kind with them.paul identified the requested modifications as reversal on jurisdictional findings of december,and visitation to be reinstated,opportunity to send cards,letters,gifts,to be a part of school,church,athletic events,and other public events.
the juvenile court denied paul request for reversal of the jurisdictional findings with the statement that a petition is the improper procedural vehicle for such a request.the court also refused to entertain paul petition to the extent that it sought changes to the visitation order entered after the review hearing.on appeal,his fourth,paul assigned both determinations as error.
further review hearing august 
the juvenile court held further review hearings,including a combined and month review hearing for son,which it conducted as a contested matter on august.in the order following that hearing,the court conditioned future supervised visitation for paul on son request for visitation,paul completion of individual therapy addressing sexual abuse,and joint therapy for paul and son.paul challenged that order in his fifth appeal.
dismissal and transfer to family court 
at a contested hearing held on october,the juvenile court granted the department motion to dismiss the dependency.the court concluded that supervision by the department was no longer necessary,and it issued exit orders to the family court,granting continued physical custody to gail and barring paul from visitation or contact.those orders prompted paul sixth appeal.
hearing on habeas corpus petition 
as noted above,in may,this court issued an order to show cause,returnable in the superior court,on paul petition for writ of habeas corpus,which claimed ineffective assistance of counsel at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.the department filed a return,paul filed a traverse and an amendment,and a hearing was set for august.
gail was aware of the hearing date for paul habeas claim,as she received notice through several different avenues,including oral references to the upcoming habeas trial at three juvenile court hearings held in august,all of which gail attended but gail never appeared at the habeas hearing,either personally or through counsel.
the evidentiary hearing commenced in superior court on august.consistent with this court order to show cause,the hearing was conducted by the same trial judge who heard the original jurisdiction and disposition hearing in,judge herlihy.the hearing took place over the course of nine court days,followed by written closing arguments.in december,judge herlihy issued an written order,granting the habeas petition.
at the outset of the hearing,the court entertained a motion to intervene,brought by paul former trial attorney,whose performance was placed at issue by the habeas petition.the court denied counsel motion,but it did allow counsel attorney to be present during the proceedings.the children also were allowed to be present,through their attorneys,though not as parties.
at the hearing,the court considered evidence relevant to its prior finding that paul had molested middle daughter,which paul trial counsel had not explored at the jurisdictional hearing.
among the evidence presented was testimony by frances gomez of the aurora,colorado police department,who investigated the disclosure by middle daughter that paul penis had touched her vagina.at the time of the investigation,gomez was a detective she later was promoted to sergeant and then lieutenant she was never demoted,as gail had claimed.at the jurisdiction hearing,one social worker testified to conversations with gomez during which the detective described middle daughter disclosure as solid.testimony by a second social worker cast some doubt on that description.paul trial counsel did not contact gomez.the court concluded had counsel investigated gomez,she would have learned that gomez did not find the case to be strong,that gomez found middle daughter statements to be vague and inconsistent,that gomez was forced to file an affidavit of probable cause due to a blanket policy by her former supervisor,that she repeatedly told gail about the importance of the medical examination,and that she felt that gail was not cooperating in that respect.the court continued this evidence not only impeached gail,but also would have directly affected the findings of all the experts.
in addition to gomez testimony,other evidence came out at the habeas hearing that paul counsel had not adduced at the jurisdictional hearing.that included evidence that gail had questioned middle daughter prior to her interview by colorado authorities in a way that undermined the reliability of the toddler disclosure.the court found fault with trial counsel failure to explore the possibility that gail questions implanted memories in the child.
additionally,the court ruled,all of the above also impacted the weight of gail credibility.the bulk of paul claims of gail inconsistent statements were insignificant,as trial counsel described in her evidentiary hearing testimony.however,gail claim that gomez had been demoted,that gomez was responsible for the delay in the investigation,that gail cooperated with the investigation,and that gomez told her that a medical examination was not necessary or too late all bear considerable relevance to the allegation of middle daughter molestation by paul.
in its formal order,filed december,the trial court concluded that paul trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the cumulative effect of her errors was prejudicial.the court therefore vacated its jurisdictional findings and all subsequent orders,stating that the jurisdictional order concerning the minors must be vacated and the dispositional,and all subsequent orders,are vacated as moot.
subsequent dismissals 
in this court following the habeas ruling,which vacated all orders in the dependency,a motion was brought in this court to dismiss the three appeals by paul then still pending.the request for dismissal was supported by the stipulation of all they would not appeal the habeas ruling.by order of january,we dismissed the three pending appeals.
in the juvenile court in april,by formal order,the juvenile court dismissed the dependency petitions and vacated all of its prior orders,including its october dismissal order.the juvenile court dismissal order effectively transfers the matter to the family court.it requires the family court to file and serve judge herlihy habeas ruling.the dismissal order also states custody of the children reverts to the orders of the family court that were in effect before the dependency petitions were filed and this dependency case was commenced in september.
in february,gail filed a notice of appeal from the december habeas decision.she claims that the trial court erred when it failed to accord her party status in the habeas proceeding.
in july,paul moved this court to dismiss the mother appeal,arguing that gail lacks appellate standing to assert that claim,that she had no trial court standing,and that she forfeited her claims by failing to appear and raise them below.paul also requested that we take judicial notice of the documents attached to his motion,as well as our records in his prior appeals.in a second motion to dismiss,filed just prior to oral argument in march,paul asserted that this appeal is moot because gail failed to appeal the april order dismissing the dependency.
we deferred ruling on paul first dismissal motion and his request for judicial notice in order to consider them with the appeal.as to his second dismissal motion,we took it under submission at oral argument.
having now considered those three motions,we shall grant the first two.we thus take judicial notice as requested by paul and we grant his motion to dismiss gail appeal for lack of standing.in light of our decision to dismiss the appeal for lack of standing,we need not reach the question of mootness.
discussion 
as a framework for assessing the parents conflicting claims concerning standing in the habeas corpus proceeding,we begin by setting forth the general principles that govern our analysis.we then apply those principles to the facts of this case.
legal principles 
habeas corpus 
the right to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is guaranteed by the state constitution cal,art.i,and regulated by statute et.in re harris cal th,d.through a habeas corpus proceeding,a court may grant relief from various forms of constructive custody,as well as from physical restraints.people romero cal th,fn,d.the statutory purpose of the writ is to inquire into the lawfulness of a person imprisonment or other restraint of his or liberty.appeals and writs in criminal cases ed.update writs in california state courts before and after conviction,citing.
use in proceedings affecting children 
habeas corpus may be used in various types of child custody matters.california criminal law,procedure and practice writs in california state courts,see,in re darlice th,d parent is entitled to seek review of the termination order by petition for writ of habeas corpus in re carrie th,d same.the writ will lie when a person entitled to custody of a minor child is denied possession thereof.in re barr cal d,adoption of alexander cal d.in such cases,the person having custody of the child may be a proper respondent.see,in re lukasik d,grandmother,who had physical custody of children,was respondent in habeas proceeding brought by mother seeking custody in re macedo d,mother,who had actual physical custody,and probation officer,who was given custody by court,were served with an order to show cause in habeas proceeding brought by father seeking custody.
because the rules on habeas corpus petitions evolved in the context of prisoners asserting unlawful confinement or conditions of confinement,they do not fit the dependency context well.abbott,et,cal.juvenile dependency practice supp.appeals and writs.nevertheless,habeas petitions are recognized as proper vehicles for raising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in dependency proceedings.in re kristin,supra,th at,d accord,in re carrie,supra,th at,d.
procedural rules 
regardless of the nature of the proceeding in which the habeas petition arises,the court must abide by the procedures set forth in penal code sections through.adoption of alexander,supra,cal d at,see generally,appeals and writs in criminal cases,supra.under those statutes,the habeas corpus proceeding begins with the filing of a verified petition for a writ of habeas corpus.people romero,supra,cal th at,d,see.whenever a habeas corpus petition is sufficient on its face that is,the petition states a prima facie case on a claim that is not procedurally barred,the court is obligated by statute to issue a writ of habeas corpus.people romero,at,d.alternatively,the court may issue an order to show cause.id.at,d.issuance of an osc signifies the court preliminary determination that the petitioner has pleaded sufficient facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief.the penal code then contemplates the custodian of the confined person shall file a responsive pleading,called a return,justifying the confinement.people duvall cal th,d,see.the factual allegations of a return must respond to the allegations of the petition that form the basis of the petitioner claim that the confinement is unlawful.people duvall,at,d.following the filing of the return,the habeas corpus petitioner responds to the facts pleaded therein in a pleading called a traverse.see.alternatively,the parties may stipulate that the original habeas corpus petition be treated as a traverse.people duvall,at,d.the writ or order to show cause is the means by which issues are joined through the return and traverse and the need for an evidentiary hearing determined.people romero,at,d.
the statutory provisions governing habeas proceedings include directives concerning service.in criminal cases where the petitioner is in custody,a copy of the application for the writ must in all cases be served upon the district attorney of the county wherein the person is held in custody or restraint and no application for the writ can be heard without proof of service in cases where the service is required.see in re moffett,supra,d at.in other types of cases,where the writ is directed to any other person,it must be delivered to the sheriff or a marshal,and be by him served upon such person by delivering the copy to him without delay,and make his return on the original to the court of issuance.
the habeas statutes also address the conduct of hearings.see.the court has full power and authority to require and compel the attendance of witnesses,by process of subpoena and attachment,and to do and perform all other acts and things necessary to a full and fair hearing and determination of the case.once the court has issued a writ of habeas corpus it has the power to dispose of the matter as the justice of the case may require.in re brindle d,quoting.but a writ issued after a hearing on notice of hours or less,directing compliance by political subdivisions,municipalities and agencies which did not have petitioners in actual or constructive custody,without notice or an opportunity to be heard,violates the essence of due process requiring reversal as to those respondents lacking notice.in re brindle,at.
in cases where the adequacy of representation is at issue,there is an opportunity in an evidentiary hearing to have trial counsel fully describe his or her reasons for acting or failing to act in the manner complained of.people pope cal d.in a habeas corpus petition alleging incompetent investigation or presentation of evidence by trial counsel,a petitioner generally can not expect to establish a case for relief solely by relying on testimony,expert or otherwise,describing what evidence might have been discovered and produced by competent counsel.instead,he must generally produce that evidence so the credibility of the witnesses can be tested by.if the prosecution claims it could have refuted that testimony by rebuttal evidence,it may also have to produce the witnesses to prove its claim.in effect,the petitioner must show us what the trial would have been like,had he been competently represented,so we can compare that with the trial that actually occurred and determine whether it is reasonably probable that the result would have been different.in re fields cal d.
the habeas statutes also provide for appeals.in criminal cases,penal code section applies.in other habeas cases,the governing statute is penal code section,which provides where an application for a writ of habeas corpus has been made by or on behalf of any person other than a defendant in a criminal case,an appeal may be taken to the court of appeal from a final order of a superior court granting all or any part of the relief sought.
appellate standing 
the general rule of appellate standing is this any aggrieved party may appeal from an adverse judgment.county of alameda carleson cal d,quoting code civ.the same rule applies in dependency cases.see,in re carissa th,d see cal.rules of court,rule b see generally,abbott,et,cal.juvenile dependency practice,supra,appeals and writs.
appellant must be aggrieved 
to be aggrieved,a party must have a legally cognizable interest that is injuriously affected by the court decision.in re barbara th,d,in re dargo d,mother and stepfather were entitled to appeal disposition of delinquent minor for the purpose of protecting their own interests as well as those of the minor.conversely,a appellant lacks standing to raise issues affecting another person interests.in re gary th,d.
appellant must be a party of record 
in addition to being aggrieved,the person prosecuting an appeal generally must have appeared in the proceeding below.it is generally held that only parties of record may appeal county of alameda carleson,supra,cal d at,accord,in re joseph th,d see abbott,et,cal.juvenile dependency practice,supra,appeals and writs,responding party may appeal the grant of a writ of habeas corpus.thus,one who is denied the right to intervene in an action ordinarily may not appeal from a judgment subsequently entered in the case.instead,he may appeal from the order denying intervention.nevertheless,one who is legally aggrieved by a judgment may become a party of record and obtain a right to appeal by moving to vacate the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.county of alameda carleson,at,citations and fn.omitted.
ii.analysis 
with the foregoing principles in mind,we turn to the case at hand.
gail was not a party of record in the habeas proceeding below.
as the mother of the dependent children here,gail was a party to the dependency proceeding as a whole,in re joseph,supra,th at,d the alleged biological father never became a party of record in the dependency court and thus lacked standing to appeal the order terminating parental rights.
significantly,however,gail was not a party to the habeas proceeding.the order to show cause,issued by this court,did not name her as a party.our order commanded only the department to show cause why the relief sought should not be granted.see in re darlice,supra,th at,d directing the agency to show cause,in re kristin,supra,th at,d directing both the department and minor to file a written return.as indicated above,a person with physical custody of the child may be a proper respondent in habeas corpus proceedings,at least to the extent that the proceeding addresses the legality of the child detention.see in re lukasik,supra,d,court issued a writ of habeas corpus,having found that the detention of these minors by their paternal grandmother is unlawful,in re macedo,supra,d at,court refused to issue a writ,stating that if the probation officer has improperly permitted the minor child to remain with the mother,as the petitioning father alleged,his remedy is not a writ of habeas corpus but is more properly an application in the superior court in the divorce proceedings to have the order modified.in this case,however,we did do any reason to include gail as a party to paul habeas proceeding,since it did not seek a change in custody of the dependent children living with her,a point that we discuss in greater detail later in this opinion,at part ii.
furthermore,gail made no attempt to intervene in the habeas proceeding,either by application to this court to modify the order to show cause,or by motion in the trial court to intervene in the proceeding.see code civ,intervention cal.rules of court,rule joinder in family law matters.nor did she make any attempt after the fact to become a party of record and obtain a right to appeal by moving to vacate the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.county of alameda carleson,supra,cal d at.
given the circumstances before us,we need not speculate about the prospects for success of such efforts in this context,in re marriage of williams d.interest of deceased mother relatives in custody and visitation of children may have been too remote to satisfy traditional rules for intervention.we nevertheless observe that in general civil litigation,intervention is not a matter of absolute right but is discretionary with the court.squire city and county of san francisco d.whether in a particular case intervention should be allowed is best determined by a consideration of the facts of that case citation,and the decision is ordinarily left to the sound discretion of the trial court citations.fireman fund ins.gerlach d.several principles should govern the exercise of that discretion.the proposed intervener interest in the matter in litigation must be of such a direct and immediate character that he will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.citations.the issues of the action may not be enlarged by the proposed intervention.citations.and,all important,the intervention must be denied if the reasons therefor are outweighed by the rights of the original parties to conduct their lawsuit on their own terms.id.at.in any event,regardless of whether success is achieved in the trial court,the attempt to intervene could ensure appellate standing.as has been said,even if mother did not have standing below,she would still be aggrieved by the trial court ruling that she did not have standing.thus,she would still have standing to appeal.in re catherine th,d by seeking return of child under guardianship via contested dispositional hearing,mother gained appellate standing.
in this case,given her inaction,gail has forfeited any claim that she was entitled to participate as a party in the habeas proceeding.as the california supreme court recently reaffirmed,a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.in re cal th,d.dependency matters are not exempt from this rule.ibid.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.ibid.a party can not deliberately stand by in silence and thereby permit the proceedings to reach a conclusion in which the party could acquiesce if favorable and avoid if unfavorable.in re dakota th,d,in re hochberg cal d,the people remained silent when the superior court at the habeas corpus hearing announced its refusal to decide the factual issues before it they are not now entitled to urge that if the court had found the facts its findings would have been favorable to them.
gail is not legally aggrieved by the challenged ruling.
despite our conclusion that gail forfeited her claim to party status below,we nevertheless reach the merits of her appellate standing claim.we do so out of concern that the narrow scope of our order to show cause may have deterred her from taking action to intervene,particularly given her pro per status,and because the only official written notice of the habeas hearing that she received was sent to her former attorney.
on the merits,we conclude,gail can not satisfy the principal criterion for appellate legally cognizable interest that is injuriously affected by the court decision.in re barbara,supra,th at,d.simply put,although gail strenuously contests the habeas ruling,she is not legally aggrieved by it.
the habeas corpus proceeding did not operate as a dismissal of the dependency.
gail argues that the habeas proceeding was the functional equivalent of a dismissal,which injuriously affected her interests.as she points out standing depends on the nature of the party interests,not the phrasing of the argument.in re daniel th,d parent lacked standing to assert ineffectiveness of child counsel on sibling issues,whether raised in direct appeal or as habeas.here,she contends ineffectiveness of counsel was merely the form,while the nature of the proceeding was to press an all out assault on the prior findings of the dependency court which had been based on gail allegations and evidence.
we reject gail arguments.the evidentiary hearing on a petition for writ of habeas corpus is a special proceeding,held pursuant to procedural rules set forth in the penal code,contained in,pt.of criminal procedure,tit.special proceedings of a criminal nature,ch.of the writ of habeas corpus.juvenile dependency proceedings,by contrast,are special proceedings with their own set of rules,governed,in general,by the welfare and institutions code.in re chantal cal th,d.the proceedings are civil in nature,designed not to prosecute a parent,but to protect the child.in re charles th,d,italics omitted.
the distinct nature of the habeas proceeding is evident here.first,the hearing was conducted in superior court not juvenile court.second,the nominal scope of the inquiry at the habeas hearing was narrow,concerned only with representation.as the court observed at the commencement of the habeas hearing,the issues to be dealt with in the habeas proceeding are framed by the petition,the return and the traverse and thus were limited to counsel performance and any resulting prejudice.third,while the habeas hearing was underway,the ongoing dependency progressed on its own procedural track,presided over by a different judicial officer.indeed,the juvenile court granted the department motion to dismiss the dependency in october,with exit orders to the family court,before the superior court ruled in the separate habeas hearing.
while we acknowledge that the habeas ruling ultimately led to a final dismissal of the dependency proceeding in april,we decline to characterize the two as functional equivalents.as has been said,reversal of an order in a dependency proceeding does not necessarily mean that the status quo is reinstated and that the child can no longer be protected.a reversal because of ineffective assistance of counsel does not preclude further dependency proceedings in juvenile court it simply requires that the proceedings be reconducted because the parents were not properly represented.in re emilye th,fn,d.to the extent that the proceeding gail an all out assault on the prior findings of the dependency court,that circumstance arises from the defects in paul representation,which contributed to those findings.in any event,even if we equated the habeas order with dismissal,that circumstance would not accord gail appellate standing in this case,a point we explain next.
gail proffered authority is unpersuasive.
in pressing her argument for standing,gail relies on in re lauren th,d,which was decided by the fourth district,division two.in lauren,the mother appealed the juvenile court order dismissing the dependency petition.id.at,d.in response to the appellate court request for supplemental briefing on the questions of appealability and the mother appellate standing,all parties conceded both points.ibid.
addressing the standing issue,the lauren court observed it could be argued that the only party aggrieved by the dismissal of the petition was the agency.a juvenile dependency petition can only be filed by a public agency.in re lauren,supra,th at,d,citing.ultimately,however,the court concluded the state exclusive power to initiate a dependency proceeding does not equate to an exclusive interest in the outcome of the proceeding.id.at,d.it determined that the mother had a natural interest in obtaining the state protection for her daughter against future sexual abuse.dismissal of the petition injuriously affected this interest.id.at,d.the court thus held that the mother was sufficiently aggrieved by the dismissal order to have standing to appeal from it.ibid.
as paul points out,however,lauren was questioned by a different division of the same court that decided it,in the case of in re carissa see in re carissa,supra,th,d,decided by the fourth,div.three.as the carissa court put it,we can not agree with lauren reasoning.mother concededly has a fundamental right to parent minor.but the juvenile court dismissal of the petition did not impact that right.id.at,d see also in re eric th,d mother not entitled to present evidence at dismissal hearing,since dismissal of dependency did not impact her fundamental right to parent her child.as the carissa court further explained,the mere fact that a parent takes a position on a matter at issue in a juvenile dependency case that affects his or her child does not alone constitute a sufficient reason to establish standing to challenge an adverse ruling on it.in re carissa,at,d.we find carissa persuasive on this point.
moreover,we observe,lauren arose in a different procedural posture than did our case.in lauren,the dissatisfied parent appealed from an order directly and explicitly dismissing the dependency petition.in re lauren,supra,th at,d.in this case,by contrast,gail made no attempt to appeal the juvenile court ultimate dismissal order,entered in april.instead,she attacks the earlier habeas ruling our case thus is procedurally distinct from lauren 
for all these reasons,gail reliance on lauren is misplaced.
the ruling did not affect gail interest in maintaining custody of the children.
apart from lauren analytic weaknesses and its dissimilar procedural posture,an important factual distinction separates that case and this one the children custody status.
in lauren,at the time of dismissal,the child custody remained unresolved.in re lauren,supra,th at,d.in this case,by contrast,gail right to physical custody of the children was settled,initially by the family court orders preceding the dependency,later by the october exit orders transferring the case back to family court with the juvenile court orders in place,and ultimately by the april exit orders transferring the case to family court in the status quo ante.see,in re carissa,supra,th at,d dismissal of the petition did not alter minor custody status in re tomi d.same.
given the limited scope of the inquiry at the habeas hearing,it could not affect the children custodial status,regardless of its outcome.for that reason,gail interest in maintaining custody of her children was not directly at issue in the habeas corpus hearing 
the ruling did not otherwise affect gail parental interests.
for purposes of appellate standing in dependency cases,a parent is aggrieved by a juvenile court order that injuriously affects the relationship.see,in re charles,supra,th at,d failure to appoint guardian ad litem for child affects relationship parent therefore had standing.the parent primary interest in dependency is usually reunification.while the case is still in reunification,the parent standing to assert errors affecting the rights of the other parent or the child is fairly clear because there may be shared interests.abbott,et,cal.juvenile dependency practice,supra,appeals and writs,see,in re barbara,supra,th at,d mother had standing to attack minor representation as incompetent,where actions by minor counsel could affect permanent plan and thus parental interest in reunification.
conversely,a parent is not aggrieved when the challenged order has no impact on the relationship,but instead affects someone else.a parent lacks standing to raise issues affecting another person interests.in re gary,supra,th at,d.in other words,an appellant must demonstrate error affecting his or her own interests in order to have standing to appeal.in re crystal th,d.this proposition has been repeated numerous times,in many different factual contexts.thus,for example,a dependent minor was not aggrieved by the denial of de facto parent status for her aunt and uncle.id.at,d.likewise,a mother was not aggrieved by the fact the juvenile court judgment may sever the grandmother ties with minors.in re gary,at,d.similarly,a parent is not aggrieved by the fact that the order terminating parental rights also severed the minor ties with his foster family.in re devin th,d.and prior to a statutory change case law consistently held that the minor interest in maintaining a relationship with siblings is unrelated to the parents interest in reunification.in re daniel,supra,th at,d see now in re erik th,d in light of statutory change,parental standing to assert sibling bond is now recognized.
although none of the foregoing cases mirrors our own in terms of procedural context,the principle of law articulated there carries equal weight here.in this case,gail has identified no direct injury to her parental relationship with her children resulting from the habeas ruling,nor do we perceive any.other than paul,only one person had interests arguably vulnerable to harm in the habeas original trial attorney.gail lacks standing to raise issues affecting only paul or his counsel,in re daniel,supra,th at,d parent must show that minor counsel alleged conflict of interest actually affected the parent interests.
contrary to gail suggestion,this is not a case where her interests interweave with paul,such that either party has standing to litigate issues that impact upon the related interests.in re patricia d,disapproved on another point by in re celine cal th,d.in the absence of such intertwined interests,a parent is precluded from raising issues on appeal which did not affect his or her own rights.in re caitlin th,d,quoting in re jasmine th,d.in this case,far from sharing paul concern about adequate representation,gail interest was not technically whether or not paul counsel had performed competently,but rather that regardless of the representation,the allegations of sexual abuse were supported by evidence sufficient to uphold the prior orders of the dependency court and retain its jurisdiction of the matter.presumably,the in the habeas a similar interest in defending its jurisdiction,in re emilye,supra,th at,d the state interest in the child welfare may also best be served by making sure that the parent is adequately represented at hearings involving that welfare.
as explained above,the mere fact that a parent takes a position on a matter at issue in a juvenile dependency case does not establish standing to challenge an adverse ruling on it.in re carissa,supra,th at,d.although gail concededly has a fundamental right to parent her children,the habeas ruling did not impact that right.ibid.
the ruling did not affect any other cognizable interest of gail.
gail indirectly asserts a reputational interest in the outcome of the habeas proceeding.she defends her credibility with regard to her allegations of abuse and her statements about the investigation of them and she urges the centrality of her credibility in the habeas proceeding,citing six short statements from the court ruling.
gail credibility is not the issue.the objective is an accurate and just decision in the child best interests,which the system tries to achieve through adversarial dependency proceedings where each party is competently represented.in re emilye,supra,th at,d,italics added.in any event,to the extent that gail reputational interests were at stake,any harm to her credibility remote consequence of the ruling that does not satisfy the requirements for standing.in re carissa,supra,th at,d.
gail also claims that she is aggrieved because the entire case was repositioned as if the jurisdictional hearing had never happened.this necessarily meant that gail would have to again assert her claims against paul and that the orders barring his visitation were null and void.as a result,she complains,presently gail is in a far different posture than she had been when the october order placed full legal and physical custody in her and barred visitation by paul.
gail complaint about the new status of the case offers no basis for finding that she is aggrieved.as noted above,a reversal based on ineffective assistance does not necessarily mean that the status quo is reinstated and that the child can no longer be protected.in re emilye,supra,th at,fn,d.an interested party may make an application to the agency to initiate section proceedings.in re tomi,supra,d at,citing.and if the agency fails or refuses to file a petition,the applicant can seek judicial review of the decision.in re lauren,supra,th at,d,citing.issues concerning custody and visitation can also be dealt with in a family law proceeding.in re carissa,supra,th at,d.gail thus is not aggrieved simply because the case has been returned to family court,from whence it came in,in re eric,supra,th at,d.
interests of other parties to the dependency 
in closing,we feel compelled to touch briefly on the interests of other members of the family involved in the dependency here.
we first address the interests of the children.as has been said,the welfare of dependent children may best be served by making sure that the parent is adequately represented at hearings involving that welfare.in re emilye,supra,th at,d.if,as our adversary system presupposes,accurate and just results are most likely to be obtained through the equal contest of opposed interests,the state interest in the child welfare may perhaps best be served by a hearing in which both the parent and the state acting for the child are represented by competent counsel.lassiter department of social services,d,quoted in in re emilye,at,d.absent such representation,there may be an unacceptably high risk of an erroneous and unjust decision at the jurisdiction hearing,which decision would be contrary to the best interests of the minor as well as those of the affected parent.in re emilye,at,d.
that brings us to paul interests.like gail,he has a fundamental interest in maintaining a normal relationship with his children.in re emilye,supra,th at,d.furthermore,he has an additional important personal interest to protect since the dependency petition was based on his alleged criminal activity.id.at,d.to protect those interests,paul had the right to competent representation at the jurisdictional dispositional hearing,which deprived him of the ability to parent for a substantial period of time,and which could have formed the basis for subsequent termination of the relationship id.at,d.adequate representation was critical for paul given the importance of his continuing and intense interests in maintaining an unrestricted relationship with his children and in avoiding a finding that he had engaged in criminal acts,the state interest in making sure the child welfare is protected by a correct decision,and the potential for an erroneous decision if he was not represented by competent counsel.id.at,d.those were the interests at stake in the habeas proceeding.
summary of conclusions 
assuming that gail has not forfeited her claim to party status by failing to press it below,she can not satisfy the principal criterion for appellate standing,because she is not legally aggrieved by the habeas ruling.gail thus lacks standing to prosecute this appeal.
disposition 
the appeal is dismissed.
i concur in the majority opinion.i agree that the mother in this case is not a proper party in a habeas corpus proceeding initiated by the father to determine whether he received effective representation of counsel.and i agree that the mother is not aggrieved,as that term is used in the law,by the outcome of the proceeding.i therefore agree with the majority conclusion that the mother does not have standing to pursue an appeal from the trial court order in the habeas corpus proceeding,and that her appeal must accordingly be dismissed.
i write separately to expand upon the discussion of a point made in the majority opinion,that the rules governing habeas corpus,because they were developed in the context of criminal law,do not fit the dependency context well,ante,at.the use of habeas corpus in dependency cases to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is a relatively recent development in the law.see in re kristin th,d.however,such claims are being brought before us with increasing regularity.i therefore believe it is worthwhile,and perhaps would be helpful to practitioners in the dependency field,and to the family members they represent,to attempt to articulate some general guidelines for the use of the habeas corpus writ proceeding to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a dependency case.
it is now well established that indigent parents whose children are the subject of dependency proceedings and may be placed out of the home have a statutory,and in some cases a due process,right to appointed counsel.welf,subd.b cal.rules of court,rule h b in re kristin,supra,th at,d kristin.a parent who has a right to appointed counsel is entitled to competent counsel otherwise it will be a hollow right.citations.kristin,supra,th at,d.indeed california law expressly provides that a ll parties who are represented by counsel at dependency proceedings shall be entitled to competent counsel.welf,subd.a.
in kristin,supra,th,d,we found that this statutory right to counsel must include the right to seek review of claims of incompetence of counsel.id.at,d.we further found in kristin that review of claims of incompetence of counsel in dependency proceedings can be sought through a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus.id.at,d.as in the criminal context,a petitioner must meet a two part test petitioner must show that counsel failed to act in a manner to be expected of reasonably competent attorneys practicing in the field of juvenile dependency law and must also establish that the claimed error was prejudicial.id.at,d.the test for prejudice is whether it is reasonably probable that a more favorable result would have occurred in the absence of counsel alleged failings.people fosselman cal d,people watson cal d.
the circumstances of a habeas corpus petitioner in a dependency setting are somewhat different from those of a criminal defendant,who is generally seeking release from confinement.in the criminal context,the parties are well defined.the petition alleges that the petitioner is unlawfully imprisoned or restrained and names the person or entity who is the custodian of his or her confinement.the custodian of petitioner confinement files the written response,or return,setting forth the legal basis for the restraint.in a dependency proceeding,on the other hand,although the underlying dependency petition may contain allegations of criminal activity,the proceedings are civil in nature.in re charles th,d.there is no prosecution by the state,or resulting confinement or restraint on liberty similar to the criminal context.in addition,the dependency proceeding involves an entire family,whose interests are both diverse and intertwined.
as the majority points out,habeas corpus has been used historically in civil proceedings involving child custody disputes,such as those between parents in a divorce proceeding in re barr cal d,in re macedo d,between a parent and a guardian in re lukasik d,or between a birth parent and adoptive parents.adoption of alexander cal d.in those cases,which do not necessarily involve claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,courts have found that the writ will lie when a person entitled to custody of a minor child is denied possession thereof.in re barr,supra,cal d at.thus,the party claiming custody is the petitioner,who alleges that he or she is wrongfully deprived of the child,and the respondents in the proceeding are the party or parties who have custody of the child.
while these cases have some parallels to the dependency setting,they do not provide an ideal model for a habeas proceeding raising ineffective assistance of counsel in a dependency setting.although the protection of the child or children is a central issue in dependency proceedings,the child custody is generally not the direct focus of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus raising ineffective assistance of counsel,and the person who has custody may not be a party to the habeas proceedings.in the case before us,for instance,although the mother had custody of the three girls,she was not a proper party to the habeas corpus proceedings initiated by the father,as the majority opinion has concluded.a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a dependency proceeding can be brought by any party entitled to counsel,and in a variety of circumstances.the child or children can be in care under the custody of the social services agency,or can be,as was the case here with the petitioner daughters,in the custody of the other parent.furthermore,unlike a criminal habeas corpus proceeding,which generally occurs after the underlying trial has concluded,in the dependency setting a challenge to counsel competence can arise at any stage of the proceedings,and the proceedings then continue along a statutory timeline.the focus of a dependency ultimately shifts to the child interests in permanency,and any evaluation of the parent rights in the later stages of the proceedings must take into account that the purpose and objective of dependency law is to achieve a safe and permanent home for the child.see,in re arturo th,d.
bearing these considerations in mind,and acknowledging that some of the penal code rules governing habeas corpus,are specific to the criminal setting,i offer the following suggestions to provide guidance to juvenile court judges and practitioners regarding the use of habeas corpus proceedings raising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in dependency cases.
the proceeding begins with the filing of a verified petition for a writ of habeas corpus.people romero cal th,d.a habeas corpus petition can be filed in the superior court or in a court of appeal a petition claiming ineffective assistance of counsel filed in the court of appeal must be filed either concurrently with the appeal from the particular order,or during the pendency of the appeal from that order.habeas corpus may not be utilized to challenge antecedent final orders.in re carrie th,d.a petition for habeas corpus is proper where the claims will require consideration of matters outside the appellate record in re darlice th,d.the habeas corpus petitioner in a dependency proceeding will generally not be imprisoned or restrained,however,the allegations should include facts describing the child custody,the petitioner interest in the child,and why the petitioner is claiming that the custody of the child is unlawful.it should state fully and with particularity the grounds for relief under the two part test summarized above,namely that counsel representation fell below reasonable standards and that it is reasonably probable that a different result would have occurred in the absence of the error.people duvall cal th,d,kristin,supra,th at,d.conclusory allegations made without any explanation of the basis for the allegations do not warrant relief,let alone an evidentiary hearing.citations.people duvall,supra,cal th at,d.since the dependency proceeding is an ongoing process,the petition should include allegations describing the child current situation.see abbott,et,cal.juvenile dependency practice,supra,appeals and writs.the petition should include copies of reasonably available documentary evidence supporting the claim,including affidavits,declarations,and pertinent portions of the trial transcript.people duvall,supra,cal th at,d,see generally cal.rules of court,rules.the petition should be served on all parties to the dependency proceeding,or on their attorneys if represented,and on the juvenile court.cal.rules of court,rule.
the habeas corpus petitioner bears a heavy burden to plead facts su
