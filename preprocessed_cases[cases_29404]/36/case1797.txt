at issue in this appeal is whether the circuit court of cook county erred during a hearing on termination of parental rights when it appointed a guardian ad litem for a mentally disabled mother who already had a plenary guardian of the person.the appellate court concluded that the appointment of the guardian ad litem rendered the termination proceeding fundamentally flawed and reversed the judgment of the circuit court terminating the mother parental rights.d.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the appellate court and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings.
background 
in august of,the circuit court of cook county entered an order pursuant to section of the probate act of ilcs west appointing amy plenary guardian of the person for her daughter,delores w.the order indicated that delores was mentally handicapped with mild to moderate retardation and that she functioned at a level.thereafter,in july of,delores gave birth to a son,mark 
in april of,when mark was approximately nine months old,the illinois department of children and family services dcfs received a report that delores had shoved a plastic toy into mark mouth and throat,that she had hit him on the head with a television remote control several times,and that she had attempted to choke mark when he continued to cry.mark was taken into protective custody and placed in foster care with his grandmother,amy.
on april,the state filed a petition for adjudication of wardship pursuant to section of the juvenile court act of ilcs west and a motion for temporary custody see ilcs,west.the petition and motion alleged that mark was neglected due to an injurious environment see ilcs b west and that he was abused because he faced a substantial risk of physical injury see ilcs ii west.
on april,the circuit court awarded temporary custody of mark to dcfs.mark remained in the care of amy until july of,when he was removed from amy care because of concerns about her parenting skills and fears that mark was at risk of being harmed.according to documents generated by dcfs,mark had what appeared to be burns on his stomach and toe that amy was unable to explain.mark was placed with foster parents from july of to june of.he was then placed with a foster parent,michelle,with whom he remains to the present day.
after several continuances,the state petition for adjudication of wardship was set for trial on october.on that date,however,the circuit court was informed that,despite several previous attempts to retain representation,delores did not have an attorney.aware that she was disabled,the court expressed an intent to appoint a bar attorney as both attorney and guardian ad litem for delores.the case was then passed so that the bar attorney for the day,raymond morrissey,could speak with delores and amy.when the case was recalled,morrissey told the court the following 
your honor,ray morrissey.i am the bar attorney today,and i have attempted to speak with the mother along with her guardian.the guardian is not present at this time.she has made it known emphatically clear that she does not want me to represent her daughter as attorney or guardian,and that she wants to hire a private attorney for her daughter.
i have talked to the mother,and i also explained to the guardian that there may be a conflict between what she feels is in the best interest of her daughter and what i feel is the best interest,and then she stopped me and she said i want to hire a private attorney for my daughter.
i have no problem with accepting appointment as the guardian.i am just not sure if she amy as a legal guardian would have a right to hire a private attorney for her daughter.
after listening to morrissey statement,and after questioning delores,the circuit court stated that it would give amy time to hire private counsel.the court then appointed morrissey guardian ad litem for delores.
on october,the circuit court entered an order amending the petition for adjudication of wardship to include an allegation that mark was dependent due to the physical or mental condition of his parent,guardian or custodian.see ilcs west.on november,following an adjudicatory hearing see ilcs west,the circuit court found that mark was a dependent child,due to the mental condition of his mother.a dispositional hearing was held on march,see ilcs west,and mark was made a ward of the court.
shortly thereafter,in june of,the appellate court filed its decision in in re,d.in re held that the state must name a plenary guardian of a parent as a in a petition for adjudication of wardship.in order to comply with the decision,on march,the circuit court vacated the adjudicatory and dispositional orders that had previously been entered in the case.the state petition for adjudication of wardship was then amended to add amy as a respondent and she was given proper notice of the proceedings.
on december,the circuit court revisited the issue of delores representation,asking morrissey if he would accept appointment as both attorney and guardian ad litem for delores.morrissey declined,stating that such an appointment would create a conflict of interests 
i would object for a couple of reasons.firstly,i was discharged as her attorney.my independent standing all the way through,and i was hoping i had made it clear every time i appeared on the case,i was just appointed as her guardian,not as her attorney and guardian.correct,i was appointed as her attorney and guardian but i was fired by amy.so for me to be reappointed i think is a conflict on the case.
also,if your honor saw fit to appoint me on the case today and we did proceed,there were a whole different set of issues that i have to deal with.in this particular case there a strong conflict,as we say,bifercation sic between my role as guardian and my role as attorney.i would be advocating two contradictory positions.i do think that would be in the best interest of my client at this time.so,i ask the matter be passed for appointment of private attorney.
following morrissey comments,the court appointed attorney mark kusatzky as delores counsel.morrissey continued as delores guardian ad litem.
in january of,the circuit court held a second adjudicatory hearing and found that mark was abused and neglected.following a second dispositional hearing in march,the court found that delores,amy,and mark father were all unable and unwilling for reasons other than financial circumstances to care for mark.the court made mark a ward of the court and appointed the dcfs guardian administrator as his guardian.in january of,the court held a permanency planning hearing and found that delores had not made any progress toward the goal of returning home.the court then entered a permanency goal of substitute care pending termination of parental rights.
on april,the state filed a supplemental petition for appointment of a guardian with the right to consent to adoption,alleging that delores was unfit and that it would be in mark best interests to terminate parental rights.the termination hearing began on november.neither delores nor amy appeared in court at any time during the hearing.however,both women were represented by their attorneys and morrissey was present as guardian ad litem for delores.
during the unfitness portion of the termination hearing,evidence was introduced which showed that delores had failed to participate in dcfs various assessment and reunification services and had failed to make progress toward reunification with mark.evidence was also introduced which showed that amy had repeatedly prevented delores from following her service plans,that she had failed to provide consent,as delores plenary guardian,for delores to receive various services that she had been hostile to service providers,and that her behavior had impeded efforts to reunify delores with mark.
at the close of the unfitness portion of the termination proceeding,the attorneys for delores and amy argued against termination of delores parental rights.morrissey made a brief statement to the contrary,asserting that delores parental rights should be terminated.as evinced by a review of the record as a whole,morrissey position was that,in light of assessments made by dcfs,the only way delores could be reunited with mark would be if she participated in an assisted living program that provided her with the necessary support and services for raising mark.amy,however,refused to permit delores to participate in such a program.thus,in order to have a chance of reuniting with her child,delores would have to curtail,and perhaps sever,her relationship with amy.faced with the options of delores ending her connection with mark,a child with whom she had an attenuated relationship,or severing her connection with her mother,a woman with whom delores was inextricably bound,morrissey concluded it would be in delores best interests to terminate her parental rights.
in april,the circuit court found delores unfit based upon her failure to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,concern,or responsibility as to mark welfare see ilcs d b west and based upon her failure to make reasonable progress toward reunification see ilcs d m west.thereafter,the court found it was in mark best interests to terminate delores parental rights.on july,the circuit court entered an order finding delores unfit,terminating her parental rights and appointing the dcfs guardian administrator as guardian with the right to consent to adoption.
amy appealed.before the appellate court she raised four issues delores due process rights were violated because morrissey recommended that her parental rights be terminated the circuit court findings at the termination of parental rights hearing were against the manifest weight of the evidence the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to terminate delores parental rights because mark was illegally removed from amy care in and the circuit court committed reversible error when it barred certain witnesses from testifying.the appellate court did not reach these issues,however,choosing instead to consider,sua sponte,whether the circuit court appointment of morrissey as guardian ad litem was appropriate.
the appellate court held that,following amy appointment as delores plenary guardian of the person,morrissey appointment as guardian ad litem was unauthorized under either the juvenile court act or the probate act.the appellate court further held that the termination of parental rights hearing was fundamentally flawed and the judgment terminating delores parental rights had to be reversed,both because morrissey revealed confidential information obtained during his initial conversation with amy and delores and because he was operating under an actual conflict of interest during the proceedings.one justice dissented,concluding that any error during the termination hearing was harmless,as the evidence overwhelmingly established delores unfitness as a parent.d at,frossard,dissenting.we granted the state petition for leave to appeal.
two principal issues are raised by the appellate court decision in this case does the circuit court have the authority,as a general matter,to appoint a guardian ad litem for a mentally disabled parent during a termination of parental rights hearing when the parent already has a plenary guardian of the person and assuming the circuit court has such authority,must the judgment of the circuit court terminating delores parental rights in this case nevertheless be reversed because morrissey revealed confidential information and was operating under a conflict of interest we address these issues in turn.
a guardian ad litem functions as the eyes and ears of the court and not as the ward attorney.in re guardianship of mabry,d,citing in re marriage of wycoff,d.the traditional role of the guardian ad litem is not to advocate for what the ward wants but,instead,to make a recommendation to the court as to what is in the ward best interests.mabry,d at.the role of the guardian ad litem is thus in contrast to the role of the plenary guardian of the person appointed pursuant to the probate act.under section of the probate act,the plenary guardian makes decisions on behalf of the ward and must,in general,conform those decisions as closely as possible to what the ward,if competent,would have done or intended under the circumstances.ilcs e west.see also in re marriage of burgess,guardian must generally make decisions on behalf of a ward in accordance with the ward previously expressed wishes.
in the case at bar,the appellate court concluded that the circuit court had no authority,under either the juvenile court act or the probate act,to appoint a guardian ad litem for delores.before this court,the state points to various statutory provisions which,it contends,support by implication the circuit court authority to appoint a guardian ad litem.the state acknowledges,however,that no provision speaks directly to the situation presented here.at the same time,amy acknowledges that no statutory provision expressly forbids the appointment of a guardian ad litem.the question,then,is whether in the absence of controlling statutory authority,the circuit court has the authority to make such an appointment.we believe it does.
delores was adjudicated a disabled person under the probate act in.a disabled person is viewed as a favored person in the eyes of the law and is entitled to vigilant protection.in re estate of wellman,t he trial court protects the disabled person as its ward,vigilantly guarding the ward property and viewing the ward as a favored person in the eyes of the law.once a person is adjudicated disabled,that person remains under the jurisdiction of the court,even when a plenary guardian of the person has been appointed.in re estate of nelson,d.the court has a duty to judicially interfere and protect the ward if the guardian is about to do anything that would cause harm.nelson,d at.to fulfill this duty,the court authority is not limited to express statutory terms.as our appellate court has held 
when,as in this case,a court is charged with a duty to protect the interests of its ward,we believe that by implication it has such powers,although not expressly given by the statute vesting the court with jurisdiction over the ward,as are necessary to properly discharge that duty.nelson,d at,recognizing the authority of the circuit court to appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate an allegation that a ward was neglected.
see also in re serafin,d,the circuit court is charged with a duty to protect the interests of its ward and has,by statute and otherwise,those powers necessary to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the respondent during the court exercise of its jurisdiction.
in accordance with this precedent,and given delores status as a disabled person entitled to the utmost protection of the courts,we have little difficulty concluding that the circuit court had the authority to appoint a guardian ad litem to make a recommendation to the court as to what was in delores best interests.
the appellate court,however,was also critical of the circuit court appointment of morrissey as guardian ad litem because the court did not first revoke amy letters of office.d at.as noted,neither the juvenile court act nor the probate act addresses the situation presented here,and we think it would be unwise to impose a requirement,as a matter of law,that the circuit court must revoke the plenary guardian letters of office in situations such as this.the facts of this case illustrate the point.
at various times during the proceedings in this case,the circuit court expressed concern about amy decisions not to permit delores to participate in reunification services with dcfs.at one point,for example,the court noted,
if the record before me were clear that amy is making a decision about d e lores because she feels that d e lores simply can not handle the parenting,is not capable of managing with a child,i would have complete respect for that.but t here have been things that have been said throughout the course of both of these proceedings,mark and paula that cause me some concern that while that may be a factor,there may be other factors as well that are causing amy to have perhaps clouded judgment on the issue.
my concern is that amy,as a result of the removal of mark,has become so
