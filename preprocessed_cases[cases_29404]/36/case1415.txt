introduction 
the juvenile court dismissed this dependency case and granted physical custody of nicholas to his presumed father,thomas nicholas mother,kimberly,contends the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss this case,applied the wrong test for determining whether nicholas should be returned to kimberly care,and erroneously restrained kimberly from telling nicholas that thomas is not his biological father.we affirm.
ii.statement of facts and procedure 
the factual circumstances which led to the filing of this dependency case have been discussed in numerous prior opinions of this court and were also summarized in a published decision by our supreme court in in re nicholas cal th,d,nicholas i.in light of the discrete issues presented in this appeal,we simply note the following salient details.in february,the fremont police department placed nicholas in the custody of the alameda county social services agency agency after kimberly and thomas accused each other of misconduct and questioned each other right to custody of nicholas.a petition was filed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section and nicholas was temporarily placed with thomas pending further proceedings to determine thomas parental status.
on july,the juvenile court found that thomas was nicholas presumed father under family code section.the court adjudged nicholas a dependent of the juvenile court,found that the home of removal was that of the mother,and placed nicholas in thomas home,under the supervision of the agency.kimberly was given reunification services and thomas was given family maintenance services.by october,thomas and nicholas had moved to southern california to live with thomas mother.
a series of juvenile court hearings ensued while,at the same time,kimberly sought appellate review of several juvenile court orders.specifically,kimberly appealed an august,dispositional order,an october,review order,a january,review order and a series of orders entered by the juvenile court in april and may during another review proceeding.the primary issue raised by each of these appeals was whether the juvenile court erred by finding that thomas was nicholas presumed father.
this court consolidated kimberly first two appeals and reversed the juvenile court orders.in re nicholas th,d,review granted,d,revd.by nicholas i,supra,cal th,d.we concluded that a presumption that thomas is nicholas natural father arose during the juvenile court proceedings,but that presumption was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that thomas was not nicholas biological father.ibid.while our decision in nicholas i was pending in the supreme court,we resolved kimberly third and fourth appeals in unpublished decisions we have elsewhere referred to as nicholas ii and nicholas iii.in re nicholas,wl,nonpub.opn.nicholas ii in re nicholas,wl,nonpub.opn.nicholas iii.
meanwhile,the juvenile court scheduled a hearing date for a combined and review for november.however,at the hearing,the court decided to stay the entire action until may,on may,the court extended the stay until august,since the supreme court had not yet issued an opinion regarding thomas status as a presumed father.
on june,the supreme court filed its opinion in nicholas nicholas i,supra,cal th,d.the court held that the fact that thomas was not nicholas biological father did not rebut the presumption of natural fatherhood which arose in this case.ibid.after the court decided nicholas i,it transferred nicholas ii and nicholas iii back to us with directions to vacate our prior decisions and to reconsider the matters decided in those opinions in light of nicholas 
on august,the juvenile court scheduled a hearing for the and review after kimberly contested the agency recommendation that this case be dismissed and custody of nicholas be awarded to thomas.two section petitions that had been filed prior to the stay of the juvenile court proceedings were also scheduled to be heard.in one petition,thomas sought dismissal of the dependency and full custody of nicholas.in the other,kimberly sought to have nicholas removed from thomas and to have him placed either with her or in foster care.
the contested juvenile court hearing commenced before the honorable winifred smith on september and continued on september.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court terminated reunification services to kimberly.it found that kimberly had made progress but was not yet ready to have nicholas returned to her care.the court further found,by clear and convincing evidence,that it would be in nicholas best interest for him to remain with thomas because of the stability and family relationships he experienced in that placement.the court also found there was clear and convincing evidence that dismissal was warranted and there was no longer a substantial risk of harm to nicholas that would require dependency status or court supervision.therefore,the court dismissed the dependency case and gave joint legal custody to both parents and sole physical custody to thomas.the court also granted kimberly reasonable visitation and established specific rules and guidelines pertaining to that matter.
the juvenile court september rulings were memorialized in a series of minute orders,each of which incorporated an attachment setting forth specific guidelines pertaining to visitation.this attachment also contains the following order parents are not to discuss separately with minor any court proceedings and specifically presumed father status with minor.when it is to be discussed parents are ordered to seek mediation.the court orders were also incorporated into a final judgment filed on september.
on september,this court vacated its prior decisions in nicholas ii and nicholas iii,consolidated those two cases and reconsidered the issues kimberly had raised therein in light of nicholas in re nicholas,nonpub.opn.for clarity,we refer to our september decision as nicholas iv.most of the arguments kimberly advanced in nicholas iv failed in light of the supreme court ruling that thomas was nicholas presumed father.we did agree with kimberly,though,that one restriction in a visitation order was not supported by substantial evidence.however,more than a year had passed since that particular order was made and we emphasized that our finding did not affect or limit,in any way,the juvenile court discretion to change kimberly visitation because of events occurring after the challenged order was issued.nicholas iv,supra,at.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
kimberly contends the juvenile court committed reversible error by dismissing this action on september,because at that time the court did not have jurisdiction to terminate its jurisdiction over nicholas.according to kimberly,the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction because nicholas ii and nicholas iii were still pending in this court,and therefore the juvenile court could not reopen any matter addressed in those appeals until this court filed its opinion in nicholas iv and transferred jurisdiction back to the lower court by issuing a remittitur,which we did not do until november.
section of the code of civil procedure codifies the general rule that the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby,including enforcement of the judgment or order,but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.kimberly relies on authority applying this general rule,and she particularly emphasizes language in the case law characterizing the effect of section in jurisdictional terms.see,people johnson cal th,d,during the pendency of an appeal,the trial court loses jurisdiction to do anything in connection with the cause that may affect the judgment,but retains certain powers over the parties and incidental aspects of the cause,such as procedural steps in connection with preparation and correction of the record griset fair political practices com.cal th,d,t he order of the reviewing court is contained in its remittitur,which defines the scope of the jurisdiction of the court to which the matter is returned.
kimberly argument fails because this case falls within an express statutory exception to the general rule set forth in section.code of civil procedure section states,in part the perfecting of an appeal shall not stay proceedings as to those provisions of a judgment or order which award,change,or otherwise affect the custody,including the right of visitation,of a minor child in any civil action,in an action filed under the juvenile court law,or in a special proceeding.all of the appeals kimberly filed in this case were from orders that awarded,changed,or otherwise affected custody,including the right of visitation.therefore,the filing of those appeals did not stay proceedings as to any of the matters embraced in the appealed orders since the filing of the appeals had no effect on the juvenile court jurisdiction at all,it was not restrained from terminating that jurisdiction simply because appeals were still pending.
our conclusion is supported by in re natasha th,d natasha,a case which kimberly erroneously characterizes as inapposite.in that case,natasha was adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court based on allegations of sexual abuse by her father.id.at,d.natasha was placed with her mother,and the father was denied visitation.father appealed the dispositional orders and a subsequent order denying him visitation.id.at,d.the riverside county department of public social services took the position that that juvenile court could not dismiss the dependency or proceed with review hearings until the father appeal was resolved.id.at,d.ultimately,the juvenile court agreed and ordered the case off calendar pending resolution of the appeal.the natasha court held that the juvenile court erred.
the natasha court acknowledged the general rule that an appeal stays further proceedings in the trial court regarding matters embraced therein but it recognized,as we have,that the general rule is expressly subject to the statutory exception set forth in code of civil procedure section.natasha,supra,th at,d.that statutory exception clearly applies to dependency proceedings.as the court explained,t he dispositional order adjudging the minor to be a dependent child of the court necessarily changed and affected legal custody in this case,it changed and affected visitation as well.all subsequent review hearings would be proceedings as to those provisions of the dispositional order,and hence not stayed.ibid.the court also recognized that,to the extent subsequent proceedings pertained to matters not embraced in or affected by the dispositional order at all,the proceeding would not be stayed even under the general rule.id.at,fn,d.
the natasha court also rejected the notion,advanced by the department in that case,that the juvenile court could not terminate jurisdiction while an appeal was pending.the court explained we do not mean that the juvenile court was fated to hold a succession of ritualistic review hearings until the appeal was finally decided even while the appeal was pending,the juvenile court could have its discretion,and subject to all statutory terminate its jurisdiction.see ibid,subd.c.moreover,if it did choose to terminate its jurisdiction,it could also have chosen to issue an exit order determining custody and visitation.see also cal.rules of court,rule.thus,our holding comports with the strong public policy against protracted litigation in dependency cases.citations.natasha,supra,th at,d.
kimberly contends that the procedural posture of the present case distinguishes it from natasha,supra,th,d.although her argument is confusing,kimberly focuses on the fact that this court rendered decisions in nicholas ii and nicholas iii that were favorable to her.she appears to argue that those decisions,although ordered vacated by the supreme court,showed that this court intended to impose directions in its remittitur that would limit the juvenile court jurisdiction upon remand and,therefore,the juvenile court had to await those directions before it could completely dispose of its jurisdiction over this case.
this premise is simply incorrect.as we noted above,the primary issue presented in nicholas ii and nicholas iii was whether the juvenile court finding that thomas was nicholas presumed father was erroneous.since we had already concluded that finding was erroneous in nicholas i,we were compelled to reverse the orders appealed in nicholas ii and nicholas iii.however,we reject,as a matter of fact,the contention that this court analysis of secondary or related issues raised in nicholas ii or nicholas iii suggested that we intended to impose directions on remand that would in any way limit the juvenile court jurisdiction over this case.furthermore,the relevant fact is that by the time the juvenile court dismissed this dependency proceeding,the supreme court had decided nicholas i,supra,cal th,d,and the primary issue raised by all of kimberly appeals was finally decided against her.
in any event,the complicated procedural history of this case is simply not relevant to the distinctly legal question of whether section applies to dependency proceedings.like the natasha court,we conclude that the general rule does not apply because a juvenile court order affecting a matter set forth in code of civil procedure section is not stayed by the filing of an appeal.since kimberly appeals did not stay the juvenile court proceedings,the fact that appeals were pending did not limit the juvenile court jurisdiction nor prevent it from dismissing the dependency case.
b.the custody determination 
issues presented 
kimberly contends the juvenile court applied the wrong standard when it made the decision to grant thomas sole physical custody of nicholas.according to kimberly,because this determination was made at a combined and review held pursuant to sections and,the juvenile court was required to return nicholas to her care unless it found that to do so would create a substantial risk of detriment to nicholas safety,protection,or physical or emotional.see,subd.f section f and,subd.a section a.the agency and thomas respondents contend that the juvenile court was not required to conduct a risk of detriment assessment in this case because review hearings were conducted pursuant to section,not section.alternatively,respondents contend that,even if section does apply to this case,the court was compelled to award custody of nicholas to thomas once it determined that agency supervision of the placement with thomas was no longer necessary citing,subd.e.no party has cited a case that is directly on point.
to resolve the issues raised by the parties,we must first determine which statutory provisions governed the review proceedings in this case.we then consider the role that the risk of detriment and need for supervision inquiries play in a custody determination like the one that was made in this case.
governing statutory provisions 
as noted in our factual summary,the juvenile court removed nicholas from the custody of his mother,kimberly,placed him in the care of his presumed father,thomas,subject to agency supervision,and ordered that services be provided to both parents.that placement decision was made pursuant to section,which provides in relevant part a when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.
b if the court places the child with that parent it may do either of the following 
order that the parent become legal and physical custodian of the child.the court may also provide reasonable visitation by the noncustodial parent.the court shall then terminate its jurisdiction over the child.the custody order shall continue unless modified by a subsequent order of the superior court.the order of the juvenile court shall be filed in any domestic relation proceeding between the parents.
order that the parent assume custody subject to the supervision of the juvenile court.in that case the court may order that reunification services be provided to the parent or guardian from whom the child is being removed,or the court may order that services be provided solely to the parent who is assuming physical custody in order to allow that parent to retain later custody without court supervision,or that services be provided to both parents,in which case the court shall determine,at review hearings held pursuant to section,which parent,if either,shall have custody of the child.
kimberly maintains that,since the placement with thomas was subject to agency supervision and services were provided to both parents,section,subdivision b section b effectively directed the court to conduct review hearings pursuant to section et.
section requires that the status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed no less frequently than once every six months,subd.a,italics added.that section also identifies specific issues to be considered at review hearings,including,for example,the safety of the child,the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement,the extent of the agency efforts to return the child to a safe home,and the progress that has been made toward alleviating the causes requiring the placement in foster care.ibid.additional guidelines pertaining to specific review hearings,the,and reviews are set forth in subsections of section.
respondents contend that section et applies only in cases in which the dependent child is placed in foster care.they maintain that the procedure described in section governs hearings in cases in which the dependent child has been placed with a parent.
section,subdivision a states every hearing in which an order is made placing a child under the supervision of the juvenile court pursuant to section and in which the child is not removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian shall be continued to a specific future date not to exceed six months after the date of the original dispositional hearing.subdivision c of section further provides that,at each review hearing,the court shall determine whether continued supervision is necessary.the court shall terminate its jurisdiction unless the social worker establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the conditions still exist that would justify initial assumption of jurisdiction under section,or that those conditions are likely to exist if supervision is withdrawn.
the review hearings in the present case were not held pursuant to or governed by section.section applies to review hearings held after an order is made placing a child under the supervision of the juvenile court pursuant to section and in which the child is not removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian.italics added.in the present case,nicholas was removed from the physical custody of his parent,kimberly.the juvenile court made an express finding that kimberly was the custodial parent and it removed nicholas from her care.under these circumstances,section does not apply.see in re sarah d,disapproved on other grounds in in re chantal cal th,d,chantal.
respondents mistakenly rely on in re th,d,a case that did not involve a section placement with a noncustodial parent.in re involved a placement accomplished by acts in excess of the juvenile court jurisdiction,which did not occur in this case.we need not confound our analysis by exploring the facts of in re instead,we simply note that the in re court held that section applies to review hearings for a minor who has been removed from,but is subsequently placed back in,parental custody.in re,at,d.that simply did not happen here.
respondents are correct that section et sets forth the procedure for conducting review hearings in the context of a dependency case in which the child has been placed in foster care.however,they improperly ignore the express statutory directive in section b that,when a dependent child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent and both parents are afforded services,review hearings are to be held pursuant to section.in light of that directive,we agree with kimberly that review proceedings in this case were conducted pursuant to section et.see b.however,we do not share her view of the consequences of that fact.kimberly takes the position that,since hearings were conducted pursuant to section,the juvenile court was compelled to strictly adhere to the procedures set forth in every provision of the welfare and institutions code that begins with section.
by directing that review hearings be held pursuant to section,section b advances the legislature goal of ensuring that dependent children receive meaningful and expeditious periodic review of their cases designed to achieve permanency and stability.the framework for periodic review established by section et establishes that goal but,by its terms,directly applies only to dependent children in foster care.thus,section b simply ensures that dependent children who have been placed with a previously noncustodial parent rather than in foster care also receive meaningful and expeditious periodic review of their cases.however,nothing in this statutory provision or any other we have found supports kimberly view that the procedure set forth in section et must be rigidly applied and followed verbatim when the status review is of a child who has not been placed in foster care.in fact,since the section procedure is tailored to address the dependent child in foster care,strict application of that procedure to a child living with a parent would not be possible.
a parent placement poses very different considerations for the juvenile court than does a foster care placement,and those considerations must govern any reasonable interpretation of section et as it applies to dependent children who have been placed with a previously noncustodial parent.with this fact in mind,we turn to the specific statutory provisions upon which kimberly relies in this case.
standards governing the custody determination 
kimberly argues that,since the september hearing was a and review hearing the juvenile court was required by sections f and a to return nicholas to her custody unless it found that returning nicholas to her would create a substantial risk of detriment to his safety or.
section f states that a permanency hearing shall be held no later than months after the date a dependent child enters foster care.it further states that,at the permanency hearing,t he court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian unless the court finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the return of the child to his or her parent or legal guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.if the child is not returned to a parent and the permanency hearing is continued,a permanency review hearing must be held within months after the date the dependent child was originally removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian,subd.g.
section a states that,at the permanency review hearing,t he court shall order the return of the child to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian unless the court finds,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the return of the child to his or her parent or legal guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.
kimberly interprets these sections as requiring the juvenile court to return custody of nicholas to her unless it found that to do so would pose a substantial risk of detriment to nicholas physical or emotional.she reasons that the statutory language quoted above expressly contemplates returning the child to a parent and,since she was the custodial parent when dependency was established,and nicholas was removed from her care,she is the only parent to whom he could be returned.we disagree.
