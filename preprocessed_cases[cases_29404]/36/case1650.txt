janice lee brimberry white,as successor in interest for susan ann brimberry katzberg hereinafter collectively referred to as mother,appeals from an order granting the motion of respondent richard katzberg father to modify his child support obligations.mother claims that the trial court failed to follow the statewide uniform guideline hereinafter the uniform guideline for child support by improperly crediting mother custodial periods to father when the child was absent from both parents homes attending private boarding school.she also claims that the trial court failed to place on the record its reasons for failing to follow the uniform guideline.finally,she argues that the trial court improperly denied her request for the attorney fees that she incurred in opposing the motion for modification.
california child support law has become highly deterministic.certain sections of the family code are now redolent of the flavor of the internal revenue code,complete with definitions of income and allowances for deductions.in re marriage of whealon th,d.one area in which a trial court retains some discretion,however,is in determining the percentage of primary physical responsibility,aka parenting time,to be imputed to each parent.that percentage is a component of the formula used in the uniform guideline to calculate child support.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,hereinafter hogoboom king.
in this case,the parties agreed to send their minor child to an east coast boarding school.the trial court concluded that the time that the child was away at school should be imputed solely to the father because he is the primary custodial parent and it is his family trust that is paying for the cost of the child school.as a result,the mother parenting time was reduced from percent to percent.plugging this percent figure into the uniform guideline formula,the mother child support was calculated to be per month.the trial court then awarded mother supplemental child support of per month to pay for half of her expenses incurred in traveling to visit the child during the school year.
we shall affirm.the trial court decision to impute to father the time the child is away at school was a proper exercise of the court discretion.having made that determination,the trial court simply plugged the appropriate figures into the uniform guideline formula to determine the statutorily presumed amount of child support to be awarded to mother.and because the trial court followed the statutory formula,the court was not required to place on the record the reasons for the award.finally,in the unpublished portion of our opinion,we reject mother claim that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her request for attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute and may be briefly stated.
the parties marriage was dissolved pursuant to a judgment of dissolution of marriage status only entered in december.the parties have three children,but only one,richard richard or the child,born in,was a minor.
since the dissolution of the marriage,the parties had shared joint legal custody of richard,but the father home served as richard primary residence in june,the parties reached a settlement agreement on all remaining issues,which was reduced to a judgment entered on march.the judgment declared that f ather is the primary caretaker of the parties child and m other has the child in her care approximately percent of the time.father parenting time apparently included the time that richard attended school,which as of june was a private school in sacramento.based on mother parenting time of percent,child support of per month was ordered.
as of the time of the instant proceeding and following a modification of the initial order,mother parenting time had been increased to percent.
in october,father filed a motion,requesting modification of his child support obligation.in support of his motion,father noted that richard was now attending an east coast boarding school in north carolina,that mother parenting time had thereby been reduced from percent to percent,that he the father continued to be richard primary caretaker,that he was paying for all of the child transportation to and from the school and incidental expenses,and that the schooling was being paid for from an education trust from his family that represents the majority share of his personal inheritance.the reduction in mother parenting time to percent was the result of imputing to the father all of the parenting time incurred while richard was away at school and the reduction in mother parenting time to percent would,in turn,reduce the father child support obligation.father argued that this reduction would not be unfair in light of the fact that the mother financial burden had been diminished as a result of richard attendance at an school.
mother opposed the motion.in her responsive declaration,mother argued that the assignment to father of all the time that the child was attending school was the same argument a custodial parent would make,counting only the hours a parent was at home with a child when calculating timeshare.she contended that the argument is fallacious and did not represent her actual costs of exercising parenting time which had increased due to her son attendance at school original emphasis since the cost of two trips per year to the school was about per trip,and paying for the child to spend at least one of his school breaks with her relatives would cost per year.she observed that she had to continue her expenses of maintaining a home for richard when he came home.
following hearing and argument,the trial court ruled on the issue who should get credit for the time the child is away at boarding school and concluded that in these circumstances the time that the child is at school should be imputed to father for the reason that he is the primary custodial parent and it is his family trust that is paying for the cost of the child school.but the court further found that mother will reasonably incur approximately a year in travel expenses to visit the child in north carolina and stated that the court was inclined to include of that expense as supplemental child support.
as a result of the ruling,the mother parenting time was reduced to percent child support was set at per month and supplemental child support travel expenses was set at per month.finally,the trial court ruled that the parties would bear their own attorney fees.mother appealed from the ruling.
the trial court findings,as set forth in the ruling,were subsequently incorporated into a formal statement of decision prepared by mother and signed by father and the trial court,which was intended to serve as the final order of the court.we treat mother appeal as having been taken from this order,cal.rules of court,rule c.
discussion 
a.the uniform guideline formula 
in california there is a statewide uniform guideline for determining child support orders,subd.a.this guideline is an algebraic formula.ibid.the intention of the legislature in adopting the uniform guideline was to ensure that this state remains in compliance with federal regulations for child support guidelines.the court may depart from the guideline only in special circumstances set forth in the child support statutes.w hen ordering child support the trial court lacks discretion to vary from the presumptively correct amount,calculated by applying the algebraic formula in the statute,unless one or more of the statutorily enumerated rebuttal factors is found to exist.citation.
there is a rebuttable presumption that the statewide uniform guideline formula amount is the correct amount of child support to be ordered.the presumption can be rebutted by showing that application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case ibid.
i f the court determines that the statewide uniform guideline formula amount would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case,the court must state in writing or on the record the reasons why the amount of support ordered differs from the guideline amount,subd.a.the court must also state in writi
