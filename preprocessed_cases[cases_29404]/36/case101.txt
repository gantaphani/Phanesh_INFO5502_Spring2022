despite the complicated procedural history of this case and its related state court proceedings,the issue before this court is relatively straightforward when marital assets have been awarded to the wife in a state court matrimonial proceeding,are those assets nevertheless part of the husband bankruptcy estate if a chapter petition is filed after the state court decision but before the state court judgment is entered the bankruptcy court ruled that,in new york,an equitable right to marital property does not arise until entry of the judgment awarding equitable distribution and,thus,the property must be included in the estate.on appeal,the district court reversed,finding that the entry of the state court judgment is ministerial and,thus,the rights of the wife,tanya ostashko,vested upon rendering of the state court decision after inquest.
we now vacate the decision of the district court.four relevant premises require this result.first,under new york law an equitable distribution award is a remedy,and the enforcement of that remedy is no different than the enforcement of any other judgment.second,new york adheres to the bright line rule that the priority of judgment creditors is determined on the basis of the order in which judgments are docketed or executed.third,strong arm provision of the bankruptcy the bankruptcy trustee the rights of a hypothetical perfected judgment lien creditor as of the petition date.finally,while the decision after inquest determined the rights to the marital assets as between husband and wife,the decision did not purport to determine the rights to the assets as between tanya ostashko and all other judgment lien creditors.based upon these considerations,and the undisputed fact that the matrimonial judgment was docketed after the filing of the chapter petition,we hold that the marital assets are part of the bankruptcy estate and subject to distribution in due course by the bankruptcy court.

this case involves the intersection of three bodies of law federal bankruptcy law,new york domestic relations law,and new york law on the enforcement and execution of judgments.each has a distinct role,but each must be understood in the context of the others when one partner to a marriage goes to the federal courthouse for bankruptcy relief.
