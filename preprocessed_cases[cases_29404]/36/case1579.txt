jerry has been a dependent child of the juvenile court since shortly after his birth when both he and his mother tested positive for cocaine in their bloodstreams.the court initially found appellant,to be jerry presumed father and ordered father and son be provided family reunification services which eventually could lead to custody of jerry upon rehearing,however,the court determined could not be jerry presumed father because he never received jerry into his home as required by family code section,subdivision d.the court did not address respondent additional argument could not be the presumed father because dna tests showed he is not the biological father.
appeals from the court order denying him reunification services because he is not jerry statutorily presumed father.
we reverse.we hold presumed fatherhood status,for purposes of dependency proceedings,is not necessarily negated by evidence the presumed father is not the biological father.we further hold adoption of kelsey applies to dependency proceedings and therefore family code section and the related dependency scheme violate the constitutional rights of a man seeking presumed father status to the extent they permit a mother or third person to unilaterally deny him that status by preventing him from receiving the child into his home.finally,we hold the constitutional protection afforded biological fathers under kelsey extends to men who are not biological fathers but who meet the other criteria for presumed father status under the kelsey decision.
facts and proceedings below 
and jerry mother,kiz,had a relationship for approximately a year.jerry was conceived during this period.when learned kiz was pregnant he assumed the baby was his and told others kiz was pregnant with his child.eventually broke off his relationship with kiz because she refused to stop using drugs despite warnings she was harming the baby.notwithstanding their,continued to provide support to kiz.he supplied her with vitamin supplements and bus fare to go to the doctor,helped with prenatal care and paid for her medications.
kiz called from the hospital and informed him she had commenced labor.jerry was born the next day,and went to the hospital to visit him.he identified himself to hospital staff as jerry father and he was allowed to hold jerry when returned the following day,kiz had left the hospital but jerry remained because he had tested positive for cocaine visited and held jerry at the hospital every day for a week.when jerry was a week old the hospital moved him to a different unit where could view him only through a window.two days later,jerry was gone.the hospital told only that jerry had been placed with his mother family.for four months tried unsuccessfully to find jerry.he was unaware jerry had been placed in a foster home and dependency proceedings initiated 
testified he first learned of jerry whereabouts four months later when a social worker from the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs contacted him,informed him the baby was in foster care and told him the date of the next scheduled dependency hearing was june.asked to visit jerry and the social worker told him she would check and get back to him.three months later the social worker gave the name and telephone number of jerry foster parents.immediately attempted to arrange visits with jerry.the foster parents referred him back to the social worker and no visits were arranged prior to the next dependency hearing.
the june hearing was a selection and implementation hearing under welfare and institutions code section.appeared at the hearing and was appointed counsel.the court continued the hearing and ordered dcfs to explore presumed father status.the court subsequently ordered a paternity test to determine if was jerry biological father and continued the hearing on the matter.the matter was continued several more times and in the interim filed a petition requesting that he be given presumed father status and provided reunification services with jerry with the intention of obtaining jerry custody.
on the issue of whether should be found to be jerry presumed father and afforded family reunification services,the court received the following evidence.
since the june hearing consistently visited with jerry.the visits began as monitored,once a week,at the foster family agency or the dcfs office.after two weeks was allowed to visit jerry at the foster parents home once a week for two to four hours.when he came for visits,brought diapers,food and toys.he played with jerry,talked to him and told him how much he loved him.also called the foster mother twice a week to check on jerry.
eventually,jerry and the foster mother would go on outings to a shopping mall or the park.the foster mother testified she was always present on these outings but she would allow and jerry to go off on their own for awhile.when returned with jerry the boy always appeared well cared for.recalling the trips to the mall,the foster mother testified buys the baby something every minute of the day if you would let him.but goes every place and buys him something and the baby would have things under each arm.according to the foster mother,is extremely dedicated to this child.
the social worker report acknowledged jerry has been having weekly visits with at the foster parents home.according to the foster parent,these visits have been consistent since july.jerry appears to be in the elementary stages of bonding with his father and is secure and comfortable in his father care.emphasis added.the court also heard evidence that at the beginning of each visit,jerry face brightens when arrives,and the minor appears happy during those visits and he cries at the end of each visit.jerry calls daddy.
by april,had completed classes in parenting and cpr.he had also completed the training for a foster care license but could not obtain one because he did not have his own residence.
the evidence showed during these proceedings for the most part resided at the midnight mission in los angeles where he was employed full time.the midnight mission facility where lived did not accept children as residents.however,it had another facility,near the home of the foster parents,which did accept families.had recently obtained private employment and was earning approximately per week.his plan for accommodating jerry,should he be awarded custody,was to retain jerry in the program he was currently attending.the foster mother had agreed to assist with child care and mother was also available to assist if necessary.he would move to the midnight mission facility which accepts children or to private housing.acknowledged to the social worker jerry had a bond with his foster parents and would have some difficulty coming to live with him.he stated he was open to any services that would help.
told the court i am fully committed to the welfare of jerry.i want what is best for him and will do whatever is necessary to ensure his emotional,physical and financial health and safety.
dna tests showed is not the biological father of jerry.
a juvenile court referee conducted the initial hearing on presumed father status.the court heard argument from counsel for,jerry,and the foster parents,all of whom supported granting presumed father status.only dcfs opposed presumed father status.it urged the court to rule against on the grounds he had not taken jerry into his home and was not the biological father.the court rejected the dcfs arguments.it ruled was the presumed father of jerry and ordered family reunification services.the court gave the following explanation for its decision.the code requires the father to receive the child into his home and openly hold out the child as his natural child he has visited regularly and clearly held himself out to be the father regarding receiving the child into his home,i think that by going to the hospital every day on a daily basis was sic the equivalent of receiving the child into his home and it would seem to me that you should be able to reach the presumed father level without being a biological father.
dcfs immediately petitioned for a rehearing under welfare and institutions code section.the petition was granted and the matter was heard de novo before a judge of the juvenile court 
at the rehearing,the court took judicial notice of the contents of the file including the evidence and argument from the previous hearing.the court also accepted an offer of proof from which essentially summarized his evidence from the previous hearing.the court then heard argument from the parties on status as jerry presumed father.each party took the same position it took in the original hearing with counsel for jerry and the foster parents supporting presumed father status and dcfs opposing it.
this time,however,the court reached a different result.finding had not ever received the child into his home the court denied presumed father status for that reason alone.having found did not meet a necessary requirement for presumed father status the court did not reach the question whether proof was not the biological father prevented him from being the presumed father.the court remarked,however,i think a hard and fast rule like that could lead to inappropriate results.
the court entered an order finding was not jerry presumed father and denying motion for family reunification services.the court set a new date for the selection and implementation hearing.filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
statutory background.
in dependency proceedings,fathers are divided into four categories de facto fathers,alleged fathers,natural fathers and presumed fathers.a man,such as a stepfather,who has assumed the role of parent,is a de facto father.a man who may be the father of the dependent child but has not been established to be the natural or presumed father is an alleged father.a man who has been established to be the biological father is a natural father.a man who has held the child out as his own and received the child into his home is a presumed father.a natural father can be,but is not necessarily,a presumed father and a presumed father can be,but is not necessarily,a natural father.
presumed father status ranks highest.only a statutorily presumed father is entitled to reunification services under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a and custody of his child under welfare and institutions code section 
presumed fatherhood,for purposes of dependency proceedings,denotes one who promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his paternal,financial,and otherwise.as one court put it the purpose of reunification services is to reunite the family in a situation where the best interests of all concerned,the child,the parent and society as a whole,are well served.therefore,w e doubt,in light of the statutory purpose,that the legislature intended to mandate reunification services solely based on the status of being the biological father.for example,we think it highly unlikely the legislature intended to give a right of reunification services to a rapist or an anonymous sperm donor simply because the man is the biological father of the child.
to identify fathers who,by reason of their parenting relationship,are entitled to seek reunification services and custody the legislature borrowed the categories of men who are presumed to be the natural father s of children under family code section hence the term presumed father.section sets out a number of ways a father can obtain presumed father status he can marry or attempt to marry the child mother,he and the mother can execute a declaration of paternity or he can receive the child into his home and openly hold out the child as his natural child.in the present case,attempted to qualify as a presumed father under the latter provision but the attempt failed because he could not prove he had physically brought the child into his home.
contends the scheme for determining presumed father status in dependency proceedings is unconstitutional insofar as it permits the mother or a third party unilaterally to preclude a man from becoming a presumed father by preventing him from receiving the child into his home despite his demonstration of a full commitment to his parental and financial and and after the child birth.for the reasons explained below,we agree.
ii.presumed fatherhood status is not necessarily rebutted by evidence the presumed father is not the natural father.
before addressing constitutional arguments we address a dcfs argument which,if correct,would render constitutional argument moot.dcfs contends even if initially could have been found to satisfy the requirements for presumed father status under section or its equivalent under kelsey discussed in part iii below,his presumed father status was negated by a subsequent blood test conclusively showing he is not jerry natural,biological,father.
dcfs relies on in re olivia which held presumed father status in dependency proceedings can be negated by a blood test showing the presumed father is not the natural father.the court held blood tests establishing nonpaternity constituted clear and convincing evidence rebutting presumed fatherhood status under section,subdivisions a and c,formerly civil code section,subdivision b which state the presumption under section a man is a natural father is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence or by a court decree establishing paternity of the child by another man.
we decline to follow the holding in olivia for several reasons.
first,we disagree with the proposition lack of a biological relationship to the child automatically defeats presumed father status.as previously noted,section,subdivision a states a presumption under section may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.emphasis added.in in re kiana the court interpreted this language as giving the trial court discretion to decide whether proof the presumed father is not the biological father is sufficient to rebut the presumption.the court explained a lthough the results of genetic testing constitute clear and convincing evidence,it does not follow that such evidence will rebut the presumption in every case.rather,the statute seeks to protect presumptions of paternity,once they have arisen,from being set aside except upon clear and convincing evidence and only in an appropriate case.thus,in a case involving two men who met the statutory requirements for being a presumptive father the court affirmed the trial court decision to award presumptive father status to the man who had played a significant parenting role in the child life as opposed to the man who was the child biological father but had never played a part in her life.
furthermore,we do not agree a finding that a man is not the biological father of the child is equivalent to a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.in our view,section,subdivision c contemplates a situation in which a man of flesh and blood,as opposed to a mere hypothetical man,is put forward as the father of the child.otherwise,a child could be precluded from having a loving,nurturing relationship with a committed father by a man the child may never even have met,who may be totally uninterested in the child and who can not obtain presumed father status in his own right.we do not believe the legislature intended to create such a rule.
finally,we question whether,in the dependency context,the courts should even treat presumed fatherhood as an evidentiary presumption.
the primary purpose of section,a part of the uniform parentage act,is to establish a child paternity through a series of rebuttable presumptions in dependency proceedings,however,the purpose of section is not to establish paternity.rather,as discussed above,the purpose is to determine whether the alleged father has demonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities to be afforded rights not afforded to natural rights to reunification services and custody of the child.therefore,in dependency proceedings the term presumed father does not denote a presumption of fatherhood in the evidentiary sense and presumed father status is not rebutted by evidence someone else is the natural father.the supreme court decisions in kelsey and zacharia and the statutory scheme itself support our conclusion.
our supreme court has observed on several occasions presumed father status,when used to connote a father with financial and social ties to the child,is unrelated to natural father status.in kelsey the court stated a man parentage of a child may be undisputed and legally proven,but he may nevertheless fail to be a presumed father conversely,even if paternity is denied and legally disproved,a man may be deemed,under some circumstances,to be a presumed father.although kelsey was an adoption case,it relied on the same categories in section for determining presumed father status as are used in dependency cases.moreover,in zacharia,which was a dependency case,the court noted it is possible for a man to achieve presumed father status,with its attendant rights and duties,without being the biological father.the court observations suggest in the dependency context the term presumed father is not an evidentiary term but a term of convenience used to identify a preferred class of fathers by reference to the familial bonds described in section which the legislature has determined reasonably approximates the class of fathers it wishes to benefit 
the conclusion presumptive fatherhood is not an evidentiary presumption in the dependency context is also clear from the fact that in dependency proceedings a presumed father has greater rights than a natural father.it would not make sense to use the categories in section simply to establish an evidentiary presumption a man is a natural father when being a natural father is a step below being a presumed father.
moreover,if the role of section in a dependency proceeding was merely to establish an evidentiary presumption a man was the child natural father,a man who was already established to be the child natural father before dependency proceedings commenced could never become a presumed father because a presumption under the statute would be unnecessary we fail to see the rationality in a system which would confer more rights on a father when his biological tie to the child is unknown than when it is.
iii.section and the related dependency scheme violate the guarantees of due process and equal protection to the extent they allow a mother or third person unilaterally to preclude a father from becoming a presumed father.
satisfied the requirement of holding the child out as his own.
as previously noted,to qualify as a presumed father under section,subdivision d,a man must satisfy two requirements.he must hold out the child as his own and he must receive the child into his home.
in kelsey the court recognized a man attempting to satisfy the holding out requirement for presumed father status may have been restricted,both legally and as a practical matter,in his ability to act fully as a father.nevertheless,the court stated,the trial court must consider whether petitioner has done all that he could reasonably do under the circumstances.this means o nce the father knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy,he must promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit.in particular,the father must demonstrate a willingness himself to assume full custody of the merely to block adoption by others.the trial court should also consider the father public acknowledgement of paternity,payment of pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so,and prompt legal action to seek custody of the child.
the evidence in this case leaves no doubt established a relationship with jerry before his birth and that this relationship continued through the hearing on presumed father status.
from the beginning,held himself out as jerry father.believed the child was his and told others the mother was pregnant with his child.even after he broke up with jerry mother because of her drug use supplied her with vitamin supplements,bus fare for doctor visits,helped with prenatal care and paid for the mother medications.he was at the hospital when jerry was born and identified himself to hospital staff as the father.he visited and held jerry daily in the hospital.when jerry was taken from the hospital without knowledge he spent months looking for him among the mother relatives.once he reestablished his connection with jerry,never missed a visit,went with him on outings to the shopping mall and the park,provided him with food,diapers and toys and developed a bond with the child,who refers to him as daddy.
without question,promptly came forward and demonstrated a full commitment to jerry,financial and otherwise.
was thwarted by the mother and third parties in his attempt to satisfy the requirement of taking the child into his home.
in kelsey and zacharia the supreme court recognized under section,subdivision d a father who would become a presumed father does not have exclusive control over the means to achieve that status.no matter how loving,caring,giving and nurturing he is,control over a man presumed father status ultimately rests with the mother or in some cases a third party this is because the mother can not be forced to allow the father to take the child into his home in addition,there will be cases where the father can not physically take the child into his home because,for example,the dcfs has taken custody of the child or the child,due to illness or birth defect,must remain in the hospital.
kelsey,an adoption case,addressed the constitutional problems which arise when a mother or third party unilaterally can prevent a man from attaining presumed father status.in adoption proceedings,like dependency proceedings,a man with presumed father status has rights superior to those of a man with mere natural father status.a natural father consent to an adoption of his child by third parties is not required unless the father shows retention of his parental rights is in the child best interest.consent,however,is required from a mother and a presumed father regardless of the child best interest,unless it is shown the mother or presumed father is unfit as a practical matter,the court noted,natural fathers almost never win out over the adoptive parents.if the natural father is to have any realistic chance of retaining his relationship with his child he needs to qualify as a presumed father 
in kelsey,the mother,kari,gave birth to kelsey whose undisputed natural father was rickie kari and rickie never married and rickie never physically took kelsey into his home.two days after kelsey was born,rickie filed a petition to establish his parental relationship with kelsey and to obtain custody.at about this same time kari placed kelsey with prospective adoptive parents.the trial court issued a temporary restraining order awarding care,custody and control of kelsey to rickie.rickie never took custody of kelsey,however,because the prospective adoptive parents secretly removed him from their home.the issue of rickie temporary custody of kelsey became moot a few days later when the court ordered kelsey into the custody of his mother and prohibited visitation by either the prospective adoptive parents or rickie.the court later amended its order to allow rickie to visit kelsey at the women shelter where he was living with his mother in the subsequent adoption proceeding,the trial court ruled rickie was not a presumed father because he had never taken kelsey into his home.
the supreme court granted review to decide whether a natural father federal constitutional rights are violated if his child mother is allowed to unilaterally preclude him from obtaining the same legal right as a presumed father to withhold his consent to his child adoption by third parties.the court held the statutory scheme for determining presumed father status violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process for unwed fathers to the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father.
the court viewed the adoption scheme as discriminating between biological mothers and biological fathers.biological mothers had an absolute right to withhold consent to adoption.biological fathers only had an absolute right to withhold consent to adoption if they were also presumed fathers.a mother,however,could preclude a father from attaining presumed father status by preventing him from taking the child into his home.
the court framed the issue in kelsey as whether the state important interest in the of a child born out of wedlock is substantially furthered by allowing the mother to deny the child biological father an opportunity to form a relationship with the child that would give the father the same statutory rights as the mother or a presumed father in deciding whether the child will be adopted by third parties 
the court concluded there was a lack of any substantial relationship between the state interest in protecting a child and allowing the mother sole control over its destiny by preventing the father from obtaining presumed status.
in reaching this conclusion the court first pointed out there were only two ways a father could achieve presumed father status through marriage to the mother or through receiving the child into his home and holding it out as his own.either method was ultimately in the control of the mother.she could refuse to marry the father and she could deny him the right to take the child into his home the court noted a presumed father,thwarted in his efforts by the mother,could resort to the courts for a custody order.but because such an order was discretionary and could be frustrated by the mother or third parties,the court held its availability did not equalize the father ability to refuse consent to adoption with the mother ability to do so 
the anomalies under this statutory scheme are readily apparent,the court stated.a father who is undisputably ready,willing,and able to exercise the full measure of his parental responsibilities can have his rights terminated merely on a showing that his child best interest would be served by adoption.if the child mother,however,were equally of the opposite,unwilling,and rights in the child could nevertheless be terminated only under the much more protective standards of showing unfitness by clear and convincing evidence.such a distinction bears no substantial relationship to protecting the of children.indeed,it has little rationality.
the court also asserted the system leads to irrational distinctions between fathers based solely on the mother wishes,a model father can be denied presumed father status,whereas a father of dubious ability and intent can achieve such status by the fortuitous circumstance of the mother allowing him to come into her home,even if only a single day under the statutory scheme,two fathers who are by all accounts equal in their ability and commitment to fulfill their parental missions can be treated differently based solely on the mothers decisions whether to allow the father to become a presumed father.
finally,the court found the statutory scheme largely ignore s the child best interest.a child may have a wholly acceptable father who wants to nurture it,but whose parental rights can be terminated because the mother has precluded the father from attaining presumed father status.conversely,if a presumed father is highly questionable in every respect,he is nevertheless allowed to withhold consent absent proof by clear and convincing evidence that he is unfit.
the supreme court remanded the matter to the trial court to determine whether rickie had demonstrated a sufficient commitment to his parental responsibilities to satisfy the holding out element of presumed fatherhood and,if so,to permit him to withhold his consent to kelsey adoption unless the trial court found him an unfit parent 
in zacharia the court noted extending kelsey to dependency proceedings would allow a father who is precluded from attaining presumed father status by the mother or a third party to participate as a parent in,or end the need for,the dependency proceedings.given the facts in zacharia,however,the court stopped short of applying kelsey to a dependency proceeding 
kelsey was subsequently extended to dependency proceedings by the court of appeal in in re julia in that case,the appellate court reversed the trial court orders denying a father reunification services and terminating his parental rights.the facts showed the presumed father did not receive julia into his home because by the time he learned he might be the child father a dependency petition had been filed and julia was already in dcfs custody.nevertheless,the appellate court concluded from the evidence that once on notice father demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities as defined in kelsey and therefore his constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.
although julia undoubtedly reached the correct result the opinion does not explain why the constitutional analysis in kelsey should apply to dependency cases.we believe a brief explanation is appropriate.
important similarities exist between the adoption procedures at issue in kelsey and the dependency procedures at issue in the present case.paternal rights may be terminated in both proceedings and in both proceedings the mother or a third party may preclude the father from obtaining presumed fatherhood status furthermore,the important governmental interest in both proceedings is the of the child 
the constitutional issues in both proceedings also are similar.in the adoption scheme at issue in kelsey only mothers and presumed fathers had the right to withhold consent to adoption in the dependency scheme at issue in the present case,only mothers and presumed fathers have the right to reunification services in both adoption and dependency proceedings,the issue is whether the state important interest in the of the child is substantially furthered by the practice of allowing the mother or a third party to deny a committed father the opportunity to become a presumed father with the same statutory rights as the mother we find this practice no more rational in the dependency context than it was in the adoption context.
like the facts in kelsey,the facts in this case demonstrate a man who has established a loving,nurturing parental relationship with a child can be denied presumed father status because,through no fault of his own,he can not physically bring the child into his home either because the mother,the dcfs,the hospital or a combination of all three have made it impossible for him to do so we recognize there is a possible way around a mother roadblock.the father may be able to obtain a foster care license and then petition the court to place his child in his foster home thereby satisfying the statutory requirement of receiving the child into his home.this circuitous route to presumptive fatherhood,however,does not cure the constitutional defect in the statutory scheme.a foster care license may be denied for reasons which have nothing to do with the father commitment to his parental responsibilities even if the father obtains a foster care license he has no right to have the child placed with him.and further,requiring some fathers to obtain foster care licenses in order to gain presumed father status places a burden on them not borne by mothers or by fathers who have not been prevented from taking their children into their homes.
again,as in kelsey,the anomalies under this statutory scheme are readily apparent.a father like who is undisputably ready,willing and able to exercise his parental responsibilities is denied the right to family reunification services leading to eventual termination of the dependency proceedings and custody of his child while a mother who is unready,unwilling and unable to exercise her parental responsibilities in most cases has a statutory right to those services we fail to see how such a distinction bears any rational relationship to the government interest in the child 
for these reasons it is plain to us that at least with respect to biological fathers section and the related dependency scheme violate the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process to the extent they allow a mother or third person unilaterally to preclude the father from becoming a presumed father where he promptly comes forward and demonstrates as well as he can under the circumstances a full commitment to his parental,financial and otherwise.
is not jerry biological father,however.he is what might best be described as an equitable father.thus,we turn to the question whether the constitutional rights of biological fathers recognized in kelsey should extend to equitable fathers such as 
iv.has a constitutionally protected interest in maintaining his parental relationship with jerry.
dcfs argues kelsey protection should not extend beyond biological fathers but offers no reasons or case authority to support its position.nevertheless,we recognize a colorable argument can be made in defense of this view.
such an argument would begin by pointing out the kelsey opinion itself contains numerous references to the right of a biological father to form a relationship with his child.for example,the court cites the united states supreme court opinion in lehr as recogniz ing the uniqueness of the biological connection between parent and child.the court then quotes lehr statement,t he significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring,arguably implying only biological fathers are entitled to the constitutional protection afforded by its opinion in discussing the best interest of the child,the court again emphasizes the importance of the biological connection between father and child.the child has a genetic bond with its natural parents that is unique among all relationships the child will have throughout its life.in its holding the court also refers to the biological connection between father and child,stating the adoption scheme at issue is unconstitutional to the extent the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father one could argue,therefore,it is not invidious discrimination to provide reunification services to a biological father who has never lived with his child but deny those services to an otherwise similarly situated nonbiological father.
troxel also lends some support to the department argument.in troxel,the court struck down on due process grounds a washington statute which allowed any person to petition the court for visitation rights at any time.under the statute,granville,a single mother,was required to permit her children paternal grandparents to visit the children on a schedule imposed by the trial court.the supreme court held the visitation order made pursuant to the statute,was an unconstitutional infringement on granville fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody and control of her two daughters.it could be argued if a mother fundamental right to make decisions about the custody and control of her child trumps any interest the biological grandparents have in developing a relationship with the child it certainly trumps any interest an unrelated individual has in developing a parental relationship with the child.in some cases the mother may have a perfectly good reason for not allowing the presumed father to take the child into his home may be a crack house or the man may have been convicted or suspected of child molestation,or the mother simply may not want the man to establish a relationship with the child when she knows he is not the biological father.
finally,it is always possible to argue complex political,practical and social considerations,such as the rights of nonbiological fathers,should be left to the legislature 
we find these arguments unpersuasive for the reasons given below.
while kelsey and lehr robertson contain references to the importance of the biological relationship between a father and his child we do not find those references determinative.both cases involved biological fathers and so it was only natural the courts would discuss that biological connection in explaining the reasons for their decisions.as the kelsey opinion itself reminds us,it is the general rule that the language of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case,and the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts.
neither kelsey nor lehr addressed the interests of a nonbiological father in developing or maintaining a relationship with the child nor did they compare those interests to the interests of a biological father.neither case,therefore,provides authority for limiting kelsey protections to biological fathers.
on the other hand,in smith organization of foster families the united states supreme court observed no one would seriously dispute that a deeply loving and interdependent relationship between an adult and a child in his or her care may exist even in the absence of blood relationship.for this reason,the court concluded,a foster parent has at least a limited constitutional liberty interest in maintaining her relationship with the foster child if a foster parent has a liberty interest in maintaining his or her relationship with a foster child,a fortiori a man who has made the kind of parental commitment to a child has made also has a liberty interest in maintaining his relationship with the child.
troxel granville does not call into question liberty interest in maintaining his relationship with jerry.the court in troxel noted there is no allegation that granville ever sought to cut off the grandparents visitation entirely.in contrast,the statutory scheme at issue here allows not only mothers but other third parties to cut off reunification and custody entirely.furthermore,as the court explained in kelsey,whatever the reason behind the mother decision to prevent the man in question from becoming a presumed father it does not provide a legal basis on which to determine the father rights we are confident the juvenile court will not permit visitation or custody with a presumed father who is a convicted child molester or lives in a crack house.
the argument complex political,practical and social issues should be left to the legislature was answered in dawn superior court where justice werdegar explained i f the judiciary is to fulfill its role in our tripartite system of government as the final arbiter of constitutional issues,it can not hope to escape the tension between legislative policy determinations and the challenges raised by those who would seek exceptions thereto.we can,however,while entertaining such challenges,seek to hold the tension in check by always presuming the constitutional validity of legislative acts and resolving doubts in favor of the statute.
here,our supreme court has already made the decision the statutory scheme for determining presumed father status is constitutionally flawed to the extent that the statutes allow a mother unilaterally to preclude her child biological father from becoming a presumed father 
our task is limited to determining whether the holding in kelsey should apply to men who are not biological fathers.the issue is one of standing does a nonbiological father have a constitutionally sufficient interest in his relationship with the child to be entitled to reunification services on the same basis as a kelsey father the issue is not whether nonbiological fathers who have never lived with their children are invidiously discriminated against in the provision of reunification services vis a vis biological fathers who have never lived with their children.does not contend kelsey itself creates an unconstitutional classification.rather,the issue is whether a nonbiological father may have a sufficient liberty interest in his relationship with the child to have standing to challenge the irrational statutory scheme identified in kelsey 
for the reasons set forth below,we hold kelsey protection should extend to men such as who have demonstrated their commitment to parental responsibility by meeting the conditions set forth in that opinion,none of which depends on biology.
in explaining the reasons for our holding,it bears repeating there is no requirement in section,subdivision d the presumed father be the biological father.the statute simply states a man becomes a presumed father if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.emphasis added.thus,there are possibly hundreds if not thousands of nonbiological presumed fathers carrying out parental responsibilities today.
more importantly,the conditions for protection under kelsey do not depend on biology.rather,a man is entitled to protection from invidious discrimination in attempting to attain presumed father status if once he knows or reasonably should know of the pregnancy,he promptly attempt s to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit,and is indisputably ready,willing,and able to exercise the full measure of his parental responsibilities emotional,financial,and otherwise.as discussed above,clearly meets these requirements.
we are also mindful of the legislative command we consider the best interests of the minor in all deliberations under the dependency law in our view,it is decidedly not in the best interest of the child to deny a man who has been part of the child life since before birth and who meets all the other requirements stated above the opportunity to enjoy the blessings of the relationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child development simply because more than a year after birth a blood test shows the man is not the child father.
as adults we must not forget what every child relationship is not spun from dna rather,it stems from the emotional attachments which derive from the intimacy of contact between the parent and child the countless gestures,large and small,that repeatedly reaffirm i see you,i love you i am yours,you are mine.
disposition 
the order denying reunification services is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion 
perluss,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
i concur in section ii of the majority opinion,holding as a matter of statutory interpretation that a finding of paternity does not necessarily defeat presumed father status under family code section,subdivision d i also agree in general with much of the analysis in section,holding that in appropriate cases the constitutional rights of unwed biological fathers recognized in adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey extend to dependency least insofar as those proceedings involve the potential termination of the father parental rights.see in re zacharia cal th,d.however,i respectfully dissent from the judgment reversing the order denying reunification services in this case because i believe substantial evidence supports findings by the juvenile court that demonstrate failed to satisfy the standard set forth in kelsey 
the juvenile court found failed to come forward promptly in the dependency proceedings 
the indispensable prerequisite for a finding that a man is a kelsey father is that,both before and after birth,he promptly attempt to assume his parental responsibilities as fully as the mother will allow and his circumstances permit.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.for kelsey to be applied in the dependency context,the father must come forward early in the dependency process.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d,father who did not appear until month review hearing under welf,failed to demonstrate commitment consistent with the standard set forth in kelsey.
as discussed in the majority opinion,had daily contact with jerry at the hospital in the period immediately following his birth.however,in denying request for reunification services,the juvenile court found that,although aware of the pending dependency case,failed to come forward promptly the court specifically found had received appropriate notice for the disposition hearing held on february,but did not appear in court until the june,hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,some four months later.in concluding that significantly delayed his appearance in the dependency proceedings,the juvenile court necessarily found the factual predicate for applying kelsey was absent even assuming it could be extended to this type of case under appropriate circumstances.
the juvenile court findings are supported by substantial evidence 
the juvenile court findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.in re tanis th,d.those findings can not be disturbed if there is any solid,credible evidence in favor of the ruling,giving benefit to every reasonable inference in favor of the prevailing party and resolving all conflicts in support of the court ruling.ibid.
in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,our review requires that all reasonable inferences be given to support the findings and orders of the juvenile court and the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to those orders.citation.those findings and orders may not be disturbed if they are supported by substantial evidence.citations.as stated issues of fact and credibility are questions of fact for the trial court,not this court.citation.the rule is clear that the power of the appellate courts begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the conclusion reached by the trier of fact.citation.citation.in re tania th,d.
under this deferential standard,the findings underlying the juvenile court denial of reunification services to should be affirmed.those findings are supported not only by the evidence of delay in appearing in the dependency proceedings,emphasized in the juvenile court ruling,but also by evidence before the court that had initially refused to cooperate in the dependency case by providing his residence address to dcfs,failed to attend or cancel a scheduled visit with jerry in december and in january,following telephone contact with dcfs,failed to keep an appointment with the social worker to discuss jerry situation.
in light of the juvenile court findings,it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue raised by 
because i would affirm the juvenile court orders based on its factual determinations,i need not resolve the difficult constitutional issue at the core of the majority opinion whether an individual who is neither the child biological father nor a statutorily presumed father but who has nonetheless demonstrated a strong commitment to parenting the child has a constitutional right to reunification services even though the legislature has declined to provide for such services 
were i to consider that question,however,i would want to address at least the following issues,not all of which are fully discussed in the majority opinion 
in light of the legislature creation of a statutory category of presumed fathers in family code section,subdivision d that does not require a direct genetic relationship with the child,what is the significance,if any,of such a relationship to the required constitutional analysis is it arbitrary or irrational to provide reunification services to a biological father who has demonstrated his commitment to parenting but has never lived with his child while denying such services to an otherwise similarly situated nonbiological father in this regard,i would necessarily consider the language from the united states supreme court decision in lehr robertson,d,referred to in the majority opinion,that the significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring.see also kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,a biological father has a constitutionally cognizable opportunity interest in developing a relationship with his child.
the statutory scheme considered constitutionally impermissible in kelsey was one that differentiated between the rights of a child biological father and his or her biological mother regarding termination of parental rights.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,the statutory scheme at issue violates the federal constitutional guarantees of equal protect
