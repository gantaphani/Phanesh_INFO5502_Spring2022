this is an appeal by a mother from an order terminating her parental rights.welf.we affirm.
background 
appellant child was born on december.according to hospital records,the mother came in off the street in labor.she was dirty and disoriented and uncooperative,but the child was delivered without problem.the child was premature and had a cleft palate,inhibiting the ability to nurse.after the delivery,the mother was noted to be very anxious and paranoid and suffering from hallucinations.both the mother and child tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine,with ratings indicating very recent use.the child was placed in the intensive care nursery.according to hospital records,the mother condition and behavior caused the hospital to call a mental health facility,which was familiar with the mother and responded she was not schizophrenic,but did suffer from psychosis secondary to polysubstance abuse.the hospital mental health staff determined the mother was not a threat to herself or others,but reported she was uncooperative and would not follow any recommendations for treatment.a friend of the family told nursing staff the mother had been homeless for four years,and had a history of psychiatric disorders and alcohol abuse.
a petition was filed on december,alleging a failure to protect and a lack of provision for support.the petition was supported by the report of a social worker for the county human services agency the agency.the mother had told the hospital social worker she had handled her own prenatal care.she also said she had had regular prenatal care,but she refused to sign a release that would allow the social worker to confirm that claim.she stated she had a place to live,but gave several different stories about where she was living.she did not know who the child father was,explaining she had had a sexual encounter with a man but did not know his name.she refused to sign a medical release for the child.the social worker also reported the mother had another child,who had been detained in after the mother had been arrested for being under the influence of methamphetamine.the mother parental rights in that child were terminated in,and the child has been adopted.
the mother and her attorney appeared at a hearing held on january.the juvenile court,at the request of the mother attorney,and after discussing the matter with the mother,appointed a guardian ad litem for the mother,and set the matter over to february,for the jurisdictional hearing.the mother appeared with the guardian ad litem and her attorney on february.her attorney informed the court the guardian ad litem had explained to the mother her right to contest the jurisdictional report and the consequences of submitting the matter on the report,and the mother had agreed to submit the matter on the report.the court discussed the matter with the mother,who,while complaining that the report was inaccurate and stating a concern that the child was being put up for adoption,confirmed she had spoken with the guardian ad litem and had agreed that the matter should be submitted on the report the court found the allegations of the petition to be true,and exercised jurisdiction over the child.the mother had told the social worker she had no indian ancestry,but at the hearing the mother asserted her mother father is full,almost indian.the court therefore ruled the indian child welfare act et.icwa might apply.the mother provided the court with a permanent mailing address,which the court ruled would be used for purposes of notice unless or until the mother provided written notice of a new permanent mailing address.
the matter was put over to february.the mother had been notified of the hearing,but failed to appear.the mother attorney and the guardian ad litem were present,as were the attorneys for the child and for the agency.the mother attorney requested a contested hearing,which was set for march.
the mother did not appear at the march,dispositional hearing.by this time,the mother visitation with the child had been suspended,as it had been determined her behavior during scheduled visits posed a high risk of safety to the child and to the social worker monitoring the visits the social worker reported she had spoken to the mother by telephone,informing her of the date of the hearing.the guardian ad litem reported she had been attempting to reach the mother by telephone,using three different numbers that had been provided to her.three weeks previously,she had reached a man named ron who said he was going to have anything to do with the mother.the guardian ad litem also reached the maternal grandmother,who stated she had no idea where the mother was,but said her home was always a resource for the mother.the mother had never contacted the guardian ad litem,but the friend,ron,had delivered an envelope of handwritten notes from the mother that morning.the guardian ad litem had urged him to have the mother show up for the hearing.the guardian ad litem and the mother attorney then submitted the matter on the agency report and recommendations.the guardian ad litem signed a waiver of rights on the mother behalf.
the court found reunification services had been terminated in connection with the mother older child because the parents had failed to reunify with that child and the mother had not made reasonable efforts to treat the problems that had caused the child to be removed from her care and custody.the court also found the mother had a history of extensive,abusive and chronic use of drugs or alcohol,and had resisted prior treatment for the problem during the period immediately prior to the filing of the petition in this case.it found the mother had received actual and constructive notice of the proceedings,but had voluntarily absented herself from them.it found the mother had made no progress toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating removal of the child from her custody.the court ruled reunification efforts would not benefit the child or be in the child best interests.it set the matter over for a section selection and implementation hearing.
the selection and implementation hearing was held on july.the mother was present,as were her attorney and the guardian ad litem.the child had been living with a foster family for several months,had adjusted well and was responding positively to all the family members.the foster parents wished to adopt her.the mother attorney reported the guardian ad litem had informed her the mother had requested a new attorney,a new guardian ad litem and a new judicial officer.the guardian ad litem had instructed the attorney to submit the matter to the court with the mother comments.the court discussed the situation with the mother,telling her it was not going to step down,was going to deny the mother requests and would be accepting the direction of the guardian ad litem to submit the matter on the agency report.the court found it likely the child would be adopted and that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to the child.it therefore terminated the mother parental rights and ordered a permanent plan of adoption.
discussion 
of guardian ad litem 
the mother claims error in the appointment of the guardian ad litem.
as a threshold matter,we agree with the parties that the mother did not forfeit her right to make this claim by failing to attack the appointment by writ.see in re joann th,d joann and in re jessica th,d jessica.
as applied to dependency cases,section of the code of civil procedure requires the appointment of a guardian ad litem if a parent is incompetent.in re sara th,d sara a parent is incompetent if the parent is unable to understand the proceedings or can not assist the attorney in protecting the parent interests in the companionship,custody,control and maintenance of the child.in re enrique th,d enrique jessica,supra,th at,d sara,supra,th at,d.when the court has knowledge of the parent incompetency,its failure to appoint a guardian ad litem is error.in re lisa d.but case law also has established it is error,and a denial of due process,to appoint a guardian ad litem if the parent has not agreed to the appointment or is not truly incompetent,because the effect of the appointment is to remove the control of litigation from the parent.in re th,d in re daniel th,d daniel joann,supra,th at,d jessica,supra,at,d sara,supra,at,d.there is a split in authority as to the nature of the error.most courts require reversal only if the reviewing court can not say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.enrique,supra,at,d joann,supra,at,d sara,supra,at,d.there also is authority for holding the error to be structural,requiring reversal of subsequent orders even without a showing of resulting prejudice,supra,at,d.
due process 
the parent due process rights are satisfied if the parent consents to the appointment of a guardian ad litem or,if the parent does not consent,the court holds an informal hearing in which the parent has an opportunity to explain why a guardian ad litem is not required.enrique,supra,th at,d daniel,supra,th at,d.it has been held that at the informal hearing,the court or the parent attorney must explain the purpose of a guardian ad litem,why counsel believes the appointment is necessary,and what authority the parent will be ceding to the guardian ad litem.the parent must be given the opportunity to respond.enrique,supra,at,d jessica,supra,th at,d.at a minimum,the court should make an inquiry sufficient to satisfy it that the parent is,or is not,competent,whether the parent understands the nature of the proceedings and can assist the attorney in protecting rights.sara,supra,th at,d enrique,supra,at,d jessica,supra,at,d.
the court here conducted an informal hearing.the mother attorney told the court the mother had been uncooperative,failing to show up for an appointed meeting and on other occasions leaving messages she was too emotionally upset to meet with the attorney.as result,the attorney had been unable to meet with the mother prior to the date of the hearing.the mother then suggested a new attorney be appointed for her like maybe pat lansdowne somebody that wants to represent me.because,obviously,we do she does like me,so i feeling little bit insecure from the.the mother attorney stated she had spoken with lansdowne,who was available and willing to be the mother guardian ad litem.the court explained to the mother,the attorney is asking that this court,if it appoints lansdowne,that she would essentially be a person to assist you and to act on your behalf in this matter in coordination with the attorney because the attorney is claiming that you are not able to fully understand and grasp what is going on here.the mother disagreed with the attorney assessment.the attorney explained the mother emotional state alternated from high to low,making it difficult to speak to her or to get her to do something she said she would do.
the court stated a guardian ad litem will be appointed where there is inability to cooperate meaningfully with counsel because of whatever condition is in existence.it asked if there was any evidence of the need for the appointment besides the mother emotional ups and downs and instability.the court also asked the mother about the proceedings leading to the termination of her rights in her other child.the mother did not appear to understand what the court was asking,and spoke instead about the difficulties she had experienced trying to reach her attorney.the court asked the agency attorney for his comments.the attorney began to talk about the earlier case,but was interrupted by the mother who complained that neither she nor her other child wanted the child to be talked about.the agency attorney then spoke about the agency contacts with the mother,stating the social worker also had asked that a guardian ad litem be appointed and had expressed concern about the mother ability to understand and participate in the proceedings.the attorney asserted the mother had experienced difficulty understanding the court questions in a previous proceeding,and also in understanding a standard letter from the agency.on numerous occasions the mother conversations with the social worker indicated she was confused and disoriented.she had been late for visits and meetings.on one occasion the social worker had written down for the mother the date and time of a visit,but within five minutes the mother had called from the parking lot,acting as if the conversation never had taken place.
the court told the mother it was thinking of appointing lansdowne to assist her.but it she would not technically be your lawyer.she would technically be kind of like consulting with your attorney on your behalf if you were not percent aware of everything that you needed to be aware of.in other words,lansdowne would be empowered to speak with you and then act in your interests as more as like a client than as a lawyer for you.so is that something that you would feel would be beneficial to you the mother replied,i pretty much understand.i just feel that we have had enough time to discuss anything,but i think that that might be better because i do think she understanding me.so that would probably be better.
the mother position is that she did not agree to the appointment because its consequences had not been explained to her.she argues,further,the evidence did not establish she suffered from a condition rendering her unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to assist her attorney,justifying an involuntary appointment.she complains that in deciding to appoint a guardian ad litem,the court improperly considered hearsay evidence contained in the agency report or asserted by the agency attorney.see sara,supra,th at,d,questioning whether the multiple hearsay in social studies would be admissible to determine whether an adult is incompetent.the mother also contends no weight should be given to the trial court personal observation of the mother.
we are troubled by what appears to be the view that the appointment of a guardian ad litem is an act adverse to a parent,depriving the parent of the ability to present his or her case.a guardian ad litem is appointed to protect the parent rights,and to act on the parent behalf.the guardian may make tactical and even fundamental decisions affecting the litigation,but always with the interest of the guardian charge in mind.in re christina th,d christina and see in re josiah cal th,d.in civil matters,the guardian is an officer of the court,and,like any other officer,is subject to court supervision.regency health services,superior court th,d.where the guardian exceeds his or her powers,so that the parent is deprived of some fundamental right,reversal is required.ibid.but we can see no reason to reverse when the guardian ad litem,although erroneously appointed,presents the parent case when the parent has absented herself from the proceedings and can not or will not act on her own behalf.we also see no reason to assume a guardian ad litem has abandoned the role of guardian,has ignored the parent wishes and has failed to protect or advance the parent interests,or that the trial court ignored its own responsibility to oversee the guardian conduct.finally,while it is always possible the guardian ad litem,in attempting to protect the parent interests,acts against the parent wishes,it is difficult to see how that action could lead to reversible error if it did not compromise the parent case.
in addition,whether due process is served requires more than a consideration of the parent interests.as the court in sara,recognized,due process is a flexible concept which requires balancing of several factors,including the private interest that will be affected by the official action,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,the interest in informing individuals of the nature,grounds and consequences of the action and in enabling them to present their side of the story,and the governmental interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.sara,supra,th at,d.and see in re sade cal th,d,recognizing the state interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child and a fiscal and administrative interest
