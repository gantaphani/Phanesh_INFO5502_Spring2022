factual and procedural background 
our factual summary is derived from appellant complaint,and the matters judicially noticed,specifically,certain pleadings and the transcript from the january,hearing january hearing in the underlying alameda county superior court family law action captioned bergeron bergeron,no.holland morse diesel,th.
appellant original complaint against respondent was filed on february.it alleged causes of action for breach of contract,negligence,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.respondent filed a demurrer to that complaint on the grounds that the acts complained of were privileged both under the and litigation privileges.the demurrer was sustained on both grounds.however,the trial court granted appellant leave to amend her complaint.
a first amended complaint fac was filed on august,again stating the same three causes of action against respondent.more specifically,the fac alleged that appellant and her estranged spouse were engaged in a contentious marital dissolution and custody dispute which involved their two young children.as part of those proceedings,the family law court ordered the parties to retain a child custody evaluator who could conduct an evaluation relating to the issue of custody,and make recommendations to the court.as a result,respondent was hired to perform unbiased testing of the parties,toxicology tests when necessary,and to produce a report.this custody evaluation was to be performed under the guise of being appointed a court retained expert pursuant to california evidence code section.respondent was paid by each side for these services.however,instead of preparing a professional,unbiased evaluation,the fac alleged that respondent failed in six enumerated ways to perform as promised,including his failure to be appointed as the court expert under evidence code section 
in addition to the alleged misconduct concerning the preparation of the custody evaluation,the fac also alleged that respondent usurp ed the actual lawful authority of the court by issuing what he called interim child custody orders.because of this misfeasance,appellant alleged that she was deprived of contact with her minor children for almost seven months,or until the court reversed the respondent orders.
as a result of respondent alleged misconduct,the fac alleged appellant suffered extreme emotional distress incurred costs in hiring a visitation supervisor during the six months she was deprived of unsupervised visitation with her children and suffered monetary damages consisting of legal fees and expenses,and lost wages.
respondent filed a demurrer to the fac asserting again the and litigation privileges as absolute defenses to the claims.at respondent request,the trial court took judicial notice of the pleadings in the underlying family law case.one such pleading in the family law matter was a minute order following the january hearing at which the parties were specifically ordered by the family law judge to comply with any interim orders to be issued by respondent.
the hearing transcript from that session,which was also judicially noticed,reflects a discussion concerning appellant visitation schedule.appellant argued that she was effectively being denied visitation with her children because the existing visitation schedule gave her custody between and monday through friday,and her new work schedule prevented her from being able to visit her children during the daytime.
in light of appellant work schedule,the trial judge concluded in the meantime that appellant should have custody on weekends.however,the court made several references to the power of respondent to issue further orders modifying the visitation schedule pending a future review by the family law court of the issue.at one point,the court stated this authority more explicitly the authority for respondent to modify the custody orders remains in effect.if he decides to make interim orders that are at variance with what i about to do,he retains that authority.and that means you need to comply with any interim modifications to custody he may communicate,or come back to court and ask that i look at what his interim orders are.all right.so i want to be clear about that.so if he at the house and it causes him concern this weekend and he says,i do think the children should be there overnight,then everyone has to understand that you going to comply with that,pending further court orders.
nothing in the record indicates that appellant objected to the original appointment of respondent,nor to the apparent authority given to him to issue interim custody orders.furthermore,at no point during the january hearing did appellant object to respondent authority to continue issuing interim custody orders modifying custody.
a final custody order was not filed until february.between january,and the issuance of the order,the court conducted at least eight hearings on the subject of custody during that month period,appellant made no attempt to set aside any interim custody order by respondent.while the matter originally had been submitted on september,additional testimony and arguments of counsel were subsequently heard,and the matter was not finally submitted until october.
the february,custody order is contained in a page statement of decision.much of the recitation of the court findings are not relevant to the sole issue now raised on appeal.the order granted the parties joint legal custody of their two minor children.in order to avoid potential disagreements about the timing and circumstances of physical custody,the statement of decision detailed how the parties were to divide the time of physical custody,including provisions for custody during school days,overnights,vacations,holidays,and access by telephone.
after briefing relating to respondent demurrer to the fac was completed,the court issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,again on the grounds that the acts complained of were privileged under the privilege.appellant filed a written objection to the tentative ruling on december.while her objection included the statement that if the court is incline sic to grant the demurrer,than sic i do seek leave of court to amend the pleadings,appellant offered no suggestion as to how she might amend the complaint to state a legally cognizable claim against respondent.
the demurrer to the fac was sustained in an order dated december,this time without leave to amend.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
the principle case authority discussing the evolution of the common law privilege in california,and one factually similar to the instant case,is howard drapkin d howard.in howard,the defendant was a psychologist who was sued by a disgruntled court litigant after performing a child custody evaluation.after tracing the history and rationale for the common law development of a privilege,the court of appeal concluded that persons performing acts that are judicial in nature are protected by the privilege.in making this determination,the court emphasized that it is the act performed,not the title of the person performing it,which is determinative so also,in determining whether a person is acting in a fashion,the courts look at the nature of the duty performed to determine whether it is a judicial act not the name or classification of the officer who performs it,and many who are properly classified as executive officers are invested with limited judicial powers.pearson reed d.howard,supra,at.
turning to the function of the family law custody evaluator in that case,the howard court rejected the plaintiff attempt to analogize the action to one for professional malpractice in contrast,the psychologist who is mediating a child custody dispute,whether by court appointment or not,is not an advocate for either parent,even if paid by them.citation.the job of third parties such as mediators,conciliators and evaluators involves impartiality and neutrality,as does that of a judge,commissioner or referee hence,there should be entitlement to the same immunity given others who function as neutrals in an attempt to resolve disputes.in a sense,those persons are similar to a judge who is handling a voluntary or mandatory settlement conference,no matter whether they are making binding decisions such as referees acting pursuant to code civ,subd,and arbitrators,making recommendations to the court such as referees acting under code civ,or mediators acting under,or privately attempting to settle disputes,such as the defendant here.we therefore hold that absolute immunity is properly extended to these neutral third parties for their conduct in performing dispute resolution services which are connected to the judicial process and involve either the making of binding decisions,the making of findings or recommendations to the court or the arbitration,mediation,conciliation,evaluation or other similar resolution of pending disputes.as the defendant was clearly engaged in this latter activity,she is entitled to the protection of such immunity.howard,supra,d at.
recently,this court applied the privilege to a private arbitrator who allegedly failed to disclose a potentially disqualifying conflict of interest.weisbach,supra,th.in so holding,we accepted the underlying rationale in howard that in determining whether absolute immunity applies to the conduct of a public or private arbitrator,courts must look at the nature of the duty performed,and not to the name or classification of the person who performs it.id.at.
more recently,in mcclintock west th mcclintock,our colleagues in the fourth district court of appeal affirmed the application of the privilege to immunize a guardian ad litem appointed in a family law case from claims of negligence,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.like here,in mcclintock,a guardian ad litem,who was appointed by the court to represent the interests of one of the parties to a divorce proceeding,was sued when the guardian actions allegedly resulted in financial losses and the loss of custody of the conservatee children.
the mcclintock court affirmed the sustaining of a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend,largely following the rationale of howard.in so doing,the court reflected rhetorically on some of the very same public policy considerations that supported application of the privilege in howard,and which are equally applicable here if the guardian had known she might be subject to liability for causes of action ranging from negligence to intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,resulting in the potential for years of litigation and financial liability greater than her entire fee for handling the case,would she have ever agreed to the appointment why would any qualified person ever accept appointment as a guardian ad litem when his or her decisions could be subject to such post hoc second guessing moreover,in addition to the difficulty of finding anyone to accept such an assignment,the risk of liability could impact how the guardian ad litem carried out her role.as we discussed ante,the guardian ad litem does not advocate for her ward in the way an attorney does her job is acting in the ward best interests,and the ward might not always agree with the guardian ad litem decisions.her ability to act would be compromised if the threat of future liability encouraged a guardian ad litem to put a ward wishes above his interests.howard,supra,d at.mcclintock,supra,th at,italics omitted.
nevertheless,appellant here contends that only judicial officers may issue custody orders under state law,and respondent was utterly without jurisdiction in doing so.therefore,no judicial privilege for conduct can attach to acts lacking in lawful jurisdiction.
we agree that the family law court has the sole power to determine whether visitation will occur.ruisi thieriot th,in re marriage of matthews d.however,even accepting appellant argument that the family court exceeded its legal authority,or even jurisdiction,to delegate custody supervision to respondent,that does not vitiate application of the privilege.
in its decision in howard,the court pointed out the need that judicial immunity be broad and applicable to all actions regardless of whether the judicial officer exceeded his or her legal authority or jurisdiction to act the concept of judicial immunity is and absolute,with its roots in english common law.it bars civil actions against judges for acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions and it applies to all judicial determinations,including those rendered in excess of the judge jurisdiction,no matter how erroneous or even malicious or corrupt they may be.citations.the judge is immune unless he sic has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.citations.citation.howard,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
as the howard court explained later in its opinion,it is the function being exercised by the immunized individual that is the focus of the privilege application and not the status o
