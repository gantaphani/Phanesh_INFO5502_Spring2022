this case poses the question whether a person in a relationship,who encourages her partner to give birth to a child via artificial insemination and who then holds out the child as her own,can be required to pay child support after she and her partner split up.
while together as partners in a relationship,elisa and emily each gave birth to a child conceived by artificial insemination.elisa delivered a boy,and emily had twins,a girl and a boy.they selected the children names together,hyphenated the women last names as the children surname,and considered them to be children of both women.in emily words,they agreed that she would be the mother and that elisa would be the primary breadwinner for the family.providing financial support and medical insurance coverage for them,elisa claimed all three children as dependants for income tax purposes.in time,the women relationship soured and they split up.elisa agreed to provide financial support for emily twins when she could and made monthly payments of.almost a year and a half later,elisa stopped sending money and stopped seeing the twins because she did not want to have to deal with emily due to the tension between them.
emily was now receiving public assistance for the twins,and the county of el dorado the county filed an action to establish that elisa is a parent of the twins and to impose a child support obligation based upon elisa alleged income of over a month.elisa opposed the action on the grounds inter alia that she is not the other parent of the twins,a lesbian partner who is neither the biological nor adoptive parent is not entitled to custody of children conceived during a bilateral relationship,and s ince the court can not award custody or visitation of the twins to her,the court can not order her to pay child support for those same children.
the trial court found that elisa is accountable as a de facto legal parent for the support of the twins and also that because she consented to the creation of these children and encouraged their creation,she is precluded by principles of promissory or equitable estoppel from disclaiming financial responsibility for them.
elisa filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court,seeking to compel the trial court to vacate its support order and to dismiss the action.she contends the trial court has no authority to order a lesbian partner in a relationship to pay child support when the partner is not the biological or adoptive mother of the children.according to elisa,a parental obligation of support may not be imposed on her because she is not a parent under the uniform parentage act the upa,et further section references are to the family code unless otherwise specified,and the court erred in concluding she is estopped from disclaiming responsibility for the financial support of the children.moreover,she argues,imposing a support obligation on her violates principles of equal protection of law because it places a greater burden on her than on a unmarried man whose partner conceives a child through artificial insemination.
we issued an alternative writ and stayed the trial court order.we now conclude that a peremptory writ of mandate should issue directing the trial court to vacate its order and to enter judgment in favor of elisa.
as we will explain,we conclude that elisa is not a parent of the twins within the meaning of the upa and,thus,the upa can not be used to impose a child support obligation on her.and she is not entitled to the parental rights and obligations provided by recent registered domestic partners legislation because it does not become effective until january,and in any event,she and emily were not registered domestic partners.furthermore,elisa is not estopped from disclaiming financial responsibility for the twins under the circumstances of this case.accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment.
background 
elisa and emily moved in together in august and maintained an exclusive relationship.they exchanged rings to symbolize their union,and elisa had the words emily por vida emily for life tattooed on her arm.the women set up a joint bank account and pooled their resources for household expenses.
elisa wanted to share her life with emily and have children.both women wanted to experience childbirth.they discarded the idea of using a private sperm donor because he potentially would have parental rights to custody and visitation.thus,they chose a fertility clinic together,and elisa began the insemination process in.after elisa became pregnant,emily began the process using the same sperm donor so their children would be related.most of the inseminations occurred at the clinic,but on one occasion,elisa inseminated emily in their home using the donor sperm.
emily and elisa attended each other childbirth classes and medical appointments,and were present at the birth of each other children.elisa gave birth to a boy in,and emily gave birth to twins in.the women jointly chose the children names and gave them a hyphenated surname,which was a combination of their own surnames.they did this so the children would be considered a family and the children of both of the women.the women all three children and pumped breast milk for any child to use as necessary.elisa considers herself and emily to both be the mothers of all the children.
prior to the children births,emily and elisa talked with an attorney because they wanted to adopt each other child.but they did not follow through on the idea.
after the twins were born,emily did not return to work.as the women had agreed,she stayed at home with a nanny to care for all the children.elisa,who was the higher wage earner,provided financial support for the family,paid for dependent medical insurance coverage for the three children,and claimed them as dependants for income tax purposes.
elisa testified she never agreed emily would be a mom forever rather,the plan was for emily to return to work in a few years and for the children to go to daycare.according to elisa,the women did not have any financial discussions about child support until after they separated.
six years after they began living together,they separated in november.emily and the twins remained in the house owned by elisa,who continued to pay the mortgage and agreed to help out emily financially when she could.after the house was sold in november,emily and the twins moved to an apartment and elisa orally agreed to pay emily a month for support although emily thought this support agreement was indefinite,she conceded that they did not discuss how long elisa would provide financial assistance.however,according to emily,elisa did say that she would always provide a home for emily and the children.
in may,elisa informed emily that she was no longer a employee and that she would not be able to assist emily anymore because all of elisa resources were needed to support herself and her son.
in june,the county filed a complaint regarding parental obligations against elisa to establish her parentage of the twins and to impose a child support obligation for them pursuant to section because the twins were receiving public assistance 
the trial court ruled that because elisa intended to create children with emily and used reproductive technology to do so,elisa was accountable for supporting the twins as a de facto legal parent.in the court view,elisa should be held to the same legal duty and responsibility of a man found to be a presumed father under the upa.the court also held that a support obligation was appropriate pursuant to principles of promissory or equitable estoppel.accordingly,it ordered elisa to pay child support of per month for each child,for a monthly total of.
discussion 
elisa contends she is not a parent of the twins within the meaning of the upa and,thus,she does not have any of the rights or obligations arising from the parent and child relationship,she has no legal obligation to pay child support for the twins.
the upa,which provides a comprehensive scheme for judicial determination of paternity,adoption of michael cal th,d,also is utilized in resolving questions of maternity,subd.a in re karen th,d hereafter karen.
as used in the upa,the term p arent and child relationship means the legal relationship existing between a child and the child natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights,privileges,duties,and obligations.the term includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.johnson calvert cal th,d,hereafter johnson.this legal relationship encompasses two kinds of parents,natural and adoptive,and extends equally to every child and to every parent,regardless of the marital status of the parents.
in the past,there was rarely a question concerning the identity of a child mother she was the woman who gave birth to or adopted the child.however,technological advances have made many variations of motherhood possible.for example,it is possible for one woman to provide the genetic material necessary for reproduction and for another woman to gestate and give birth to the child.b oth genetic consanguinity and giving birth are means of establishing a mother and child relationship johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
yet for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother,despite advances in reproductive technology rendering a different outcome biologically possible.johnson,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.therefore,when the two means genetic consanguinity and giving birth do not coincide in one woman,she who intended to procreate the is,she who intended to bring about the birth of a child that she intended to raise as her the natural mother under california law.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
here,elisa has no genetic consanguinity with the twins,she did not give birth to them,and she has not adopted them.in contrast,emily conceived the twins by artificial insemination and gave birth to them with the intent of raising them as her own.accordingly,emily is the natural mother of the fact that neither she nor elisa has elisa has no legal maternal relationship with the children under the upa because for any child california law recognizes only one natural mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
since elisa is not the twins natural mother and,for obvious reasons,she is not their father,and because she did not adopt the twins,elisa does not have any of the rights,privileges,duties,or obligations of a parent under the upa.this conclusion is consistent with prior decisions regarding the parental status of a lesbian with respect to the children of her former lesbian partner.
for example,in curiale reagan d.hereafter curiale,a woman unsuccessfully sought to establish de facto parental status to assert rights of custody visitation with the child of her former lesbian partner.id.at.this court held that although the upa confers standing upon any interested person to bring an action to establish the existence of a relationship former,t he legislature has not conferred upon one in plaintiff position,a woman who did not have a biological or adoptive relationship with the child of her former partner in a relationship,any right of custody or visitation upon the termination of the relationship.curiale,supra,d at.accord,west superior court th,d hereafter west.
likewise,nancy michele d.hereafter nancy held that a lesbian who was not the natural or adoptive mother of her former partner two children could not establish the existence of a relationship under the upa even if she helped facilitate the conception and birth of both children and immediately after their birth assumed all the responsibilities of a parent.id.at.
those decisions pointed out that given the complex practical,social and constitutional ramifications of expanding the class of persons entitled to assert parental rights under the upa,this public policy decision should be left to the legislature.west,supra,th at,d nancy,supra,d at.curiale,supra,d at.the same must be said for the expansion of the class of persons responsible for parental obligations.
faced with this established case law holding that a partner in a relationship lacks parental rights with respect to the other partner children and is not a parent under the upa,the legislature has not amended the upa to provide otherwise.but in,the legislature added section to the family code,which states the rights and obligations of registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of spouses.the rights and obligations of former or surviving registered domestic partners with respect to a child of either of them shall be the same as those of former or surviving spouses.stats,ch.assem.bill,operative.
section does not apply to this case because it is not effective until january,and in any event,there is no evidence that elisa and emily ever registered as domestic partners with the secretary of state,which is a prerequisite to the application of section.consequently,we must apply the parental definitions set forth in the upa.
in sum,because elisa is not the twins natural mother and because,for obvious reasons,she is not their father,she does not have any of the rights and privileges of a parent under the upa.since elisa is not a parent under the upa for purposes of enjoying parental rights,she is not a parent for purposes of the obligations imposed by the upa,including child support.
the county contends that curiale,nancy,and west are no longer good law in light of two more recent cases,in re nicholas cal th,d,hereafter nicholas and karen,supra,th,d.
in the county view,nicholas and karen support a determination that elisa is a presumed parent under section,subdivision d,even though she is not biologically related to the twins and the statutory language in section indicates it applies to paternity determinations,and as a presumed parent,elisa has an obligation to support the twins.we disagree.
in nicholas,thomas,a man seeking to establish paternity,conceded that he was not the biological father of nicholas.but thomas was listed as the father on the birth certificate,received nicholas into his home,and openly raised him as his natural child.thomas sought to establish paternity pursuant to the presumption of paternity set forth in section,subdivision d d.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.section d provides that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.the court of appeal concluded that pursuant to section,the presumption of paternity was rebutted by thomas concession that he is not nicholas biological father.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.section states in pertinent part a a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.b if two or more presumptions arise under section which conflict with each other,the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.c the presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.
the california supreme court held that evidence establishing thomas is not nicholas biological father did not overcome the presumption of paternity set forth in section d.the court explained the presumption may be rebutted only in an appropriate action and rebutting the presumption that thomas is nicholas father was inappropriate because it would render the child fatherless since his alleged biological father had not come forward to assert his parental rights,his paternity had not been judicially established,and he could not be located.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d,quoting,subd.a,italics added see also in re raphael th,d we can discern no policy that would support a requirement of failing to legally recognize a man who has acted as a child only father,regardless of his relationship with the child and desire to accept paternal responsibility,solely because he is determined not to be the biological father.
nicholas noted,however,that rebutting the presumption of paternity with evidence that a man is not the biological father of a child would be appropriate where another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section d presumption in order to perfect his claim,or in which a court decides that the legal rights and obligations of parenthood should devolve upon an unwilling candidate.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.
karen held the principles applicable to presumed paternity discussed in nicholas apply equally to women.karen,supra,th at,d.hence,the fact that the woman who had raised karen since birth was not her birth mother did not preclude a finding of maternity where karen birth mother was not a candidate for a declaration of maternity.id.at,d.
thus,nicholas and karen are inapposite because they concerned situations where no other competing father or mother was claiming parentage and was available to care for and support the child,and the parent was willingly seeking a declaration of parenthood,along with the rights and obligations entailed therein.these facts were critical to the decisions in nicholas and karen that the proposed parents lack of biological ties did not rebut the presumption of parenthood in section d.
here,the twins have a natural,biological mother,emily,who is not disclaiming her maternal rights and obligations,and the children can have only one natural mother.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,because the trial court is attempting to impose the legal obligations of parenthood upon an unwilling candidate,this is an appropriate action for elisa lack of biological ties to be used to rebut the presumption in section d upon which the county relies.nicholas,supra,cal th at,d.
nothing in nicholas or karen even remotely suggests section d can be used to establish that a woman in a relationship is the presumed parent of her partner biological children while the mother is still alive,has not abandoned her children,and has not relinquished her parental rights.language used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.ginns savage cal d,fn.
the county also relies on in re marriage of buzzanca th,d hereafter buzzanca to support its position that elisa intention to create a child through artificial insemination makes her a parent of the twins.
in buzzanca,a husband and wife agreed to have an embryo genetically unrelated to either of them implanted in a would carry and give birth to the child for them,and a surrogacy agreement was memorialized in writing after the embryo was implanted.buzzanca,supra,th at,d.before the child was born,the husband filed a petition for dissolution of marriage,asserting there were no children of the marriage.the wife responded that they were expecting a child by way of surrogate contract,and the child was born six days later.id.at,d.n o bona fide attempt was made to establish the surrogate as the lawful mother.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
citing section,buzzanca held that the husband and wife were the lawful parents of the child even though neither one of them was biologically related to the child.buzzanca,supra,th at,d.section treats a husband as the natural father of a child if the husband wife is artificially inseminated with another man sperm under supervision of a licensed physician and with the husband written consent by analogy,buzzanca concluded that the couple consent to the creation of a child via the surrogacy agreement made them the legal parents of the child,who would not have been born but for the husband and wife intention to become parents and their initiation of the surrogacy agreement.id.at,d.
in reaching this legal conclusion,buzzanca relied in part on johnson,supra,cal th,d,another case that resorted to an intention to procreate in resolving a parentage dispute.buzzanca,supra,th at,d.in johnson,a childless couple and a woman entered into a contract providing that an embryo created by the gametes of the couple would be implanted in the other woman uterus,that the child born would be the couple child,and that the surrogate would relinquish all parental rights to the child in return for a specified fee and life insurance policy.despite the terms of the contract,the surrogate claimed she was entitled to parental rights and sought a declaration of maternity.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.johnson found that where two women have presented acceptable proof of maternity,in that one provided the gamete used to create the embryo and the other gave birth as a surrogate,the court has to inquire into the parties intentions as manifested in the surrogacy agreement in order to determine maternity.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.johnson held that the husband and wife were the child parents,not the surrogate,because t hey affirmatively intended the birth of the child,and took the steps necessary to effect in vitro fertilization.but for their intention,the child would not exist.ibid.
this case is distinguishable from buzzanca and johnson.emily did not carry the twins as a surrogate for elisa,who carried and gave birth to her own child.and the buzzanca holding was limited to the facts before it,a paternity dispute by a married man who was the only available father and who had consented to a reproductive procedure designed to provide him and his wife with a child.buzzanca did not address whether its reasoning would apply to an unmarried couple or a couple.buzzanca,supra,th at,fn,d.in any event,the twins can have only one natural mother under the upa.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.nothing in buzzanca or johnson holds that a woman intention to create and raise a child can be used to establish the child has two mothers.in fact,johnson declined to adopt the suggestion that it find the child therein had two mothers.johnson,supra,cal th at,fn,d.instead,johnson resorted to the intention to procreate to determine which of the two women vying for a declaration of maternity,the wife or the surrogate,was the child mother.id.at,d.
accordingly,elisa intention to have emily bring a child into the world is irrelevant to a determination of the identity of the twins natural mother.emily indisputably is their natural mother because she conceived and gave birth to them.and for obvious biological reasons,elisa can not be the children father.there are no other parental options available under the upa and,absent a parental relationship,the upa does not impose an obligation of child support.
as pointed out by the washington court of appeals under similar circumstances if the marriage statute,adoption statute,upa presumptions or surrogacy statute are inadequate when an unmarried couple,same gender or not,conceive artificially,it is up to the legislature to make any changes.if a new test for an intended parent is to be created,the legislature must do the creating.state ex rel.
in sum,the county has failed to establish that elisa is a parent under the upa with an obligation to support the children,and the trial court erred in imposing such an obligation under the upa.
as an alternative ground for imposing upon elisa a child support obligation,the trial court found that principles of promissory or equitable estoppel applied.it noted that the twins would not exist but for elisa and emily joint decision to give birth to a child by medical technology elisa consented to and encouraged the creation of the children and acted as a parent,providing them with financial,emotional,and psychological support after the parties separated,elisa continued to visit and support the children and emily indicated that she relied on elisa promise to raise and support her children,and would not have agreed to become pregnant but for this agreement and understanding.finding there was considerable evidence of an agreement,a breach of the agreement,and detrimental reliance on the agreement,the court concluded that estoppel creates a duty to provide child support in addition to any duty imposed under the upa.
as we will explain,an obligation to support the children may not be imposed pursuant to either a promissory estoppel or an equitable estoppel theory under the circumstances of this case.
promissory estoppel applies whenever a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance would result
