on appeal from a judgment of dissolution,semrin ettefagh semrin challenges numerous property and support rulings issued by the trial court.in the published portion of our opinion,we examine the standard of proof required to overcome the rebuttable presumption contained in family code section that property acquired by either spouse during marriage is community property.the parties agree that the presumption is rebuttable,affects the burden of proof and is overcome by sufficient evidence that the property was a gift to one of the spouses.the parties divide,however,on the quantum of evidence required.semrin claims that the trial court erred in holding that the presumption of section could be rebutted if her former husband,vahid ettefagh vahid established by a preponderance of the evidence that the contested property was a gift to him.she asserts that clear and convincing evidence of a gift is required to rebut the community property presumption.we conclude,however,that the trial court applied the correct standard of proof.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we reject a number of other arguments raised by semrin and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the parties 
semrin is a native of turkey.as a teenager,she moved with her family to los angeles,where,in,she met vahid,a native of iran.the couple married in august.both attended college in the united states,after which they moved to iran in.the parties had two children,one of whom,jehan,was a minor at the time of trial.semrin and vahid separated in.semrin later returned to california and filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage on august.after the petition was filed,the parties stipulated to the joinder of vahid father,hashem ettefagh hashem as a claimant in the proceedings.
properties in controversy 
at trial,one of the principal contested issues was the characterization of four parcels of california real estate collectively the california properties.the first parcel acquired was referred to as santa ana court in tiburon and was deeded to vahid ettefagh,an unmarried man,on may.this recital in the deed is obviously incorrect,since vahid had been married to semrin for over a decade at the time the property was deeded.hashem testified at trial that he provided the funds for the purchase of this property.vahid testified that he invested neither his personal funds nor any funds from his family textile corporations in the santa ana court property.vahid later conveyed the property to hashem on march,
the parties refer to the second parcel as the larkspur shopping center property.on april,the southern pacific transportation company transferred this property to vahid and his sister,maryam ettefagh,granting each an undivided interest.this deed also erroneously refers to vahid ettefagh,an unmarried man.again,hashem testified that he contributed funds used to purchase the property,but that vahid did not.vahid testified that he contributed neither personal nor corporate funds to its acquisition.on march,vahid conveyed this property to hashem.
the third and fourth properties are both located in santa rosa.the parties refer to them as santa rosa large and santa rosa small.on august,vahid sister,shahla ettefagh,conveyed a interest in the santa rosa small property to vahid ettefagh,a married man as his sole and separate property.hashem testimony was that he used money from his bank of america account for the downpayment on this property and that vahid paid no money for the property when it was purchased.vahid also testified that none of his funds were used for the purchase.vahid conveyed his interest in this property to hashem on march.
hashem granted an undivided interest in the fourth parcel,the santa rosa large property,to vahid on january.vahid testified that his funds were not used to purchase the property.by grant deed dated march,vahid conveyed his interest in this property to hashem.
in addition to the properties in california,the parties also had significant real property holdings abroad,including several pieces of real property in iran and turkey.these included an interest in a residential property on anaherta street in tehran,parcels of property identified as golnar,an apartment referred to as lavasoon,a ski chalet in shemshak,iran,seaside apartments located in ayvaluk,turkey,and parcels of land referred to as shomal,and.
the trial court decision 
after an trial,on january,the trial court issued a statement of decision,making a number of dispositions regarding the parties real and personal property,and awards of spousal and child support.we summarize only those aspects of the statement of decision relevant to the issues on appeal.
after reviewing the testimony concerning the california properties,in which semrin claimed a community property interest,the trial court noted that g enerally,these properties were either purchased by hashem with his own funds and then title placed in that of his son vahid in order to assist him in obtaining a green card and entry into the united state s,or,vahid sent money he had earned during the marriage from iran to his father in california so that his father could purchase property and invest for vahid.the parties agreed that these properties were presumed to be community assets under section because they were acquired during the marriage.despite the presumption,the trial court found that the california properties were vahid separate property.it explained there was no documentary evidence supporting semrin claims that the funds used to purchase these properties came from her husband.in addition,the trial court appears to have credited hashem testimony that he purchased these properties with his own funds and simply placed title in vahid name.
in reaching its decision concerning the california properties,the trial court expressly rejected semrin contention that the community property presumption of section can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence.citing in re marriage of haines th,d,the trial court concluded that a party seeking to overcome the presumption established by section must establish the separate nature of the property by a preponderance of the evidence.since section is not a title presumption,virtually any credible evidence could be relied upon to overcome it.the court determined that the presumption had been rebutted because the evidence demonstrates that vahid acquired interests in the california properties as gifts from his father hashem.there is insufficient testimony and no written documentation to the contrary.
the trial court also made a number of determinations regarding the parties ownership interests in their properties abroad,dividing those interests in equal shares between semrin and vahid the court further ordered vahid to provide semrin with a written legal description of all of the properties in which the court had held that semrin had an interest.
regarding the parties minor son,the trial court ordered vahid to pay semrin monthly child support of.it also ordered vahid to pay of the monthly cost of jehan health insurance.the trial court ordered the parties to share equally all reasonable uninsured medical and dental expenses incurred on jehan behalf.
discussion 
semrin raises four issues in this appeal.her first argument is that the community property presumption of section can be rebutted only by the production of clear and convincing evidence.semrin second contention is that the trial court erred in concluding it could rely on any credible evidence in rejecting the presumption according to semrin,section can be overcome only by a tracing rooted in written documentation.semrin third contention is that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding her a interest in the iranian properties.she asserts that the only fair and equitable disposition is for the trial court to order the iranian properties sold and the proceeds divided between the parties.finally,semrin argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allocating the cost of health insurance for the parties minor son.we reject each of these contentions.
i.the community property presumption of section 
semrin principal contention on appeal is that the trial court applied the wrong standard of proof in ruling that the california properties were vahid separate property.because the properties were acquired during the marriage,semrin correctly notes that they are presumed to be community property under section.she argues that vahid was required to produce clear and convincing evidence to rebut this presumption and that the trial court erred in accepting any credible evidence to overcome the presumption.we disagree nothing in the constitutional,statutory,or decisional law of this state requires a higher standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence.
standard of review 
we review the trial court factual findings regarding the existence and character of the parties property under the substantial evidence standard.the trial court selection of what legal principles to apply is subject to de novo review.bono clark th,d.this includes the choice of the applicable standard of proof,which is a question of law that we review de novo.see in re marriage of weaver d.
b.the standard of proof required to overcome the presumption in section is preponderance of the evidence 
the legal context 
before addressing semrin first claim,it is helpful to review certain statutory rules that necessarily guide our decision.two different family code sections are relevant to our inquiry.section states the presumption that,except as otherwise provided by statute,all property acquired during marriage is community property.on the other hand,section,subdivision a provides,a separate property of a married person includes all of the following all property acquired by the person after marriage by gift,bequest,devise or descent.
a presumption is an assumption of fact that the law requires to be made from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in the action.a presumption is not evidence,subd.a.presumptions are either conclusive or rebuttable,and rebuttable presumptions are divided into two categories,those affecting the burden of producing evidence and those affecting the burden of proof.the parties do not dispute that family code section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof,but argue over the standard of proof necessary to prove a fact,like gift,that overcomes the presumption.
the legislature has directed that the standard of proof will generally be by a preponderance of the evidence.evidence code section states that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.as used in this section,the word law includes constitutional,statutory,and decisional law,weiner fleischman cal d.the preponderance of the evidence standard is the default standard of proof in civil actions in this state.conservatorship of wendland cal th,d.while clear and convincing proof is occasionally required by case law,it remains an alternative to the standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.liodas sahadi cal d.
in this case,no party has cited,and we have not found,any constitutional or statutory provision that would require a burden of proof other than preponderance of the evidence to rebut the community property presumption.semrin claim that the community property presumption may be overcome only by the production of clear and convincing evidence rests instead on case law.weiner fleischman,supra,cal d at.an examination of the relevant case law reveals a host of decisions with inconsistent statements regarding the requisite burden of proof.these cases often lack any consideration of contradictory rulings or substantial analysis of the issue.in evaluating these cases,we are guided by the supreme court admonition that judicial expressions purporting to require clear and convincing or clear and satisfactory evidence must be read in light of the statutory provision for proof by a preponderance of the evidence citations,quoting liodas sahadi,supra,cal d at,fn.
the case law 
semrin relies on four cases to argue that the community property presumption may be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence.in estate of niccolls cal,the court stated,the burden of overcoming the community property presumption by clear and satisfactory evidence rests upon the party claiming that the property is separate.gagan gouyd th,d concluded that the contesting spouse has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the property is separate,not community.in re marriage of ashodian d.stated that postnuptial acquisition of property is presumed community unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.finally,thomasset thomasset d,thomasset noted expressions in the decisions to the effect that the separate character of property acquired after marriage is to be established by clear and convincing evidence,clear and decisive proof,and clear and satisfactory proof.
a careful examination of these cases is revealing,however.for example,in estate of niccolls,supra,cal,the supreme court statement that clear and satisfactory evidence is needed to overcome the community property presumption id.at,was dictum,unnecessary to the court decision.in the very same paragraph,the court related that the evidence regarding the acquisition of the subject property was without substantial conflict and that it pointed indisputably to the conclusion that the house and lot in controversy were not community property,italics added.
in gagan gouyd,supra,th,d,though the court noted that the wife had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the property is separate id.at,d,it held there was no evidence that the wife interest was her separate property id.at,d.thus the wife proof would have failed under either standard.moreover,gagan relied on ashodian as support for the proposition that clear and convincing evidence is needed to rebut the community property presumption.ashodian,however,concerned the distinct property presumption attaching to a wife acquisitions of property by an instrument in writing,subd.a,and is therefore inapposite.see in re marriage of ashodian,supra,d at.see also hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,noting that ashodian does not concern community property presumption.
thomasset acknowledged expressions in the decisions to the effect that the separate character of property acquired after marriage is to be established by clear and convincing evidence,clear and decisive proof,or clear and satisfactory proof thomasset,supra,d at,but went on to declare that t he decision of the trier of fact must be according to the preponderance of evidence.former code civ,enacted repealed by stats,ch,eff.thomasset,at,italics added.later cases have interpreted thomasset in this fashion.see in re marriage of fabian cal d,citing thomasset for the proposition that t o overcome the community property presumption the spouse asserting a separate property interest must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties had a contrary agreement italics added patterson patterson d.noting that community property presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence and citing thomasset as support.though relied upon by semrin,thomasset undermines her position.
semrin also relies on witkin as support for her claim that clear and convincing evidence is required to overcome the community property presumption.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof and presumptions.but witkin relies primarily on estate of nickson cal,nickson,which is questionable authority for this proposition.in nickson,the court recognized that the presumption is one which can only be overcome by clear and satisfactory proof or by clear and convincing evidence,but,the court went on to say,we are still required to determine the scope and meaning of those terms.id.at.nickson then relied on freese hibernia sav.soc.cal,to conclude t he property is merely considered as the property of the community until the contrary is shown by legal proof,and legal proof would seem to be a preponderance of the testimony under all the facts and circumstances of the particular case.we are of the opinion that it is incumbent on the party seeking to overcome the presumpti
