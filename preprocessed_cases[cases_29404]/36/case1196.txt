a baby born to a drug addicted mother and an identity unknown father became a dependent of the juvenile court and was placed in foster care.eight months later,the alleged father learned of the baby existence,went to see the social worker,appeared in court as directed,asked for a paternity test,and stated his desire to support and care for the child he believes is his.the dependency court,determined to proceed as planned before the man appearance,denied the request for a paternity test and terminated parental rights as to the identity unknown father as well as the man who appeared in court.we reverse.
gladys has four children,the youngest of whom baby boy is the subject of this appeal.the two oldest children,richard born in may and alexa born in november,have the same father,lorenzo gladys born in december has a different father anthony.four hours after baby was born in february,gladys walked out of the hospital after telling a social worker she knew the baby would be taken by the department of children and family services because the other three children were then dependents of the court and because she knew or suspected that baby had tested positive for methamphetamines and amphetamines.gladys did not give the hospital the name of baby father.
the department filed a petition,alleging that gladys had a long history of drug abuse that rendered her unable to care for baby,and that she had failed to reunite with her three older children.welf,subds.b,j.at a hearing held on february at which gladys did not appear,the department reported that the identity of baby father was unknown,and recommended placement with gladys prospective adoptive parents.the dependency court followed the recommendation and ordered the department to try to find baby father.gladys appeared at a february hearing,at which time the court asked her,do you want to give us the names of the people you think might be the father when gladys declined,the court ordered her to talk to the department and to give the social worker the names of anyone who might be baby father.gladys never complied.
in a report prepared for a march hearing,the department included a declaration of due diligence,explaining that search source s had been identified,but that a search was not possible because the father identity was unknown.on march,the court sustained the petition.on april,the court denied reunification services for gladys and for baby unidentified father.the court set a permanent plan hearing for july,and ordered the department to give notice to the identity unknown father by publication.on july,the court found the published notice inadequate and continued the hearing to november.
meanwhile,on september,jesus appeared at the department office and said he was probably baby father.he told the social worker he had been in an intimate relationship with gladys,and that she had just told him about the baby and told him to talk to the social worker.he said he wanted family reunification services and was willing to comply with all of the court orders.the social worker gave him a copy of the notice of the hearing set for november,told him the purpose of the hearing was to terminate parental rights,and explained that it was mandatory for him to be present at the denied his request to visit baby and did not do anything to inform the court that the baby apparent father had come forward.
jesus appeared at the november hearing and a lawyer eric wexler was appointed to represent him.the court told jesus,basically the mother has never given your name as the possible father of this child,ever.wexler explained that gladys had told jesus the baby looked like him,and that jesus had contacted the social worker as soon as he learned about the baby birth.wexler asked for an test to determine paternity this was the court response he an alleged father.notice is proper.we going forward with the section.hearing today.there no exception.there no reason not to terminate parental rights.
when wexler suggested it would be in the baby best interests to determine paternity,baby lawyer agreed,as did the department lawyer.the court response why would you just go forward today if you terminate the parental rights,that the end of him i mean are you going to,like,move him into this guy home when he in a preadoptive home what are you trying to do by doing that the court repeated,i just do see the point.there followed a debate about whether published notice to the identity unknown father was sufficient notice to jesus,after which the court faulted jesus for not visiting baby v.wexler explained that jesus had wanted to visit but the department would not permit it,and asked for reunification services as well as the paternity test for jesus.
the court questioned the need for a paternity test what if he the father then we going to offer him reunification services the minor lawyer who had at first agreed that a paternity test was appropriate then questioned jesus presence and when pressed by the court said she had no good reason for joining in the request for the test,suggesting maybe the father would have a reason.the court again said they should just go forward because jesus had had no contact with the child and because the court did not know if it even his child.there followed a conversation about the insufficiency of service on jesus notwithstanding substantially correct published service for the identity unknown father,followed in turn by wexler repeated requests for a paternity test.this was the court response 
all the objections are overruled.i think they makeweights.they are in the child best interest if there was some person we were trying to serve,i would agree that person would have standing and have a real objection.you know,casper the friendly ghost,identity unknown,does not have standing.we do know who it is.there no real person.this may be the gentleman it may not be the gentleman.he been timely served.he has no basis to contest it at this point,so i feel it would be in the child best interest to proceed,so i overruling everyone objection.
when the lawyers finally persuaded the court that there was a defect in the service on jesus,the court put the matter over to november dad advised that the hearing is going over to november.court at that time will be terminating parental rights.the baby been with a family that wants to adopt him.they have a home study to adopt him.given that this is child on this case,i ca find that it would be in the child best interest to even test to see if you are the father.i do think you are.the court comments are difficult to understand because jesus had nothing at all to do with gladys other children the record is clear that he is not their father.the court last comment i do think you are the child father is equally odd because there is nothing at all to suggest that jesus is not the baby biological father.
jesus and his lawyer appeared at the november hearing,at which there was the following exchange 
wexler jesus,when he learned that the child was actually in existence he had a relationship with the mother.the mother went into a drug rehab program.he did meet with the mother again until september of this year,and that when he found out that the mother had a baby and that he was probably the father.he met with the social worker and told the social worker that,and he requested an because he wants to have a relationship with his child.
he has another child that he supports.it a little girl who he sees weekly.he supports the mother and that child.he has a job.he had the same job for eight years.he a very stable man,and his words with me w ere he did not want to throw this child back into the river when the child has a father who would take care of him,that wants to raise him,and will provide for him the rest of his life,so he would ask for a chance to have a relationship with his child i know we late as far as the time frames go in this case.i think the social worker should have brought this to court immediately instead of making him wait an extra month before he came to court.
the court we published on him in june.
wexler does mean he saw it,your honor.
the court i understand.but i saying he
