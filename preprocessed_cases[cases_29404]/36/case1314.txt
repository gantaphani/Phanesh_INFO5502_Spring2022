introduction 
following the dissolution of her marriage to daniel henry,shelley reissmueller was ordered in october to pay child support to henry for their two teenaged sons.reissmueller became pregnant in december,and developed complications during the pregnancy that caused her to be disabled from work.she therefore sought modification of the child support order because of her reduced income.
reissmueller medical complications continued after the birth of her baby she continued receiving disability payments and ultimately went on unemployment because her employer could not keep her position open.
in january,the trial court entered an order modifying reissmueller child support obligation,although not to reissmueller benefit.one of the teenaged sons of henry and reissmueller had turned years of age,so the support order no longer applied to him.reissmueller support payment for the other son increased from per month to per month.on appeal,reissmueller challenges the court order on a number of grounds.
we reverse and remand for recalculation of the child support payment.the court erred in calculating reissmueller income because her share of the increased equity value in a residence is not income within the meaning of family code section.all further statutory references are to the family code,unless otherwise specified.we must therefore reverse the order modifying reissmueller child support obligation,and remand the matter for the trial court to recalculate the proper amount of that obligation due from january,to may.the trial court shall determine how best to ensure any overpayment or underpayment by reissmueller to henry is to be corrected.
in all other respects,the court order was correct.the court findings regarding henry income were supported by substantial evidence the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to make the modification order retroactive or in denying reissmueller requests for income deductions and the record does not support a claim of gender bias by the court.
henry seeks his attorney fees on appeal as a sanction against reissmueller for filing a frivolous appeal.we deny that request.

discussion 
in considering the modification of a child support order,o ur review is limited to determining whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.citation.we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court,but confine ourselves to determining whether any judge could have reasonably made the challenged order.citation.in re marriage of de guigne th,d.a determination regarding a request for modification of a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found from examining the record below.citations.in re marriage of leonard th,d.
the trial court findings of reissmueller income were not supported by substantial evidence.
as we shall explain,the trial court findings regarding reissmueller income were not supported by substantial evidence.at the time the trial court considered reissmueller request for modification,reissmueller had no wages,since her employer had been unable to keep her job open during her disability leave.in,she had earned approximately per month.in,reissmueller earned per month from january through april per month from may through september and per month from september through december.this income was comprised of wages and disability benefits.reissmueller also expected to receive per week in unemployment benefits beginning december.
the court found reissmueller had suffered a temporary reduction in income.in this matter,reissmueller has had a reduction in income.it would seem that the reduction is not permanent.she got pregnant.she exhibited a disability.her job was exonerated.reissmueller argues these findings show the court was punishing her for getting pregnant.we disagree.the quote from the january order merely sets out the steps leading to reissmueller reduction in income reissmueller became pregnant she then became disabled from work as a result of complications during and after the pregnancy and reissmueller employer was unable to hold her position open after her leave had been exhausted.
the court made additional findings that reissmueller is highly skilled in a profession nursing,she expects to be,and she was currently receiving unemployment benefits and is seeking employment.nurses find jobs quickly.there was substantial evidence for each of these findings in the record,and reissmueller does not argue to the contrary.
the court also found reissmueller residence appreciated in value by between april and december,and half of this increase in value belonged to reissmueller,because the house was jointly owned with her current husband.this half interest calculates to approximately per month during that time period.the trial court found reissmueller gross income to be per month.in its order denying the new trial motion,the court explained its determination of reissmueller income as follows the court was asked by reissmueller to lower the child support because she had become unable to be employed for a period of time and she argued that without income she had no capacity to pay.this court rejected that argument as the court found that pursuant to the definition of income as contained in family code section reissmueller had sufficient income to support her children.the court compared a newly filed income and expense declaration with an older one and discovered that reissmueller had some increase in her real estate investment.the court could thus have found that reissmueller had an income of in the earlier nine months.rather than apply to reissmueller a monthly average of monthly income,the court exerci
