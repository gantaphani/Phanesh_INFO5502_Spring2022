paul and veronica challenge the juvenile court judgment terminating their parental rights to their son,jeremy,and freeing the minor for adoption.earlier this year,we denied on its merits paul petition for writ of mandate paul superior court june,nonpub.opn,seeking relief from the court order finding there was sufficient evidence to support certain jurisdictional findings and denying reunification services.
jeremy suffered severe internal injuries in january while in the care of his mother,her boyfriend,and his maternal grandmother.all of the adults disclaimed any knowledge as to how jeremy was hurt.however,jeremy reported to a social worker that in addition to causing his physical injuries,his mother boyfriend played the vacuum cleaner game with him by placing a vacuum cleaner hose over his penis.veronica later revealed that her boyfriend would rough house and wrestle with jeremy on a regular basis,pinning the child on his back until he cried.she claimed to be unaware of any sexual abuse.
the petition alleged jeremy internal injuries were caused by blunt force trauma.he required major surgery to repair the damage and a course of three antibiotics to treat an infection.in the emergency room,jeremy was heard to say repeatedly,i sorry,i sorry.veronica had to be admonished by the h ospital s taff for yelling at jeremy to shut up and knock it off as the child was crying while afraid and in pain 
jeremy was placed in a special needs foster care home because he initially required specialized help following the surgery.moreover,jeremy half brother,david massey,a developmentally delayed child,was living there and had been adopted by the foster mother.veronica rights to david had been terminated a few years earlier in.david had been taken into protective custody after being found alone,in the fast lane of harbor boulevard in garden grove,dressed only in a diaper.
paul had also lost his parental rights to two other children,jeremy,due to his chronic substance abuse and failure to protect them.he has used drugs since he was a teenager and has several prior arrests.paul and veronica were never married,but they lived together until jeremy was a little over two years old.when jeremy was taken into protective custody,paul was serving time in jail for possessing a controlled substance for sale.he was due to be released in april,and he told the social worker he was willing to care for jeremy.he hoped to enter a rehabilitation program to address his drug abuse.
veronica had monitored contacts with jeremy before the jurisdictional hearing.at first,jeremy was extremely upset and was very reluctant to visit with veronica.he clung to the social worker for the first minutes of the first visit and told his mother,i do like you.jeremy also made reference to his fear of veronica boyfriend.when veronica assured jeremy the boyfriend was no longer around,jeremy relaxed and eventually agreed to play with her.during the next two visits,it was reported jeremy was no longer fearful of his mother and interacted playfully.however,veronica was unable thereafter to maintain regular weekly contact reportedly due to her busy and somewhat unpredictable work schedule at two different restaurants.she expressed a willingness to participate in parenting classes and counseling but had done neither.
paul filed an opposition to the petition,challenging the allegations contained in counts i,iii and iv that he knew or reasonably should have known jeremy was at risk of abuse.at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,he testified he did not know about the abuse because he was in jail,and a social worker gave testimony supporting paul story.paul and the social worker also testified paul was willing to care for jeremy but unable to do so while incarcerated.
the court found all the allegations against both parents in the petition to be true.welf,subds.a,b,d,e j.it determined reunification services were not in jeremy best interest and need not be provided to either parent pursuant to section,subdivision b,and additionally not to veronica pursuant to subdivision b.paul challenged the ruling by filing a writ of.
in response to paul writ,we concluded substantial evidence supported the court ruling.as for the jurisdictional finding,we found there was sufficient evidence supporting count ii regarding paul inability to supervise,protect and provide care for jeremy.paul did not refute this aspect of the petition,and no more was needed to uphold the judgment.similarly,we were not persuaded by paul argument he was entitled to reunification services.there was ample evidence supporting the court finding paul had not made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of his other children,his inability to care for them and addiction to drugs,subd.b.
in a report prepared for the permanency hearing,the social worker reported veronica had established a more regular pattern of visitation.she saw jeremy once a week for one hour.as for jeremy,the social worker determined he was considered likely to be adopted.she said jeremy is an exceptionally appealing child with desirable facial features,good social skills,and an affable personality.he exhibits a good vocabulary and appears to enjoy engaging verbally.
the foster family caring for jeremy said they desired to adopt him.the prospective adoptive mother told the social worker she has already adopted jeremy brother and would like the two children to be able to grow up together as the bond between them is very evident.additionally,the prospective parents said they love jeremy as their own son and believe that they can provide him with a very happy and stable home.the social worker noted,it is still being assessed whether the home,designated as a group home for special needs children,is appropriate for meeting the child needs.
the day before the scheduled permanency hearing,paul filed a section petition,seeking to modify the court prior order denying him reunification services.in his declaration,paul claimed he was out of jail,drug free,participating in group therapy,and visiting with jeremy regularly.he said he completed hours of parenting classes and believed he would be able to benefit from reunification services.paul also stated jeremy knows me and calls me dad.he greets me enthusiastically and really enjoys our time together.the court also accepted paul counsel representation the group counseling was aimed at addressing his drug problem.the court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing.the permanency hearing was continued.
in a supplemental report prepared for the hearing,a social worker,newly assigned to the case,reported she thought jeremy was a happy and verbal child.she addressed the previous social worker concern regarding whether the adoptive placement was a sufficiently stimulating and enriching home environment for the child.she concluded,the concerns were valid since the child with no current developmental delays resides in the home that specializes in medically or developmentally special needs children.however,after spending time with the foster mother,reviewing the child school and home activities,observing the home environment,and interactions between the child and the family members,the undersigned found the prospective adoptive home to be more than sufficient to meet the child medical,educational and emotional needs in a stimulating home environment t he adoptive parents are unconditionally committed to adopting jeremy as a member of their family.in addition,a benefit for the child of being in his current home environment would be the development of compassion towards developmentally delayed children.the social worker described jeremy room as being decorated with a train and automobile theme and filled with books and toys.she reported the home is filled with educational books,toys,computers,children videos,and pictures of the family,including jeremy.
after considering testimony and argument,the court found jeremy was likely to be adopted and terminated parental rights,finding section,subdivision c a through d did not apply.
we begin with paul appeal he claims the court should have granted his request for hearing under section.we disagree.under the statute a parent must prove changed circumstances necessitate modification of an existing order to serve the child best interests.although paul was out of custody and visiting with jeremy,there was no showing he had made a serious commitment to address his substance abuse problem which was the basis for the court initial decision to deny reunification services,subd.b.paul declared only that he was attending group therapy twice a month to address his drug problem.but this was ordered as a condition of his probation.paul failed to enroll in any sort of drug testing program,treatment program,narcotics anonymous,or alcoholics anonymous.other than his declaration he was now drug free,there is no evidence paul was on the road to,much less had reached the goal of sobriety.based on such a minimal showing of treatment,it was not unreasonable for the court to disbelieve paul claim and deny his request for a section hearing 
moreover,there was no showing additional reunification services would have been in jeremy best interests.there is little evidence of a bond.jeremy lived with his father and mother for the first two years of his life,during which time paul would often use drugs in jeremy presence.indeed,jeremy mother said she ended her relationship with paul because of the drug abuse.thereafter,jeremy visits with his father were sporadic and ended altogether while paul was incarcerated.paul waited one month after his release to contact social services and arrange for weekly one hour visits.as minor counsel points out,jeremy calls paul his dad,but the significance of this is tempered by the fact jeremy called his mother sexually and physically abusive boyfriend a similar term of endearment papa.given the scant evidence of a bond or of paul commitment to sobriety,it can not be said the court abused its discretion.
we next address veronica contention the court should not have selected adoption as the permanent plan because she proved she maintained regular visitation and contact with jeremy,and he would benefit from continuing the relationship,subd.c a.in making this argument,she cites to the undisputed evidence she cared for jeremy the first four years of his life,she has contributed to his educational needs during the dependency period by reading and doing puzzles with him,and she has acted in a parental role by disciplining jeremy as needed during visits.she challenges the social worker opinion jeremy would not benefit from a relationship based on the fact he does not talk or ask about her between visits.she claims this information is unreliable because it was reported by the foster mother,not jeremy.she cites to the fact jeremy calls her mommy and is very happy during their visits.and,as she testified at the permanency hearing,she believes that,being his birth mother,she can give him more love than anybody can in this world.veronica asserts the foster family will not be able to give jeremy what she could give him,unconditional love.
although disputed by the parties,the court determined the evidence showed veronica had maintained regular visitation with jeremy,stating,i believe mom does have enough visits,she missed some visits,but does have enough to minimally comply with the first prong of section,subd.c a however,the court concluded the second prong was not proven because there was no evidence whatsoever that this child would benefit from a continuing relationship.in fact,the evidence presented points to the opposite.mom limited comments that she is the birth mother and she can offer him unconditional love does not meet that burden.in fact,i think her acts speak louder than her minimal words offered to the court here today.
indeed,the exception requires proof of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed if deprived of the relationship.in re autumn th,d.the court must balance the strength and quality of the natural relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and the sense of belonging a new family would confer.ibid.as explained in in beatrice th,d,the child relationship must transcend the kind of relationship the child would enjoy with another relative or family friend.
that showing is difficult to make in the situation,such as the one here,where the parents have not advanced beyond supervised visitation.in re casey th,d.although veronica contact with jeremy was loving,it was not sufficient to establish the benefit from a continuing relationship contemplated by the exception.one can know a child interests,enjoy playtime together,and be a loved relative,but not occupy a parental role in the child life.and while we recognize jeremy would benefit from such a loving relationship,the court below was justified in finding it was outweighed by jeremy need for a stable and permanent home that would come with adoption.
veronica also claims the court improperly found jeremy was adoptable because the social worker did not know the severity of his medical,developmental,and behavioral problems.we find her contentions belied by the record.to terminate parental rights and order adoption,the trial court must find by clear and convincing evidence it is likely the child will be adopted,subd.c.the issue of adoptability focuses on the minor,whether the minor age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt the minor.citations.in re sarah th,d,original italics.our review is limited to whether the court findings were supported by substantial evidence.in re jennilee th,d.
it is undisputed jeremy has a seizure disorder,and some intestinal and behavioral problems due to the abuse he suffered.however,the social worker testified those conditions would not impede jeremy chances for adoption.she explained jeremy was prescribed psychotropic medication to address his seizure disorder and indicated he needed no further testing for his neurological condition.although it was too early to tell if the medicine was working,the social worker opined the disorder was not something that would make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt jeremy.she said she had placed other children with seizure disorders in adoptive homes.
as for jeremy behavior problems,the social worker reported they had significantly decreased in frequency.in a report prepared in august,jeremy was described as a behavior problem.he was prone to tantrums,slamming doors,using bad language,hitting,and scratching.in a report prepared the following month,the foster mother reported jeremy behavior had improved a great deal.indeed,at the hearing,the social worker testified that when jeremy was first placed in foster care he was having behavioral problems two or three times a week,but now it only occurred once every two to three weeks.she described jeremy as presently being affectionate with his foster family and siblings,being able to communicate well and describe what he wants,and being able to enjoy activities where he is helping his family.she stated,he just your regular five year old who likes to play with trains and watch disney movies 
veronica speculates jeremy behavior problems may be due to a neurological deficiency which must be evaluated before he is adopted.we find it is more likely to suspect the problems stem from the horrific abuse he suffered while in his mother care.very telling is the fact the frequency of jeremy outbursts have substantially decreased within a very short period of time of living with a loving and nurturing family.we find no reason to disregard the social worker opinion this diminishing problem will not affect jeremy chances of being adopted.
the record shows jeremy is too young to tell if he is developmentally delayed.the social worker explained jeremy is currently attending a special school for children who have lived in unstimulating environments.although there is no way of knowing for sure,it was the social worker hope jeremy will be prepared to be mainstreamed into a regular kindergarten classroom setting one year from now.she believed the issue does not need to be resolved or further evaluated before jeremy is freed for adoption.
