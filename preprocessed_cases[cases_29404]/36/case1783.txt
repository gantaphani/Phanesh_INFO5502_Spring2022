today we decide issues of first impression under the family code concerning a primary custodial parent right to modify a joint managing conservatorship to remove a residency restriction when that parent desires to relocate.rosemarie romy lenz sued to modify the joint managing conservatorship she shared with her,rudolph rudi lenz,in order to relocate to germany with their two sons.contrary to a jury verdict in favor of the modification,the trial court entered an order restricting the boys residence to bexar county,texas,and further ordered each party responsible for its own attorney fees and costs.the court of appeals affirmed.the precise issues presented for our review are whether romy produced legally sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict and if she did,whether texas family code permits a trial court to impose a geographic restriction on a child primary residence contrary to that verdict.we conclude that legally sufficient evidence supports the jury verdict in favor of the requested modification,and that under family code,the trial court could not contravene the jury verdict giving romy the exclusive right to establish her sons primary residence by imposing a geographical restriction on their primary residence.for these reasons,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment modifying the joint managing conservatorship to give romy the exclusive right to determine her sons primary residence.we remand the issue of attorney fees to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
romy and rudi lenz are german citizens currently residing in san antonio,texas.six years after their marriage in germany,they had their first son,oliver,in.the family relocated to phoenix,arizona,in because of rudi job.the next year,dominic was born.in,romy and rudi legally separated and entered into a stipulated consent decree of legal separation pursuant to arizona law.the decree included a joint custody agreement and parenting plan,under which romy and rudy would be joint legal custodians.the agreement designated romy as the primary residential parent,and as a result,oliver and dominic resided with their mother while rudi saw the boys on a regular schedule.the agreement also expressed the parties intent to relocate to san antonio and restrict the boys residency to texas.rudi moved to san antonio in february to start a new job,and romy and the boys followed in june of that year.
in january,romy initiated divorce proceedings in bexar county,and eight months later,romy and rudi divorced.the divorce decree incorporated the arizona joint custody agreement and parenting plan.thus,the children continued to live with their mother,their father saw them on the prearranged schedule,and romy had the right to determine the boys residence in texas.
shortly after the divorce,romy filed this proceeding seeking to modify the divorce decree in order to remove the texas residency restriction.she sought modification so she could return to germany with the children and remarry.rudi argued against romy modification and alternatively sought modification to become the boys primary custodial joint managing conservator.both parties sought attorney fees and costs.
the modification issues were tried to a jury,while the trial court decided attorney fees and costs.the court charged the jury with two questions whether the statutory requirements for modification had been proven and if so,which parent should have the exclusive right to determine the county of residence and primary residence of the children.the jury answered the first question affirmatively,and based on that answer,determined in response to the second question that romy should have the exclusive right to determine the children residence.
rudi consequently filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in which he asked the court to disregard the jury verdict because,among other things,romy had failed to produce sufficient evidence to meet any of the statutory requirements for modification under texas family code.see.rudi also argued that the jury finding giving romy the exclusive right to determine the children primary residence was advisory under family code c b because it concerned a specific term or condition of possession of or access to the child,an issue on which a party is not entitled to a jury finding under the statute.see id.c b.in the alternative,rudi asked the court to enter orders in the best interest of the children and specify a fixed geographical area in which the children could reside.
although the jury found in favor of modification and gave romy the exclusive right to determine the children primary residence,in its final order the trial court allowed romy to establish the children primary residence,but only within bexar county.the trial court also ordered each party to pay its own attorney fees and costs.the court of appeals affirmed,concluding that no evidence showed that the boys relocation would be a positive improvement and in their best interest,and that family code authorized the trial court to impose the additional residency restriction.at.
romy presents two issues for our review whether legally sufficient evidence supports the jury finding that her children relocation to germany would be a positive improvement for them and in their best interest,thereby justifying modification of the joint managing conservatorship,see.and whether the trial court had the authority to impose an additional residency restriction contrary to the jury verdict,see id.
as a preliminary matter,romy asserts that rudi did not preserve his challenge to the modification finding because the record failed to reflect the trial court ruling on his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.rudi,however,argues that romy had the burden to preserve error,because as the appealing party she should have secured a ruling on the motion and had that ruling reflected in the record.we conclude that rudi has preserved error.
rudi motion asked the court to disregard the jury finding on modification,or in the alternative,to render an order specifying a fixed geographical area for the children residence.the trial court final order declared 
pursuant to the jury verdict,it is ordered article v of the joint custody agreement and parenting plan entitled relocation is hereby specifically modified to read as follows as a condition of possession to the joint managing conservatorship,that the children shall reside in and attend school in bexar county,texas.
thus,although the trial court ordered modification pursuant to the jury verdict,it imposed its own primary residence restriction.by doing this,the trial court rejected the jury verdict giving romy the exclusive right to decide her sons primary residence and granted the alternative remedy rudi sought in his motion,which was to restrict the children primary residence to bexar county.in this way,the trial court implicitly disposed of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.see.a a stating record must show that trial court ruled on the request,objection,or motion,either expressly or implicitly.
as rudi did not waive his challenge,we turn to romy claim that the court of appeals erred in sustaining that challenge.when reviewing a point,we must view the evidence in a light that tends to support the finding of the disputed fact and disregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.bradford vento.here,we must decide whether romy presented more than a scintilla of evidence to support modifying the joint managing conservatorship to remove the residency restriction so that she could relocate with her children.
family code specifies that a court may modify the terms and conditions of a joint managing conservatorship when two requirements are met.first,either the circumstances of the child or one or both of the conservators must have materially and substantially changed since the rendition of the order,or the order must have become unworkable or inappropriate under existing circumstances.second,the modification must be a positive improvement for and in the best interest of the child.id.the parties do not dispute that romy circumstances have materially and substantially changed since the divorce and that the order has become unworkable under the parties present circumstances.see id.the parties also acknowledge romy wish to move to germany and remarry.at issue is the second part of the test for relocation will be a positive improvement for and in the best interest of oliver and dominic.see id.
the legislature has made clear that t he best interest of the child shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the issues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.yet,the family code does not elaborate on the specific requirements for modification in the context,and we have no specific statute governing residency restrictions or their removal for purposes of relocation.neither have texas courts articulated any specific standards to apply in this context.nonetheless,the legislature has provided a basic framework upon which we may build guidelines for reviewing a modification that removes a residency restriction for purposes of relocation.family code outlines this framework by pronouncing our public policy for all suits affecting the relationship 
a the public policy of this state is to 
assure that children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child 
provide a safe,stable,and nonviolent environment for the child and 
encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage.
id.a.we must endeavor to give meaning to these public policy imperatives as we interpret the family code modification standards in the relocation context.but as this is an issue of first impression for our court,we begin by reviewing the jurisprudence of other states that have outlined standards in the relocation context.
several jurisdictions have enumerated considerations at issue when a primary custodial parent seeks to relocate.see,in re marriage of burgess,cal th,d,in re marriage of smith,silbaugh silbaugh,wilson wilson,baures lewis,tropea tropea,love love.historically,courts have disfavored removing a child from the jurisdiction issuing the original custody decree.edwin terry et,relocation moving forward or moving backward.tech.recently,however,courts have reassessed the standards for relocation,moving away from a relatively strict presumption against relocation and toward a more fluid balancing test that permits the trial court to take into account a greater number of relevant factors.see,burgess,d,at in re marriage of francis,baures,at tropea,at.increasing geographic mobility and the availability of easier,faster,and cheaper communication have in part accounted for this shift in perspective.see baures,at.the change in approach to evaluating relocation standards is best highlighted by three cases baures lewis,tropea tropea,and in re marriage of burgess,cal th,d.
baures constitutes the latest case in new jersey evolving jurisprudence on removal.in baures,the court held that under the new jersey removal statute,a custodial parent may move with the children as long as the move does not interfere with the best interests of the children or the visitation rights of the noncustodial parent.baures,at.guided by two previous new jersey supreme court cases,holder polanski,and cooper cooper,the court clarified the legal standards for removal in baures.baures,at.the court had previously required that the custodial parent seeking relocation to another state prove a real advantage to that parent from the move,but then in holder rejected that requirement as failing to allow custodial parents the same freedom enjoyed by noncustodial parents to seek a better life.holder,at see baures,at.the court then established a new test requiring a reason for the move and proof the child will not suffer from it.holder,at see baures,at.in baures,the court listed many factors relevant to proving the two parts,including,among other things the reasons for and against the move comparison of education,health,and leisure opportunities whether special needs or talents of the children can be accommodated the effect on extended family relationships the effect on visitation and communication with the noncustodial parent to maintain a full and continuous relationship with the child and whether the noncustodial parent has the ability to relocate.baures at.
in tropea,new york,long considered one of the most restrictive jurisdictions with respect to relocation,replaced a test requiring the parent seeking relocation to prove exceptional circumstances to justify the move with one focusing on the best interests of the child w e hold that each relocation request must be considered on its own merits with due consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances and with predominant emphasis being placed on what outcome is most likely to serve the best interests of the child.tropea,at see terry,supra,at.recognizing that its earlier test erected artificial barriers to viewing all relevant factors for relocation,the court then identified factors for the trial court to consider,including the parents good faith in requesting or opposing the move,the possibility of a visitation schedule allowing the continuation of a meaningful relationship between the noncustodial parent and the child,the degree of economic,emotional,and education enhancement for the custodial parent and the child,and the effect on extended family relationships.tropea,at.the court opined that to summarily reject motives for relocation overlooks the value for children that strengthening and stabilizing the new,postdivorce family unit can have in a particular case.id.at.
finally,in burgess,the california supreme court also modified its prior approach of requiring a custodial parent to prove that relocation was necessary before permitting the move.burgess,d,at.the court concluded that the necessity of relocating has little,if any,substantive bearing on the suitability of a parent to retain the role of a custodial parent.id.moreover,the court noted that given that both parents may need to secure or retain employment or pursue educational or career opportunities,it is unrealistic to assume that divorced parents will permanently remain in the same location after dissolution or to exert pressure on them to do so.id.at.of paramount concern in the analysis,however,was the need for continuity and stability in custody arrangements.id.like texas,the california family code pronounced a public policy in favor of frequent and continuing contact between the parents and children.id.at quoting cal.see.a.the court in burgess held t he policy of family code section in favor of frequent and continuing contact does not so constrain the trial court broad discretion to determine,in light of all the circumstances,what custody arrangements serve the best interest of minor children.burgess,d,at.and,as did the courts in baures and tropea,the court pointed out that bright line rules in this area are inappropriate each case must be evaluated on its own unique facts,and identified factors to consider,such as the nature of the child existing contact with both parents,the child age,community ties,and health and educational needs.id.at.
other jurisdictions are also part of this shift toward less stringent relocation standards.see francis,at t he child best interests are served by preserving the custodial relationship,by avoiding relitigation of custody decisions,and by recognizing the close link between the best interests of the custodial parent and the best interests of the child.stout stout,clarifying interpretation of relocation statute to permit removal in the best interests of the child love,at concluding that as long as the custodial parent seeks the move in good faith and reasonable visitation is available to the noncustodial parent,removal should be granted.
as most of these cases rely on a standard as the ultimate guide for determining whether a modification for purposes of relocation should be granted,the factors they consider reflect the public policy concerns implicit in texas own statutory standard for modification.see.modification must be a positive improvement for and in the best interest of the child.the factors highlighted by those courts thus may assist us in giving meaning to our standard in the relocation context,particularly in light of the legislature overarching goals of assuring that children will have frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the best interest of the child and to provide a safe,stable,and nonviolent environment for the child.see id.a.
contrary to the courts highlighted above,however,we are reviewing not a trial court determination after that judge has balanced the relevant factors,but the decision of a jury.see id.c d a party may demand a jury trial on the issue of primary residence.thus our analytical framework is different,even though much of the evidence will be of the same kind a trial court in another jurisdiction might take into account.in this case,we must conduct a review to determine whether the evidence supports the jury verdict in favor of removing a residency restriction.therefore,we view the evidence produced relevant to the factors in a light that tends to support the jury verdict.see bradford,at.with these considerations in mind,we turn to our review.
oliver is a german citizen and resident alien of the united states dominic has dual citizenship.both boys speak german in their mother home,as well as receive formal training in german from a tutor.they also watch german movies and listen to taped stories in german.the children celebrate german and american holidays.at trial,a clinical and forensic psychiatrist,frank paredes,testified that maintaining the boys german culture was very important because their cultural identity acted as a mechanism by which to deal with life events.moreover,paredes averred that it is terribly important for these children to maintain and benefit from their culture of origin,the german culture.oliver and dominic also have strong family ties in germany.almost all the lenzes extended family live in germany,including the boys only living grandparents with whom they have a close relationship.rudi testified that his sons are also close to romy sister and as well as her fiancé,harmut graffert.in addition to family members,oliver and dominic have good friends in germany.the boys strong association with their german heritage and culture,and the opportunity to strengthen their relationships with extended family members amount to some evidence that the boys may benefit by moving to germany.see landa landa,so d,noting that opportunity to live in chile with family members would be beneficial to children yannas,concluding that children should benefit from move to greece by strengthening their ties to family and greek culture see also tropea,at stating courts should consider effect on extended family relationships.that same evidence also indicates the boys will live in a stable and supportive environment.see.a declaring that the public policy of this state is to provide a safe,stable,and nonviolent environment for the child.
romy improved financial situation in germany may also contribute to her providing a better standard of living for her two sons.romy testified that she searched for employment in san antonio,applying for travel agent positions,but found only work as an outside travel agent earning six dollars an hour and working twelve hours a week.clinical psychologist joann murphey testified that romy felt she was more employable in germany than san antonio.while romy spousal support will cease if she remarries,there is evidence that romy fiancé will help support her sons financially.that romy has a chance of better employment and a stable financial situation in germany is evidence that she may provide a higher standard of living for her sons there.see yannas,at taking into consideration mother much improved professional and financial situation in greece versus unemployment in massachusetts see also burgess,d,at recognizing need of parent to secure employment or pursue career opportunities tropea,at looking at degree of economic enhancement from the move.
the record also contains testimony that relocation would positively affect romy emotional and mental state,with beneficial results for oliver and dominic.murphey testified that romy feels lonely in san antonio.murphey then stated that if romy is happier in germany,natural benefits would flow to her children.the psychologist commented that the custodial parent mental state directly impacts the quality of a child life.because the custodial parent provides the child with a basic quality of life,a child best interest is closely intertwined with the of the custodial parent.see francis,at yannas,at baures,at cooper,at,modified by holder,at.of course,the child best interest trumps that of either parent however,to disavow the custodial parent influence on his or her children ignores the fundamental relationship between parent and child.
rudi right to have regular and meaningful contact is also an important factor in the analysis.see.a declaring that state public policy is to assure that child will have continuing contact with parents who can act in child best interest.the record shows,however,that while romy will experience a personal life and financial prospects that are less satisfactory should she remain in san antonio,rudi could easily relocate to germany in order to be with his sons.besides being a native german,rudi has many employment options in germany.murphey testified that rudi told her he could return to his former employer in germany,albeit resulting in a demotion.with respect to other job prospects,rudi testified that he received many calls from german headhunters even though he did not circulate his resume.he also told romy he could move back to germany and perform his job from there.furthermore,rudi has an advanced german business degree.rudi ability to move to germany is some evidence that romy relocating the boys to germany would not necessarily result in diminished contact between rudi and the boys.in certain situations,as here,a jury may consider evidence of the possibility and feasibility of a parallel move by a committed noncustodial parent as an alternative to restricting the custodial parent mobility.see tropea,at see rampolla rampolla.
the evidence also shows that even if rudi chose not to return to germany,he can adapt his work schedule to be with his children.during the summer of,rudi planned meetings in germany to coincide with romy visit there with the children.rudi also testified that in his job,he has the freedom to change his schedule.moreover,romy testified that if rudi decided to stay in texas,he could see oliver and dominic every vacation they have and when rudi is in germany.that rudi has the ability to continue visitation in germany allows romy and rudi to continue sharing the rights and duties of raising their two children.see.a declaring that state public policy is to encourage parents to share in the rights and duties of raising their child after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage.
the legislature expressed public policy considerations guide our analysis of the and standard in the relocation context,but no test can be formulated.suits affecting the relationship are intensely fact driven,which is why courts have developed tests that consider and balance numerous factors.see burgess,d,at e ach case must be evaluated on its own unique facts.yannas,at unless one is to apply a fixed but arbitrary rule,the issue can be resolved only on a case by case basis.cooper,at because they are,no two cases are the same and it is therefore essential that the trial court have the flexibility to deal with unforeseen fact patterns.given the many relevant factors,courts have explicitly rejected formulaic tests in relocation cases.see burgess,d,at w e recognize rules in this area are inappropriate.tropea,at rejecting exceptional circumstances test.
in this case,we conclude that romy produced evidence that oliver and dominic have strong ethnic and cultural ties to germany,maintain strong relationships with their extended family in germany,will benefit from romy incre
