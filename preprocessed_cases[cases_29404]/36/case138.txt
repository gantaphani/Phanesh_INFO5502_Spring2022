opinion of the court 
this is a battle for william knapp estate.it is in federal court because he kept much of his wealth in employee benefit trusts that were subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa.boiled down,plaintiff janice leckey,on behalf of herself and the estate of her deceased mother evelyn knapp who initiated this suit before she died,claims that both erisa and the terms of the various plans gave an interest in her husband erisa benefits.he,however,took distributions of almost all of his plan assets before he died without evelyn consent and placed them in trusts that paid her not the money.the remainder went,through william estate plan,to his children from a previous marriage.
in two granting partial summary judgment and one entering final judgment after a bench district court denied leckey any relief.this is a complicated case because it involves two different erisa plans and three different kinds of erisa causes of action.
one,brought under a,is a derivative suit to redress the loss to the plan itself when william allegedly withdrew assets improperly.a threshold question in this claim is whether he had a duty to seek evelyn consent before taking a distribution at all.the district court concluded that he did as a matter of law under the retirement equity act of rea,pub,stat.codified in scattered sections of titles and,an amendment to erisa.we disagree because we give effect to a treasury department regulation that interprets the act differently.we hold,rather,that whether the duty attached is a fact issue that depends on the contents of the plan instrument.unfortunately,because the plan instrument has been lost and the parties offer different versions,both of which are supported by some evidence,we must remand for a factual finding on this issue.we also vacate the district court findings that the plan itself suffered no loss because it is contrary to our holding in in re.erisa litigation,cir,and we vacate the court finding that william actions did not damage evelyn or leckey because it is clearly erroneous.
the second cause of action,brought under a,seeks equitable relief for william improper withdrawal from a different erisa plan.on this claim,the district court granted summary judgment to leckey on the issue of liability but did not believe it could grant a remedy after the bench trial.having examined the record and the law,we see no legal or factual impediment to imposing a constructive trust on traceable assets that were wrongfully withdrawn,and so we remand for consideration of that remedy 
facts procedural history 
as noted,janice leckey sues both in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of her mother evelyn knapp.the nominal defendants are paul stefano and frank jones as administrators of the estate of william knapp and trustees of his residuary trust,both of which are part of his unified estate plan.stefano and jones are pittsburgh attorneys appointed by the state probate court to act in these capacities.the real are charles knapp and linda sumser,william children by his first marriage and the primary beneficiaries of the residuary trusts.for ease of use,we refer to the defendants collectively as the residual beneficiaries throughout this opinion.
this dispute centers on the propriety of william removing certain assets from two trusts without evelyn written consent.the plans were operated by the american carbyde corporation amcarb,which william formed in.initially,amcarb had three owners william,charles knapp,and leckey.in november,charles knapp withdrew his interest by having amcarb buy back his interest,and william share rose to,leckey to.
before he formed amcarb,william had significant assets invested in the employee benefit plans of two former employers,both of which were in chapter bankruptcy liquidation in.all four plans in which william had assets were set to terminate,and so he created the amcarb profit sharing plan and a related amcarb profit sharing trust to allow him to continue deferring tax on his assets.he named himself administrator of the plan and trustee of the trust.he also named leckey a trustee of the trust,though she later testified that her role was almost entirely passive.
william transferred just over of assets into the profit sharing trust,all of which derived from his former employee benefit plans he effected this by taking a distribution of his accrued benefits in all previous plans,in effect rolling over assets in one set of plans to another.evelyn signed a written consent to the election,thus waiving her right to receive the benefits in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity qualified annuity.william was the only participant in the amcarb profit sharing plan,and amcarb never contributed anything to it,as it never achieved commercial success.
in,william withdrew some from the trust and placed the money in individual accounts.in,when he began winding up amcarb,he withdrew the balance and again placed the money in individual accounts.to effect the transfer,william hired attorney james wirtz.using the copy of the profit sharing plan and profit sharing trust instruments that william provided wirtz concluded that nothing prevented william from withdrawing the assets at his leisure.at william direction,wirtz developed a estate plan.important for our purposes is that william removed substantially all of the assets from the profit sharing trust though he did not formally wind it up and placed them in insurance trust b,a residuary trust that,upon his death,provided evelyn with income for life.after her death,the trust corpus was to go to the residual beneficiaries to repeat,william children from a previous marriage.the trust corpus is largely intact and will remain so until this litigation is resolved.
in,amcarb created a pension plan the amcarb pension plan and a related trust the amcarb pension trust.william named himself administrator of the pension plan and trustee of the pension trust.he and leckey were the only eligible participants.amcarb contributed a total of to the pension trust between and.in,william withdrew all of the money from the trust and placed it in individual accounts.upon realizing that leckey was entitled to some of the money,he transferred from his personal brokerage account back into the trust account and subsequently caused the trust to pay her that money.that same year he formally wound up amcarb,and the irs approved the termination of the pension plan effective december.
william died in,and evelyn and leckey brought this action in.the essential claim is that william wrongfully withdrew funds from both amcarb trusts and deposited them in personal accounts,which had the effect of depriving evelyn of the death benefits that she would have received had the funds remained in the trusts.this claim is based both on an erisa requirement that distributions be paid out in the form of a qualified annuity unless the spouse signs a written consent to an alternate form of distribution,as well as plan language to that effect.it is undisputed that william distributions did not take the form of qualified annuities.it is similarly undisputed that evelyn did not consent in writing to these alternate forms of distribution.
as noted,leckey translates these facts and allegations into three causes of action wrongful denial of benefits,a b breach of fiduciary duty causing a loss to the plan,a and a request for individual,equitable relief to redress a violation of the rea qualified annuity requirement,a.the district court granted summary judgment in leckey favor on the issue of whether the plans were subject to the erisa qualified annuity requirement.it then held a bench trial on the issues of whether william breached his fiduciary duties in bad faith,caused a loss to the plan,and damaged evelyn or leckey.following that trial,it concluded that william actions caused losses neither to the plan nor to the plaintiffs.therefore,it entered judgment in favor of the residual beneficiaries,and leckey appealed 
ii.the a b claim 
section a b allows erisa plan beneficiaries to sue their plans for benefits owed.for reasons we can not discern from the record,the district court did not award leckey relief under this section,and leckey does not press the matter on appeal thus,we shall not address this claim further.
iii.the a profit sharing trust 
section a allows plan beneficiaries to sue plan fiduciaries personally for breaching their fiduciary duties.a violation of those duties allows,by way of,three remedies making good on the loss caused by the breach,restoring any profits made using the assets of the plan,and any other equitable or remedial relief the court deems appropriate.section a actions are derivative in nature inasmuch as the plaintiff must assert a loss to the erisa plan itself not merely an individual claim for extracontractual damages.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d see also graden conexant,cir.consequently,the plan takes legal title to any recovery,which then inures to the benefit of the participants and beneficiaries who were injured.
here,leckey claims that william breached his fiduciary duty by withdrawing assets from the profit sharing trust in a form other than a qualified annuity without evelyn consent.the district court,however,ruled that this claim failed as a matter of law.to review that decision,we must resolve three issues whether william had a duty to take distributions only in the form of a qualified annuity if so,whether he breached that duty and if so,whether that breach caused a loss to the plan.we also address whether leckey or evelyn was damaged by william act and whether the district court properly ruled that any objection to the transfer is barred by the statute of limitations.
whether the profit sharing plan was subject to a qualified annuity requirement 
the retirement equity act 
resolving for summary judgment,the district court ruled that the rea required william to obtain evelyn consent before transferring money out of the profit sharing trust in a form other than a qualified annuity.
the rea amended erisa.its primary purpose was to protect surviving beneficiaries when their spouses predecease them.see,at,cong.under the rea,when a participant dies before becoming eligible to receive distributions of vested benefits,the surviving spouse is entitled to a qualified annuity.a.under prior law,it was permissible for plans to provide that participants dying before becoming eligible to take distributions forfeited all accrued and vested benefits,thus leaving their surviving spouses with nothing.in addition,the rea requires that plan fiduciaries pay out almost all benefits in the form of qualified annuities unless both spouses consent in writing to another form of distribution.a i n the case of a vested participant who does not die before the annuity starting date,the accrued benefit payable to such participant shall be provided in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity.requiring the written consent of the spouse was purposeful the senate finance committee wrote that it included the rule because the committee believes that a spouse should be involved in making choices with respect to retirement income on which the spouse may also rely.id.thus,it was congress intent not just to provide the spouse income in the form of a qualified annuity,but also to ensure that he or she had a right to be involved in decisions.
while the rea default rule that benefits must be paid out in the form of a qualified annuity applies to most erisa plans,plans meeting the following three conditions are exempt from the requirement 
i such plan provides that the participant nonforfeitable accrued benefit reduced by any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to such participant is payable in full,on the death of the participant,to the participant surviving spouse or,if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse consents in the manner required under subsection c of this section,to a designated beneficiary,
ii such participant does not elect the payment of benefits in the form of a life annuity,and 
iii with respect to such participant,such plan is not a direct or indirect transferee in a transfer after december,of a plan which is described in subparagraph a or b or to which this clause applied with respect to the participant.
b c.in layman terms,this means that,for a plan to be exempt,it must provide that accrued benefits go to the participant spouse on his death,not allow payment to the participant alone in the form of a life annuity,and not have received money from a plan subject to the qualified annuity requirement.
the parties agree that the profit sharing plan met prongs i and ii.the question is whether the plan was a transferee of plans to which the requirements applied.treasury department regulations that interpret the rea provide 
if through a merger,spinoff,or other transaction having the effect of a transfer,benefits subject to the qualified annuity requirements of sections a and are held under a plan that is not otherwise subject to such requirements,such benefits will be subject to the qualified annuity requirements even though they are held under such plan.even if a plan satisfies the qualified annuity requirements,other rules apply to these transactions a transfer made before january,and any rollover contribution made at any time,are not transactions that subject the transferee plan to the qualified annuity requirements with respect to a participant.if a plan is a transferee plan with respect to a participant,the qualified annuity requirements do not apply with respect to other plan participants solely because of the transfer.
a q a emphasis added.
as the district court ruled,this regulation seems to exempt rollover contributions from the class of transfers that can trigger the qualified annuity requirement.leckey argues that the court misread the regulation.specifically,she contends that the regulation merely provides that rollover contributions do not subject the entire plan to the qualified annuity requirement rollover contributions do,however,subject the individual participant to them.
this reading is untenable because the regulation specifically states that a rollover contribution is not a transaction that subjects the transferee plan to the requirements with respect to a participant.a q a.the wording of the regulation is obviously administrative argot,but the district court correctly concluded that it does not classify rollover contributions as transfers within the scope of b c.thus,rollovers do not trigger the joint and survivor annuity requirements at all.
the commissioner of internal revenue promulgated a pursuant to his power to prescribe all regulations necessary to the enforcement of the internal revenue code.specifically,the code regulates whether a plan qualifies for status,which turns in part on its compliance with the qualified annuity requirement.a.thus,it is within the power of the commissioner to promulgate regulations concerning whether an erisa plan complies with these requirements.
the question here is whether the regulation distinction between rollover contributions and transfers accords with congress intent in enacting b c.the commissioner,who is participating as amicus curiae,argues that the term rollover is used to describe a distribution of a participant benefits from an erisa trust followed by the participant contributing those benefits into another qualified erisa trust.
this definition is consistent with the code.section defines eligible rollover distributions as any distribution to an employee of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the employee in a qualified trust.c.eligible rollover distributions are excluded from income and thus not taxable if they are actually rolled over,contributed to another qualified retirement plan within days.c.thus,the commissioner definition of rollover as a distribution followed by a contribution between two qualified retirement plans comes directly from the code.it is important to note that rollovers are voluntary transactions that plan beneficiaries undertake for the purpose of deferring tax or shielding assets from creditors.see b excluding contributions to erisa plans from a debtor bankruptcy estate.
in contrast,the commissioner interprets transfer in b c as meaning an involuntary from the participant perspective movement of benefits among erisa incident to a merger,acquisition,or the like.he argues that this interpretation is sensible in light of how transfer is used in nearby sections of erisa.in g,erisa prevents employers from amending plans to decrease benefits in many circumstances.the provision applies to transfers and to plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a direct transfer,including consolidations of benefits attributable to different employers within a multiple employer plan.g b.this language suggests that transfer refers to involuntary movements of plan assets,not individual rollovers.moreover,this section uses the transferee plan language of to refer exclusively to involuntary transfers.
perhaps more on point,directly regulates plan mergers with the following language 
a pension plan may not merge or consolidate with,or transfer its assets or liabilities to,any other plan after september,unless each participant in the plan would if the plan then terminated receive a benefit immediately after the merger,consolidation,or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger,consolidation,or transfer if the plan had then terminated.
here again,erisa uses the word transfer to refer to involuntary movements of substantially all of a plan assets,not to voluntary,rollovers.
putting together the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole with the statutory interpretation canon ejusdem generis a general term following specific terms should be limited to things similar to the specific terms,we can conclude that erisa uses the word transfer to refer to involuntary movements of plan assets by plan administrators,not to distributions taken and reinvested by plan participants in another erisa plan.circuit city stores,adams,d w here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.quoting singer,sutherland on statutes and statutory construction king vincent,d see also tavarez klingensmith,cir noting that the rule of reading a statute as a whole and ejusdem generis can work together to make the meaning of a statute plain.
in addition,the commissioner argues that even if a plan receiving a rollover contribution is in some sense a transferee,it is not a transferee of a plan,as it must be for the qualified annuity requirement to attach.b c iii emphasis added.rather,it is a transferee of an individual.the text is ambiguous because it is not clear whether the phrase of a plan means merely that the transferred assets are in some way traceable to a previous erisa plan or that the plan itself,acting through its administrator,actively transferred the assets.the commissioner reading is persuasive because,in the rollover context,the plan from which the assets are transferred is entirely the point that calling the new plan its transferee is unnatural.the participant receives a distribution of his benefits free and clear of all encumbrances thus,the assets received are no longer attributable to the previous plan in any meaningful sense.
the commissioner also argues that the rea legislative history supports the distinction.the relevant house report explains that a plan not otherwise subject to the qualified annuity requirement becomes so if it receives a direct transfer of assets in connection with a merger,or conversion of the plan,or receives a direct transfer of assets solely with respect to a participant.pt,cong.from this it appears that congress intended to reach involuntary movements of assets,not voluntary contributions from a participant that came out of a previous distribution from another plan.
further supporting the commissioner arguments is that while employers can,under some circumstances,effect transfers of substantially all plan assets to other plans without the participants consent,rollovers are by definition voluntary on the participant part.thus,transferring assets from a plan to which the qualified annuity requirement applies to one to which it does not could effectively void the requirement.hence,b c iii prevents that result by applying the requirement to the transferee plan.rollovers,however,are a different story.when an employee receives a distribution from a plan subject to the qualified annuity requirement,it must come in the form of a qualified annuity unless the spouse consents at that time to have it paid in another form.here,william elected to take all of his distributions from his prior plans in form,and evelyn consented in writing to that election.app.at.thus,congress purpose of involving the spouse in the distribution decision was realized it would not further that purpose to subject the amcarb plans to the qualified annuity requirement.
given the use of transfer in other sections of erisa and the way the commissioner interpretation dovetails with the rea history and purpose,it easily passes muster.because we hold that a q a properly interprets the rea,we vacate the district court ruling that the regulation is invalid.applying the regulation to this case,we hold that the rea does not subject the profit sharing plan to the qualified annuity requirement.
the profit sharing plan instrument 
in the alternative,leckey argues that the profit sharing plan instrument contained qualified annuity provisions.she relies on one version of the profit sharing plan instrument.the residual beneficiaries counter that leckey version was never adopted by amcarb board and is therefore invalid.the question we resolve is whether the record evidence supports granting summary judgment on this issue for either if so,we will not waste the parties time with a remand.
at trial,leckey called richard cramer,william personal attorney.cramer testified that he drafted the profit sharing plan and profit sharing trust instruments at william direction.leckey submitted a version of the plan that contained qualified annuity language the cover page and the first page of the body of the plan are dated.the table of contents,however,which is between the cover page and the body text,is dated.based on the date on the body of the plan and not on personal recollection,cramer testified that this version was in force no later than july.specifically,he testified that it was his firm practice at the time scrupulously to type onto each draft the last date on which it was revised.leckey also put in evidence a letter from cramer to william dated july.the letter states that it includes the latest draft of the plan,trust instrument,a board resolution adopting the plan,and various other documents for him to sign and return.leckey then admitted in evidence a letter dated july,from edward leckey another of william attorneys,stating that he had enclosed executed copies of the documents sent on july.unfortunately,the enclosures themselves were lost,so cramer could not produce them,but he testified that he believed that an executed board resolution was enclosed.
on,the residual beneficiaries submitted a june,letter from cramer to william and the enclosed draft of the profit sharing plan.this version did not have a qualified annuity requirement rather,it allowed william to have his benefits paid out in any form he chose.next,they submitted a june,memorandum from cramer to his file.according to it,cramer spoke with edward leckey that day about the profit sharing plan.edward leckey told him that william and his son charles were having a variety of disagreements over the business and that william might turn the business over to charles earlier than expected.because of this,william was concerned about charles being able to take control of the profit sharing plan,which william wanted to avoid,as virtually all of the money in it was his.the june version of the plan allowed the amcarb board to remove the profit sharing trust trustees and the profit sharing plan administrator at any time.thus,william wanted the plan and trust instruments redrafted to protect his positions in the event of a change in corporate control.
the residual beneficiaries also put in evidence a letter from cramer to william dated june,stating that it enclosed revised versions of the profit sharing plan and profit sharing trust instruments.specifically,the letter stated t he documents now designate you william as trustee and prevent your removal absent judicial determination of cause for removal.they further put in evidence the version of the plan instrument sent with the june letter it contained revisions consistent with the transmittal letter.it did not include a qualified annuity requirement.next,the residual beneficiaries submitted a june,letter from edward leckey to cramer,stating that enclosed were an executed copy of the profit sharing trust instrument,an executed board resolution adopting the new profit sharing plan,and the altered pages of the plan instrument.the letter also indicated that william would like additional revision to secure the trustees ability to administer and dispose the assets in the trust.this letter,cramer testified,was the impetus for making the revisions contained in the july,version and for sending his july,letter to william.cramer acknowledged that his july,letter referenced changes to the plan administrator and trustees powers but did not mention the addition of a qualified annuity requirement.moreover,cramer testified that he did not actually remember when he added that requirement he merely surmised from the date on the body of the plan that its addition must have been part of the july round of the revisions.he did not recall so much as speaking with william or edward leckey about the requirement.
the residual beneficiaries questioned cramer about an irs form that his firm submitted on june,requesting a determination that the profit sharing plan was qualified for status.next to a question asking whether the plan defines the term joint and survivor annuity,neither the yes nor the no box was checked.next to a question asking how distribution may be made,the boxes lump sum and substantially equal installments were checked the annuity contracts box was not checked.next to the question does this plan comply with the payment of benefits provisions of section a,which is the code qualified annuity requirement,was typed in.in various places on the form,the responses referenced sections of the profit sharing plan.when compared to the alleged july version with the qualified annuity requirement,the page number references were often off by a page or two.
on redirect,leckey put in evidence a copy of the plan instrument that was certified by the irs as the version in its files.it contained the qualified annuity requirement and was identical to leckey alleged july version.moreover,on a schedule of the irs form which,cramer testified,would have been submitted with the form itself,though it bore no date,the response referenced section of the section with the qualified annuity requirement,and referenced the correct page number for that section on the alleged july version.
aside from cramer testimony and the related exhibits,the only other relevant evidence offered at trial was james wirtz testimony that the copy of the profit sharing plan that william gave him did not contain the qualified annuity language.william hired wirtz for advice on removing assets from the profit sharing trust and pension trust.the district court,without concluding which copy of the profit sharing plan was actually in force found that william did not intentionally mislead wirtz by providing him a copy without the qualified annuity language.
from all this evidence,the only thing clear is that which plan was in force is a material,disputed issue of fact with credible evidence on both sides of the question.thus,summary judgment would not be appropriate,see.c,and we must remand for the district court to make a factual finding on this issue.
the district court,citing our opinion in burke latrobe steel,cir,ruled that in an erisa claim based on failure to follow the terms of the plan instrument,the plaintiff must show that the trustee failed to do so in bad faith.we believe that the court read burke too broadly.in firestone,the supreme court wrote that trust law fills in the details of erisa fiduciaries duties and how courts review their actions.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.the second restatement,in a section that the firestone court quoted and relied on,explains the degree of fault required to establish a trustee breach of fiduciary duty 
scope of the rule.ordinarily a trustee does not commit a breach of trust if he does not intentionally or negligently do what he ought not to do or fail to do what he ought to do.in other words,he does not commit a breach of trust unless he is personally at fault.he may,however,commit a breach of trust where he is not personally at fault,as where he acts under a mistake of law or fact,as is stated in the comments which follow.
mistake of law as to existence of duties and powers.a trustee commits a breach of trust not only where he violates a duty in bad faith,or intentionally although in good faith,or negligently,but also where he violates a duty because of a mistake as to the extent of his duties and powers.this is true not only where his mistake is in regard to a rule of law,whether a statutory or rule,but also where he interprets the trust instrument as authorizing him to do acts which the court determines he is not authorized by the instrument to do.in such a case,he is not protected from liability merely because he acts in good faith,nor is he protected merely because he relies upon the advice of counsel.if he is in doubt as to the interpretation of the instrument,he can protect himself by obtaining instructions from the court.the extent of his duties and powers is determined by the trust instrument and the rules of law which are applicable,and not by his own interpretation of the instrument or his own belief as to the rules of law.
mistake of fact or law in the exercise of powers or performance of duties.when the question whether the trustee has committed a breach of trust depends not upon the extent of his powers and duties,but upon whether he has acted with proper care or caution,the mere fact that he has made a mistake of fact or of law in the exercise of his powers or performance of his duties does not render him liable for breach of trust.in such a case he is liable for breach of trust if he is negligent,but not if he acts with proper care and caution.
thus,if the trustee is authorized to invest trust funds in such securities as a prudent man would purchase,he is not liable if he invests in bonds which on the facts known to him are the sort in which prudent men would invest,although,owing to facts which he did not know and was not negligent in not knowing,the bonds were not in fact properly secured.
restatement second of trusts cmts.thus,when a trustee exercises his authority,a mere mistake will not render him liable for a loss.only the form of bad faith or.when,on the other hand,a trustee takes action that exceeds his authority,he is strictly liable for any loss and accountable for any profit.while this may seem harsh,a trustee who is in doubt as to the interpretation of the instrument can protect himself by obtaining instructions from the court.firestone,at.citing bogert bogert,law of trusts and trustees ed.restatement second of trusts cmt.b united states mason,d.
our prior decision in burke dealt with a mistake in the exercise of the trustee powers the plaintiffs accused the administrator of improperly denying their claim for pension benefits when they refused to comply with a request.determining who is eligible for from being ultra one of a plan administrator key functions.see a b.thus,burke held that to allege properly a breach of fiduciary duty,a plaintiff must allege more than mere error in discharging that duty.burke,at.rather,he must allege some kind of fault.id.
in our case,william allegedly distributed trust assets in an unauthorized form.if true,this is a mistake in the extent of his powers,not in his exercise of them.thus,following the restatement as firestone requires,fault is not an element of the breach.firestone,at.quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.b.moreover,even under a fault standard,leckey has met her burden because an administrator who breaches clear and unambiguous language in the plan is not relieved of liability by acting in good faith,burke,at citing delgrosso spang,cir see also restatement second of trusts cmt.c.if leckey is correct that the plan included a qualified annuity requirement,the language of that requirement was clear 
u nless the participant elects otherwise in the manner provided herein,the normal form of benefit distribution for a married participant shall be a qualified joint and survivor annuity in order for a waiver of a qualified joint and survivor annuity to be effective,the waiver must be in writing and must be consented to by the participant spouse.the spouse consent to a waiver must be witnessed by a plan representative or notary public.app.at.given the clarity of this requirement,failing to follow it establishes fault under our precedent.
we reject the district court finding that confusion over which version of the plan instrument was in place could somehow justify william actions.at all relevant times,he was administrator of the amcarb profit sharing plan,trustee of the amcarb profit sharing trust,and controlling shareholder and president of amcarb.he directed the creation of the plan and trust,oversaw the various revisions,administered both,and presided over and controlled the board that adopted it.in short,any confusion as to which version the amcarb board put into effect was william own creation.to use this confusion to excuse the breach of fiduciary duties owed to a plan beneficiary would turn erisa and trust law topsy.
in addition,william is ineligible for the advice of counsel defense.even if it is available in this context and the restatement disavows it,an element of the defense is providing the attorney with complete and accurate information.see howard shay,cir accord chao hall holding,cir adopting howard.it is undisputed that william did not provide to wirtz the alleged july,version of the plan.if that were the plan adopted by the amcarb board,then william did not provide complete and accurate information,and so seeking and following the advice of counsel can not exonerate him.
loss to the plan 
the district court,applying its findings of fact to erisa law,concluded that william breach did not cause a loss to the profit sharing plan.in analyzing whether that finding is wrong,we begin with the text of a.it allows beneficiaries to sue for appropriate relief under section.section states,in relevant part,that a ny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.from this,the elements of a a claim appear to be a plan fiduciary breaches an duty causing a loss to the plan.see roth lumber,cir.assuming that the plan contained a qualified annuity requirement,we have already explained that william was a plan fiduciary and that he breached his duty with the requisite level of fault.as to the third element,the supreme court held in massachusetts mutual that a actions must be brought on behalf of the plan must,therefore,seek to restore losses to the plan.mut.life ins,at.it is not a vehicle for individual relief rather,a and provide individual relief.see life annuity ins.knudson,d holding that a provides individual,equitable relief a b providing for individual recovery of wrongly withheld benefits.this is,of course,not to say that beneficiaries should not expect to benefit from a actions.as beneficiaries,any assets restored to the plan will be distributed to them in accordance with the plan instrument.
the question,then,is whether william breach caused a loss to the plan.explaining how district courts should determine whether there has been a loss to the plan,the eighth circuit court of appeals has counseled that a comparison must be made between the value of the plan assets before and after the breach.roth,at.here,the comparison is stark before william withdrew assets from the plan,it held nearly when he finished,it was all but bereft of assets.hence,a loss to the plan.
the residual beneficiaries argue,however,that this action is a paradigm for individual recovery,not recovery on behalf of the plan,as william breach only took assets out of one participant account.indeed,the profit sharing plan only had one participant,so any loss to the plan is also a loss to one person account.in,at,we held that losses need not be to all plan beneficiaries to be attributable to the plan in the a sense rather,it is possible for a loss to the plan to affect only a subset of beneficiaries.id.in that case,the plaintiffs were former employees who had selected a particular investment package in their employer k that they alleged was imprudent and should not have been offered.we held that the investment losses,though allocated to individual accounts,were still suffered by the plan,and so a was available.under that logic,had but one person selected the imprudent package,he still would have been able to bring suit.thus,there is nothing per se improper about an a suit in which the plan suffers a loss that happens only to affect one individual account.this result seems all the more correct in the context of a plan.we can not imagine that congress intended to cut off a liability which is,in most cases,the only means for recovering personally from a breaching fiduciary because of the happenstance that the plan has only one participant.
the residual beneficiaries do,however,cite cases that emphasize the number of people affected by the alleged breach of duty.in particular,they cite larue dewolff,boberg,clarified on panel reh g,cir,in which the fourth circuit court of appeals held that an individual alleging that his plan account lost money because the administrator failed to carry out his investment instructions does not assert a loss to the plan.larue is complicated by the fact that the plaintiff did not argue to the district court a a violation,and did not plead a loss to the plan.still,larue is in tension with because it emphasizes that the loss only affected one beneficiary,whereas we read as focusing on whether the plan itself actually lost money no matter the number of individual accounts affected the residual beneficiaries also cite matassarin lynch,cir,in which the fifth circuit court of appeals held that a a claim could not proceed because it would only inure to the benefit of some of the plan beneficiaries.the rationale,however,is principally that there was no loss at all.thus we do not read it as disagreeing with our decision in.
the other cases that the residual beneficiaries cite do not support their position.in horan kaiser steel retirement plan,cir,the plaintiffs did not claim that the administrators decision to pay benefits directly rather than by purchasing an annuity had harmed the plan in fact,the court pointed out that it had improved the plan bottom line.here,on the other hand,william left the plan nearly bereft of assets.similarly,in lee burkhart,cir,the plaintiffs sought individual damages stemming from the administrator failure to give notice as to how the plan was funded there was no colorable allegation of loss to the plan.
in sum,we follow the text a provides a proper cause of action when a beneficiary can show a loss suffered by the plan.nothing in the text makes the number of beneficiaries affected relevant.here,assuming leckey version of the plan instrument,william improperly emptied the plan of assets.that loss was suffered by the plan,and so a is available.the district court findings to the contrary were premised on a misunderstanding of the law,and we vacate them.
at trial,the residual beneficiaries introduced evidence showing that william placed the assets that he took out of the profit sharing trust into a residuary trust that provided evelyn income for life principal to the residual beneficiaries upon his death.from that trust she received some while she was alive.the beneficiar
