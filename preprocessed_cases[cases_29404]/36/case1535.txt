cristian appeals from an order terminating his parental rights and finding his son brian likely to be adopted.cristian contends the order is not supported by substantial evidence.we conclude a parent may challenge the sufficiency of evidence supporting a child adoptability,despite the parent failure to raise the argument below.because substantial evidence does not support the juvenile court finding of adoptability,we reverse.
background 
brian was born in.he was declared a dependent of the juvenile court on november.on march,the court terminated brian mother reunification services and set a hearing under welfare and institutions code,section for june.no services had been ordered for cristian,because the social services agency the agency had been unable to locate him and his paternity had not been established.a status review report prepared on january noted the minor was first assessed for adoption on june,and at that time the minor was approved for adoptive services because of lack of parental compliance with the case plan.the minor was reassessed on and found to be a proper subject for adoption.
on june,the agency filed a memorandum stating that the section hearing needed to be continued,because cristian had come forward and contacted the child welfare worker.the worker reported that cristian told her he was an undocumented alien,and brian mother,janelle,had continually stated that she would contact immigration services to have him deported if he attempted to have contact with brian.cristian told the worker he had relatives who were legal residents,and he was interested in having them adopt brian if possible.the worker stated that cristian,who was not identified as the father on brian birth certificate,needs the opportunity to establish paternity.
the hearing was continued until august,and counsel was appointed for cristian.the report for the section hearing was dated august.the child welfare worker who prepared the report had only recently been assigned to the case,on july.the worker recommended a permanent plan of long term foster care at the present time,while the agency looked for an adoptive home.the report noted that brian foster mother was not interested in adopting him.a maternal cousin was considering adoption.a referral had been made to the agency adoption unit,and the agency would be looking for an adoptive home.but the worker stated t here is not clear and convincing evidence that it is likely the child will be adopted at this time.
the worker noted that brian,now four and a half years old,has made excellent progress over the past year.he is almost able to dress himself,and is now toilet trained.brian has begun to speak and his gait has improved.the report described brian as cautious but friendly with adults,and it takes him some time to warm up and trust adults.he appears to enjoy the attention from his foster mother large extended family.he especially enjoys playing with the year old,and he has emerged even more from his protective shell.when playing he can be just as loud and rambunctious as any other child his age.brian did not make a statement for the report,because a lthough brian is speaking more now,he has been unable to make a statement.brian smiles,and gestures to his foster mother give the appearance that he is receiving the nurturing that he needs.
as for the likelihood of adoption,the worker repeated verbatim the january report of assessments performed on june and january,and added the agency is looking for an adoptive home,and the maternal cousin is still considering adoption.the likelihood of adoption is very good,but it is not im minent at this time.the worker also noted if paternity is established,the father relatives may be considered for placement as well.
two reports from a social worker associated with the foster family agency,dated march and may,were appended to the section hearing report.both expressed concern over the negative effects of brian visitation with his mother janelle,who frequently failed to appear for visits.the may report noted that when brian was first placed in foster care at the age of two and a half,he was sickly and developmentally delayed.he did not speak,walked with an unsteady gait and could not even attempt to dress himself.however,almost t wo years after placement brian has blossomed into a happy,healthy little boy,who loves learning in and playing with his peers.the march report stated brian continues to improve developmentally.his gait is becoming less awkward and his speech improves daily.this report also noted he is eating and sleeping well,dresses himself,and has been successfully toilet trained.
at the hearing on august,cristian appeared before the court.janelle did not.county counsel explained to the court that the recommendation in the report for a permanent plan of foster care was incorrect.the reason for the confusion was cristian recent appearance in the proceedings.his paternity had been confirmed just prior to the hearing.counsel asked the court for a continuance of the section hearing so that cristian relatives could be assessed as potential adoptive parents.
the court responded that brian had been deemed adoptable when the hearing was set,and unless there were some change in the agency position,then i do see a basis for a change in the recommendation.counsel assured the court that the agency does agree that the minor is adoptable,but said the agency wanted a continuance for the purpose of finding an adoptive home.janelle counsel noted that if we terminate parental rights,we have the danger of creating a judicial orphan with no adoptive home in sight.the court,however,pointed out that a prospective adoptive home is not a prerequisite for terminating parental rights,and stated it was prepared to hear this as a contested matter.cristian counsel advised the court that his client was living with his aunt,and wanted her to be considered as a suitable placement.the court stated that placement issues were not before it at this hearing,and were not grounds for a continuance.
the child welfare worker who prepared the section hearing report testified briefly.she said she had intended to recommend continued foster care when she wrote the report,but realized she had made an error after speaking to counsel,who informed her that w e were recommending termination of parental rights.the worker also retracted,with some confusion,her proposed finding on the lack of clear and convincing evidence of adoptability 
cristian also testified briefly.he said he first learned brian was in foster care about six months before the section hearing.janelle would not tell him where brian was,though.she only wanted money from cristian.he had last seen brian a long time ago.he had asked for custody repeatedly,but janelle always said no.
in closing,county counsel made no mention of brian adoptability,but asked the court to terminate parental rights because cristian had made insufficient efforts to care for brian,had no parental bond,and had not seen brian for six months.counsel pointed out that janelle had also failed to bond with brian,her visitation had been detrimental for the child,and she had failed to appear for the hearing.
cristian counsel complained that the case was fraught with various errors.he protested that cristian had not been properly notified of earlier hearings,and had never been provided with reunification services.counsel also objected that he had only received the section hearing report the day before the hearing.
janelle counsel again argued that the court should not engage in creating judicial orphans.he urged the court to follow the report recommendation of foster care.
brian counsel said he gave special credence to the part of the report finding the likelihood of adoption very good if not imminent.he urged the court to establish adoption as the permanent plan.
the court found there was clear and convincing evidence that brian was likely to be adopted.it terminated the parental rights of cristian and janelle,and prohibited any visitation.the court noted that the agency was required to evaluate any relatives who were interested in being considered as adoptive parents.
