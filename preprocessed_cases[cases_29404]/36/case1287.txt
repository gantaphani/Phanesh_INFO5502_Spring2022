introduction 
in this consolidated appeal and petition for a writ of habeas corpus,maria maria challenges an order and judgment of the juvenile court terminating her parental rights to michelle michelle after a hearing pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.maria maintains that the trial court violated her constitutional due process rights and her right to counsel by proceeding to terminate her parental rights despite the fact that neither she nor her attorney were present at the selection and implementation hearing.we conclude that the court violated maria constitutional rights by terminating her parental rights at a hearing at which neither she nor her attorney were present,in the absence of a waiver,express or implied,of her right to be represented by counsel or to be heard,and that the error is a structural one that requires automatic reversal.
the process itself was so fundamentally flawed and unfair that a court could not perform a harmless error analysis even if it were so inclined,because the resulting record is so limited.because neither maria or her attorney were present at the section hearing,the record contains nothing regarding maria position.further,the court made no findings,either orally or in writing,to support its ultimate conclusion that it is likely michelle will be adopted.this lack of findings is confirmation that the process here was entirely one sided and fundamentally unfair.
factual and procedural background 
michelle was born premature on october.she had a number of medical complications,and remained at children hospital in san diego from the time of her birth until her release on december.
on january,the imperial county department of social services dss filed a section petition alleging that maria failed to obtain prenatal care while she was pregnant with michelle and that she was not following through with proper medical care for michelle after the birth.the petition also alleged that maria told the social worker she had used drugs three months before the petition was filed,and that michelle had tested positive for opiates at birth.
the court held a detention hearing on january,and ultimately ordered that michelle be detained.maria,who was represented by appointed counsel from the public defender office was present at the hearing.the court set the matter for both pretrial and jurisdictional hearings.
after the jurisdictional hearing was continued a number of times,the county counsel moved to dismiss the petition without prejudice on april.the court granted the motion and the detention orders were vacated.
on april,dss filed another section petition alleging facts substantially similar to those alleged in the previous petition.the court held a detention hearing on april,and again ordered that michelle be detained.maria was not present at this hearing,but she was represented at the hearing by her attorney,william roche.the court set the matter for a pretrial hearing and a jurisdictional hearing.
the alleged father,ramiro ramiro,made his first appearance at a pretrial conference on july.the court appointed counsel to represent him.
on july,the jurisdictional report was filed.the report included a history of michelle medical problems and noted that maria had resisted dss offers to provide her with services.according to the report,maria had not availed herself of services offered by the hospital,such as transportation to michelle medical appointments and support group meetings,and she had not requested information about michelle condition.maria continued to blame the hospital for michelle positive drug test results.the report also stated that maria continued to refuse to submit to any drug testing,despite the fact that on three different occasions the court had ordered her to do so.the report also noted that ramiro had not contacted dss since his first appearance in the matter.
the jurisdictional hearing was held on august.although maria was not present,she was represented at the hearing by her attorney.maria attorney requested a continuance because maria was not present.the court denied the request and sustained the petition.the matter was then set for a dispositional hearing.
a disposition report was filed on september.the report recommended that maria receive family reunification services,including a parenting class and individual counseling.the report also suggested that maria complete a drug rehabilitation program,submit to random drug testing,cooperate with the social worker,report changes of address,telephone or other living arrangements,complete an anger management program,and complete a medical training course,among other things.the dispositional hearing was held on september.maria and her attorney were present.ramiro was not present.the court ordered that maria receive reunification services,but did not order services for ramiro.the court scheduled a review hearing pursuant to section,subdivision e for december.
the section,subdivision e hearing was held on january.both maria and her attorney were present at that hearing.the status review report,filed on december,stated that michelle had been placed in a licensed foster home for medically fragile children.it recommended that michelle not be returned to maria and that reunification services be terminated because maria had not completed a parenting class,had not participated in individual counseling,and had not participated in either an inpatient or outpatient drug rehabilitation program.the report also noted that maria still had not submitted to a drug test and that she had failed to complete an anger management course.the court found that maria had made only minimal progress in her reunification plan and concluded that michelle should not be returned to maria.the court terminated maria family reunification services,and scheduled a selection and implementation hearing,pursuant to section,for may.
a section report was filed on may.the report stated that michelle was showing improvement,but that she continued to have medical problems and was possibly mildly developmentally delayed.the report noted that dss had facilitated monthly visits between michelle and maria,and that maria occasionally brought her son anthony with her to the visits.according to the report,michelle appeared extremely content and well adjusted with her foster parents and did not seem affected by maria absence.the report also discussed maria drug testing,noting that she had tested negative on a urine test and that the results of a hair follicle test were still pending at the time the report was written.the report recommended adoption as the permanent plan for michelle.her foster parents had expressed an interest in adopting her and they had been providing a safe and stable home for her since january.
on may,with both maria and her attorney present,the section hearing was continued to june.maria and her attorney were again present on june,when the hearing was continued to august,at the request of dss,so that the department could have the opportunity to serve ramiro with notice of the hearing.maria attorney requested that visitation between maria and michelle continue,and the court granted the request.
neither maria nor her attorney appeared in court on august.maria had informed the social worker prior to the hearing that she would not be able to attend the hearing because of a problem that had arisen over the weekend.the court stated on the record that someone from attorney roche office had called to inform the court that attorney roche was in trial and,according to the court ha d made no arrangement to have someone cover his calendar.
attorney roche secretary had called a court clerk that morning to inform the court that attorney roche was involved in a trial that was taking longer than he had expected,and that he would appear in juvenile court as soon as the trial ended she also gave the clerk the telephone number of the department in which attorney roche trial was taking place so that the court could contact him if necessary.the court clerk did not indicate to attorney roche secretary that the court would proceed with the termination hearing without attorney roche.attorney roche expected that the court would trail the matter or continue it,as was the custom and practice he had encountered from courts when scheduling conflicts arose.the trial court did not contact attorney roche at his office or at the number he provided to the court to inform him that the matter would not be trailed.
despite the fact that neither maria nor her attorney were present,the court proceeded with the selection and implementation hearing.dss submitted the matter after offering in evidence the section report and the proofs of service of notice on the parents.counsel for michelle submitted without offering any evidence or testimony.
the court found that notice of the original section hearing had been given as required by law and that notice of the continuance dates had also been provided.the court concluded that clear and convincing evidence established that michelle was adoptable and that she was likely to be adopted.the court terminated both maria and ramiro parental rights.through counsel,maria filed a notice of appeal on august.on december,she filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which she makes essentially the same arguments as she does in her appeal.the matters were consolidated in this court on june.
discussiona.the trial court violated maria due process rights by proceeding with the selection and implementation hearing when neither maria nor her attorney were present 
f reedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.santosky kramer,d santosky.in an action initiated by the state to terminate parental rights,the private interest at stake is a parent fundamental and commanding liberty interest in maintaining a relationship with the child.id.at.it is plain beyond the need for multiple citation that a natural parent desire for and right to the companionship,care,custody,and management of his or her children is an interest far more precious than any property right.citation.ibid.
impairment of this fundamental right requires strict adherence to procedural due process rights,focusing on the fairness of the proceedings.in re crystal th,d.determining what satisfies the requirements of due process is an uncertain enterprise in which courts must discover what fundamental fairness consists of in a particular situation by first considering any relevant precedents and then by assessing the several interests that are at stake.lassiter department of social services,d lassiter.in juvenile dependency proceedings,as in other proceedings that would deprive an individual of important rights,due process takes the form of the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.see in re matthew th,d.moreover,the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.citation.fuentes shevin,d.
in order to ensure that the right to notice and the right to be heard are granted in a meaningful manner,s ignificant safeguards have been built into the current dependency scheme.in re marilyn cal th,d.these safeguards include representation by counsel to assist parents at every stage of the proceedings,notice of all hearings and rights,clear and convincing evidence for removal from custody,subd.b,reunification services,and review hearings at which services and progress are reviewed.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.
the manner in which the trial court terminated maria parental rights implicates due process concerns in two ways.first,the trial court deprived maria of any assistance of counsel by proceeding with the selection and implementation hearing in the absence of her attorney,when maria had not waived her right to be represented by counsel,either expressly or impliedly.more significantly,by proceeding with the hearing when neither maria nor her attorney were present,the trial court deprived maria of a fundamental due process opportunity to be heard.
the right to the effective assistance of counsel 
although in california a parent right to counsel in dependency proceedings generally derives from statute and,a parent may also have a constitutional right to counsel at some stages of dependency proceedings.in re th,d in re,citing lassiter,supra,at.applying three elements given in mathews eldridge,d,in deciding what due process requires in dependency proceedings.to determine whether a parent has a constitutional right to counsel at any particular point during the dependency proceedings,courts evaluate and weigh the private interests at stake,the government interest,and the risk that the procedures used will lead to an erroneous decision.lassiter,supra,at.
the appointment of counsel is a constitutional imperative only when,in the estimation of the court in which the matter is pending subject to appellate review,fundamental fairness requires such appointment.citation.in re meranda th,fn,d.in lassiter,a plurality of the court determined that the decision whether due process calls for the appointment of counsel of indigent parents in termination proceedings is to be answered in the first instance by the trial court,subject,of course,to appellate review.lassiter,supra,at.therefore,each court must independently evaluate the private interests at stake,the government interest,and the risk that the procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions in each case,balanc ing these elements against each other,and then set ting their net weight in the scales against the presumption that there is a right to appointed counsel only when personal freedom is at stake.id.at.
the lassiter court further determined that a trial or appellate court faced with deciding whether due process requires the appointment of counsel need not ignore a parent plain demonstration that she is not interested in attending a hearing.lassiter,supra,at.because the mother in lassiter had expressly declined to appear at a previous custody hearing,and had not even bothered to speak to her retained lawyer after being notified of the termination hearing,the high court agreed with the trial court that she lacked any real interest in participating in the proceedings.ibid.the supreme court concluded that in view of all of these circumstances,the trial court had not erred in failing to appoint counsel for lassiter.ibid.
although the court in this case did appoint counsel to represent maria,in our view,the lassiter analysis of the due process issue applies since the purpose of appointing counsel in dependency proceedings is to ensure that the parent whose rights are at stake will be assisted by and represented by counsel throughout the dependency proceedings,thereby safeguarding the parent right to be heard.here,proceeding with the selection and implementation hearing in the absence of maria attorney had the same effect as if the court had failed to appoint counsel for her.we conclude that in this case,proceeding with the selection and implementation hearing in the absence of maria and her counsel violated maria constitutional right to due process.
maria demonstrated that she had a significant personal interest in maintaining a relationship with michelle.unlike the mother in lassiter who had indicated no interest in participating in the dependency process,failed to inform her retained attorney about the termination hearing,and expressly requested not to be present at a prior proceeding,both maria and her attorney were present at the section,subdivision e hearing and at the originally scheduled section hearing on may.she and her attorney were also present at the first rescheduled section hearing on june.it was at the behest of maria or her the june hearing was continued to august,the date on which the trial court terminated her parental rights.while the state may have an interest in resolving michelle status expeditiously,any interest the state has in resolving michelle status without delay is insignificant in comparison to maria compelling interests,particularly considering that the state agreed to the first continuance of the hearing,and that it was the state that requested the second continuance.
the court terminated maria parental rights at a hearing at which she was not represented at all,despite the fact that she had an appointed attorney who had been present at previous dependency proceedings.holding a section hearing in the absence of a parent appointed attorney means that the proceeding may be completely.any decision rendered under these circumstances is inherently unreliable by hearing only one side presentation of evidence,the outcome of the case is necessarily skewed.salas cortez cal d,by intervening heavily on behalf of a mother in a paternity determination case,state has skewed the outcome and due process requires indigent defendant be appointed counsel.even if the case does not involve complex issues of law,the determination of what is best for the child can be an exceedingly difficult one that requires a process of balancing many complex and competing considerations that are unique in every case in these circumstances,a parent who does not have the assistance of counsel will be at a decisive disadvantage,thus significantly increasing the risks of an erroneous result 
california courts have determined that an indigent parent right to the assistance of counsel is more than the right to have an attorney assigned to one case.it requires that the parent be assisted by counsel during court proceedings.when due process requires the appointment of counsel,the person represented is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel otherwise it will be a hollow right.citations.in re kristin th,d.if he had been present,maria attorney could have assisted her by presenting her position regarding the possible termination of her parental rights.unlike the situation in lassiter,in which the mother was in court and able to present her position,for maria,the assistance of her attorney would have been significant because there was no one else at the hearing who could present maria position.see lassiter,supra,at.certainly,at a minimum,terminating parental rights at a hearing at which the parent attorney is not present,when that parent has an attorney and has not waived the right to be represented by counsel at the hearing,either expressly or impliedly,constitutes a deprivation of the effective assistance of counsel.
here,the parental rights at issue are considered to be fundamental and commanding santosky,supra,at,and the proceeding could have resulted,and in fact did result,in the complete termination of these fundamental rights.although the dissent maintains that a parent rights at the section hearing are significantly diminished compared to the fundamental parental rights at stake during the dispositional process dis,post,it is worth noting what does remain at stake for a parent at the section hearing.at issue at the hearing is whether adoption will be ordered,or rather,whether one of the statutory exceptions to adoption applies,and thus another disposition such as guardianship or foster care is appropriate,subd.b.only adoption entails the termination of parental rights.the right to custody of a child is but one aspect of the complex concept we know as the relationship,since it is undeniable that a parent interest in the relationship goes beyond an interest in having custody of a child.as one commentator has succinctly described it,the essence of the right to a relationship recognized by courts is,more fundamentally,the right to know and be known by one child.meyer,family ties solving the constitutional dilemma of the faultless father.thus,the parent continues to have a strong interest in the fundamental right to maintain the bond in re jasmon cal th,d,even after reunification services have ended.we conclude that under the circumstances in this case,the court deprived maria of her right to the assistance of counsel at the section hearing as derived from the united states constitution see in re,supra,th at,d see also in re kristin,supra,th at,d.
the right to a meaningful hearing and the opportunity to be heard 
what makes the circumstances of this case unique is that in going forward with the section hearing in the absence of both maria and her attorney,the court deprived maria of any meaningful opportunity to be heard in the matter,and thus denied maria her constitutional right to due process of law.fundamental fairness requires that a mother who may lose all rights to parent her child be given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before a court terminates her parental rights.this is why,in the context of child dependency litigation,evaluations of due process requirements focus on the right to a hearing and the right to be notified of the hearing.see,in re cal d,failure to give mother notice of hearing was a deprivation of due process.a hearing denotes an opportunity to be heard and to adduce testimony from witnesses.moreover,parties in civil proceedings have a due process right to and confront witnesses.citation.in re james th,d.thus it has been held that the failure to provide parents with a copy of the social worker report,upon which the court will rely in coming to a decision,constitutes a denial of due process.in re george d.see also in re jeanette th,d.
although the ultimate goal in dependency cases is to do what is best for the child,dependency proceedings are,nevertheless,fundamentally adversarial in nature.citation.in re kristin,supra,th at,d in re charles th,d p roceedings,particularly when termination of parental rights may result,are accusatory in nature as to the parent.in these proceedings,t he governmental agency is represented by its own counsel and employs professional social workers who are empowered to investigate the family situation and to testify against the parent.moreover,the possible end result of the process,namely the total and irrevocable severance of the relationship,has been acknowledged as a punitive sanction.in re kristin,supra,th at,d.the adversary system presupposes that accurate and just results are most likely to be obtained through the equal contest of opposed interests.lassiter,supra,at,italics added.in this case,proceeding without either maria attorney or maria herself being present deprived maria of any opportunity to participate in the termination hearing.we conclude that the juvenile court failure to postpone the hearing until maria her attorney could be present resulted in a miscarriage of justice and constituted a violation of maria due process rights.
b.the error requires reversal 
dss concedes that the trial court may have erred in proceeding with the hearing in maria sic her counsel absence however,dss contends that the court error was harmless because there was substantial evidence to support the court order terminating parental rights under a standard of either proof a beyond a reasonable doubt or clear and convincing evidence.we conclude that the trial court error was of such magnitude that the error requires automatic reversal.
where,as here,the fundamental constitutional right to parent has been impaired as a result of the court error,we join other california courts in taking guidance from the analysis provided in arizona fulminante,d fulminante the fulminante court recognized that,as a general rule,constitutional error does not automatically require reversal,and that in determining the effect of most constitutional errors,appellate courts may properly apply a chapman california,d chapman harmless error analysis.fulminante,supra,at.according to the supreme court,the common thread connecting cases in which courts have applied the chapman harmless error analysis is that each involved trial error error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.fulminante,supra,at.the fulminante court explained that the harmless error doctrine is essential to preserve the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant guilt or innocence,and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.citation.id.at.
in contrast,structural errors involve basic protections,without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence,and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.citation.fulminante,supra,at.a structural error requires reversal without regard to the strength of the evidence or other circumstances.ibid.examples of structural errors in the criminal context include the total deprivation of the right to counsel at trial,a biased judge,unlawful exclusion of members of the defendant race from a grand jury,denial of the right to at trial,denial of the right to a public trial,and an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction to the jury.id.at.
through circumstances beyond her control,and without her knowledge,maria attorney failed to appear for the selection and implementation hearing by proceeding with the section hearing when neither maria nor her attorney were present,the trial court effectively deprived her of her right to counsel,and also deprived her of any opportunity,let alone a meaningful opportunity,to be heard.in re jasmine th,d failure to attempt to give a parent statutorily required notice of a termination hearing is a structural defect requiring automatic reversal because it deprived the parent of a meaningful opportunity to be heard jasmine judith superior court,supra,th at,d in context of hearing,it was fundamentally unfair to terminate a parent or child familial relationship when the parent child was not given an adequate opportunity to prepare and present the best possible case for continuation of reunification services reunification.by depriving maria of a meaningful opportunity to be heard,the trial court eliminated a basic protection necessary to ensure the reliability and legitimacy of termination proceedings.
dss urges us to apply a harmless error test and affirm the trial court judgment.there is little guidance available for how to review an error such as the one here,as we are aware of no cases in which a court has proceeded to terminate parental rights in the absence of the parent or her attorney,when that parent is represented by counsel and has neither expressly nor impliedly waived the right to be represented by counsel,or the right to be heard.we have found three cases in which other appellate courts have applied a harmless error analysis to errors that effectively resulted in termination proceedings.see in re angela th,d angela in re malcolm th,d malcolm in re andrew th,d andrew.however,for a number of reasons,we find these cases distinguishable from the present case.
angela dealt with a mother claim of lack of notice pertaining to a continued section hearing.angela mother had received personal notice of the original termination hearing date,but failed to appear on that day.angela,supra,th at,d.because the agency was concerned that the father had not been adequately served,the court continued the termination hearing to another date.the record on appeal was silent as to whether or not the mother had been provided notice of the continued hearing date,and she did not attend the hearing.the trial court proceeded to terminate her parental rights.ibid.
on appeal,the mother challenged the trial court order,arguing that she had never received proper notice that the section hearing had been continued to a different date.although the court of appeal agreed with the mother that the trial court had erred in finding that she had received proper notice and in terminating her parental rights,the court concluded that the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard enunciated in chapman,supra,d should be applied to the error because,in the court words,the lack of notice of a continuance is in the nature of a trial error.angela,supra,th at,d.the court reasoned that the error was not structural because the mother has had notice of these dependency proceedings from the outset,as well as the opportunity to be heard.ibid.according to the court,had the trial court proceeded on the originally scheduled hearing date,as it had every right to do with respect to appellant,that hearing too would have been uncontested in that appellant failed to attend the hearing as originally noticed or notify anyone as to her position.ibid.for this reason,the court determined that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
significantly,the angela court did not address the issue of the right to counsel rather,the opinion deals only with the question whether the lack of notice of a continuance should be reviewed for prejudice,or instead,is reversible per se.further,unlike the situation here,the mother in angela failed to appear on the date originally set for the selection and implementation hearing,an act that could be construed as an implied waiver of the right to be heard and,by extension,the right to be represented by counsel at that hearing in contrast,maria was represented by counsel throughout the dependency proceedings,and she was clearly contesting termination of her parental rights.her attorney had informed the court of his scheduling conflict,as well as of his intention to appear before the court on the matter.under these circumstances,it is clear that maria did not waive her right to counsel,or,more fundamentally,her right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard,at the selection and implementation hearing.
in malcolm,supra,th at page,d,the court terminated a mother parental rights after granting her attorney motion to withdraw from the case on the ground that the attorney had been unable to contact the mother.although it is unclear from the recitation of facts in the opinion,it appears that the section hearing began in december and concluded in march.malcolm,supra,th at,d.the mother appeared on the december hearing date,and at that time the court reappointed the public defender office to represent her.the hearing was continued to december,and the mother appeared on that date as well.at that hearing,she requested that the court consider placing malcolm with her mother and making foster care the permanent plan.id.at,d.the court continued the hearing again to give dss an opportunity to reassess the proposed adoption plan.ibid.
on the next hearing date,the mother attorney appeared on the mother behalf and asked that the court either grant a continuance or relieve her as counsel,because she had been unable to locate her client.the trial court did not continue the hearing,but instead granted the attorney request to be relieved.malcolm,supra,th at,d.the court then proceeded with the section hearing and terminated the mother parental rights.malcolm,supra,th at,d.
the appellate court concluded that the trial court actions amounted to a violation of the mother statutory right to counsel,and further determined that under a people watson cal d,standard of harmless error,she had suffered no prejudice as a result of the trial court actions malcolm,supra,th at,d.the malcolm court focused its analysis on the fact that the trial court had granted the attorney motion to withdraw and concluded that the motion had been improperly granted because an inability to contact the client did not constitute sufficient cause for withdrawal.id.at,d.the appellate court went on to conclude that neither a continuance nor substitution of counsel would have had any effect because,the court presumed,any new counsel would also have been unable to contact the client.ibid.in contrast,maria attorney had not requested to be relieved and,in fact,indicated his intention to represent her at the section hearing.nor did maria impliedly waive her right to representation through her failure to contact her attorney.unlike the mother in malcolm,maria neither expressly nor impliedly waived her right to have counsel assist her in contesting dss proposed permanency plan and,specifically,to represent her at the selection and implementation hearing.
concluding that the presence of counsel at the hearing would not have made any difference in the outcome,the malcolm court determined that the proceedings were not fundamentally unfair,and thus that the mother had no due process right to counsel.malcolm,supra,th at,d.in our view,this reasoning is circular,and can not be used to justify the termination of a fundamental right.
according to the malcolm court,in order to establish that a constitutional right to counsel exists,it is the parent burden on appeal to demonstrate that not only did the absence of counsel make a determinative difference,it also rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair.malcolm,supra,th at,d,italics added.under this reasoning,it is only when a parent has been prejudiced and can show that the proceeding was fundamentally unfair that the court will conclude that the parent even had a constitutional right to counsel at that particular hearing.the flaw in this analysis is it combines the determination of whether a particular court error violated a party constitutional right with the secondary determination whether such error must be reversed,and allows the results of fundamentally unfair proceedings to be affirmed if the parent can not also establish prejudice.
in analyzing whether a particular error is structural or not,the question whether a proceeding was fundamentally unfair is a completely independent inquiry from any issue of the strength of the evidence or the eventual outcome of the case.obviously errors that lead to an erroneous result,errors leading to prejudice are inherently unfair.however,there are some errors that go to the fundamental fairness of the underlying process and which,by their very nature,undermine the safeguards otherwise presumed to exist in our judicial system.when such an error occurs,reversal is required regardless of the outcome,because we can not say that the proceeding itself was fair.to the extent malcolm,supra,th at page,d,may be read to hold that a court action in terminating parental rights in the absence of the parent or the parent counsel,where the parent is represented by counsel and has not expressly or impliedly waived the right to representation at the termination hearing,should be reviewed under a harmless error standard,we disagree.
in a situation similar to that presented in malcolm,the trial court in andrew,supra,th at page,d,granted an attorney request to be relieved as counsel for the child mother just prior to the section hearing,despite the fact that the mother was not present and was otherwise unrepresented at the hearing.according to the attorney,the mother had complained after the previous hearing that she had not been properly represented and that she intended to hire a new attorney.ibid.several lawyers had telephoned the attorney,saying that they were going to represent the mother,and although no formal substitution was presented to the court,the mother attorney sought to be relieved on the basis of a conflict of interest.ibid.
the appellate court in andrew determined that the trial court actions had erroneously deprived the child mother of her right to counsel.andrew,supra,th at,d.however,like the appellate court in malcolm,the andrew court concluded that the trial court had violated only the mother statutory right to counsel,and not her constitutional due process rights.andrew,supra,th at,d.the andrew court then reviewed the error for prejudice,and determined that no prejudice had been shown.ibid.
as in malcolm,in concluding that the trial court error was not of constitutional dimension,the andrew court failed to consider whether the mother right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard had been affected by the trial court decision to go forward with the section hearing immediately after relieving her attorney.further,the trial court in andrew had made an express finding that the mother had purposefully absented herself from the hearing.andrew,supra,th at,d.there was no similar finding here.because the courts in malcolm and andrew failed to consider whether the mother due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard had been implicated,we find these cases of little persuasive valued in assessing the nature of the error that occurred in this case.
to the extent andrew suggests that the right to counsel is never a right of constitutional dimension at a section hearing,we disagree.andrew,supra,th at,d.as the lassiter court made clear,whether or not there is a constitutional right to counsel at a particular hearing is to be determined on a basis because in each case,the facts and circumstances are susceptible of almost infinite variation citation.lassiter,supra,at.we conclude that under the facts and circumstances of this case,maria possessed constitutional rights that were violated by the trial court decision to go forward with the section hearing,particularly in view of the nature of the right at stake.
in our view,the paucity of cases in which a trial court has terminated parental rights when neither the parent nor her attorney is present and the parent has not waived her right to be represented by counsel or to be heard,either expressly or impliedly,underscores just how fundamentally unfair the court action was in this case.while we understand that courts may be frustrated with attorney conduct the circumstances and delays that complicate court calendars and slow judicial processes,there are other ways to deter such conduct that do not place fundamental individual rights at risk.if the court in this case was concerned about delay or frustrated with counsel handling of the matter,the court could have appointed a different attorney for maria,issued an order to show cause as to attorney roche absence and imposed sanctions,or otherwise expressed displeasure with the attorney failure to attend the hearing.what the court may not do is run roughshod over the parties fundamental rights to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard,by proceeding to terminate parental rights when neither the parent nor her attorney are present.
when courts,through their actions,fail to provide a process that adequately protects individual rights,particularly rights as fundamental as the right to parent a child,the legitimacy of the judicial system is called into question.the court error in this case,like the failure to attempt to notify the parent of the hearing in jasmine,denied maria the opportunity to present her case.the error was not merely a mistake that hinders a party ability to present a case effectively,but rather,constituted a flaw in the systematic framework that denie d that party the opportunity to be heard at all.jasmine,supra,th at,d.for this reason,the court order terminating maria parental rights must be reversed.
conclusion 
by terminating maria parental rights at a hearing at which neither she nor her attorney were present and where she had not waived her right to be represented by counsel or her right to be heard,either expressly or impliedly,the court deprived maria of the right to counsel and of any meaningful opportunity to be heard.the error is of such magnitude that it is structural and requires automatic reversal.
disposition 
the trial court order and subsequent judgment terminating maria parental rights is reversed and the case is remanded to the juvenile court.on remand,the court shall conduct a new section hearing and shall allow maria attorney to present maria position with regard to the termination of her parental rights.the court shall then redetermine the issue of maria parental rights,based on the evidence presented at the new hearing.
in light of the disposition on her direct appeal,maria petition for a writ of habeas corpus is moot and is therefore denied.
i respectfully dissent.
with admirable vigor my colleagues have doggedly asserted maria right to maintain a parental relationship with her daughter,michelle.with due respect,in their vigor to protect maria interests i fear my colleagues have ignored michelle.as the court in in re jasmon cal th,d,instructed us children,too,have fundamental the fundamental right to be protected from neglect and to have a placement that is stable and permanent.citations.children are not simply chattels belonging to the parent,but have fundamental interests of their own that may diverge from the interests of the parent.citation.italics added.
because in any dependency proceeding courts are required to consider the ever fluid and sometimes conflicting interests not just of a parent and the state,but of a parent,the state and a developing child,it is not surprising the supreme court of the united states as well as our own california supreme court and sister courts of appeal have consistently avoided rigid application of the categorical rules and remedies found in criminal proceedings.see lassiter department of soc.serv.of durham cty,d lassiter cynthia superior court cal th,d,cynthia in re andrew th,d andrew in re malcolm th,d malcolm.the social cost of providing a criminal defendant with what might appear to be extraordinary procedural protection is easily outweighed by the high value we place on personal liberty and the need to restrain a powerful government.the calculus is not so easy when the interests at stake include those of a growing child.
thus,i can not help but believe that a fuller appreciation of michelle rights by the majority would have produced a more faithful application of the analysis of the right to counsel required by lassiter.indeed,it is striking that in finding a constitutional right to counsel in the context of a termination of parental rights,the majority acknowledges it is in direct conflict with the holdings in andrew and malcolm,which in applying the very same lassiter principles found that due process did not require counsel at the selection and implementation hearings on review in those cases.my colleagues justify their sui generous application of lassiter by suggesting that unlike the courts in andrew and malcolm they have considered whether the mother right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard had been affected by the trial court decision.majority modification at slip opn.i do not accept their narrow reading of those cases.more importantly,however,i do not accept their complete failure to consider,let alone discuss,michelle rights 
discussion 
in the context of dependency proceedings involving termination of parental rights,lassiter sets forth a criteria for determining whether in a given case the parents interests were at their strongest,the state interest were at their weakest,and the risks of error were at their peak,such that the presumption against appointment of counsel is overcome.id.at.the decision whether due process calls for appointment of counsel in termination proceedings is to be answered in the first instance by the trial court subject to appellate review of the facts and record of each case.id.at.the burden is on the parent complaining of constitutional defect to demonstrate based on the record that there was a determinative difference in the outcome of the proceeding by reason of the lack of counsel,such that the proceeding was rendered fundamentally unfair to the parent.id.at.
california dependency cases treating claims of denial of due process because of the absence of counsel follow lassiter case by case approach.these opinions also agree that where counsel is absent,a parent has the burden of demonstrating there would have been a determinative difference at the hearing had counsel been present.in re malcolm th,d in re ronald th,d see also in re justin d,citing lassiter and using a watson people watson cal d,harmless error analysis.
claims of constitutional defect at dependency hearings due to the closely related issue of ineffective assistance of counsel are also determined on a case by case basis.in re emilye th,d,citing lassiter in re arturo th,d in re christina d,citing lassiter.these,and other opinions,have all concluded that before relief will be granted,the complaining party must show some form of prejudice,for example that a prima facie case of prejudice is shown,or that there is a reasonable probability,sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,that but for counsel unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different.see in re emilye supra,th at,d in re eileen th,d in re kristin th,d in re arturo,supra,th at,d in re meranda th,d in re christina,supra,d at.
while they cite lassiter,my colleagues do not examine the record of this case,and therefore do not answer the question whether there has been a showing that counsel presence at the section hearing would have made a determinative difference.instead,they conclude that because counsel was not present at the section hearing,there is no record in this case and therefore the per se reversible error standard applies,rather than lassiter determinative difference standard.in doing so,the majority agrees with mother that her failure and her counsel failure to appear and present their failure to create the very record they now claim is form the basis for reversal.with all due respect not only is there is no authority for this novel approach,there is also a full record in this case.
applying lassiter to the selection and implementation hearing first requires an examination of the parental interest involved.andrew,supra,th at,d.in doing so,it is clear a parent rights at the section hearing are significantly diminished compared to the fundamental parental rights at stake during the dispositional process.id.at,d.contrary to mother assertions here and acceptance of that assertion by my colleagues,the fundamental right to parent is no longer at stake once dependency proceedings reach the permanency planning stage.cynthia,supra,cal th at,d,also see in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d.nor as my colleagues urge,are the best interests of the child at issue.majority,subd.c in re tabatha th,d in re jasmine th,d.
the nature of the selection and implementation hearing and the interests of the parties at that hearing have been thoroughly explained by our supreme court in cynthia,supra,cal th,d.as cynthia explains i n order to terminate parental rights at a section hearing,the court need only make two findings that there is clear and convincing evidence that the minor will be adopted and that there has been a previous determination that reunification services shall be terminated.id.at,d.t he critical decision regarding parental rights will be made at the dispositional or review hearing,that is,that the minor can not be returned home and that reunification efforts should not be pursued.in such cases,the decision to terminate parental rights will be relatively automatic if the minor is going to be adopted.citation.therefore,the decisions made at the review hearing regarding reunification are not subject to relitigation at the termination hearing.this hearing determines only the type of permanent home.citation.id.at,d,italics added.
thus at the section hearing the sole issue before the court is the adoptability of the minor.andrew,supra,th at,d malcolm supra,th at,d.the court has no discretion to consider as a dispositional matter the return of the child to a parent.in re marilyn cal th,d.a parent whose conduct has already and on numerous occasions been found to grievously endanger his or her child is no longer in the same position as a parent whose neglect or abuse has not so clearly been established.at this point the interests of the parent and child have diverged,and the child interest must be given more weight.because section contemplates termination of parental rights only when there is clear and convincing evidence that the child is likely to be adopted,the child fundamental interest in the opportunity to experience a stable relationship is very much at stake at the hearing.cynthia,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.by the time termination is possible under our dependency statutes the danger to the child from parental unfitness is so well established that there is no longer reason to believe that positive,nurturing relationships exist citation and the parens patriae interest of the state favoring preservation rather than severance of natural familial bonds has been extinguished i t has become clear that the natural parent can not or will not provide a normal home for the child citation,and the state interest in finding the child a permanent alternate home is fully realized.id.at,d.
it is significant that mother did not appeal from the critical point in the dependency proceedings when her reunification rights were terminated.thus,we must ass
