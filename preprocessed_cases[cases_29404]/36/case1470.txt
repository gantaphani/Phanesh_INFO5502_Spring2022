social services agency sought termination of father parental rights to child.notice of child possible indian heritage was sent to bureau of indian affairs bia office the day before termination hearing.the superior court,orange county,no,corey cramin,terminated parental rights without addressing possible application of indian child welfare act icwa.father appealed.the court of appeal,aronson,held that father suggestion that child might be an indian child,based on his claim that his grandparents were of native american ancestry,was sufficient to trigger icwa notice requirement violation of icwa period of notice requirement is not jurisdictional error and social services agency failure to comply with notice requirement was harmless in light of evidence that icwa did not apply.
father contends the juvenile court failure to comply with the notice provisions of the indian child welfare act icwa,or the act deprived the court of jurisdiction to terminate his parental rights to antoinette s.the court held the termination hearing without waiting at least ten days after receipt of notice by the secretary of the interior.a subsequent statutory citations are to this title unless otherwise noted.while broad language utilized by some of our sister courts of appeal and other state courts suggests such error is jurisdictional,we agree with those courts reaching the opposite conclusion.in our view,the error is not jurisdictional.nor does it always require reversal or remand for strictly proper notice.here,the failure to ensure a window after notice to the secretary was harmless.finally,father argument that the court should have applied the substantive provisions of the icwa is also without merit.we therefore affirm the judgment.
orange county social services agency ssa placed a hospital hold on then antoinette because blood tests ruled out her mother explanation that she bruises easily and because of suspicion her bowel obstruction was caused by blunt force trauma to her stomach.showed two healing rib fractures that did not surprise or shock mother but which she could not explain.mother admitted antoinette had been vomiting for six weeks and had lost to pounds before being brought to the hospital.
ssa filed a dependency petition alleging serious physical harm to antoinette and failure to protect her.a box checked on the petition indicated,child may be of indian ancestry.the record does not disclose what information prompted ssa to check that box.at the initial detention hearing mother denied she or father had any indian heritage.taking mother at her word,the juvenile court and ssa proceeded as if the icwa did not apply.neither mother nor father ever suggested to the trial court in any subsequent proceeding that the act applied.
ssa made repeated efforts over the next nine months to locate antoinette father,to whom mother was married but had not seen for more than two years.the social worker finally received a voice mail from father two weeks before the termination of parental rights hearing.father was incarcerated and had not seen antoinette since early last year some time before i got busted for drugs.he explained his absence this way i got busted for possession of drugs and then was in and out of jail a few times last year.i have been around anaheim when i am not in jail.
father told the social worker he believed his deceased maternal grandparents had native american ancestry.in response to the worker inquiries,father was not able to provide birth dates for either his grandmother or his grandfather,nor was he even sure of their names.he did not know whether they were members of any tribe.father himself was not a member of any tribe.
nevertheless,ssa sent notice regarding antoinette possible indian heritage to the appropriate regional bureau of indian affairs bia office of the department of the interior the day before the termination hearing.the notice included a form entitled,request for confirmation of child status as indian.the form listed antoinette name,sex,birth date,and birthplace anaheim,ca.it also contained mother married and maiden names,her birth date,birthplace mexico city,mexico,and similar information for father birthplace orange,ca,as well as mother and father definitive,no,regarding whether they were enrolled tribal members.the names of antoinette maternal grandmother,paternal grandparents,and paternal great grandparents were provided,but their birth dates,birthplaces,tribal affiliations,and enrollment statuses were reported as unknown.ssa attached a copy of antoinette birth certificate.in the remarks section of antoinette family history,the social worker wrote child birth father claimed his maternal grandparents had indian ancestry in their fam ily background.he reports both grandparents to be deceased.he was not able to identify a particular tribal affiliation.
ssa sent a similar notice to the state department of social services dss for help in determining whether antoinette might be an indian child.in her cover letter,the social worker stated,antoinette birth father reports that his maternal grandparents have some type of indian ancestry in their background.unfortunately,i was unable to obtain very much information regarding the extent of his family indian a ncestry from the child birth father the birth mother states that she is not aware of any indian h eritage within her family of origin.
father appeared at the termination hearing,where neither he,ssa,nor the court raised the issue of his possible indian ancestry nor was the possible applicability of the icwa addressed.the court terminated parental rights.mother does not appeal on any ground,but father now raises the icwa for the first time on appeal.
preliminary issues should the merits be reached 
we deal briefly with two preliminary issues raised by ssa regarding whether we should reach the merits of father arguments.
first,father claim that his grandparents had native american ancestry,and that antoinette therefore does as well,was sufficient to trigger the notice requirements of the act,notwithstanding ssa insistence the information was too vague.the icwa provides that where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a,italics added.that the identity of the tribe is not known does not discharge ssa from the requirement of giving notice.section a provides that in such cases notice shall be given to the secretary in like manner secretary means the secretary of the interior,and notice to the secretary is accomplished by notice to the bia.in re edward th,d see delegating secretary duties to bia.the purpose of notice to the bia is that it presumably has more resources and skill with which to ferret out the necessary information in re desiree th,d desiree,such as which tribe or tribes might be entitled to notice 
ssa suggests father general claim of his native american heritage did not give the juvenile court reason to know antoinette was in fact an indian child within the meaning of the icwa,and thus notice was not required.the icwa defines an indian child as an unmarried person under the age of who is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.father and mother admitted they were not enrolled members of any tribe,but that is not dispositive because enrollment is not the sole means to establish tribal membership.dwayne superior court th,d dwayne noting that a child may qualify as an indian child within the meaning of the icwa even if neither of the child parents is enrolled in the tribe.in any event,ssa argument fails to distinguish between a showing that may establish a child is an indian child within the meaning of the icwa and the minimal showing required to trigger the statutory notice provisions.id.at,d.
after an exhaustive analysis,the court in dwayne recently concluded the minimal showing required to trigger notice under the icwa is merely evidence suggest ing the minor may be an indian child within purview of the act.dwayne,supra,th at,d.we agree.congress has recognized there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of indian tribes than their children and that the united states has a direct interest,as trustee,in protecting indian children who are members of or are eligible for membership in an indian tribe.the purpose of the icwa is therefore to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families.because of the important interests at stake,courts around the country have interpreted the icwa notice provision broadly.dwayne,supra,th at,d citing cases see,in re,it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice.
as noted in dwayne,the federal guidelines for indian child custody proceedings provide that a court has reason to believe a child involved in a child custody proceeding is an indian when,among other things,a ny public or agency involved in child protection services has discovered information which suggests that the child is an indian child and when a n officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an indian child.guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings,italics added dwayne,supra,th at,d acknowledging that the guidelines are not binding on state courts.similarly,rule d of the california rules of court states that the circumstances that may provide probable cause for the court to believe the child is an indian child include,inter alia,when a party provides information suggesting that the child is an indian child.italics added.
here,ssa filed a petition indicating antoinette may be of indian ancestry.mother denied indian heritage at the detention hearing but father later claimed his grandparents were of native american ancestry.because biological descendance is often a prerequisite for tribal membership we hold father suggestion that antoinette might be an indian child was enough to trigger notice in this case.given the interests protected by the act,the recommendations of the guidelines,and the requirements of our court rules,the bar is indeed very low to trigger icwa notice.it was met here by the suggestion of indian ancestry,and ssa argument therefore has no merit.
father failure to raise the icwa notice requirement below did not waive the issue on appeal.because the notice requirement is intended,in part,to protect the interests of indian tribes,it can not be waived by the parents failure to raise it.in re marinna th,d.the right to raise the issue for the first time on appeal is not limited solely to the affected tribes.instead,any parent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate foster care placement or termination of parental rights upon a showing that such action violated any provision of sections,and.thus,because it is critical to the tribes in which the dependent child may have existing or future membership,and because tribes depend on parents in the first instance to notify state social workers and courts of known or potential indian ancestry,parents who have failed to raise the notice issue below may raise it on appeal.in re marinna,supra,th at,d observing that notice is absolutely critical under the act,for one of the act major purposes is to protect and preserve indian tribes.based on this authority,we turn next to the merits of father appeal.
violation of section a 
father is correct that the juvenile court and ssa failed to abide by the plain notice requirements of section a.the juvenile court violated section a by holding the termination hearing less than days after the bia received notice on behalf of the secretary of the interior.section a provides no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary.italics added.ssa clearly violated section a by sending notice to the bia just one day before the termination hearing.
apart from notice to the secretary,ssa was not required to notify any particular tribe regarding antoinette possible indian heritage.indeed,ssa could not have done so,given the lack of information provided by father.in such instances,where ssa has determined that the icwa may apply but no tribe has been identified,notice of the proceedings to the bureau of indian affairs and further inquiry regarding the possible indian status of the child are the only requirements.cal.rules of court,rule e.this inquiry obligation exists in every dependency case the court and the county welfare department have an affirmative duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition under welfare institutions code section is to be,or has been,filed is or may be an indian child.cal.rules of court,rule d.before determining whether this inquiry obligation was satisfied,we examine the broader question of whether violation of icwa notice provision constitutes jurisdictional error.
violation of icwa notice provision does not constitute jurisdictional error 
ssa contends the juvenile court encroachment on section a window was harmless.father insists the error was not harmless but rather jurisdictional,and isolated language in a few cases supports his position.for example,desiree,supra,th at,d,states in passing that state courts have no jurisdiction to proceed with dependency proceedings involving a possible indian child until a period of at least days after the receipt of notice.see also in re jonathan th,d jonathan same,quoting desiree in re samuel th,d samuel same,citing desiree and jonathan.at least one court has taken a similar view.in matter of,the south dakota supreme court declared inadequate notice under the icwa divests the trial court of jurisdiction to terminate parental rights.no party raised the notice issue,but the court in a per curiam opinion reached it because this court must examine jurisdictional questions whether presented by the parties or not.ibid.in reversing and remanding because inadequate notice divested the trial court of jurisdiction,the court added,consequently,this court has no jurisdiction to address the merits of the case.ibid.
but as another court has observed,there is a wide difference between a want of jurisdiction,in which case the court has no power to adjudicate at all,and a mistake in the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction,in which case the action of the trial court is not void,although it may be subject to direct attack on appeal.altman nelson,trial court had jurisdiction to rule on paternity action,notwithstanding that ruling proved erroneous.the juvenile court undoubtedly had subject matter jurisdiction over these dependency proceedings.cal,art.vi,superior courts have original jurisdiction in all causes except those given by statute to other trial courts welf,superior court known as juvenile court when exercising jurisdiction conferred by ch.of juvenile court law,delineating dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court.compare b c recognizing state court jurisdiction over foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings,with a vesting exclusive jurisdiction in tribal courts over proceedings involving an indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe.
we do not believe the respective no jurisdiction statements in desiree,jonathan,or samuel were intended as novel pronouncements on the dependency jurisdiction of state courts.rather,the use of the word jurisdiction appears to have been simply a shorthand way of saying the icwa violations under consideration in those cases constituted serious legal error.indeed,the statements regarding no jurisdiction are only dicta.in each case,the reviewing court reversed or remanded because the lack of notice was prejudicial additional language regarding jurisdiction was mere surplusage.see desiree,supra,th at,d jonathan,supra,th at,d samuel,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,these cases and are being relied upon for the proposition that notice violations of the icwa are jurisdictional.see,in interest of iowa,citing,construction and application of indian child welfare act of icwa et upon child custody determinations supp.a citing samuel.to the extent desiree,jonathan,samuel,or can be interpreted to mean a trial court or the reviewing court lacks subject matter jurisdiction in the face of erroneous notice,we disagree.
we hold that violation of the period of notice required by icwa is not jurisdictional error.the very fact that notice problems are sometimes deemed harmless in icwa cases see,in re kahlen d.indicates such error is not jurisdictional.to the contrary,a finding of jurisdictional error would logically precede and preclude any inquiry as to whether the error was harmless.and if error were to strip a court of its jurisdiction a dramatic proposition for which there is no precedent in other areas of the law,then the juvenile court would lose all authority over the dependent child in its care,requiring immediate return of the child to parents who have demonstrated at least temporary unfitness.the vermont supreme court prudently rejected this notion in in re,supra,at,as we do here.in re riva d.rejecting notion that substantive standard of proof requirements of icwa involve the fundamental jurisdiction of the court to act.
most importantly,congress has recognized state court jurisdiction over foster care placement and termination of parental rights proceedings b c,and the remedy congress provided for violations of the icwa was not to void that jurisdiction and transfer the matter to tribal courts but rather to allow parents and tribes to seek invalidation of any proceedings held in error.see carson carson,fn.criticizing on grounds that congress intended states courts to enforce icwa notice rules only on the presupposition that they otherwise had jurisdiction.we agree with the conclusion that i f a state court,as opposed to a tribal court,properly has jurisdiction over the subject matter,the court is not divested of jurisdiction simply because it fails to comply with the a state ex rel.juv.charles,fn.noting congress specifically acknowledged state court jurisdiction in.for all these reasons,we hold a court failure to comply with the notice provisions of the icwa is not jurisdictional error.
violation of window of notice to the secretary is harmless error 
even though the failure to comply with section a was not jurisdictional,the question remains whether it was prejudicial or harmless.deficient notice under the icwa is usually prejudicial see,in re kahlen,supra,d at.but not invariably so.in re junious d,fn.lack of notice is not necessarily prejudicial to the tribe,even where it is required,citing matter of.we note and agree with the concluding sentiments recently expressed with some frustration by the fifth appellate district that this court has published repeatedly to emphasize the importance of icwa notice compliance and that,when failing to assure compliance,ssa and the juvenile courts face the strong likelihood of reversal on appeal to this court.in re th,d.but this case is the rare one where inadequate notice was harmless.
our harmless error analysis turns on evidence ssa moves to introduce for the first time on appeal,namely the bia response to ssa notice sent the day before the termination hearing.father does not oppose the motion.we previously observed in in re jonathan th,fn,d,that t his court routinely accepts evidence per code of civil procedure section in juvenile dependency cases to expedite just and final resolution for the benefit of the children involved.see cal,art.vi,authorizing the taking of such evidence code civ,cal.rules of court,rule b in re elise cal d,conc.opn.of bird,in re junious,supra,d at fn.
code of civil procedure section provides by its terms that it is to be liberally construed,but there are limits on when ssa may invoke it,as shown by our recent opinion in in re jennifer th,d jennifer.there,ssa sought to introduce on appeal the negative response of one tribe and the lack of response of another as evidence that jennifer was not an indian child.id.at,d.ssa,however,had not bothered to ask the parents both of whom were participating in the dependency proceedings their birthplaces or that of their highly relevant to tracing tribal membership.ibid.for us to have accepted ssa new evidence in such circumstances would have been unjust.in this case,in contrast,ssa queried father regarding his grandparents alleged indian ancestry and identifying information such as their names,birth dates,and tribal affiliations.jennifer is therefore inapposite.we also note here that,in terminating parental rights,the juvenile court found antoinette was adoptable,and the record shows prospective adoptive parents have been located for her.in view of these circumstances and the fact that our concerns in jennifer do not apply,a just and final resolution for antoinette compels us to accept ssa new evidence 
the substance of ssa new evidence is simply that no indian heritage could be traced for antoinette by either the bia or dss.ssa sought to introduce similar responses in jennifer,albeit from a tribe,which we refused.but as we have discussed,the tribe response in jennifer was premised on the inadequate information ssa had provided the tribe,lacking birthplaces for either parent or jennifer even though all were participating in the proceedings.jennifer,supra,th at,d.here,ssa confirmed with mother that she had no indian heritage and inquired of father regarding the birth dates and tribal affiliation of his grandparents.in so doing,ssa satisfied the inquiry obligation imposed by california rules of court,rule d and e.we note that the obligation is only one of inquiry and not an absolute duty to ascertain or refute native american ancestry.father points to nothing more ssa might have done or any further information he or any other person might have regarding his alleged indian ancestry.reversal or remand here would exalt form over substance because it is apparent father can not provide any more information.under the standard of chapman california,d or people watson cal d,the notice violation here was harmless.
juvenile court not required to apply substantive provisions of icwa in this case 
finally,father argues that because the juvenile court had reason to believe antoinette might be an indian child,based on the information father provided to ssa,the court should have applied the substantive provisions of icwa,including the beyond reasonable doubt standard necessary to terminate parental rights.f cal.rules of court,rule e court shall proceed as if the child is an indian child if it has reason to know child might be native american.
we recently suggested juvenile courts should make an explicit rather than implicit determination as to the applicability of the icwa.jennifer,supra,th at,d.in disagreeing with in re levi th,d,which appeared to allow implicit rulings,we stated,the point of the matter is the court must decide,one way or the other,whether the icwa applies,so it can proceed in compliance therewith when appropriate.jennifer,supra,th at,fn,d.we strongly affirm that juvenile courts should abide by their obligation to determine in the first instance whether the icwa applies.the court here made no such determination,whether explicit or implicit,and therefore erred.but given the bia response showing no indian heritage could be traced for antoinette,the icwa clearly did not apply to these proceedings and the court error was harmless.we therefore affirm the judgment 
disposition 
the judgment of the juvenile court is affirmed.failure to abide by the notice requirement of the indian child welfare act is not jurisdictional error and,indeed,constitutes only harmless error in this case.
the juvenile court was put on notice that antoinette might be of indian ancestry,when the dependency petition containing that statement was filed.subsequently,the father appeared on the scene and said his maternal grandparents had indian ancestry.in an addendum report filed the day of the termination hearing,orange county social services agency ssa informed the court of the father claimed indian heritage.the report also reflected that just one day before the termination hearing,ssa had sent correspondence regarding antoinette possible indian ancestry.the court accepted the report into evidence.inexplicably,the court chose to ignore the information concerning the possible indian heritage of antoinette.the court made no findings as to the applicability of the indian child welfare act icwa and failed to ensure compliance with the icwa notice requirements.
having been informed about antoinette possible indian heritage twice,the court certainly was on notice that she might be an indian child.dwayne superior court th,d dwayne court has reason to believe child is indian when public or agency involved in child protection services has obtained information so suggesting.as to this much,my colleagues agree,ante,at.when the court has reason to know indian children are involved in dependency proceedings,as here,it has the duty to give the requisite notice itself or ensure the social services agency compliance with the notice requirement.citations.in our view,the court duty is sua sponte citation.dwayne,supra,th at,d.
as the majority opinion acknowledges,ante,at,title united states code section a provides as follows in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.if the identity or location of the parent or indian custodian and the tribe can not be determined,such notice shall be given to the secretary in like manner no termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary in an instance such as this,then,the notice that would otherwise be given to the tribe must be given to the secretary of the interior,since the tribe is not known.a in re th,d in re kahlen d.kahlen.the prescribed notice must pertain to the pending proceedings and the right of intervention.
the guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings hereafter guidelines,promulgated under the statute for aid in interpreting its provisions identify in some detail the responsibilities inuring to the secretary under the notice provisions of title united states code section.first,the guidelines provide notice to the secretary should include the following information name of indian child,birthdate,birthplace,indian child tribal affiliation,names of indian child parents or indian custodians,including birthdate,birthplace,and mother maiden name,and a copy of the petition,complaint or other document by which the proceeding was initiated.kahlen,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
in addition,the notice to the bia shall include statements regarding the right of the indian parents,indian custodians and tribe to intervene in the proceedings to the effect that counsel will be appointed for indian parents or indian custodians who are indigent regarding the right of the indian parents,indian custodians and tribe to obtain an additional days to prepare for the proceedings providing the location,address and telephone number of the court regarding the right of the indian parents,indian custodians and tribe to petition the court for a transfer of the proceedings to a tribal court regarding the potential legal consequences of an adjudication on future parental and custodial rights and to the effect that the recipients of the notice must keep all information contained therein confidential.e in re,supra,th at,d.
in this case,as the father points out in his opening brief,there was no evidence before the juvenile court that ssa had provided the required information.ssa said in its addendum report that it had submitted letters to the bia and the state department of social services regarding the possibility of indian ancestry within antoinette birth family.the father argues there is no proof the content of these letters provided the requisite information concerning the proceedings and the right of intervention.he is right.
my colleagues impliedly acknowledge that the record before the juvenile court was inadequate to determine whether the icwa notice provisions had been followed,ante,at.rather than remand the case for a determination of the pertinent factual issues,they choose to take additional evidence on appeal.we declined to follow this course of action in in re jennifer th,d jennifer,where we stated that m aking the appellate court the trier of fact is not the solution.we further explained i t is up to the juvenile court to review the information concerning the notice given,the timing of the notice,and the response of the tribe,so that it may make a determination as to the applicability of the icwa,and thereafter comply with all of its provisions,if applicable.id.at,d.in my view,that statement remains correct.t he guidelines provide that a juvenile court has an affirmative duty to inquire about a child indian status.citation.kahlen,supra,d at.the juvenile court failure to secure compliance with the notice provisions of the act is prejudicial error.id.at.
in at least five opinions published in the last two months,appellate courts have admonished juvenile courts and social services agencies for giving the icwa notice provisions short shrift.see in re suzanna th,d order terminating parental rights reversed when no notice was given to bia and trial court was not provided with copies of notices,return receipts or responses from tribes in re,supra,th,d party seeking termination of parental rights or foster care placement of possible indian child must serve proper notice,with copy of dependency petition,and file with superior court copies of proof of registered or certified mail plus return receipts,notices served,and any responses received in re jeffrey th,d jeffrey order terminating parental rights vacated when record failed to show whether notice given complied with icwa requirements and was sent to secretary of interior and bia area director jennifer,supra,th,d no evidence regarding notice,receipt of notice,or any responses from tribes or bia provided to juvenile court,which erred in failing to determine whether notice given in compliance with icwa dwayne,supra,th,d court has sua sponte obligation to ensure compliance with notice requirements even when parents make vague statements that they may have cherokee indian heritage but provide no evidentiary showing.in each of those cases,either the matter was remanded for,or writ petitions were granted directing,further proceedings in compliance with the icwa.
as the majority indicates,ante,at,the juvenile court should have made a determination as to whether the icwa applies,but it did not do so.while the majority does not hesitate to make that determination on appeal,i view the issue as one best left for the juvenile court to resolve.jennifer,supra,th at,d.the matter should be remanded for that determination.
that aside,once the majority has taken ssa evidence on appeal,it turns out what was given was no notice at a request for information with respect to antoinette.what ssa sent the bia was a form entitled request for confirmation of child status as indian.it provided no information whatsoever regarding the pending proceedings.
as observed in in re samuel th,d,the request for confirmation form provides no court case number or other information with respect to the dependency proceedings,no notice of any hearings and no information regarding the tribe right to intervene.id.at,d.the deficiency of this form for use in lieu of a notice was discussed further in both jeffrey,supra,th,d and in re,supra,th,d.as stated in jeffrey,supra,th,d,two forms have been issued by the state of california health and welfare agency and the department of social services to comply with the icwa.they are entitled request for confirmation of child status as indian form soc and notice of involuntary child custody
