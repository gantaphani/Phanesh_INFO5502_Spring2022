william miller miller appeals from the decision rendered against him in the western district of north carolina ordering the return of his infant children to canada in the custody of their mother,doris miller.see memorandum and order of november,district court order.the district court proceeded under the international child abduction remedies act icara,which implements the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction hague convention.we affirm the district court.
in august,miller forcibly removed the children from their mother home in catharines,ontario,canada,and brought them into the united states to settle with him in charlotte,north carolina.miller filed this action pursuant to icara and the hague convention seeking the children return on the ground that they were illegally abducted by miller in violation of a valid canadian custody order.
the essential facts underlying this dispute are spelled out in the district court order.miller is a citizen and resident of canada,while miller is a citizen and resident of the united states.the parties elder child,hope christian miller,was born in canada in september.the parties subsequently married in and separated in,prior to the birth of the younger child,faith kendra taylor irwin miller,who was born in canada in august.they have since divorced.
an ontario court,in an october,decree ontario order,granted permanent custody of the children to miller.on august,miller arrived in for the purpose of exercising his rights of supervised visitation under the ontario,without miller consent,took the children from her home and returned with them to the united states the district court found that b ased on the amount of time during which the children lived in canada during the course of their respective lives,the children were habitually resident in canada as of august.district court order,at moreover,the court determined that miller filed her hague convention petition less than one year after the children were taken to the united states and that hope and faith had not become settled in north carolina within the meaning of the hague convention.finally,the court ascertained that the return of the children to miller did not pose a grave risk to the health,safety,and of the children as defined by the convention.id.
this case is complicated by a series of conflicting custody orders issued by courts in both new york state and ontario,both before and after the children were taken by miller to north carolina.the custody battles began in spring in a new york family court miller then filed a custody petition in october in ontario.the parties each intermittently appeared failed to appear the new york and ontario courts.they each were admonished for violating various orders,including mandates regarding visitation rights and payment of child support.
subsequent to the ontario order of october,the new york court awarded custody of the children to miller in a march,decree new york order in granting this relief,the new york family court noted that miller had last appeared in person in september,although counsel had appeared on her behalf the court determined that g iven miller failure to appear and to testify on her own behalf,this court is permitted to draw,and has drawn the strongest inference against her that the evidence permits.new york order,at citation omitted.the court then concluded,based on various findings of fact,that miller actions demonstrate a fundamental defect in her understanding of the duties of parenthood.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
before removing the children from canada,miller twice asked ontario courts to set aside the ontario order in favor of the new york order.although his first request was rejected,his second,substantially identical entreaty was granted on september,a few days after he removed the children to the united states.however,the ontario order was reinstated in a june,order by the court of appeal for ontario ontario court of appeal order.the court of appeal first determined that,in recognizing the new york order,the lower court had misapplied canadian law regarding the recognition of a foreign custody judgment.the court of appeal also concluded that 
w hatever rights the husband may have had by reason of the new york order or otherwise,he had no right either to assault his wife or to abduct the children.in our view,his conduct should have been condemned by the application judge in the strongest possible terms.whatever the faults of the wife,the husband had to be made aware that his objectives could not be achieved by violence or other unlawful conduct.to consider his application in the circumstances,was to approbate his conduct 
the application judge expressed his most sincere hope that upon learning of the outcome of these proceedings the father will return to the niagara falls area and will allow the children to visit with their mother.that hope has not been realized.
in our view,the application judge should have refused to consider the application of the husband until the children were returned to the custody of their mother.in our opinion that is still the appropriate position of the court.
ontario court of appeal order,at.notably,the court of appeal welcomed the parties to further litigate the custody issue once the children were returned to canada.subsequent to this decree,however,the new york family court issued a modifying order allowing miller to retain custody of hope and faith and relocate with them to north carolina.this modifying order was issued on august,nearly a year after miller had absconded to north carolina with the children.
miller filed this action pursuant to the hague convention,as implemented in the united states by icara.the petition was initially submitted to the united states district court for the western district of new york on august.the action was thereafter transferred to the western district of north carolina,where venue properly lies.see b permitting hague convention petitions to be filed in any court which has jurisdiction of such action and which is authorized to exercise its jurisdiction in the place where the child is located at the time the petition is filed.
the district court treated miller petition as an application for a writ of habeas corpus.see,zajaczkowski zajaczkowska.notice of the proceeding was properly given to the parties,see c,and,as we explain below,the case was appropriately determined by the district court in accordance with the hague convention,see d.
in adopting the hague convention,the signatory nations sought to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as to secure protection for rights of access.hague convention,at,at.that is,the primary purpose of the hague convention is to preserve the status quo and to deter parents from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court.friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich i.consequently,the scope of a court inquiry under the hague convention is limited to the merits of the abduction claim.see b.as the district court correctly recognized in this action,the merits of any underlying custody case are not at issue.district court order,at emphasis added see also shalit coppe,cir friedrich friedrich,cir friedrich ii.
in this case,miller,as petitioner,was required to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that her children were wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention.e a.thus,miller had to prove that the children were habitually resident in canada at the time miller removed them to the united states the removal was in breach of miller custody rights under canadian law and she had been exercising those rights at the time of removal.see hague convention,at,at 
upon substantiation by miller that removal of her children from canada was wrongful,hope and faith return was required unless miller,as respondent,established one of four available defenses.see e a requiring proof,by clear and convincing evidence,that one of the exceptions set forth in article or of the hague convention applies e b commanding proof,by a preponderance of the evidence,that some other exception set forth in article or of the hague convention applies.in order to prevail,therefore,miller could show,by clear and convincing evidence,that there was a grave risk that the children return to miller would expose them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place them in an intolerable situation,see hague convention,at,at,or the return of the children to canada would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the united states relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,hague convention,at,at.miller also could prevail if he established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that this action was not commenced within one year of the abduction,and the children were now in north carolina,see hague convention,at,at,or that miller was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal,hague convention,at,at.
because of the competing new york and ontario custody orders in this case,it is significant to recognize that the convention was meant,in part,to lend priority to the custody determination hailing from the child state of habitual residence.ohlander larson,cir.thus,upon establishment of canada as the children habitual residence,the mere existence of the new york order granting permanent custody of the children to miller was not in itself a defense for wrongful removal,though it would be an exercise to take account of the reasons for that decree in appraising the merits of this abduction claim.see hague convention,at,at 
after setting forth its findings of fact,see supra part,the district court concluded that miller removal of hope and faith to the united states was a breach of miller custody rights under the law of canada,which was the habitual residence of the children at the time of their abduction.thus,the court determined,miller removal of the children from canada was wrongful and his present retention of them in the united states is wrongful.district court order,at.moreover,the court concluded that the defenses raised by miller were inapplicable in this action.accordingly,the court ordered that the children be placed in miller custody for their return to canada,and that law enforcement officers provide any necessary assistance to ensure a safe homecoming.that order was carried out and the children returned to canada with their mother.
in an action pursuant to icara and the hague convention,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,while its conclusions regarding principles of domestic,foreign,and international law are reviewed by us de novo.see friedrich ii,at citing.other citations omitted accord shalit,at.
on appeal,miller asserts that the district court erred in concluding that miller proved the wrongful removal of her children from canada,within the meaning of the hague convention,and that miller failed to establish any of the four available defenses.we address these arguments in turn.
first,miller insists that because he had been granted permanent custody of the children pursuant to the new york order of march,the district court erred in concluding that canada was the habitual residence of the children as of august,the day he removed them to the united states and that miller was exercising valid custody rights under canadian law on that day.
the hague convention does not define habitual residence.however,in ascertaining how to make this determination,we are guided by the precedent of our sister circuits in concluding that there is no real distinction between ordinary residence and habitual residence.friedrich i,at citing in re bates,no.ca,high court of justice,family div.royal court of justice,united kingdom accord rydder rydder,cir.as the sixth circuit explained a person can have only one habitual residence.on its face,habitual residence pertains to customary residence prior to the removal.the court must look back in time,not forward.friedrich i,at.this is a inquiry that should be made on a basis.see id.citing bates.moreover,of potential import in this action,a parent can not create a new habitual residence by wrongfully removing and sequestering a child.see diorinou mezitis,cir.citations omitted.
in this case,the evidence shows that both children were born in canada and resided there with their mother for a substantial portion of their faith case,for her entire they were removed by their father to the united states.accordingly,the district court determined that the children habitual residence at that time was canada.miller maintains that this was error and that the united states was their habitual residence,because miller wrongfully retained the children in canada as of march,in violation of the new york order.miller does not,however,appear to dispute the evidence as to the amount of time the children lived in canada nor assert that their canadian residence began as a result of miller wrongfully moving them there.
because miller argument presumes that the new york order superseded the earlier ontario order granting custody of the children to miller,we turn to the ontario court of appeal order upholding this custody award in the face of the new york order.see diorinou,at in hague convention action where father insisted children were not habitual residents of greece because mother had wrongfully retained them there,the second circuit looked to prior hague convention action between same parties in which greek courts concluded that children retention in greece was not wrongful in determining the amount of deference due to the canadian decision,we acknowledge that judgments rendered in a foreign nation are not entitled to the protection of full faith and credit.id.at quoting restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.b.we note,however,that american courts will normally accord considerable deference to foreign adjudications as a matter of comity.id.citations omitted.indeed,comity is at the heart of the hague convention.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
after reviewing the complex history of litigation in this case,the ontario court of appeal upheld the validity of the ontario least pending further denied recognition of the new york order based on canadian conflict of law principles in light of this reasonable disposition,we see no reason not to defer to the court decision.therefore,we reject miller contentions that miller wrongfully retained the children in canada upon issuance of the new york order furthermore,we agree with the district court that canada was the children habitual residence at the time miller absconded with them to the united states.
miller related,because of the new york order,miller was not exercising valid custody rights on august,fails.indeed,because we agree that canada was the children habitual residence for purposes of the abduction claim,we look to canadian law to determine whether miller was exercising valid custody rights in that country at the time of the children removal.see friedrich i,at under the convention,whether a parent was exercising lawful custody rights over a child at the time of removal must be determined under the law of the child habitual residence.citation omitted shalit,at holding that this determination is not limited to internal or domestic law but includes the conflict of law rules of the state of habitual residence.
as previously discussed,the ontario court of all accounts,a competent judicial that miller was entitled to custody of hope and faith,despite the new york order to the contrary.miller failed to provide any authority from canada undermining this decision or any other reason to question the ontario court interpretation of the law of its own country.thus,we are compelled to agree with the district court that miller was exercising valid custody rights in canada when her children were removed from that country 
next,miller asserts that he established two defenses that should have prevented the reunion of hope and faith with their mother in the return posed a grave risk of harm to the children,and that they
