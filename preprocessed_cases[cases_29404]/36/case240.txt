plaintiff linda mccormick appeals the march,order of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan dismissing plaintiff cases against defendants eric braverman braverman,et and citizens insurance company of america citizens insurance,et for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.plaintiff claims violations of,the first,fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution,michigan common and statutory law,and the michigan constitution.although plaintiff sets forth a myriad of claims,her underlying contention is that she is the owner of certain real property,and that defendants have acted illegally in interfering with her ownership.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order.
background 
in,mary mccormick mary filed a complaint of divorce against her husband edward mccormick edward.on july,mary and edward entered into a reconciliation agreement.in consideration of mary promise to withdraw her complaint of divorce and to attempt a reconciliation for a period of one year,edward conveyed his interest in marital real property located at henry ruff road in livonia,michigan henry ruff property to mary.on july,edward conveyed his interest in the henry ruff property via quitclaim deed to mary.plaintiff alleges that on july,as a result of the reconciliation agreement,judge colombo of the wayne county circuit court dismissed the complaint of divorce with the consent of the parties.
on july,mary entered into an agreement with her daughter linda mccormick,plaintiff in the instant case.mary promised plaintiff that she would repay plaintiff for any house payments,taxes,maintenance costs,and any other payments concerning the henry ruff property that plaintiff made.the agreement secured the indebtedness by promising to pay plaintiff for all sums provided if and when the henry ruff property was sold.plaintiff alleges that after july,plaintiff made all of the mortgage payments on the henry ruff property.
on march,mary conveyed the henry ruff property via quitclaim deed to herself and her daughters plaintiff,nancy mccormick nancy,and frances mccormick frances,in joint tenancy.on april,frances conveyed her interest to the remaining joint tenants.on july,nancy conveyed her interest to the remaining joint tenants.on march,mary conveyed her interest via quitclaim deed to plaintiff.plaintiff gave nominal consideration for the conveyance.as of march,plaintiff was the sole title holder of the huff road property 
in,mary filed a second complaint of divorce against edward.on august,the circuit court entered a default judgment of divorce.mccormick mccormick,wl,at,unpublished opinion.the circuit court found that the henry ruff property was marital property to be divided between mary and edward.mary appealed from the property provision of the divorce judgment id.as a condition of the appeal,the circuit court issued an injunction which froze marital assets in certain bank accounts.id.
on september,the michigan court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the circuit court judgment of divorce between mary and edward.specifically,the court of appeals reversed the circuit court decision to distribute the henry ruff property as marital property.the court of appeals found that the circuit court had failed to make any findings with respect to mary property interest,if any,in the henry ruff property.the circuit court failed to even address whether the reconciliation agreement was valid.the court of appeals remanded the case to the circuit court to determine whether the reconciliation agreement and any of the subsequent transfers were valid,as there was a question of whether the transfers were part of a conspiracy to deprive edward of his rightful marital property.the court of appeals also advised that third parties whose property rights might be affected,such as plaintiff,usually must be added to the action,and at a minimum,should have the opportunity to testify at trial.in most cases,third parties should also be represented by counsel.at citation omitted.
on october,before the remand had occurred,edward died.mccormick,wl,at.
after edward death,mary filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding without notifying edward estate.id.on march,judge gillis of the wayne county circuit court dismissed the proceeding and lifted the injunction on the marital bank accounts.mary and plaintiff subsequently withdrew money from those accounts.
upon learning of the dismissal,edward estate moved for reinstatement of the proceeding.on may,judge talbot of the wayne county circuit court set aside the march,dismissal and reinstated the proceeding,and he ordered the return of the money withdrawn from the marital bank accounts judge talbot also transferred the case to the wayne county probate court.
on february,judge mack of the wayne county probate court entered an order of divorce between mary and edward judge mack acted pursuant to the remand instructions of the september,order of the michigan court of appeals.judge mack awarded the henry ruff property to edward estate,on the grounds that mary refused to purge herself of the contempt of this court,has willfully secreted assets of the marital estate,and has violated orders of the wayne county circuit court.at.judge mack did not base his decision on an analysis of the validity of the reconciliation agreement or any of the subsequent transfers.
in,after the judgment of the probate court,plaintiff filed a quiet title claim against edward estate with respect to the henry ruff property.mccormick mccormick,at wayne county circuit court,the circuit court held that plaintiff had no ownership interest in the henry ruff property.id.at.the circuit court found that the conveyance from edward to mary was void because it lacked consideration and because it was against public policy.id.the circuit court found that the conveyances from frances and nancy to the joint tenants were void because the signatures on those deeds were forged.id.the circuit court also found that the march,transfer from mary to plaintiff was void because it was an attempt to conceal the marital assets from the divorce court and a violation of the injunctive orders against the transfer of marital property.id.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied plaintiff appeal.id.at exhibit 
on february,the michigan court of appeals vacated the may,order to the extent it transferred the proceeding to the probate court.mccormick mccormick.the court of appeals also vacated the judgment of the probate court.id.the court of appeals found that judge talbot could properly reinstate the proceeding,as the marriage was dissolved and the divorce was final before edward death.id.at.the court of appeals,however,found that judge talbot improperly transferred the case to the probate court.the remand instructions from the september,order of the court of appeals instructed the circuit court to determine the ownership interests in the henry ruff property,but instead of following this instruction,the circuit court passed the case on to the probate court.id.at.the court of appeals remanded the case to the circuit court with the instructions given in the september,order.id.at.the court of appeals offered the following guidance 
w e note that mary continued refusal to answer questions about the funds she removed from bank accounts in violation of injunctive orders provides an equitable ground for granting judgment against her.thus,the circuit court would be permitted to award the henry ruff property to edward estate,subject to the property interest of linda mccormick 
on remand,the circuit court found that the henry ruff property was the sole property of the edward estate,subject to a life estate for mary,so long as mary obeyed certain conditions,such as insuring the property in the name of edward estate.mccormick mccormick,at wayne county circuit court.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the decision.mccormick braverman,wl,at.may,unpublished opinion.on march,the michigan supreme court affirmed the court of appeals decision with respect to the henry ruff property,but it vacated other portions of the decision that have no bearing on the instant case.mccormick braverman.the supreme court then remanded the case to the circuit court to address those vacated portions.id.thus,after almost twenty years of litigation,the state courts finally agreed that plaintiff had no property interest in the henry ruff property,and that the henry ruff property belonged to edward estate subject to a life estate for mary.
on december,a fire destroyed the interior of the henry ruff property.edward estate moved the circuit court for appointment of a receiver,as mary had failed to insure the property in the name of edward estate and had thus extinguished her life estate.
on january,judge youngblood of the wayne county circuit court appointed defendant david findling findling as the receiver for the henry ruff property.judge youngblood also appointed defendant findling as the receiver for the proceeds of the insurance policy for the henry ruff property,as the property had suffered damage from the fire,although the policy was under plaintiff name.in addition,judge youngblood directed defendant findling to make sure that all necessary repairs were made to the henry ruff property.
on february,plaintiff filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.the named defendants were eric braverman braverman,the administrator of edward estate michael mccormick mccormick,the son of edward and the former administrator of edward estate and the justices of the michigan supreme court michigan justices.in count i,plaintiff alleges that defendants braverman and mccormick seized the henry ruff property under color of state law through fraud,fabricated information,withholding of relevant material,false testimony,malicious,reckless unreasonable acts,in violation of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendment.plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that she is the sole rightful owner of the henry ruff property,and she seeks compensatory and punitive damages.in count ii,plaintiff alleges that she was not made a party to the litigation that resulted in the january,order of receivership.plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the january,order of receivership is void.in count iii,plaintiff makes the same allegations of fraud against defendants mccormick and braverman,but in greater detail.she alleges that defendants mccormick and braverman engaged in various frauds and misrepresentations from onward in order to continue litigation with respect to the divorce of mary and edward.plaintiff seeks the henry ruff property,as well as compensatory and punitive damages.in count iv,plaintiff makes the same factual allegations of fraud and misrepresentations on the part of defendants mccormick and braverman in continuing litigation of the divorce of mary and edward,with a state common law claim of abuse of process.in count v,plaintiff claims that mcl,a statute which gives the michigan probate court jurisdiction over certain issues,is unconstitutionally vague and.this complaint was filed as case.
on the same day,plaintiff filed a complaint in the united states district court against defendant findling and defendant citizens insurance company of america.in count i,plaintiff alleges that the order of receivership seizes the henry ruff property in violation of the first,fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.plaintiff also alleges that the order illegally seizes the proceeds of the insurance policy on the henry ruff property,because plaintiff is the sole policy holder.in count ii,plaintiff alleges that defendant findling has scheduled a search of the henry ruff property,and that the search would be in violation of the fourth amendment.in count iii,plaintiff alleges that the order of receivership,and defendant findling resulting actions,are based on fraud and misrepresentation in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.this complaint was filed as case.
on march,the district court dismissed both of plaintiff complaints due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the doctrine.the court found that the case complaint was an appeal of the state circuit court order of receivership and thus impermissibly before a federal district court.the court also found that the state probate court order of february,extinguished mary interest in the henry ruff property and thus plaintiff did not have an interest in the henry ruff property with respect to case,the court concluded that the thrust of the complaint is that plaintiff is the sole title holder to the henry ruff property and that her claim to that title can not be attacked.the doctrine precludes this court from reviewing decisions of state courts,and as such,dismissal of plaintiff complaint is appropriate as well.at.
plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.

a.the.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court ruling that the doctrine precluded subject matter jurisdiction.gilbert ferry,cir citation omitted.
the district court erred when it held that the doctrine precluded jurisdiction for all counts in the case complaint and for count iii in the case complaint.the district court did not err in dismissing on grounds counts i and ii in the case complaint.
legal framework 
in rooker fidelity trust,the plaintiff filed suit in district court to have a state trial court judgment,which was affirmed by the state supreme court,declared null and void.the plaintiff alleged that the state court judgment violated the contract clause and the fourteenth amendment due process and equal protection clauses.id.at.the district court dismissed the complaint based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the supreme court affirmed.id.at.the court found that the plaintiff complaint was in fact requesting the district court to exercise appellate review of the state court judgment.id.the court noted that the district court jurisdiction was strictly original,and that only the supreme court could exercise appellate jurisdiction over state court decisions.id.at.
in district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,the supreme court reiterated the holding that a district court could not exercise appellate review of a state court decision.in that case,the plaintiff feldman applied to the bar of the district of columbia.id.at.at the time of his application,the plaintiff was already a member of the bars of virginia and maryland.id.the bar admissions committee denied the plaintiff application,as the district of columbia court of appeals,pursuant to its rulemaking authority,had previously adopted rule i b,which stated that a bar applicant could not be admitted without having graduated from an approved law school,and the plaintiff had not done so.id.at.after this denial,the plaintiff petitioned the district of columbia court of appeals to be admitted to the bar without examination or,at the least,to be allowed to sit for the bar examination.id.at.the plaintiff argued that he was more than adequately qualified for admission,and he noted that the district of columbia court of appeals had previously granted waivers of rule i b.id.at.the court denied the plaintiff petition.the plaintiff hickey had a similar experience the plaintiff did not graduate from an approved law school and petitioned the district of columbia court of appeals for a waiver of rule i b.id.at.the plaintiff argued that he continued his education at his law school,as opposed to transferring to an approved school,because the state court had routinely granted waivers of the rule to graduates of a certain school.id.the plaintiff also argued that he was more than adequately qualified for admission.id.at.the court denied the plaintiff petition.
the plaintiff feldman filed suit in district court,alleging that the state court refusal to waive rule i b and its failure to judge the plaintiff individual qualifications violated the fifth amendment and the sherman act.id.at.the plaintiff hickey filed an almost identical suit in federal court,alleging that the state court decision was in violation of the fifth amendment and federal antitrust laws.id.at.the district courts in both cases dismissed the plaintiffs suits,on the ground that plaintiffs sought appellate review of the state court decisions.id.at.the circuit,addressing both cases in a single opinion,affirmed the dismissal of the antitrust claims on the ground that they were insubstantial,but reversed the dismissal of the constitutional claims.id.at.the court opined that the state court proceedings with respect to the petitions for waiver were not judicial,so that the district courts did have jurisdiction.id.at.
the supreme court vacated the circuit judgment and remanded the case.the court noted that a district court was without jurisdiction to review the final determinations of a state court in judicial proceedings,id.at.the court then found that the state court proceedings with respect to the plaintiffs petitions for waiver were judicial,as they involved a judicial inquiry in which the court was called upon to investigate,declare,and enforce liabilities as they stood on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist,id.at.alteration in original quoting prentis atlantic coast line.the court therefore ruled that to the extent the plaintiffs sought review of the denial of their petitions,the district courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.on the other hand,to the extent the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of rule i b,the district courts had subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
turning to the plaintiffs complaints,the court held that the district courts were without jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs claims that the district of columbia court of appeals acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying their petitions for waiver and that the court acted unreasonably and discriminatorily in denying their petitions.id.at.the court reasoned that such claims were inextricably intertwined with the district of columbia court of appeals decisions,in judicial proceedings,to deny the plaintiffs petitions,such that the claims called for the district courts to review the decisions of the state court.id.at.the court held,however,that the district courts did have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims that rule i b was unconstitutional.
the court mentioned the phrase inextricably intertwined in one other portion of the feldman opinion in footnote,the court expressed disapproval of the fifth circuit analysis in dasher supreme court of texas,cir.there,the fifth circuit held that a plaintiff,who in state proceedings had been denied the opportunity to take the texas state bar examination,and who had not raised federal constitutional arguments in those state proceedings,could raise federal constitutional arguments in district court to attack the judgment of the state court.id.at.importantly,the plaintiff in that case claimed that the state supreme court violated the fourteenth amendment equal protection and due process clauses in denying her application to take the bar examination.id.at.in rejecting the fifth circuit analysis,the supreme court noted 
if the constitutional claims presented to a united states district court are inextricably intertwined with the state court denial in a judicial proceeding of a particular plaintiff application for admission to the state bar,then the district court is in essence being called upon to review the state court decision.this the district court may not do.
feldman,at.
after feldman,the courts of appeals took varying approaches in giving content to the phrase inextricably intertwined in applying the doctrine.while the supreme court used that phrase in feldman to twice describe a plaintiff complaint of harm from a state court decision itself,many circuits,including this one,gave an expansive definition to that phrase.see executive arts studio,city of grand rapids,cir a federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court judgment and thus implicates when the federal claim succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.internal quotations and citation omitted.
recognizing the inconsistency in application of the doctrine amongst the lower courts,the supreme court clarified the scope of the doctrine in exxon mobil corp saudi basic indus,d.there,exxon and saudi basic were involved in joint ventures,and a dispute arose as to certain royalties charged by saudi basic.id.at.saudi basic filed suit in state court,seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalties were valid,and,shortly after,exxon filed suit in federal district court,alleging that saudi basic had overcharged exxon.id.at.saudi basic filed a motion to dismiss in district court,which the court denied.id.saudi basic appealed the decision,and the third circuit dismissed exxon complaint on grounds.id.the court found that the district court subject matter jurisdiction terminated when the state court entered a judgment.id.
the supreme court reversed.the court began its analysis with these words 
rooker and feldman exhibit the limited circumstances in which this court appellate jurisdiction over judgments precludes a united states district court from exercising jurisdiction in both cases,the losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended,complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.plaintiffs in both cases,alleging jurisdiction,called upon the district court to overturn an injurious judgment.
id.at emphasis supplied.the court noted that the concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts had long been recognized,and that the entry of judgment by the state court before the federal court in such a situation would not trigger.id.at.instead,preclusion law would govern.id.at.the court also addressed the circumstance where the plaintiff initiated a federal claim after a state court decision 
nor does stop a district court from exercising jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.if a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.
id.alteration in the original quoting gash village of rosemont,cir.
application to this case 
the doctrine does not preclude subject matter jurisdiction in this case of counts i through in case and count iii in case.in these counts,plaintiff does not complain of injuries caused by the state court judgments,id.at she does not claim that the state court judgments,with respect to mary divorce and to the order of receivership,in and of themselves violate the federal constitution or federal law,unlike the plaintiffs in rooker and in feldman.instead,plaintiff claims that certain defendants acted illegally and that a state statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.in count i of case,plaintiff claims that defendants braverman and mccormick committed fraud and misrepresentation in the divorce proceedings between mary and edward estate.in count ii,plaintiff claims that defendants braverman and mccormick intentionally did not make plaintiff a party to the litigation concerning the order of receivership,so that she did not have an opportunity to assert her property right over the henry ruff property.in count iii,plaintiff repeats her claim that defendants braverman and mccormick committed fraud and misrepresentation in the divorce proceedings between mary and edward estate.in count iv,plaintiff claims that defendants braverman and mccormick committed an abuse of process in the divorce proceedings between mary and edward estate.in count v,plaintiff claims that mcl is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.in count iii of case,plaintiff claims that the order of receivership was obtained through fraud and misrepresentation,though she does not specify who committed these actions.
none of these claims assert an injury caused by the state court judgments plaintiff does not claim that the state court judgments themselves are unconstitutional or in violation of federal law.instead,plaintiff asserts independent claims that those state court judgments were procured by certain defendants through fraud,misrepresentation,or other improper means,and that a state statute is vague and overbroad.certainly,these independent claims may deny a legal conclusion of the state court,the henry ruff property is the sole property of edward estate however,this fact does not lead to a divestment of subject matter jurisdiction in the federal courts.instead,the supreme court has instructed that preclusion law is the appropriate solution for these independent claims.it bears repeating that i f a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.id.at citation omitted.
this court recently addressed similar arguments in todd weltman,weinberg,reis,cir.in that case,the defendant debt collector sought to garnish the bank account of the plaintiff debtor.id.at.the defendant filed an affidavit in state court,required by state law,stating that it had a reasonable belief that the target assets were not exempt from garnishment.id.the state court found that the affidavit was valid and froze the plaintiff bank account.id.at a subsequent hearing in state court,the plaintiff proved that the assets in the bank account were exempt,and the state court released the account.id.the plaintiff then filed suit in federal court against the defendant,alleging that the defendant had lied in its affidavit in violation of the fair debt collection practices act.id.at.the defendant argued,among other things,that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the claim because of.this court disagreed and held that did not apply plaintiff here does not complain of injuries caused by this state court judgment,as the plaintiffs did in rooker and feldman.instead,after the state court judgment,plaintiff filed an independent federal claim that plaintiff was injured by defendant when he filed a false affidavit.id.at.likewise,the majority of plaintiff claims in this case assert injuries caused by defendants braverman and mccormick alleged wrongdoing before the state court,or by a vague and overbroad state statute these claims do not assert injuries from the state court judgments.
the question naturally arises as how to differentiate between a claim that attacks a state court judgment,which is within the scope of the doctrine,and an independent claim,over which a district court may assert jurisdiction.we find an appropriate rule of thumb in the fourth circuit decision in davani virginia dep t of,cir.that court explained 
the plaintiffs in rooker and feldman sought redress for an injury allegedly caused by the decision rooker,the plaintiff sought to overturn a judgment in federal district court,and in feldman,the plaintiffs sought to overturn a judgment rendered by the district of columbia court in federal district court.in barefoot a mobil case,by contrast,we extended the doctrine to apply in situations where the plaintiff,after losing in state court,seeks redress for an injury allegedly caused by the defendant actions.
id.at.the inquiry then is the source of the injury the plaintiff alleges in the federal complaint.if the source of the injury is the state court decision,then the doctrine would prevent the district court from asserting jurisdiction.if there is some other source of injury,such as a third party actions,then the plaintiff asserts an independent claim.the second circuit employs a similar inquiry.see hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir f ederal plaintiffs are not subject to the bar unless they complain of an injury caused by a state judgment.in differentiating between a barred claim and a valid claim under,the second circuit provided two instructive examples 
suppose a state court,based purely on state law,terminates a father parental rights and orders the state to take custody of his son.if the father sues in federal court for the return of his son on grounds that the state judgment violates his federal substantive rights as a parent,he is complaining of an injury caused by the state judgment and seeking its reversal.this he may not do,regardless of whether he raised any constitutional claims in state court,because only the supreme court may hear appeals from judgments.
further,by focusing on the requirement that the judgment be the source of the injury,we can see how a suit asking a federal court to den y a legal conclusion reached by a state court could nonetheless be independent for purposes.suppose a plaintiff sues his employer in state court for violating both state law and title vii and loses.if the plaintiff then brings the same suit in federal court,he will be seeking a decision from the federal court that denies the state court conclusion that the employer is not liable,but he will not be alleging injury from the state judgment.instead,he will be alleging injury based on the employer discrimination.the fact that the state court chose not to remedy the injury does not transform the subsequent federal suit on the same matter into an appeal,forbidden by,of the judgment.
id.of course,there are certain exceptions to this rule of thumb.for example,if a third party actions are the product of a state court judgment,then a plaintiff challenge to those actions are in fact a challenge to the judgment itself.see id.at finding that the plaintiffs challenge to a county board of election refusal to tally certain absentee ballots was in fact a challenge to the state court judgment that the ballots were invalid.the key point is that the source of the injury must be from the state court judgment itself a claim alleging another source of injury is an independent claim.as explained previously,counts i through in case and count iii in case all assert injury from a source other than the state court judgments they are therefore independent claims outside the scope of the doctrine.
to the extent that defendants argue that these claims,even though they do not assert injury from the state court judgments,are inextricably intertwined with those judgments so as to fall within the reach of,that argument must fail.we first note that it was this exact language that was the source of the mobil woes as to the application of.in addition,the supreme court used the phrase inextricably intertwined in feldman to describe a claim where the plaintiff asserted an injury from the state court judgment itself the claims of the plaintiffs feldman and hickey that the state court judgments were in violation of the fifth amendment were inextricably intertwined with the state court judgments,feldman,at.and the plaintiff claim in dasher that the state court judgment was in violation of the fourteenth amendment was inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment,id.at.in exxon,the supreme court implicitly repudiated the circuits use of the phrase inextricably intertwined to extend to situations were the source of the injury was not the state court judgment.in short,the phrase inextricably intertwined only describes the conclusion that a claim asserts an injury whose source is the state court judgment,a claim that is thus barred by.see davani,at hoblock,at but the phrase inextricably intertwined has no independent content.it is simply a descriptive label attached to claims that meet the requirements outlined in exxon mobil.
we stress that the doctrine is not a panacea to be applied whenever state court decisions and federal court decisions potentially or actually overlap.the supreme court made clear in exxon mobil that the doctrine is confined to those cases exemplified by rooker and feldman themselves when a plaintiff asserts before a federal district court that a state court judgment itself was unconstitutional or in violation of federal law.in such a situation,the plaintiff seeks appellate review of the state court judgment,and the federal district court has no subject matter jurisdiction over such an action.counts i through in case and count iii in case do not fall within this category,so that the district court had jurisdiction over these claims.
on the other hand,in counts i and ii in case,plaintiff alleges that the order of receivership in and of itself is illegal and causes plaintiff harm.in count i,plaintiff alleges that s aid order of receivership,under color of law,seizes plaintiff real estate in violation of plaintiff united states constitutional rights under the first,fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.under the same count,plaintiff alleges that s aid order,absent any jurisdiction,is also illegally seizing the proceed of plaintiff homeowners sic policy,of which plaintiff is the sole policy holder and interfering with her rights to have said premises repaired from a recent fire.like the plaintiffs in rooker and feldman,plaintiff complain s of injuries caused by the state court judgment rendered before the district court proceeding commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil.at.the count does not allege any independent claim but rather,the count alleges that the state court order itself was illegal and harmed plaintiff.likewise,count ii alleges that a search authorized by the order of receivership would be illegal and would cause harm to plaintiff.thus,plaintiff challenges the legality of the order itself.
the problem with applying to divest jurisdiction of these two counts is that the doctrine only applies to bar a federal plaintiff claim when she was a party in the state court action.johnson de grandy,d.plaintiff was not a party to the litigation surrounding the order of receivership the parties involved were mary,defendant braverman,and defendant findling.the question then becomes whether the doctrine should apply to a federal plaintiff in privity with a party in the state court proceeding the second and third circuits have answered in the affirmative,although only the second circuit decision was filed subsequent to the supreme court decision in exxon mobil.see hoblock,at marran marran,cir.see also bates jones,cir en banc fletcher,concurring in part and dissenting in part because it is a doctrine concerning the integrity of individual judgments,is applicable only when the parties in a second action were also parties,or in privity with parties,in a previous state court proceeding.
this is admittedly a close issue.in exxon mobil,the supreme court stated that the doctrine barred federal claims of losers.at.narrowly interpreted,this language could mean that only actual parties in the state court proceeding may be affected by the doctrine.under a more moderate interpretation,a person in privity with the actual party who loses in state court may be deemed a loser.we find that the latter interpretation is appropriate.the doctrine prevents a party who loses in state court from appealing that decision to the lower federal courts,as only the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction over state court decisions.it would be inconsistent to disallow the party in the state suit to raise a federal claim but to allow his privy to bring the exact same claim.a state party may not circumvent the article iii jurisdictional provisions simply by substituting a privy name for his own in the federal claim.this is especially true because the source of the injury to the state court loser and his privy would be one and the same the state court judgment.in other words,a federal claim that alleged injury from a state court judgment would seek review of that state court judgment,regardless if the state court loser or his privy filed the federal claim.the district court may not entertain jurisdiction over a claim that calls for appellate review,no matter who raises that claim we hold that plaintiff is in privy with mary and is a loser,so that the doctrine bars jurisdiction over counts i and ii in case.

standard of review 
the district court did not address the issue of collateral estoppel,so there is no district court analysis to review on this issue.
plaintiff is collaterally estopped from raising all of the remaining claims.the michigan state courts have already determined that plaintiff has no ownership interest in the henry ruff property.

application to this case 
the michigan state courts have already determined that plaintiff does not have an ownership interest in the henry ruff property.in,in case,plaintiff filed a quiet title action against edward estate to establish her ownership interest in the henry ruff property.the circuit court found that plaintiff had no ownership interest in the henry ruff property,because the conveyance from edward to mary was invalid,the conveyances from nancy and frances were invalid,and the conveyance from mary to plaintiff was invalid see supra.the state court of appeals and the supreme court denied plaintiff appeals.see supra.
collateral estoppel applies in the instant case.with respect to the aforementioned requirements,plaintiff ownership interest in the henry ruff property was an issue that was essential to the circuit court judgment,and the issue was litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue and mutuality is not required,as parties not bound by the prior judgment may use collateral estoppel defensively against the prior plaintiff see monat,at.
a factual predicate of all of plaintiff remaining claims is that she has an ownership interest in the henry ruff property the problem,however,is that the state courts have already decided that she has no such interest.thus,collateral estoppel precludes all of plaintiff remaining claims.
