by a carefully drafted clause in his trust,richard colburn testamentary plan compelled a forced election by his former wife and their enforce their rights under an existing marital dissolution judgment by filing creditor claims,or relinquish those rights and take the gifts provided for them in his trust instruments.the former wife and children filed safe harbor petitions,in pursuit of an order eliminating the election and allowing them to reap the benefits of both the marital dissolution judgment and the gifts under the trust.the trustees opposed both petitions.the trial court found that creditor claims a prerequisite to enforcement of the marital judgment would violate the clause,but that an order to show cause for modification of the child support due under the marital judgment would not.both sides appeal,the former wife and children in search of an order that would allow them to have their cake and eat it too,the trustees in search of consistency.we agree with the trial court that creditor claims would violate the clause but disagree with the trial court finding that an order to show cause would not.we affirm the order denying the safe harbor petitions and reverse the finding that allows an order to show cause.

the northern trust company and three of richard six adult children richard colburn,keith colburn,and carol hogel were named as the trustees of richard trust.
richard died on june,and the trustees thereafter initiated procedures to require anyone asserting a claim against the trust assets including claims based on money judgments to first present a creditor claim to the trustees,subd.a,subd.b embree embree th,d.
in october,jacqueline filed two safe harbor applications one for herself,and one on behalf of the children which was subsequently prosecuted by barbara bergstein as the children guardian ad litem in which she asked the probate court to determine whether creditor claims for spousal and child support and other funds she claimed pursuant to the marital judgment a total of for her and for the children or,in the children case,an order to show cause for modification of child support as an alternative to a creditor claim,would violate the trust clause.in a nutshell,jacqueline and the children claimed the provisions of richard trust did not fully satisfy the obligations imposed on his estate by the marital judgment,and that their proposed creditor claims would carry out,not frustrate,his stated intention to have the trust fulfill his obligations under the marital judgment.
the trustees,joined by the colburn foundation,opposed both applications,noting that the overall distributions to jacqueline and the children under the trust far exceed the amounts required by the marital judgment and contending,among other things,that the proposed creditor claims would be contests under the express terms of the trust instrument because they sought distributions from the trust estate that far exceed ed and differ ed from the distributions for jacqueline and the children provided for under the trust and thus frustrated the purpose of the trust.
in july,the probate court signed and filed an order finding that jacqueline proposed creditor claim,if filed,would violate the trust clause,that the children proposed creditor claim,if filed,would violate the trust clause,but that an application for an order to show cause for modification of child support,if filed,would not violate the clause because the clause is unenforceable as against public policy with respect to modification of child support.
jacqueline and the guardian ad litem appeal from the order insofar as it finds that their proposed creditor claims would violate the clause,and the trustees appeal from the order to the extent it holds that an application for an order to show cause for modification of child support would not violate the clause.
discussion 
jacqueline and the children appeals 
jacqueline and the children contend their proposed creditor claims would not violate the clause.we disagree.
a clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon the instrument gifts and disposition by conditioning a beneficiary right to take the share provided to her upon her agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument clauses are not only valid but also favored as a matter of public they discourage litigation and give effect to the purposes expressed by the testator or trustor.e ven though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the trust in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the trustor unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.burch george cal th,d.

richard clause is a paradigm of clarity and unequivocally states his intent.
he provided that any beneficiary of his trust or will who,directly or indirectly,contested or attacked either document so as to frustrate his dispositive plan by filing a creditor claim or be specifically disinherited and her share would go to the colburn foundation.
he identified the marital dissolution judgment and stated that he had set forth in his trust provisions to fulfill all obligations he might have to jacqueline,daisy,and franklin pursuant to the terms of the marital judgment.he explained that he specifically intend ed that if jacqueline or any personal representative or agent of jacqueline a raise ed any claim that she ha d a community property interest in his estate or against this trust or prosecut ed any action based thereon,b fil ed a creditor claim in his estate or against this trust or prosecut ed any action based thereon,or c in any other manner made any claim against this trust,his estate,the colburn music fund,or the colburn foundation,then in that event jacqueline and all of her descendants including daisy and franklin shall be deemed to be objectors as provided in the clause,and for all purposes thereof,they each shall be deemed to have predeceased him.emphasis added.
lest there be any doubt,he also provided that if jacqueline,either on her own behalf or in any other manner or through any other person commence d any legal proceeding of any nature against him the trustees,his estate,this trust,or any other trust established during his lifetime,or any of his charitable entities,then such action shall constitute a contest of this trust and his will,and he thereby disinherit ed jacqueline and all of her descendants including daisy and franklin.
by its plain terms,the clause bars the creditor claims proposed by jacqueline and the children by its substantive provisions,the trust itself confirms richard intent to have the trust perform all of his obligations under the marital at the same time giving million gifts to each of his children.quite plainly,he did everything within his power to ensure that jacqueline and the children would accept his gifts without challenging his overall testamentary plan,while at the same time forcing their election so that their challenge to the trust,if made,would leave them to their remedies under the marital dissolution judgment.
to avoid this result,jacqueline and the children offer a variety of arguments,none of which have merit.
jacqueline contends that,although it is clear richard intended to satisfy the marital judgment by the provisions in his trust,those provisions do not accomplish his intended purpose.according to jacqueline,her goal is to further richard intent by modifying the trust to conform to the judgment,which she insists is not a contest the children advance a similar argument,pointing to the differences child support and medical support,and the absence of the residence provision from the trust.both arguments miss the point,because the mere filing of a creditor claim is a contest within the plain language of the clause,and the purported reasons for prosecuting the claims are irrelevant.burch george,supra,cal th at,d,estate of orwitz,supra,d at.estate of emerson d.
richard trust provides that,before making distributions to jacqueline and the children and in order to ensure that his estate is eligible for the maximum allowable federal estate tax charitable deduction,the trustees are to obtain either an order from the court having jurisdiction over this trust or other suitable legal release confirming that the trust satisfied his obligations under the marital judgment.in the event one or more of the provisions related to the marital judgment are determined by court order or legal release to fail to satisfy the marital judgment,those provisions are to be deemed void.according to jacqueline and the children,the trustees have failed to obtain the required order or releases,and their creditor claims are nothing more than an effort to obtain the determinations the trustees should have sought and obtained while at the same time preserving jacqueline and the children rights by the timely filing of their creditor claims.we disagree.
first,there is nothing in the record to support an assumption that the trustees were required to act before the safe harbor petitions were filed,or that the time within which the trustees can seek the required order or release has expired.jacqueline and the children could consent to an order confirming the suff
