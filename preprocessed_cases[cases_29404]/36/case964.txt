this is an appeal and from the trial court postjudgment order reducing child and spousal support.in her appeal,respondent cindie greenbaum alter argues that the trial court erred by refusing to enforce the parties marital settlement agreement msa,which stated that child support was to be absolutely downward.in his,petitioner jack mitchell alter argues that the trial court abused its discretion by considering as income the his mother gave him every month.we reject both arguments.the trial court always has the power to modify an existing child support order,either upward or downward,notwithstanding the parties agreement to the contrary.and,where a party receives recurring gifts of money,the trial court has discretion to consider that money as income for purposes of the statewide uniform child support guidelines,et 
we do agree with jack that the trial court misread the msa in setting the amount of spousal support.accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment and remand the matter for the trial court to reconsider that portion of its order.
factual and procedural background 
introduction 
jack and cindie were married in.they had two minor children,samantha and alexandra.when jack and cindie separated in they entered into an msa,which was ultimately incorporated into the judgment of dissolution.the msa gave cindie sole physical and legal custody of the children and required jack to pay child support of per month plus significant additional child support in the form of tuition payments and the like,which are commonly known as.in re marriage of fini th,d.paragraph of the msa stated these obligations shall be absolutely downward throughout the term that child support shall remain in effect.
the msa also required jack to pay spousal support of per month,to give cindie a portion of anything he inherited from his mother or from his father estate,and to maintain an estate plan that left percent of his own estate to cindie.spousal support would not terminate upon cindie remarriage,but it could be reduced to in specified circumstances.
immediately after finalizing the msa in july,cindie moved with the children to georgia where they continue to reside.
b.the current litigation 
on december,jack commenced proceedings to modify his support obligations based upon changed circumstances.jack sought a reduction in child support to the amount required under the statutory guidelines,reduction of his responsibility for the,and elimination of spousal support.cindie opposed the modifications,arguing that under the terms of the msa the child support provisions could not be reduced and,in any event,there had been no change in circumstances.the issues were litigated for over two years,finally going to trial in june.
jack income 
jack testified that he had worked in his family retail drapery business most of his life.he had inherited the business on the death of his father in and continued to operate it,with varying degrees of success,through the time of trial,when his income from the business was about per month.when jack and cindie separated in,jack had anticipated receiving additional income of around per month from a commercial building his mother owned.that income never materialized,however,because jack mother sold the building.thus,according to jack,his income was not what he had expected it to be when he and cindie entered into the msa and was now insufficient to meet all his obligations under the judgment.
jack admitted that his mother covered many of his expenses.she had been regularly giving him per month for many years.for a time after the divorce,jack lived with her.in,she purchased a house in sunnyvale and jack moved into it.she then increased jack monthly stipend to,of which jack used to pay the rent his mother charged.jack mother also paid for jack daughters schools,tutoring,and summer camp.jack used his mother credit card to buy clothes and other things for the girls.his mother paid for transportation and lodging for jack to visit his daughters in georgia several times a year.she gave him money from time to time when he needed it.she paid his attorneys in california and in georgia.and,although jack had declined the offer,his mother had also volunteered to pay the difference between the support and that which jack was able to pay himself.
jack claimed that all the money his mother had given him over the last several years had been loaned.he produced a number of promissory notes dating back to,documenting the debt.the notes were not itemized and did not call for interest.the total of the notes showed that jack owed to his mother trust and to his brother.although the notes had different dates,the notes jack produced at trial were all signed on the same day.jack explained that his mother attorney sent him the notes via email,he printed them,signed them,and sent them back to the attorney.the notes he produced were those he still had on his computer,which he printed and signed all at once.jack testified that the loans would not be repaid out of his inheritance because his mother money was to remain in a trust.
jack explained that his mother began asking for repayment when she learned of the terms of the msa.jack had not wanted to tell his mother about some of the terms of that agreement,particularly the inheritance clause.but as it got harder and harder for him to make the payments required by the judgment,he felt compelled to disclose the entire agreement to his mother who,thereafter,demanded he sign promissory notes for the money that went to support cindie.according to jack,the loans would not continue.cindie countered that,when jack father died,jack mother began giving cindie and jack per month on a regular basis and it was with that source of money that jack had planned to pay some of the support required by the judgment.cindie always understood this money to have been a gift,not a loan.jack mother did not testify.
cindie income 
cindie was a lawyer,although she had not been employed outside the home during the marriage.after she returned to georgia in,she reactivated her license to practice law and obtained a job as a clerk for a superior court judge.her annual salary had risen from in to nearly in.she had some dividend income,as well.her tax return showed dividends of for the year,most of which,cindie explained,came from accounts she owned in joint tenancy with her father.cindie received annual notice of dividends from these accounts but she never actually received the dividends and did not have access to the accounts.she did not submit tax returns for.by the time of trial cindie had liquidated most of her own savings to pay for this litigation and a lawsuit she had commenced against the builder of her house in georgia.her income and expense declaration for showed monthly dividends of and noted that any other dividends she reported on her tax return were paper income only.
the trial court orders 
the trial court made three orders the july,order,the july,amended order first amended order,and the final order of october,second amended order.
the trial court first order rejected cindie claim that child support could not be reduced,concluding that the court always has jurisdiction to modify child support.the court found that since jack was not receiving the per month he had anticipated in,there had been a material change in jack financial situation.the court found that jack monthly income from his business was and that he historically and continually receives per month from his mother and another in cash and benefits,totaling in income per month.the court found cindie salary to be as stated on her wage and tax statements and that her dividends were for all of,per month for,and per month for.applying its findings to the statutory formula,the court determined that jack monthly child support payments should be reduced.the court did not modify the.
in the first amended order,the court confirmed the findings contained in the original order,made the additional finding that,both sides signed a marital settlement agreement which set a floor for support,and reduced the spousal support payment to.jack filed written objections to the calculation of cindie income,the characterization of the per month he received from his mother as income,and the finding that the msa set a floor of per month for spousal support.
the second amended order confirmed most of the findings in the prior orders and corrected an error in the calculation of one of the child support payments.the final orders reduced child support to,and per month for the years,and,respectively.spousal support was reduced to per month,effective january.the court later awarded cindie her attorney fees.
cindie has timely appealed from the second amended order jack has filed a.
ii.cindie appeal 
the sole issue in cindie appeal is whether the trial court had the power to reduce the amount of an existing child support order when the order was based upon the parties agreement that child support is absolutely downward.cindie maintains that the trial court was legally bound by this contractual provision.the question is a legal one,subject to our independent review.in re marriage of pearlstein th,d.
although the parties give it little attention,section is the general rule for modifying or terminating support orders,whether or not the support order is based upon an agreement between the parties,subd.e.section,subdivision a,provides except as provided in subdivisions c and d and subject to family code provisions not pertinent here,a support order may be modified or terminated at any time as the court determines to be necessary subdivision c prohibits modification of an amount that accrued before the date of the filing of the notice of motion.and subdivision d prohibits modification of a spousal support order based upon the parties agreement that spousal support is not subject to modification or termination.thus,under express terms of section,all support orders,even those based upon the agreement of the parties,are modifiable prospectively except spousal support orders that the parties have agreed may not be modified.agreements pertaining to child support orders are not exempted from the general rule.may we infer such an exemption from the statutory scheme we think not.under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.citation.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.rojas superior court cal th,d.we find no such legislative intent.
cindie acknowledges that parents can not,by agreement,prevent the court from increasing a child support order or otherwise limit the right of their minor children to support.elkind byck cal d.she maintains,however,that an agreement may set an absolute floor for support that the court is bound to honor.she rests her argument on puckett puckett cal d,puckett,newhall newhall d,newhall i,and newhall newhall d.newhall ii.these cases are inapplicable.
the puckett line of cases concerned integrated property settlement agreements.puckett,supra,cal d,newhall i,supra,d,newhall ii,supra,d.as witkin explains,under the law prior to,an integrated nonseverable property settlement agreement,approved by the court and incorporated in the judgment,was not thereafter subject to modification.it was necessary,therefore,to determine in each case whether the judgment merely incorporated an integrated,nonmodifiable property agreement or a hybrid agreement,which included a severable and modifiable support award.if the agreement was nonseverable,its support provisions were not modifiable except as the agreement expressly provided.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.husband and wife.
in puckett,the husband sought to reduce his monthly payment to the wife but the supreme court determined that the monthly payments were part of a nonseverable property settlement agreement and,therefore,could not be modified.puckett,supra,cal d at.the court commented that,to the extent the payments were for support of the child,they are not subject to reduction,but they might be increased by the court if the child welfare requires it.id.at.out of context,the statement supports cindie position.but what the court meant was that,although the amount could be increased if warranted by the circumstances,the amount could not be reduced because it was a part of a property settlement,italics added.reducing the monthly payment would disturb the settled division of marital property.jack child support obligations do not reflect the parties division of marital property and,in any event,current law has eliminated the problem posed by the type of property settlements considered in puckett.
in,the legislature enacted what is now section,which provides,the provisions of an agreement between the parents for child support shall be deemed to be separate and severable from all other provisions of the agreement relating to property and support of the wife or husband.an order for child support based on the agreement shall be and shall be made under the power of the court to order child support.thus,under current law,child support orders are always severable from an agreement dividing the marital property and are imposed not by contract but by the power of the court.the puckett analysis,which was also the basis of the decisions in the newhall cases newhall i,supra,d at,newhall ii,supra,d at,is inapplicable.
cindie argues that the purpose of section was to enable the courts to enforce property settlement agreements by contempt and that the section should not be extended to allow the court to modify an agreement the parties had intended to be nonmodifiable.the argument is unavailing.it does not extend the statute to give effect to its plain meaning,which is that the child support payment,although originally based upon the parties agreement,is imposed by is an order of the court.since the child support payment is imposed by law,when the court modifies the amount of the payment,the court is not modifying a private agreement,it is modifying its own order.
the family code allows parents to make an agreement pertaining to child support but such an agreement is always subject to approval of the court,subd.a.this is not a question of first impression.our supreme court explained over years ago when a child support agreement is incorporated in a child support order,the obligation created is deemed rather than contractual,and the order is subsequently modifiable despite the agreement language to the contrary.armstrong armstrong cal d.more recently,this court has emphasized it is true that parties may settle their disputes over child support by agreement.this state has a strong policy favoring settlement of litigation over family law disputes.citation.but such agreements,to the extent that they purport to restrict the court jurisdiction over child support,are void as against public policy.citations.children have the right to have the court hear and determine all matters that concern their welfare and they can not be deprived of this right by any agreement of their parents.citation.thus,these agreements are not binding on the children or the court,and the court retains jurisdiction to set child support irrespective of the parents agreement.in re marriage of bereznak th,d bereznak.
cindie maintains that bereznak does not apply here because that case involved an agreement to arbitrate all child support disputes which,if enforceable,limited the trial court power over child support issues,a result that is against public policy.cindie maintains that agreements setting a floor of support should be favored for public policy reasons.but if,as cindie maintains,the court is legally bound by such an agreement,then the agreement would have the effect of ousting the trial court of its jurisdiction over child support in particular circumstances.it is this limitation upon the court power that bereznak found to be void as against public policy.bereznak,supra,th at,d.
it is true that no california case of which we are aware has addressed the precise question of whether the court must honor an agreement setting an absolute minimum for child support.however,the statutory scheme and associated case law make no distinction between a court jurisdiction to increase an order for child support and its jurisdiction to decrease it.section makes all such orders modifiable,which could mean a change in either direction.furthermore,section instructs that in calculating child support,the court should adhere to the principles,among others,that b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children,subd.b,and that e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,at subd.d.under cindie view,if the parties had previously agreed to prohibit any downward modification of the child support payment,then,even if circumstances change,the court would have to ignore those legislatively mandated principles and require the parent to pay an amount he or she can not afford and that does not represent that parent fair share of support.
at oral argument,cindie stressed that agreements setting a floor for child support should be enforceable for public policy reasons,implicitly suggesting that more is always better than less for the child.while at first glance it might seem that respecting such an agreement would inevitably be in the best interests of the child,that might not always be so.parents circumstances are subject to adversities out of their control.a serious accident,catastrophic illness,or a flagging economy and the hard times that go along with it,can all interpose a reversal of fortune that would make it impossible for the parent to satisfy a level of child support.in such a situation,it would not be in the child best interest to force the parent into a level of debt he or she has no ability to pay.certainly there is no public policy that would require it.we conclude,therefore,that the court always has the power to modify a child support order,upward or downward,regardless of the parents agreement to the contrary.
child.contentions 
although the trial court agreed with jack that the child support order was modifiable,jack maintains that the court erred in calculating the ultimate amounts he must pay.jack argues that the trial court erred by characterizing the he received from his mother every month as income.he claims that the money was either a loan or a gift and that neither is includable as income in the guideline child support calculation.he argues,in the alternative,that as to the he received to pay his rent,it is the same thing as free rent,which,under in re marriage of loh th,d loh,may be considered only as a circumstance warranting a departure from the guideline under section and not as part of guideline calculation itself.jack also challenges the trial court determination of cindie income and its refusal to modify the order for additional child support.
standards of review 
we review a child support order for abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.in so doing,we determine whether the court factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and whether the court acted reasonably in exercising its discretion.citation.we do not substitute our own judgment for that of the trial court,but determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order.in re marriage of schlafly th,d schlafly.in exercising its discretion,however,the trial court must follow established legal principles.ibid.to decide whether the trial court followed established legal principles and correctly interpreted the child support statutes,we apply the independent standard of review.in re marriage of pearlstein,supra,th at,d.
characterizing the 
the trial court did not make an express finding about the nature of the money jack received from his mother other than to designate it as income.jack objected to the finding,arguing that the money was a loan and loan proceeds are not income for child support purposes.in re marriage of rocha th,d.by finally designating the money as income,the court rejected jack argument that the money was a loan.the evidence amply supports the court conclusion.jack mother had paid many of the children expenses for most of their lives.she had given jack and cindie per month during their marriage.she had paid the bulk of jack legal bills associated with this litigation,and had volunteered to make up the difference in jack support payments.there was no evidence that jack had ever repaid any of the money.a logical inference would be that jack mother was very generous and did not expect to be repaid.since there is no dispute that jack mother was not his employer,the court must have determined that the money was a gift.
characterizing the gifts as income 
jack argues that even if the money was a gift,gifts are not income for purposes of calculating support payments.we reject such an absolute rule.
the mandatory formula for calculating child support takes into account both parents net monthly disposable income,subds.a b,which is determined based upon the parents annual gross income.section,subdivision a,defines annual gross income as income from whatever source derived,and lists more than a dozen possible income sources to be considered as part of annual gross income that list includes wages,salaries,dividends,interest,workers compensation benefits,and business income,at subd.a.the section gives the court discretion to include employee benefits,at subd.a and to consider the parent earning capacity in lieu of actual income,at subd.b.subdivision c of section contains a short list of exclusions from gross income.section does not mention gifts at all.the question,therefore,is whether gifts may be considered income for purposes of section.
in interpreting section,our goal is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.hsu abbara cal th,d.we do that by first examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.ibid.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,we may resort to extrinsic aids,including the rules of statutory construction and consideration of the evils to be remedied by the statutory scheme at issue,to help us select the interpretation that comports most closely with the lawmakers intent.ibid.
we begin by noting that the list of income sources in section,subdivision a,is expressly described as a nonexclusive list.the listed items are by way of illustration only.income from other sources should properly be factored into the annual gross income computation.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,ch.in contrast,section,subdivision c,contains a specific list of exclusions.thus,for purposes of the computing child support under the statutory guidelines,income should be broadly defined while the exclusions are specific and must be narrowly construed.asfaw woldberhan th,d.furthermore,although section does not list gifts among its examples of income,it does say that annual gross income is income from whatever source derived,which might easily include some types of gifts.indeed,if the legislature had intended to exclude all gifts from the income calculation,it surely could have listed them among the specified exclusions.in re marriage of henry th,d.there is,therefore,nothing in section itself that precludes considering gifts as income for child support purposes.
existing case law provides little guidance on the point.in re marriage of scheppers th,d,stated,in dictum,that inter vivos and testamentary gifts are not income within the meaning of section.and it is settled that the principal amount of a,lump sum,gift or inheritance is not income but the rents,interest,or dividends generated by the gift are income.county of kern castle th,d.what the published cases have not addressed is how to characterize recurring,monetary gifts such as those jack received from his mother.
in re marriage of schulze th,d schulze involved recurring benefits that the payor spouse received from his parents.the appellate court noted in passing,gifts are not mentioned in section,and,judging from the use of language lifted straight from the internal revenue code,should logically be outside the purview of the child support statute.gross income,in federal tax law,does not include gifts.schulze,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.schulze concluded,however,that the benefits were includable as income because the parent parents were also his employers and,therefore,the gifts were employee benefits which could be considered income under section,subdivision a.schulze was not called upon to consider the really tough case,namely that of the scion of a wealthy family whose parents are not his or her employers and who still manages to live quite well even on a low annual gross income as defined by section because of bona fide nontaxable gifts from his or her parents.schulze,supra,at,fn,d.that is the case before us.
since section does not define income,we turn first to the common meaning of that word to discover the legislature intent.the standard definition of income is simply a gain or recurrent benefit that is usu ally measured in money and for a given period of time,derives from capital,labor,or a combination of both webster new internat.dict.the common law is the same the traditional understanding of income is the gain or recurrent benefit that is derived from labor,business,or property citation or from any other investment of capital.in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d.recurring gifts of money would fit both these definitions except that gifts are not derived from labor,business,or property.that source of the benefit is not universally required,however.one legal dictionary defines income as t he money or other form of payment that one receives,usu ally periodically,from employment,business,investments,royalties,gifts and the like.black law dict.ed,italics added.thus,the common definitions of income do not unequivocally preclude considering recurring gifts of money as income.
we recognize that the definition of annual gross income in section is taken from language used in the internal revenue code.loh,supra,th at,d see.because of this,some courts have proposed a rather formalistic,approach to determining what the legislature intended to include as income under section.in loh,the appellate court rejected a rule,implicit in stewart gomez th,d,which would make anything that reduces living expenses income for purposes of the child support calculation.in stewart,the appellate court had held that the value of the parent living rent free on an indian reservation should be includable as income.id.at,d.loh disagreed with stewart,noting that such noncash benefits were not income for tax purposes and,therefore,should not be considered income for purposes of section.loh held,a parent gross income,as stated under penalty of perjury on recent tax returns,should be presumptively correct.loh,supra,at,d.this court followed the loh approach in schlafly,supra,th at page,d.
in holding that the income stated on the tax returns was the presumptively correct amount,loh noted that use of that standard accords with the legislature goal of uniformity and expedition.loh,supra,th at,d.it is a relatively easy way of identifying realistic income figures and spares chronically overcrowded family courts the burden of determining income on an ad hoc basis,with the risk of inconsistent results.ibid.but loh and schlafly do not control the result here because the concern in those cases was the trial courts having included noncash benefits,unrelated to employment,in the income calculation.loh,supra,at,d schlafly,supra,th at,d.with noncash benefits,the court must make ad hoc determinations of the value,which are more complicated to do and could lead to inconsistent results.these concerns are not present with gifts of cash.cash gifts are readily valued.furthermore,since the purpose of the calculation is to determine how much money a parent has available for the support of the minor children,ignoring gifts that form a part of the parent regular cash flow would give an unrealistic picture of the parent ability to pay.it follows that,even if recent tax returns set forth the presumptively correct amount of income,the presumption could be rebutted by evidence of recurring gifts of money that form a regular part of the parent income picture.see in re marriage of calcaterra badakhsh th,d parent statement of income on loan application showed parent earned more than stated on tax returns.
it is true that gifts are not included as income under federal tax law.but federal tax law is not conclusive.in re marriage of rothrock th,d.in fact,section specifically includes some types of income,such as workers compensation payments,that are excluded from taxable income under the internal revenue code.a in re marriage of scheppers,supra,th at,d.and the internal revenue code express exclusion of gifts and inheritances is not found in section.these disparities flow from the differing purposes of the two legal schemes.the internal revenue code does not so much define the term income as identify that which,consistent with prevailing federal tax policy,might be taxed.see white,realization,recognition,reconciliation,rationality and the structure of the federal income tax system.in contrast,california child support statutes are designed to insure that parents take equal responsibility to support their child in the manner suitable to the child circumstances.section,which lists the principles to be followed by the court in setting the child support award,states that the guideline takes into account the parents actual income,not their taxable income.a parent may have income that is not taxable but that would be available for support of the child.for example,components of a personal injury award paid on account of physical injury might be considered as income for child support even though such funds are expressly excluded from gross income under the internal revenue code.a in re marriage of heiner th,d.therefore,while the tax model will be helpful in many cases,it is not controlling.
whether gifts may be included as income in the child support calculation is a matter of some dispute among our sister states.some state courts have declined to consider gifts as income.see nass seaton alaska,gifts as income blurs the easily administered and historical distinction between gifts and earned income.many of the courts that have refused to consider gifts as income have done so because the donor of the gift has no legal obligation to continue giving.true true me,ikard ikard paso huebscher huebscher.other courts,however,have considered gifts to be income where the gifts are recurring,cash gifts in predictable amounts.ordini ordini.dist so d,gifts from husband parents who had supported couple during marriage are income unkelbach mcnary,regular gifts to parent are income in re marriage of petersen,same barnier wells,regular gifts from dependable party may be income.in our view,these latter cases present the better approach.
the illinois supreme court considered a case much like the one before us and concluded that cash gifts may properly be included in the child support calculation.in in re marriage of rogers,the father received gifts and loans from his family which,so the mother claimed,amounted to a steady source of dependable annual income he has received each year over the course of his adult life.he has never had to repay any portion of those sums,nor has he been required to pay tax on them.id.at.rogers held that these gifts fell within the definition of income contained in the illinois statute,which defined net income as the total of all income from all sources minus specific deductions.id.at,quoting.comp.stat.a.that the gifts may not have been subject to taxation by the federal government is of no consequence.they represented a valuable benefit to the father that enhanced his wealth and facilitated his ability to support the minor child.in re marriage of rogers,supra,at.the court also rejected cases holding that a gift could not be income merely because there was no guarantee that the parent would continue to receive such gifts in the future.few,if any,sources of income are certain to continue unchanged year in and year out.people can lose their jobs,interest rates can fall,business conditions can wipe out profits and dividends.accordingly,the relevant focus under the illinois statute is the parent economic situation at the time the child support calculations are made by the court.id.at.i f the payments should stop earlier than anticipated by
