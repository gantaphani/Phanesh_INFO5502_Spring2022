in this case,we consider whether registration of a marriage certificate was vital to the validity of a marriage under the family law act former civil code section et 
in,a judge conducted a marriage ceremony for joseph cantarella husband and tanya cantarella wife.the marriage certificate,however,was twice rejected for registration due to a technical error on the document.after the second rejection,the parties decided not to resubmit the certificate for registration,possibly to avoid the tax consequences of marriage as a result,the marriage was never registered.nine to years later between and,the parties were married in a new ceremony.
in,the parties dissolved the marriage.as part of the dissolution judgment,the family court ordered husband to pay wife spousal support for several years in accordance with an agreement between the parties 
husband subsequently sought modification of the spousal support order.at the hearing on his order to show cause,the parties disagreed about how long they had been married.husband argued the parties were married in.but wife contrary to a filing she had made earlier in the dissolution proceeding claimed the parties were married in.the court found the marriage was of long duration and therefore awarded wife permanent spousal support.
husband appeals from the spousal support order we affirm,holding the marriage is valid even though the marriage certificate was never registered.
in husband application for modification of the spousal support order,he declared his income had decreased due to the poor economy.at the august hearing on the order to show cause,the court and the attorneys focused on husband and wife respective current incomes.
later,at the end of the hearing,the court asked the parties attorneys how long the parties had been married.wife counsel replied that in wife view,the marriage had lasted eight years and four months consistent with a marriage date of.wife corrected her counsel,stating the marriage took place in.husband disagreed and claimed the year of marriage was.wife counsel then informed the court that the parties had a marriage license and ceremony in,the license was submitted for registration but returned due to an error in the judge address,and wife tried to have the error corrected.husband countered the parties were legally married in.wife counsel acknowledged that the parties went through a second ceremony.the court asked husband whether,at the time of the ceremony,he believed the marriage was legal.husband replied,i want to say no.the court stated,i do believe you.
the court found the marriage was a putative one between and the second legal ceremony,and the second ceremony occurred when the parties learned the original marriage was invalid and decided to do it the right way.the court placed no termination date on spousal support,but stated this was modifiable.the minute order of the hearing states,as to spousal support,that the court,b ased upon wife testimony,found this is a putative marriage of long duration and ordered husband to pay spousal support until either party death,wife remarriage,or further order of the court.but the court written findings and order after the hearing included a finding based on a checked box on a standard form that the parties were married for years,from.
discussion 
husband contends the court erred in finding a putative marriage of long duration where wife did not set forth any facts establishing a good faith belief in the existence of a valid marriage in.wife counters the marriage is valid not putative,arguing the parties fully complied with all procedural requirements for marriage in and were,therefore,validly married at all times since that date.
wife argument requires us to determine whether the parties failure to register a marriage certificate invalidated the marriage.to do so,we must interpret the family law act former et,which governed marriage prior to the effective date of the family code.
we interpret a statute de novo,applying relevant rules of statutory construction.citation.first among these rules is that the plain meaning of the statute words governs.estate of lewis th.if the language is ambiguous,extrinsic aids such as the statutory scheme may be used to construe a statute.ibid.
the family law act defined marriage as follows marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman,to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary.consent alone will not constitute marriage it must be followed by the issuance of a license and solemnization former.thus,former section identified four elements of a marriage consent,capacity to consent,a license,and solemnization.
former section set forth two further requirements for marriage authentication of the marriage,and registration of the marriage this section titled procedural requirements effect of noncompliance stated marriage must be licensed,solemnized,authenticated,and the certificate of registry of marriage filed as provided in this article but noncompliance with its provisions by others than a party to a marriage does not invalidate it.
other sections of the family law act dealt specifically with each requirement.former section governing marriage licenses required the parties to obtain a license from the county clerk prior to a marriage.former,subd.a.the license showed the parties identities,full names,residences,and ages.ibid.the section authorized the county clerk to issue a license only if both parties were capable of consenting to and consummating marriage the clerk could examine the parties under oath and request documentary proof from them.former,subd.b.
solemnization denoted a ceremony where the parties declared,in the presence of the person solemnizing the marriage,that they take each other as husband and wife.former.the person solemnizing a marriage must first require the presentation of the marriage license and if he has any reason to doubt the correctness of its statement of facts,he must first satisfy himself of its correctness,and for that purpose he may administer oaths and examine the parties and witnesses former.under former section,the person solemnizing the marriage the officiant was required to complete the certificate,have it signed by a witness to the ceremony,and return it to the county recorder within days of the ceremony.
former health and safety code section,set forth the minimum disclosures required in a certificate of registry of marriage.required information beyond that mandated in a marriage license included each party date of birth,birthplace,parents names and birthplaces,mother maiden name,number of previous marriages,marital status,and maiden name if a previously married female,as well as the official position and address of the officiant.ibid.
these statutes did not specify which of the foregoing requirements were essential to a valid marriage in.nor does case law answer the question.depasse held a marriage license is necessary to a valid marriage under the family code adopted in in the legislature reorganized the major family law statutes into a new code,entitled the family code.citation.the new code specifically addressed the question of whether the term shall is directory or mandatory.family code section provides that the use of the term shall in the family code indicates that the required action is mandatory.citations.family code sections requiring a license,solemnization,authentication,and registration,but specifying noncompliance by a nonparty does not invalidate the marriage,and all employ the word shall.thus according to the plain language of the statutes,a license is a mandatory requirement for a valid marriage in california.depasse,supra,th at.depasse did not address whether the license requirement under the prior family law act was mandatory or directory.
the family law act itself,however,specified certain circumstances under which marriages were void or voidable.bigamous,polygamous,or incestuous purported marriages were statutorily void from the beginning.former and.marriages were voidable if,generally,at the time of marriage a party was incapable of consenting or of unsound mind or physically incapable of marrying a party prior spouse was alive,but was absent and not known to the party to be alive or a party consent was obtained by fraud or force.former.
these statutes shared a common theme a marriage was actually or potentially invalid if a party did not consent to it or lacked the ability to consent.the statutes thereby reinforced the family law act clear requirement,in its substantive definition of marriage,that the parties must consent to the marital relationship and be capable of consenting.former.indeed,former section containing the marriage definition is the only section relevant to our discussion that was contained in the article of the family law act entitled validity of marriage.italics added.correlative to this,under former section,a nonparty noncompliance with a statutory requirement did not invalidate a marriage.the likely basis for this proviso was that a nonparty failure to perform a procedural duty has little to no bearing on the parties consent or ability to consent.
likewise,other statutory requirements for marriage,such as a license and solemnization,revolved around the core element of the parties consent and ability to consent.in the marriage license,the parties disclosed their ages a prime factor affecting their capacity to consent.former,subd.a a party who is at least years old is capable of consenting to marriage.the county clerk and an officiant were authorized,respectively,to issue a license or solemnize a marriage only if the parties were capable of consenting to marriage.on the marriage certificate,a required disclosure was each party marital status,presumably to deter bigamy.most importantly,a marriage ceremony culminated in the parties declaration that they accepted each other as husband and wife.common sense and tradition tells us this is the moment at which the parties valid consent creates a marriage.indeed,once solemnized,a marriage is presumed valid,and a person disputing its validity bears the burden of proving it void depasse,supra,th at.
in contrast,registration of a certificate did little to ensure the parties had validly consented to marriage,but rather served a record keeping function.registration occurred after the parties had solemnly consented to marriage in a ceremony and after the county clerk and the officiant had satisfied themselves the parties consent was knowing,voluntary,and valid.additionally,registration was the duty of an officiant former,of a nonparty whose noncompliance with statutory requirements did not void a marriage former.
in the rare instance where a party failed to register public evidence of the marriage,such failure might be inadvertent or involuntary as in the case of a rejected certificate or might instead indicate a lack of consent at that time.we do not believe the legislature intended a marriage to be thereby rendered invalid true,the keeping of accurate and complete marriage records benefits the public but this goal pales compared to the societal importance of recognizing the validity of marriages to which parties have consented.to hold that a failure by a party to register a certificate voids a marriage would invalidate marriages already solemnized in this state and would,among other results,affect the marital status of the parties,their property rights and rights of inheritance.argonaut,supra,d at.in wife words,it would negate the manifold mutual fiduciary and legal obligations the parties understood they were incurring,due to a technical misstep along the way.
other sections of the statutory scheme support our conclusion a marriage was valid under the family law act despite a failure to register a certificate,regardless of who bore the responsibility for the nonregistration whether a party or nonparty.for example,under former section,if no record of the solemnization of a marriage was known to exist,the parties could buy a license and certificate of declaration of marriage from the county clerk and had to file it with the local registrar of marriages under former section,if a certificate of registry of marriage was lost or destroyed after the marriage ceremony but before filing with the county recorder,the officiant had to obtain a duplicate certificate of registry of marriage from the county clerk and presumably register it significantly,neither statute stated that in the interim period between the marriage ceremony and the filing of a duplicate or substitute certificate,the marriage was invalid.finally,registration of a certificate was not the only manner in which solemnization of a marriage could be evidenced under former section,c onsent to marriage and solemnization thereof could be proved under the same general rules of evidence as facts are proved in other cases.
accordingly,we affirm the family court ruling in its written findings and order after hearing that the parties were married for years
