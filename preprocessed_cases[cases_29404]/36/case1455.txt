the los angeles county department of children and family services the department appeals under welfare and institutions code section from the order of the juvenile court following a section selection and implementation hearing in which it selected a permanent plan of legal guardianship based on its finding that the child is not likely to be adopted.because there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court finding that the child is not adoptable,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
josue was days old in september when he was detained in the foster home of carmela and fernando,where his sister annel had already lived for nearly two years.the department filed a petition under section,subdivision j on september,alleging that josue sibling had been declared a dependent of the court under section,subdivision b,and that josue parents,maria and nelson,had failed to comply with the case plan ordered by the juvenile court in that case,and had failed to successfully reunify with josue sibling,thus endangering josue and placing him at risk of physical and emotional harm 
the juvenile court sustained the petition on february.thereafter,on july,the juvenile court terminated parental rights with respect to annel,and in an opinion filed february,we affirmed the juvenile court order.in re annel,nonpub.op.
at the judicial review hearing on august,the department reported that mother had completed counseling,but noted that her therapist had recommended against returning josue to her care until she had completed at least six months of individual therapy in order to work on unresolved personal issues.mother objected to further counseling.she stated that she and father were both dating others and did not intend to reconcile,and she planned to move to san jose to live with her mother when she got her children back.father had enrolled in domestic violence counseling on january,but attended only four sessions and never returned.he had not appeared for any visits with josue since about february,and he had had no contact with the social worker,who had been unable to locate him at his last known address.
in the meantime,josue remained in carmela and fernando care and had adjusted well to his foster home.he was in good health,on his immunizations,and developing normally.the juvenile court ordered the department to provide mother further family reunification services,terminated services for father,and ordered mother to attend individual counseling.
in february,the department reported to the court that,after failing to attend any therapy from july through december,mother had resumed individual counseling twice a week to address issues of anger management and family history.mother continued to visit the children regularly,but the therapist noted that mother found the visits overwhelming.she recommended that mother continue in therapy.the department also reported that it had been unable to verify the information mother had given regarding her employment.it subsequently discovered that mother was living with father,who was supporting her financially,and that the two intended to marry,contrary to mother representations that she was unaware of father whereabouts.the department noted mother lack of candor regarding father whereabouts and expressed concern over her lack of a stable or adequate home environment.
by the review hearing on march,mother had found a new home and claimed she was no longer living with father.but she acknowledged to the juvenile court that she was not in a position to have josue returned to her care and agreed to have the matter set for a section hearing to select and implement a permanent plan for josue.the juvenile court found that the parents had failed to comply with the case plan,terminated family reunification services,and set the matter for a section hearing.
at the initial section hearing on july,the department reported that it had identified adoption as the preferred permanent plan for josue.although josue was happy and continued to do well in his foster home,where he had lived his whole life,carmela and fernando were not interested in adopting him.however,josue paternal grandmother had expressed an interest in adopting both josue and annel,and the department had commenced an assessment of her home.
the section hearing was continued to november.at that hearing the department reported that then josue appears to be a very happy child.he appears to get along well with other children and is very bonded to the foster parents who are constant figures in his life.he was also bonded to his sister,annel,and the department reported efforts to find an adoptive home for both of them together.although both children had resided in the foster home since their initial placements,carmela and fernando were in their,and did not intend to adopt the children.no prospective adoptive parents or legal guardians had yet been identified.
the juvenile court ordered that mother visits with josue be extended to unmonitored day visits once a week,increasing to all day eight hours if the visits went well and with department having the discretion to further liberalize.the court continued the selection and implementation hearing to february.
in the interim review report dated february,the department noted mother transient lifestyle,identifying residences known to the social worker where mother had lived since february.in the status review report dated february,the department reported that mother had not visited with the children at all from december,through january.in addition,although mother had otherwise been quite consistent in visiting josue and annel,there was insufficient interaction between her and the two children.the social worker who had monitored the visits observed,m other is more aware of the surroundings outside the visiting room as opposed to engaging in quality time with her children.as a result,minor annel plays independently with the toys in the visiting room or interacts with sibling josue,foster parents or the social worker.the social worker also noted little bond between mother and the children,citing the need to remind the children to acknowledge and say goodbye to their mother at the conclusion of the visits.during the january,visit,the social worker reported that mother sat on the sofa holding her newborn son during the entire visit.josue remained close to carmela and played with the toys in the room.when at one point he left the visiting room alone,mother did not even go after him.
meanwhile,the department had found a prospective adoptive family interested in a sibling group and a date was set for the children to meet them.the department asserted that because the children were bonded to each other,it would be detrimental to their emotional to be separated.
at the february,hearing,the court reiterated its previous visitation order,and continued the selection and implementation hearing a third time to april.
the department interim review report submitted for the april,selection and implementation hearing described mother visits with josue since the previous court hearing.although these visits were to be four or eight hours long per the court order,mother brought josue back several hours early each time,complaining that he was difficult to control,she was unable to handle him,and he would not listen to her.mother had also canceled or postponed five visits because her baby was ill or it was cold outside.
at the contested hearing the court received into evidence various reports submitted by the department and heard testimony from fernando and the department social worker who had been assigned to the case since josue was born.
fernando testified that he and his wife,carmela,had been josue foster parents since he was days old,and they were ready and willing to adopt josue and annel.they had decided to adopt josue and his sister because they loved the children very much,and they had been advised by the social worker that it was possible another adoptive home would be found for the children.although the of whom were in their had previously believed they were too old to adopt,fernando testified that they felt sound and strong,and they pre
