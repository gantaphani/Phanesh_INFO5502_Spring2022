the offer summary contained several compensation bonuses.the first,a transitional bonus exceeding million,was based on of wife trailing twelve months production of and assets of.her entitlement to receive the entire amount was conditioned on her remaining employed as a financial advisor by wells fargo for months,maintaining a gross production level of over million on each anniversary date,and remaining current on any other obligations she owes to the firm.
wife chose to immediately receive the entire amount of the transitional bonus.thus,payment was arranged as a loan evidenced by a promissory note whereby wells fargo agreed to forgive the sum of each month over months.for tax purposes,wells fargo credited wife with an equal amount of income on each monthly pay voucher.however,to enforce the foregoing conditions,it was provided that if she stopped working for wells fargo,the entire unpaid balance of the loan would be due.in the event wife continued working for the firm but failed to satisfy the minimum production quota during annual reviews,wells fargo could reduce the amount of the m onthly b onus p ayment credited to her.
the offer summary also provided wife could receive a deferred recruitment award bonus of.but to be eligible for it she must remain employed by wells fargo until january.
in addition,the offer summary stated wife was eligible for two production bonuses.wells fargo agreed to pay her a first production bonus of if her total gross production equal ed or exceed ed in the best twelve months of the first fourteen month period beginning february and ending march wife achieved this goal and received the entire amount of the bonus in april.like the transitional bonus wells fargo arranged the payment as a loan evidenced by a promissory note with the balance to be forgiven in equal monthly installments over a year span,and crediting an equal amount as income on wife monthly pay vouchers.in addition,wells fargo forgiveness of this obligation was also subject to the same employment and production level conditions.the offer summary authorized a second production bonus if wife achieved a higher gross production level between april and march.wife failed to achieve the higher production goal and did not qualify for this bonus.
in mid,wells fargo announced another benefit for its financial advisors,entitled a level bonus.wife testified that to receive it,she had to meet with clients,prepare and maintain investment profiles of them,plus follow up with each client investment profile.she qualified for this bonus and was paid in mid.as with the foregoing bonuses,payment of the level bonus was arranged as a loan evidenced by wife promissory note with wells fargo agreeing to forgive the balance in equal installments over months and,for tax purposes,crediting an equal amount as income to each of her pay vouchers.wife testified this bonus was also conditioned on her remaining employed with wells fargo and maintaining her client financial profiles.
both parties presented expert testimony on wife book of business and the character of the bonuses she received.andrew hunt,a certified public accountant,testified for wife.he employed the time rule to determine the character of the bonuses and accompanying loans.he described the transitional bonus as a asset,with approximately and a half percent of it on an basis was community and the balance being wife separate property.hunt concluded the first production bonus and the level bonus were wife separate property because,being earned over a period of years,they were received after separation.
wife also called quinton ellis,an associate with a firm providing litigation assistance to firms in the securities industry.he described the transitional bonus as a kind of pay for the book of business coming over,calculated as a multiple of the value of the recruitee production credits of the trailing months before they were to join your firm.the hiring firm would also expect to receive a nine to commitment to earn that bonus because you do want to pay somebody upfront and then have them go into early retirement once they join the firm.ellis described the production bonus as a bonus that is a incentive for the consultant to work extremely diligently in bringing their book over,as well as to continue to seek new business and continue to be successful the level bonus required wife to perform extensive analytical work and complete financial plans for her clients.david altshuler,wife boss,testified the level bonus was a loyalty award created to retain our financial advisors.

stephen zamucen,a certified public accountant called by husband,testified the bonuses wife received were community assets.he explained the bonuses were either based on her book of business transitional,agreed to before the parties separated,or based on wife production first production and level.
the court issued a statement of decision and entered judgment.on wife book of business,the court ruled it had no value and husband did not have an interest in it.in its statement of decision,the court agreed wife received a high salary from wells fargo because of the value of the investments held by her clients,but husband assistance in helping wife transfer her clients to wells fargo did not give him an interest in the b ook of b usiness,there was no expert testimony given as to the value of it,and,citing in re marriage of mctiernan dubrow th,found the book of business can not be transferred to another party for a price.
as for the bonuses,the court ruled the portion of transitional bonus earned during the first months of wife employment with wells fargo slightly over was received before separation and thus constituted community property to be divided between the parties.but it concluded the balance of that bonus and the remaining bonuses were wife separate property because they were not paid or due until after the parties separated.in addition,the court noted wife retention of the bonuses was subject to her continued employment and minimum production requirements enforced by the promissory notes.it found the reasoning in in re marriage of doherty th and garfein garfein d supported its findings.
discussion 
introduction 
the issues presented in this appeal are the trial court characterization and valuation of wife list of clients,her book of business,and the bonuses wells fargo conditionally agreed to pay her.
in general,all property that a spouse acquires during marriage before separation is community property.in re marriage of green cal th,see also,all further undesignated statutory references are to this code.cases have recognized that family code section creates a general presumption that property acquired during marriage by either spouse other than by gift or inheritance is community property unless traceable to a separate property source.in re marriage of rossin th.however,t he earnings and accumulations of a spouse while living separate and apart from the other spouse,are the separate property of the spouse,subd.a.
under california community property law,the characterization of property as separate,community,or is an integral part of the division of property on marital dissolution.in re marriage of haines th.courts recognize several factors relevant to this task see in re marriage of rossin,supra.th at,but the most basic characterization factor is the time when property is acquired in relation to the parties marital status in re marriage of haines,supra,th at.the factual findings that underpin the characterization determination are reviewed for substantial evidence in re marriage of rossin,supra,th at,but i nasmuch as the basic inquiry requires a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values,the determination in question amounts to the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law.citation.as such,it is examined de novo in re marriage of lehman cal th.
once the court determines the assets and liabilities of the community estate,it must value them and make an equal division of the estate,et see in re marriage of walrath cal th.issues concerning the valuation and apportionment of community property are reviewed for abuse of discretion.in re marriage of lehman,supra,cal th at apportionment in re marriage of ackerman th,valuation.
the book of business 
as noted,the trial court awarded wife book of business to her.citing in re marriage of mctiernan dubrow,supra,th,it concluded since wife could not sell her client list,her book of business has no value,and husband does not have an interest in it.on appeal,husband attacks this ruling.he argues the book of business can be valued even if there is no market for it,and in fact she sold her book of business when moving from ubs to wells fargo.husband also relies on the supreme court decision in in re marriage of brown cal d brown and other cases following it for the proposition that rights created under an employment contract entered into during marriage,even if contingent in nature,constitute divisible community assets.wife disagrees,arguing the trial court properly found her book of business was nontransferable,wells fargo agreed to pay her a significant sum of money because she is successful at her job,and that her success is primarily measured by the amount of assets she manages.
we conclude the trial court ruling on the nature and value of wife book of business constituted error.t o qualify as community property,an asset or interest must be property within the meaning of the community property laws.in re marriage of spengler th.husband argues wife status as a licensed financial advisor with the ability to induce clients to follow her when transferring to a new firm is similar to the goodwill found in the business of other professions such as lawyers and doctors.
this argument has merit.business and professions code section declares t he good will of a business is the expectation of continued public patronage.i t is well established that the goodwill of a professional practice as a sole practitioner created during marriage constitutes a divisible asset of the community in an action for dissolution of marriage.in re marriage of foster d,see also in re marriage of watts d.w here the issue is raised in a marital dissolution action,the trial court must make a specific finding as to the existence and value of the goodwill of a professional business as a going concern even if it involves the business of a sole practitioner in re marriage of fenton d.as for the nature of a client list,in dairy dale azevedo cal,the supreme court recognized i t is settled in this state that the names,addresses and requirements of an employer customers constitute part of the goodwill of the business id.at.
the parties have not cited,nor have we found,a california case on point concerning whether a licensed professional list of clients is an asset subject to division in a dissolution action.but courts in other jurisdictions have generally held customer lists of licensed professionals who are employed in a business or industry constitute divisible marital property.moll moll misc d,clients serviced by stockbroker constitute marital asset the thing of value is the personal or professional goodwill of a stockbroker or financial advisor reiss reiss so d,stockbroker signing bonus for clients he brought with him to new securities firm is a divisible marital asset niroo niroo,insurance agent anticipated renewal commissions on policies sold during marriage are type of property interest encompassed within the definition of marital property pangburn pangburn,citing brown,insurance agent contractual right to commissions for future renewals earned during coverture includable within community estate.
the record before us is unclear,but in this appeal husband claims,and wife apparently does not dispute,that she acquired her book of business during their marriage.contrary to the trial court findings,the terms of the offer summary and the testimony of the parties experts reflect wife book of business,list of clients,was a valuable asset.the offer summary states the transitional bonus was based on of your trailing twelve months production,subject to and following verification of twelve months production of and assets of,and that e vidence of both assets under management and trailing twelve month production shall be dated within sixty days prior to your date of hire.
both ellis,wife securities industry expert,and buchler,husband securities expert,acknowledged financial advisors are viewed as professionals.in order to work in the securities industry financial advisors must acquire and maintain one or more licenses.wife professional credentials include being certified as a financial planner,an investment management analyst,and a retirement planning counselor.buchler testified the securities industry now recognizes a financial advisor owns his or her book of business.both experts agreed that industry protocol allows a financial advisor to take the names of his or her clients,plus their account and telephone numbers when changing firms.
ellis described the transitional bonus as kind of the bonus,the purpose of which was to aid the transition and basically,if you would,kind of pay for the book of business as it was coming over.buchler agreed wife received the transitional bonus as compensation for bringing her book of business to wells fargo.he explained the value of a financial advisor book of business would range anywhere from one to three times the gross commissions generated by the book of business.although claiming wife would have been entitled to some bonus based on her previously demonstrated production credits,her expertise,and her ability to build business,ellis conceded that without bringing the book of business to wells fargo she likely would not have received a transitional bonus of million.
thus,wife book of business was a valuable asset.the evidence reflects wells fargo agreed to pay wife million for bringing her customers to the firm.the difficulty presented is that the transitional bonus was to be paid over several years,but wife received the entire amount in advance subject to the conditions that she continue to work as a financial advisor for the firm,maintain a minimum production level,and remain current on her other obligations to the firm.wells fargo enforced these terms by requiring wife sign a promissory note for the entire amount to be forgiven in monthly installments over a to year period.
but the fact that wife right to receive the bonus is subject to contingencies does not preclude it from being a divisible community asset.in
