in this appeal we consider whether a court may find a parent unfit pursuant to section d m iii of the adoption act ilcs d m iii west,with regard to a minor who was born within the statutory period used to assess the parent fitness as to other children.in the case at bar,the peoria county circuit court found that respondent,tontorya,failed to make reasonable progress toward the return of her children during the period between november,and july.based on that finding,the court ruled tontorya an unfit parent pursuant to section d m iii and terminated her parental rights as to all four of her children,including,who was born on january.in an unpublished order,the appellate court affirmed the finding of unfitness and termination of parental rights as to tontorya three older children,but reversed as to unpublished order under supreme court rule.the state now argues that where,as here,a parent has been shown to be unfit because the parent failed to make reasonable progress toward the return of her children during a particular period,the parent is unfit as to all of her children,including one who was born within the statutory period used to determine parental fitness.
we allowed the state petition for leave to appeal and now affirm the judgment of the appellate court.

on january,tontorya gave birth to a fourth daughter,dcfs took into protective custody on january,and placed her in foster care.on january,dcfs filed a neglect petition alleging to be in substantial risk of physical harm due to the fact that her siblings were already under the guardianship of dcfs as a result of neglect by tontorya,and that tontorya had not made sufficient efforts or progress to allow for the return of those children.that same day,the court issued a temporary shelter care order placing in the temporary custody of dcfs.on february,tontorya admitted in court the allegations of neglect contained in the state petition concerning and the court found to be a neglected minor.at a may,dispositional hearing,was made a ward of the court with dcfs as her guardian.
