los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs social workers visit children declared dependent court wards welf,in the children placement while the children remain court wards.dcfs regulations generally require assigned social workers to visit each ward monthly.however,the regulations permit dcfs supervisors to approve less frequent social worker visits under specified circumstances,such as when the child placement is positive and of long duration.for convenience,we adopt the parties nomenclature and refer to dcfs decisions to permit such visits less frequently than monthly as waivers or variances.the regulations permit dcfs to determine when variances are appropriate.
the alliance for children rights alliance,an advocacy group,believed dcfs routinely approved variances for budgetary rather than reasons,to accommodate high social worker caseloads.alliance originally sought a blanket order prohibiting dcfs from using waivers in any case,essentially mandating monthly visits in all cases.the trial court refused to issue such a broad order.however,over dcfs opposition,the trial court issued a ruling requiring dcfs to submit each variance to the dependency court judge supervising that particular ward for approval at a noticed hearing.
dcfs appeals.preliminarily,alliance contends the ruling was a blanket order,subject to review only by writ petition.see code civ,cal.rules of court,rule.dcfs responds the order was an appealable injunction.code civ,et we need not resolve this procedural dispute.if the ruling was an injunction,the parties correctly agree it was appealable.code civ,subd.a.if the ruling was a order,subject to writ review see contra costa newspapers,superior court th,d kalivas barry controls th,d,we would issue an osc order to show cause and have the matter briefed and argued.because the parties and the court treated the case as an appeal,we leave it in that posture,without thereby deciding whether it constituted an injunction or a blanket order.again,for convenience,we label the challenged ruling an order.
on the merits,dcfs raises several related challenges to the order.dcfs contends the order violates the separation of powers by wrongly imposing judicial review of decisions properly made exclusively by dcfs,and by compelling the spending of money.dcfs also contends the order is based on legal and factual errors and omissions,including the trial court reliance on its own experience,which was not part of the record.finally,dcfs argues alliance failed to show the existing practice harmed dependent wards,or that the challenged order would better protect them.
alliance responds the order is proper as part of the dependency court exercise of jurisdiction over each ward case,and was legally and factually supportable.
we reject dcfs claims and affirm the challenged order 
in april,alliance petitioned the juvenile court for a special order prohibit ing the use of children social worker visitation waivers by dcfs for children placed in state licensed and foster family agency certified foster homes.the petition alleged without minimal monthly visitation,los angeles county lacks the ability to know the full nature and quality of care foster children receive,the full extent of harm children may face in foster care,and how to protect children from future harm while in foster care.
on may,dcfs filed its opposition.along with urging dismissal because the petition was not supported by points and authorities or exhibits and declarations,dcfs argued the request was unnecessary and violated the separation of powers.
the trial court gave alliance time to submit evidentiary support for its requested order.both sides submitted numerous reports,declarations,regulations,and other exhibits supporting and opposing the requested order.
alliance submitted a report by the los angeles county foster care task force.the report concluded children in foster care received inadequate supervision to ensure their safety and recommended ending visitation waivers.
alliance submitted a los angeles county grand jury report.that report noted that dcfs social workers often do not make monthly visits,sometimes visiting as infrequently as four months to two years.the report noted that the infrequent visits made the children uncomfortable when visits did occur.
alliance also submitted the standards of excellence for family foster care services by the child welfare league of america.those standards explained the social worker crucial role in assuring the child safety and proper progress,and recommended at least monthly visits.the standards further recommended either more or less frequent visits depending on a particular child situation and progress.
the former dependency court supervising judge declared how reliant the court was on social worker reports for information on foster children,and that infrequent visits deprived the court of accurate and necessary information.the judge also declared dcfs rarely notified the court if waivers were in effect for particular children.
several dependency court attorneys who represented dependent children and the director of the western child welfare law center declared less frequent visits generally were not in the children best interest and frequently failed to detect deteriorating conditions in the placement,the child,or both.
alliance submitted a public records act request to dcfs for the monthly number of waivers in wards and documents supporting these waivers.dcfs responded that it does not currently compile this information and is unable to meet your request.
dcfs submitted extensive documentation regarding the los angeles county board of supervisors study of the issue.the board foster care task force recommended the board adopt a mandatory monthly visit standard,which the task force believed would require additional funding and legislation.dcfs opposed the recommendation because it would require nearly million in annual costs,but noted that much of that cost could be reimbursed by the state.dcfs also responded it would be in favor of the recommendation if it was sufficiently funded.
dcfs objected to alliance additional briefing and evidence.dcfs moved to dismiss and to strike the additional briefing as expanding the case,and lodged evidentiary objections to the evidence.
the trial court held a hearing on september.regarding dcfs motions to strike and dismiss and objections to alliance evidence,dcfs argued alliance supplemental briefing and evidence put dcfs in a position where we had no opportunity to reply to the documents that they submitted to the court.dcfs think s that basic fairness would allow us an opportunity to reply.there is a case that basically says you ca enlarge the application for a motion in a reply.the reason is that there no opposition to a reply.that it.after a lengthy discussion about the propriety of dcfs motions to strike and dismiss and evidentiary objections,dcfs stated i f the court wants to consider all the stuff in our motion,our reply,our motion to strike,as a basic response to whether or not the court has the power to grant alliance requested relief,we do have an objection to that.later,dcfs reiterated if the court wants to consider all this at once and go to the merits,dcfs is not going to object.the parties and the court later agreed the court could consider all the exhibits submitted by both parties 
the hearing then proceeded to arguments on the merits of alliance petition.dcfs began its argument by stating alliance was asking the court to issue what is tantamount to a regulation or statute,because it applies to all our cases without looking at whether or not it a good idea in this specific instance or not.
this colloquy followed the court i s the practice that any individual dependency judicial officer may follow,as i have in particular individual cases,based upon the record to order that the worker visit,notwithstanding whether a waiver has been sought or not,to order the worker to visit the child monthly,weekly,daily is that in excess of the court authority or not 
owens dcfs counsel if the court directed us on a specific case to visit the child on a weekly basis,on a daily basis,on a hourly basis,we would make every attempt to do that.
the court i appreciate the desire to comply.my question is,legally,do you believe that the court has the authority to make that order or not 
owens i think it largely depends on whether the order is based upon facts that are present within the circumstances of the case that would justify the issue 
the court let presume that the court makes a report that states facts that indicate this is a special needs child who had recent emotional problems or any number of other possibilities.
owens on first blush,i would say yes,you have the authority to do this on a basis.that not what alliance is asking for.
the court continued its questioning dcfs concede s and agree s with alliance and the court that the court has the lawful authority to issue such an order,contrary as that may be to the language of the regulation that,according to your argument,fully and exclusively empowers dcfs to follow the procedure in the regulation waiver process and file the waiver.how is that different in an individual case,just on a legal basis,from the court doing so on a blanket basis 
owens answered y ou still have the regulation.the regulation is still valid.perhaps maybe even the waiver that dcfs had made to the regulation is still valid.however,what you have is you have a court order that saying that after reviewing this case what i saying on this case,because of the special circumstances of this child,that i think that i going to order that you visit every three weeks or whatever.and if dcfs did not comply what dcfs would be violating is that regulation.dcfs would be violating your court order.
as the colloquy continued,dcfs counsel repeatedly agreed that the court could order visitation more frequently than the regulations permitted,so long as it did so in an individual case after considering the specific facts of that case.
later,the court and parties discussed whether dcfs knew how many waivers had been issued.as noted,dcfs did not keep cumulative records on that topic,although dcfs could review any particular case and determine whether a waiver had been issued in that case.alliance argued dcfs did not monitor waivers,did not know how many had been granted or under what circumstances,or whether doing so was in the best interest of the children.in response,dcfs cited a statistical analysis,studying two percent of its cases,which extrapolated an estimate that waivers had been granted in about eleven percent of cases,and were generally appropriate.dcfs argued the court had to accept that study because it validate d itself.
in rejecting dcfs argument that the court had to accept the study,the court stated my experience,sitting for five years as a dependency judicial officer,is that in many cases the fact that a waiver was obtained or sought and a child who is a dependent of the court was not visited on a regular basis was harmful to that child best interests.so i am not persuaded that a two percent sample is an appropriate way to determine whether the children of this county,the or so that are in foster appropriately cared for,when i know from five years of experience conducting tens of thousands of hearings for many thousand children,i know that in the cases where i made orders to workers to visit a child more frequently even than the standard,or made orders precluding dcfs from waiving the requirement,i know that in every case the children are not safe and protected.so i not convinced by the study.despite this statement,in its later findings supporting the challenged order,the court accepted and relied upon the study.
the court later announced a tentative ruling i am inclined to issue an order establishing a process by which dcfs would have the burden of filing a request with the court in any case where it seeks a waiver from the visitation rule.and if in fact this is the order that i make,i will set forth in detail what i would expect to be contained as the minimum required contents of such a request,the absence of which would permit the individual judicial officer to deny it without hearing.the court explained why it was considering such an order,that it would continue to study and think about the issue,and would permit each side to submit one additional brief to address all the issues previously briefed and discussed,including the tentative ruling.
on december,the court held a second hearing.after hearing further argument,the court issued its page ruling.the court made the following findings.dcfs conducted a random audit of cases in june which revealed that dcfs social workers requested waivers from the monthly visitation standard in of cases audited.it appears that all such audited waivers were granted.declaration of anita bock,august,based on this evidence,the court finds that the practice of obtaining foster child visitation waivers is common practice in los angeles county.
no evidence was presented to the court regarding whether any process exists whereby dcfs or any other entity reviews and considers individual waiver requests to determine whether the request meets the regulatory established criteria.
dcfs admitted that juvenile dependency judicial officers have the authority on a case by case basis to order dcfs to visit dependent children monthly or more often if necessary.
los angeles county juvenile dependency judicial officers rely upon dcfs court reports in order to meet their statutory obligations set forth above 
the information,observations,evidence and child statements contained in these court reports must be current,accurate and complete in order for los angeles county juvenile dependency judicial officers to fulfill these statutory obligations.in the absence of monthly,or if necessary,more frequent visits by dcfs social workers with each dependent foster child,the information,observations,evidence and child statements contained in these court reports may not be current,accurate and complete.
the order stated.prior to acting on a visitation waiver in any case involving a dependent of the los angeles juvenile court,every dcfs social worker must submit a report waiver report to the judicial officer in that case,with notice to all other parties.such waiver report shall state whether or not or dcfs has reviewed and considered the waiver request and,if so,set forth the or dcfs determination,including a copy of any written documentation of the or dcfs determination.additionally,the waiver report shall set forth the grounds for the waiver request including a factual basis supporting each and every criteria required by child welfare service manual,regulations,et,to establish that there are grounds for issuance of a waiver.
the judicial officer shall set a noticed hearing at the earliest possible date for review of the waiver report.
at the hearing,the judicial officer will read and consider the waiver report and consider other relevant evidence to determine whether grounds exist for issuing a specific order regarding frequency of visitation.
by january,dcfs must provide a list of all dependent children who are currently not visited monthly pursuant to a visitation waiver,including the child name and case number,either to the presiding judge of the juvenile court or to the judicial officer hearing each such child case.this list shall be made available,by court department,to all counsel who regularly practice in each department.
at the hearing,the court explained its ruling i do see any basis that the alliance lacks standing.this organization others like it have often brought petitions to the court for blanket orders that often have been agreed to by the county without such an objection being made 
the question about preemption is not persuasive as it is set forth here.particularly referencing action by the county board of supervisors seeking legislative action or that the court is requiring the allocation of funds to carry out the order.
the court order will simply set forth what the court believes is consistent with the law.the court is not ordering dcfs to spend money in issuing whatever blanket order that i issue anymore than in an individual case.when a court orders a social worker t
