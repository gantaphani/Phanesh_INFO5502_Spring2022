eighteen months after the trial court appointed guardians for the minor,her parents petitioned to terminate the guardianship.among other things,they asserted they were now able to adequately care for the minor and,thus,they were entitled to regain custody of their child.the court denied the petition,finding that although the parents can,at this time,provide food,shelter and clothing for the child,it would be detrimental to the minor to terminate the guardianship.
the parents appeal.their primary contention is that because they were fit parents who could provide adequate food,clothing,and shelter for the minor,it was their constitutional right to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody.we disagree.
as we will explain,a parent constitutional right against judicial interference with the parent child rearing decisions applies to a fit parent who has custody of the child.here,the parents did not have custody of the minor a guardianship had been established,and the guardians had provided the minor with custody and care for several years.because the parents were not participating in the parenting of the minor,they were not entitled to the constitutional protection afforded to parents acting in that role.the test for determining whether to terminate the guardianship was the best interest of the child.substantial evidence supports the trial court decision that to terminate the guardianship would have been detrimental to the minor and,thus,not in her best interest.the parents other attacks on the decision also lack merit.thus,we shall affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural background 
for clarity and to preserve the minor privacy,we will refer to the minor parents as mother and father,or collectively as the parents.the minor guardians are her maternal uncle and his wife.we will refer to them as uncle and aunt,or collectively as the guardians.
in,when the minor was eleven years old,her family was experiencing difficulties.father had an alcohol problem and multiple convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol,and his driver license had been revoked.mother was unemployed.father was working but not that much.the parents separated,father moved to another city,and mother commenced proceedings to dissolve the marriage.mother then began to experience health problems,including a benign lung tumor and heart problems,and she was hospitalized on at least two occasions.in april,mother placed the minor in the care of the uncle and aunt.
by june,the parents had reconciled and were living together a long distance away from the minor.the uncle and aunt then filed a petition seeking appointment as the minor guardians.it appears the petition was precipitated by the minor expressed wish to remain in the custody of her uncle and aunt by her fear that if she visited her parents,they would not allow her to return to the uncle and aunt care and by an angry telephone confrontation between the minor and her parents.
after a court investigator recommended that the petition be granted,the parents agreed to a schedule of visitation and with that stipulation,they did not oppose the petition.in august,the petition was granted,making the uncle and aunt the minor guardians.in,following an annual review,the guardianship was continued in effect.
shortly before the scheduled annual review in,the parents filed a petition to terminate the guardianship.the parents and the guardians then reached an agreement for the minor to spend every other week in the summer with the parents and,if everything went well,for the minor to be returned to parental custody in the fall.the trial court postponed,until after the summer,a hearing on whether to terminate the guardianship.
all did not go well.the visitation schedule failed,and the minor made it known that she was strongly opposed to being returned to her parents custody.the guardians thus decided to oppose termination of the guardianship,and they successfully asked the court to appoint counsel for the minor to represent her interests.
at the hearing on the petition,the parents presented evidence that they had improved the conditions which had resulted in the guardianship.father was employed and no longer was abusing alcohol and drugs mother health issues were under control they had rented an apartment and there no longer was disruption,anger,hostility or problems between them.the parents also asserted that while the minor had been in the guardians custody,she was not getting the kind of education she needed.
it was stipulated the minor would testify that when she visited her parents,they provided her with adequate food,clothing,and shelter,and guidance in the sense the parents directed her what to do and not to do,but that the conditions could have been better.
the guardians presented the following evidence at the hearing.
mother has a severe anger control problem she will scream,yell,hit,and throw things,often on an unpredictable basis.father continues to drink to excess,and he and mother often engage in loud and lengthy screaming matches.although there was no evidence father had been physically violent to the minor,he was physically violent to her two older half brothers,both of whom eventually were removed from the home.
when the minor first came to live with the guardians,she was pale,appeared malnourished,had no muscle tone,and had obviously poor hygiene habits.her eyes looked sunken or glazed,and she appeared to be deprived of sleep.
the principal of the school the minor had begun to attend testified the minor was two to three years behind in most subjects.the principal noted that although the minor wore glasses,she complained of headaches caused by reading and studying.she was extremely reserved,d id not know ordinary politeness,and did not know how to interact with a sic other people,especially children her own age.according to the principal,the minor lacked physical as running,catching,and a child of her age should have.
the minor told the guardians that she had not seen an eye doctor in years.after having an eye examination,the minor obtained new glasses and her headaches and concentration problems disappeared.in school,she was able to catch up to her grade level and make the honor roll.she developed social skills and made many friends.she also developed physical skills and was an active participant in team sports.
the minor did not want the guardianship to end.although she loved her parents and wanted to be able to talk with and visit them,she was strongly against being returned to their custody.
in arguing for continuation of the guardianship,the minor counsel stated this child has been in a stable environment for four years.to remove her from it and return her as though she was a borrowed car to her parents would do great damage to this child and to whatever hope the parents have of any kind of relationship with her.
the parents took the position that they were currently fit parents because they could provide adequate food,shelter,clothing,and guidance for the minor,and since they now were fit parents,it was their constitutional right to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody.
the trial court found that the parents can,at this time,provide food,shelter and clothing for the child.nevertheless,the court concluded that when a natural parent is seeking to terminate the guardianship there must be a showing of overall fitness on the part of the natural parent seeking to end the guardianship sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma of removing a successful caregiver.based upon its review of the facts,the court found that t o terminate this guardianship at this time based on the facts presented would be detrimental in every sense of the word to the minor.thus,the court denied the parents petition.
discussion 
the parents assert that this case presents a mixed question of fact and law,and that we should review the issues de novo in the words of their counsel,we should give no deference to the ruling or judgment of the trial court,and conduct essentially the same inquiry as that conducted by the trial court we disagree.
the resolution of a legal dispute involves three steps establishing the facts determining the applicable law and applying the law to the facts.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
the first step,determining the relevant facts,is committed to the trier of the facts and is reviewed on appeal with deference to the factfinder decision by applying the venerable substantial evidence test.ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d,see guardianship of kassandra th,d.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the trial court decision,resolving all conflicts in the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in support of that court findings.crawford southern pacific cal d.in short,we review the evidence but do not weigh it we defer to the trial court findings to the extent they are supported by substantial evidence.estate of teel cal d,county of mariposa yosemite west associates d.
throughout their brief,the parents state and argue the facts in a manner most favorable to themselves,in disregard of contrary evidence.this is inappropriate.the assertion that this case presents a mixed question of fact and law has relevance only to the third step in the dispute resolution process,application of the law to the facts.ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d.appellate review of the trial court determination of the first step in the process,finding the underlying facts,is confined to substantial evidence review.ibid.
with respect to the second step in the dispute resolution process,determining the applicable law,we independently review all issues of law presented by the parents.ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d,hill city of long beach th,d.
the third step,applying the law to the facts,is reviewed under the deferential clearly erroneous standard if the inquiry is essentially factual,if it is founded on the application of the trial court experience with the mainsprings of human conduct ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d.if,however,the inquiry requires a consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values,the question is predominately legal and will be reviewed de novo.see also crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.
the decision whether to terminate a guardianship is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court,guardianship of stephen th,d.it is an inquiry that is particularly founded on application of the trial court experience with human conduct.thus,when the trial court applies the appropriate legal standard,its determination is subject to deferential review on appeal.guardianship of d.guardianship of davis d.guardianship of white d.hence,we reject the argument that we can disregard the trial court determination and decide the issue anew.
the parents claim that because they are fit,they can provide adequate food,clothing,shelter,and guidance for the are entitled to have the guardianship terminated and the minor returned to their custody.this is not the statutory standard in california law.as we will explain,it is the best interest of the child that governs whether the trial court should terminate a guardianship.
former section of the probate code stated in pertinent part upon petition of the guardian,a parent,or the ward,the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is no longer necessary that the ward have a guardian or that it is in the ward best interest to terminate the guardianship.stats,ch,further section references are to the probate code unless otherwise specified.
in guardianship of kassandra,supra,th,d hereafter kassandra,the court of appeal observed that t he troublesome part of former section lies in the disjunctive or.by using that little word,the legislature signaled that a guardianship might be terminated even if it was in the best interest of the child to do so,as long as it was no longer necessary for the child to have a guardian.kassandra,supra,th at,d,orig.italics.
kassandra concluded that the phrase no longer necessary can not be construed as a mere synonym for best interest of the child because that would make the phrase surplusage.kassandra,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,the court rejected the view that a guardianship must be terminated merely because a parent meets the minimal standard of fitness.id.at,d.c ontinuity and stability in a child life most certainly count for something children are not dogwood trees,to be uprooted,replanted,then replanted again for expediency sake.id.at,d.in substantive family law,stability and continuity in a child living arrangement are so important in themselves that there must be a persuasive showing of changed circumstances affecting the child to overcome the disruption necessarily inherent in any change of custody.id.at,d,orig.italics.
thus,kassandra held that in considering a parent request to terminate a guardianship,the trial court must evaluate the parent fitness in the context of whether changed circumstances justify a change in custody.kassandra,supra,th at,d.the bottom line is this the no longer necessary language of probate code section necessarily requires a showing of overall fitness on the part of the natural parent seeking to end the guardianship sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma of removing a successful caregiver.id.at,d.
in guardianship of simpson th,d hereafter simpson,the court of appeal that decided kassandra reiterated and adhered to its earlier decision.in simpson,a father sought to terminate a guardianship of his children,and the trial court put the burden on the guardians to prove by clear and convincing evidence that returning the children to father custody would be detrimental to them.simpson concluded this was erroneous.instead,as california courts have done for generations,the court should have examined the totality of evidence bearing on the father fitness with the burden upon him to show sufficient overall fitness to justify the termination of the guardianship.simpson,supra,th at,d.
since kassandra and simpson were decided,the legislature has acted to eliminate the aspect of the law those decisions found to be troublesome.in,the legislature amended section to state in pertinent part upon petition of the guardian,a parent,or the ward,the court may make an order terminating the guardianship if the court determines that it is in the ward best interest to terminate the guardianship.stats,ch.thus,the legislature eliminated the no longer necessary ground for termination of a guardianship,and established the best interest of the ward as the sole criterion.
any doubt as to the legislature intent is resolved by reference to other aspects of the legislation,including the enactment of section,subdivision a to state,the legislature finds and declares that it is in the best interest of children to be raised in a permanent,safe,stable,and loving environment,and the amendment of family code section.
prior to the legislation,family code section provided that before placing a child in the custody of a person or persons other than a parent without the consent of the parents,a trial court had to find that granting custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent was required to serve the best interests of the child.stats,ch.that standard is applicable in proceedings to establish a guardianship and to appoint a guardian,subd.b guardianship of stephen,supra,th at,d.
in the legislation,the substance of former family code section was retained as subdivision a of that section,and three new subdivisions were added as follows 
b subject to subdivision d,a finding that parental custody would be detrimental to the child shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence.
c as used in this section,detrimental to the child includes the harm of removal from a stable placement of a child with a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of his or her parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.a finding of detriment does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents.
d notwithstanding subdivision b,if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person to whom custody may be given is a person described in subdivision c,this finding shall constitute a finding that the custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child absent a showing by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary.stats,ch.
the amendment of family code section demonstrates the legislature intent when at the same time it amended section.in short,the legislature agreed with the holding in kassandra that continuity and stability in a child life most certainly count for something kassandra,supra,th at,d and found that,in the absence of proof to the contrary,removing a child from what has been a stable,continuous,and successful placement is detrimental to the child,subds.c,d.and in that circumstance,a finding of parental unfitness is not necessary to a finding of detriment to the child,subd.c.
consequently,now the best interest of the child is the sole criterion for termination of a guardianship.the fact that the trial court in this case applied the standard set forth in kassandra and simpson did not harm the parents because that standard was more favorable to them than is the legal standard set forth in section.
in the parents view,the best interest of the child standard for termination of a guardianship is unconstitutional as applied to them.relying on the united states supreme court decision in troxel granville,d hereafter troxel,they contend that because they are able to provide minimally adequate food,clothing,shelter,and guidance for the minor,their fundamental rights as biological parents required the trial court to terminate the guardianship and return the minor to their custody.we disagree.
troxel involved a visitation schedule in favor of grandparents and against a natural,custodial parent.noting that all states have enacted statutes providing for grandparent visitation in some form troxel,supra,at,fn.at,fn,d at,fn.plur.opn.of,the supreme court found the state of washington nonparental visitation statute at issue in troxel was breathtakingly broad.id.at.at,d at.the statute permitted any person at any time to petition for visitation and gave trial courts the power to overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent based solely upon the judge view of the best interest of the child.id.at.at,d at.
the plurality opinion concluded that,as applied to that case,the washington statute unconstitutionally infringed upon the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.troxel,supra,at.at,d at.this was so because there was no allegation or proof that the mother,who had maintained continuous custody of the children,was an unfit parent id.at.at,d at,the mother had agreed to meaningful grandparental visitation,but simply did not allow it with the frequency and duration desired by the grandparents id.at.at,d at and the case involved nothing more than a simple disagreement over the mother decision id.at.at,d at.
the plurality opinion held that parenting decisions made by fit,custodial parents must be presumed to be in the best interest of their child.troxel,supra,at.at,d at.the problem in troxel was not that the trial court intervened,but that when it did so,it gave no special weight at all to the parent determination of her daughters best interests.id.at.at,d at.in fact,the trial court appeared to have applied a presumption in favor of the grandparents and against the mother decision.ibid.because a court may not interfere with the child rearing decisions of a fit,custodial parent simply because it believes that a better decision could be made,the washington statute was unconstitutional as applied in that case.id.at.at,d at.
appellate courts in california have followed the plurality opinion in troxel in concluding that nonparent visitation orders were unconstitutional as applied to the specific facts at issue.see in re marriage of th,d zasueta zasueta th,d herbst swan th,d punsly ho th,d kyle donald th,d.however,it also has been recognized that in appropriate circumstances a court may impose a visitation order against a custodial parent,and that such orders are not per se invalid.in re marriage of harris cal th,d,in re marriage of ross kelley th,d fenn sherriff th,d.a custodial parent decisions regarding visitation are entitled to presumptive validity and must be accorded special weight,but they are not immune from judicial review.fenn sherriff,supra,th at,d.
the decisions in troxel and its california progeny have no application to this case because they dealt with judicial interference in the child rearing decisions of a fit,custodial parent.here,the parents no longer had custody of the minor.a guardianship had been established and the guardians had provided the minor with custody and care for several years.
also inapplicable are the decisions,cited by the parents,that addressed orders freeing a child from parental custody and control.in re cheryl d.in re d.here,the trial court did not terminate all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the minor.those rights and responsibilities remained suspended by the decision not to end the guardianship in re cheryl,supra,d at.in re,supra,d at,but the court had continuing jurisdiction to reinstate them in the future.
nor are the parents helped by other decisions upon which they addressing initial orders that established guardianships or otherwise removed children from parental custody.in re cal d,guardianship of jenna th,d guardianship of stephen,supra,th at,d.as recognized by the court of appeal in guardianship of stephen,supra,th at page,d,a decision to terminate a guardianship rests in the broad discretion of the trial court and is not determined on the same basis as the creation of the guardianship or other living arrangement.
the parents have not cited,and we have not discovered,any supreme court decision,state or federal,that holds expressly or by necessary implication that natural parents have an automatic right to termination of a guardianship absent an express finding of their unfitness to care for the child,or that otherwise precludes the application of a best interest of the child standard to the termination of a guardianship.
for the following reasons,we decline to create such a constitutional standard that would overturn the legislature considered decision to provide that a guardianship may be terminated if a court determines that it is in the child best interest to do so.
parental rights do not spring from the biological connection between parent and child.they require relationships more enduring.citation.lehr robertson,d,hereafter lehr,italics omitted.t he rights of the parents are a counterpart of the responsibilities they have assumed.id.at.at,d at.
in other words,parental rights derive from a biological connection with the child and from acting in the role of parent.lehr,supra,at.at,d at.thus,the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection to that which exists when a parent has come forward to participate in the rearing of the child t he importance of the familial relationship,to the individuals involved and to the society,stems from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association,and from the role it plays in promot ing a way of life through the instruction of children as well as from the fact of blood relationship.citation.ibid.
for example,the supreme court in quilloin walcott,d hereafter quilloin rejected the constitutional claim of a natural father who opposed the adoption of his child by the child stepfather.according to the natural father,in the absence of a finding of his unfitness as a parent,he had a constitutional right to veto the adoption of his child.id.at.at,d at.the court disagreed we have little doubt that the due process clause would be offended i f a state were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family,over the objections of the parents and their children,without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children best interest.citation.but this is not a case in which the unwed father at any t
