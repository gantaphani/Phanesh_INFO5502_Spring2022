scott smith filed this appeal after commissioner richard vogl ordered him to pay per month child support,plus in arrears he maintains he was entitled to have the ruling reviewed de novo by a superior court judge and the commissioner made several mistakes.finding none of his contentions have merit,we affirm.
in,smith agreed to sign a stipulation stating bridget was his daughter he would pay per month in child support and payments would be made through the riverside county probation department.the stipulation did not indicate whether smith was represented by counsel.smith signed the stipulation,as did a deputy district attorney,a family support officer and the court.
for the next year,smith made all the scheduled payments.in,bridget mother told smith she was going to get married.they dispute what happened next.smith claims that bridget mother,denise theodoropolous denise told him she would contact the district attorney to stop enforcement of the child support order,if he stopped visiting her.he chose to stop all contact and child support.denise maintains she merely told smith it would cause problems in her new marriage if he continued to visit her,but he could see bridget.she denies ever telling smith that he did not have to visit bridget or that he did not need to pay child support.
thirteen years later,denise contacted the district attorney office and asked them to enforce the child support order.denise knew smith had recently become a lawyer and wanted him to pay attention to bridget and pay some money so she could go to college.
in september,smith received a bill in the mail from the district attorney office stating he owed for august and september.he claims he gave cash to cover those months plus october.smith maintains he next received a statement from the district attorney showing he owed for october and in arrearages.
the district attorney registered the child support and submitted a document showing how the arrears were calculated,which show no payments were made after january.it is undisputed denise has never received financial assistance from the county.
three months later,smith filed an order to show cause osc seeking modification of the child support order and arrearages.in his income and expense declaration,he asserted he was with a gross income of per month.he claimed he could not afford to pay any child support or arrearages.
after the court continued the hearing in january,smith filed a notice of motion re.citing family code section,subdivision a he noted he was entitled to an expedited process in the courts that is and accessible to families.he cited section,subdivision b,which provides that child support cases are to be heard by commissioners unless an objection is made by the local child support agency or any other party.he requested the presiding judge hear the matter.
the district attorney opposed the motion.the district attorney noted the law requires child support cases to be heard by a commissioner,even after an objection is made,subds.a c.the district attorney explained smith could make a second objection after the commissioner issued a recommended order,which entitled him to a hearing de novo before a superior court judge,subd.c.
in february,judge myron brown denied smith motion and ordered commissioner salvador sarmiento to hear the matter.the case was continued and trailed several times over the next several months.in june,the district attorney filed a responsive declaration,stating smith owed and had not provided the court with any facts or authority supporting his claim the arrears should be waived.
on july,smith osc was taken off calendar by the court.the following day,he filed a new osc,which was different from the one previously filed in several respects.for example,in his income and expense declaration,smith reduced his gross income from to per month.in addition,he made a new factual claim that he was not represented by counsel when he agreed to sign the child support stipulation.he also requested more visitation with his daughter.the new osc was assigned to commissioner richard vogl.the district attorney filed a responsive declaration,noting the arrears had increased to a total of.
at the hearing,after considering testimony from both parties,the court took the matter under submission.it issued a statement of decision,finding,inter alia,the child support order would remain unchanged and smith owed in arrears.the court noted that smith license to practice law may be revoked for noncompliance with his child support obligations.it stated that as long as smith pays per month on the arrears and remains current on the child support obligations,the court would permit him to retain his license.
smith filed a notice of objection regarding the statement of decision,pursuant to section,subdivision c.the district attorney filed a response,stating smith objection was untimely.the district attorney argued smith was required to file an objection to commissioner vogl prior to the hearing in order to later challenge any rulings.commissioner vogl agreed and rejected smith objections.
in october,smith filed a motion for reconsideration,which was continued to january.believing the continuance amounted to a denial of the motion by operation of law,smith filed his notice of appeal in november.in his opening brief,he claims the motion for reconsideration was denied in january because the trial court recognized this appellate court had sole jurisdiction over the case.
relying on section,subdivision c,smith maintains he timely objected to commissioner vogl findings and recommendations and therefore was entitled to have a hearing de novo before a superior court judge.he misunderstands the statute.
family support cases must be referred to a child support commissioner,subd.a.section,subdivision b provides in relevant part,the commissioner shall act as a temporary judge unless an objection is made by the local child support agency or any other party.italics added.subdivision c explains,if any party objects to the commissioner acting as a temporary judge,the commissioner may hear the matter and make findings of fact and a recommended order.within court days,a judge shall ratify the recommended order unless either party objects to the recommended order,or where a recommended order is in error.in both cases,the judge shall issue a temporary order and schedule a hearing de novo within court days.in other words,one must object to a commissioner twice before and after the commissioner rules in the case to have the matter reviewed by a superior court judge.
in january,smith filed an objection to having a commissioner act as the temporary judge in his case.at the time,the matter was assigned to commissioner salvador sarmiento.however,smith overlooks the fact his osc was taken off calendar in july.this resulted in a dismissal of the osc.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group to,to.a hearing on a dismissed matter can not be continued to a later date,and thus smith correctly filed a new osc.ibid.the matter was assigned to commissioner vogl.smith failed to object to having this commissioner hear the case.without an objection,the commissioner shall be regarded as a temporary judge,subd.b and consequently smith was not entitled to have a superior court judge review the matter de novo.
smith maintains he was not properly notified of his right to object as required by section,subdivision b,which provides,the judicial council shall develop a notice which shall be included on all forms and pleadings used to initiate a child support action or proceeding that advises the parties of their right to review by a superior court judge and how to exercise that right.the parties shall also be advised by the court prior to the commencement of the hearing that the matter is being heard by a commissioner who shall act as a temporary judge unless any party objects to the commissioner acting as a temporary judge.
it is true that there is no such notice on the standardized form smith used to initiate the proceedings,and the commissioner did not advise him of his rights before the hearing on the record.however,it can not be said this error was p
