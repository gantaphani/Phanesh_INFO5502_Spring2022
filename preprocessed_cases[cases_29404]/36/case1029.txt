facts and procedural history 
facts and procedural history from our prior opinions 
this is the third appeal in this case.in the first appeal,in re july,wl,a nonpublished opinion,we rejected mother challenge to juvenile court orders that denied her family reunification services and reduced the amount of her visits with the minors.in the second appeal,in re,wl,a nonpublished opinion,we rejected the parents contention that the juvenile court lacked sufficient evidence that the minors were likely to be adopted,but we ordered a limited reversal of the order terminating parental rights for compliance with icwa and reinstatement of the order if icwa compliance did not indicate native american heritage.
we set forth a summary of facts and procedural history taken from our prior opinions,with appropriate deletions and additions 
mother has seven children,all of whom have been dependents of the juvenile court at different times.
in,before and were born,mother physically abused and then brother.as a result,the department filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section for and older siblings.the juvenile court sustained the petition,declaring the older siblings to be dependents of the juvenile court.mother received reunification services for the older siblings,and they were returned to her care.however,mother remained physically abusive toward her children,and the court terminated mother reunification services with and older siblings in.of the five older siblings,the three who were still minors live d with their legal guardian.
the present proceeding,involving and,commenced in.in july,mother struck,causing a swollen,black,bruise around his left eye,ruptured blood vessels and a cut underneath the eye.although she knew was in pain,mother failed to seek medical attention for him.
father is the biological parent of and,but not mother older children.he lived separately and was not present during the incident.several months before and were detained,father was arrested for engaging in domestic violence with mother.he was required to attend anger management classes and ordered to stay away from mother.father told a neighbor he did not take to the doctor after the incident because mother was scared the social worker would take away from her.
the department filed a petition under section,subdivisions a,b and j for and 
at the detention hearing in july,the juvenile court found the department made a prima facie case for detaining and from their parents and that the children were persons described by section,subdivisions a,b and j.the department recommended that mother be denied reunification services.however,the court granted both father and mother preliminary reunification services pending adjudication and disposition.each parent was allowed monitored visits,but the court granted the department discretion to liberalize visits for father only.
at this hearing,mother told the juvenile court she had native american heritage through two tribes hopi nation and chumash.
in august,the court set the case for trial and,while and were detained in foster care prior to disposition,granted the parents limited monitored visitation each week at a location.the court permitted the parents to have additional visitation if they could find a monitor.
in september,at the department request,the court further ordered that mother visits be restricted to the department office.
at the adjudication and disposition hearing in november,the court sustained the department allegations under section,subdivisions a,b and j.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that mother reunification services for and older siblings had previously been terminated because mother had failed to reunify with the siblings,the siblings had been removed from mother and mother had not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of the siblings.the court further found that mother had failed to benefit from the reunification programs provided her and had not addressed her issues of domestic violence,anger management and physical abuse.
the department had reported that,within the month preceding disposition,mother had displayed inappropriate and volatile behavior during visitation mother violated explicit visitation rules by showing up at father visits and by following the children and their foster mother,on foot and by car,after her own visits.mother inappropriate conduct resulted in visits being cut short or cancelled.she made repeated harassing phone calls to the social workers and foster family.
the court ordered reunification services for father,including a domestic violence program,individual counseling for anger management and a parenting class that would include protection of the children from mother.the court also ordered monitored visits for father,which the court ordered were to be kept confidential from mother.
the court limited and imposed conditions on mother visitation.we rejected mother appeal from these orders in the first appeal.
the november orders included requirements that father attend weeks of counseling regarding domestic violence and parent education.he also had to obtain individual counseling to address anger of children with licensed therapist.
in february,the department obtained a restraining order against mother,to prevent her from tampering with the voicemail of the department workers,and verbally harassing its employees and other clients.
subsequently,t here continued to be problems at mother weekly visits to the children,but not at father weekly visits the social worker was concerned with the lack of proof that father had enrolled in parent education.she recommended termination of father family reunification services because he had not fully complied with the court orders,still lived with mother,and continued to have codependency issues.the department strongly felt that father family reunification services should be terminated,because he would not protect the children from mother.
in april,t he court ruled that father was in partial compliance with the case plan,as there was no proof that he had enrolled in parent education.the court thought it was unlikely that father would protect the children from mother,as he had not dealt with the codependency issue and still lived with her.therefore,it ordered termination of father family reunification services,and scheduled a hearing to consider termination of parental rights.
in september,mother was incarcerated for stabbing father with a knife.father lied to the social worker about mother whereabouts to protect mother.
in october,t he court reduced father visits from three hours to one hour until he passed five alcohol tests.father objected to any testing requirement,as he maintained that he had no problem with alcohol,but mother did.
according to the section report of late november,the boys were transferred early that month to the home of foster parents who were willing to adopt them both the boys and the new foster parents were affectionate with each other,and the home study had been completed and approved.said he was happy and wanted to live in that home for a long time.father was having visits,as he had not complied with the testing order.the department recommended termination of parental rights and a permanent plan of adoption.
the contested section hearing occurred on january,
father testified that he had visited the children every week,loved them,and thought they were bonded to him.he had complied with the court orders,to the best of his ability.he worked hours a day.he had done some bad things earlier in his life,but he had changed.he did not have any problem with alcohol or drugs.
mother testified that she and father had been good parents,the children loved her,and her behavior had never been inappropriate.she was currently living in a residential program with intensive therapy.
following argument by counsel,the court severed mother and father parental rights.fns.omitted.
prior limited reversal and remand of termination order 
both mother and father appealed the termination of parental rights.this court affirmed the juvenile court orders,but found proper notice had not been given under icwa.in re,supra.during the proceedings,mother had identified her family heritage as apache.i think yaki sic.they come from new mexico.our opinion applauded the dependency court effort to comply with icwa,as mother had named a succession of possible native american tribes at different hearings.we noted,however,that some of the information on the icwa notices was inconsistent and no notice had been sent to the yaqui tribe of new mexico,even though the juvenile court had ordered it.
the department conceded that reversal of the order terminating parental rights was necessary for compliance with icwa.therefore,quoting in re francisco th,d,we concluded this case was appropriate for a limited reversal in which we order the judgment to be reinstated if no indian tribe intervenes after proper notice is given.
we specifically directed,upon remand,that n otices for and shall be sent to the yaqui tribe,that n otice for shall be sent to the nine apache tribes,and that such notice shall use the names and birthdates that appear on each boy birth certificate.
we expressly stated,we do not address issues regarding notice to any tribes other than the apache and yaqui,as those were the ones that mother eventually identified.italics added.we further rejected father contention that upon remand he should be permitted to file a section petition to address a change of circumstances or new evidence.again quoting in re francisco,supra,th at,d,we declared that t he limited reversal disposition in defective notice icwa appeals is in keeping with the public policy of our child dependency scheme,which favors prompt resolution of cases.
in our disposition,we reversed the order terminating parental rights and remanded the matter to the juvenile court with directions to order compliance by the department with the notice provisions of icwa.we further directed that if,after proper notice,the children are determined to be indian children,the juvenile court shall proceed in conformity with all provisions of icwa.on the other hand,if the children are not determined to be indian children,the judgment terminating parental rights shall be reinstated.
our reversal of the order terminating parental rights,therefore,was subject solely to the department giving proper notice under icwa to the yaqui and apache tribes.
facts and procedural history related to present appeal 
in april,following the filing of the second appeal,the department had reported that the children had adjusted well to their new foster home,and an adoptive placement had been completed.the adoptive parents felt very strongly that they wished to adopt both minors.father continued to visit the boys weekly,but his visits were causing anxiety for the adoptive parents and confusion for the children.consequently,the juvenile court terminated father visitation.
as of november,the children were continuing to do well in their adoptive placement.on november,prior to the issuance of the remittitur in the second appeal,the juvenile court held a review hearing and ordered the department to give icwa notice to the yaqui,hopi and all apache tribes with the correct name and birth dates for the children and parents.
in december,the department sent a group of notices to the hopi,apache,yaqui and chumash tribes.the department provided proof of service upon these tribes by certified mail and return receipts to the court.the department also sent notices in december and january to the bureau of indian affairs and the united states department of the interior and filed receipts for such notices with the court.
following receipt of the remittitur from this court,the juvenile court held a status hearing on january.during the hearing,mother provided additional information claiming affiliation with pueblo and navajo tribes.the juvenile court told mother,you had three years to do this.i been asking you this question for three years.now,we noticed the chumash,the hopi,and the apache sic.you have never once mentioned any other tribe until today.the court expressed skepticism of mother newly asserted relationship to other tribes.mother claimed to have newly recovered memories from when she was a child.she stated she had indian on four sides of her family and a person at her treatment center from the tribal counsel was helping her take care of this matter.
the court placed mother under oath regarding her native american heritage.mother provided additional names of relatives and other information about the relatives.
mother counsel intervened at this point.he requested a short continuance for mother to gather information so the court could consider whether or not it has the proper amount of information to go forward.the court stated,the only problem is that the court of appeal only addressed hopi sic and apache.the only issue with hopi sic and apache is the notice with the birth dates of the children there are no other issues.a fter the appellate court has affirmed this decision to terminate parental rights,mother ca suddenly come up with other tribes the court expressed its belief mother provision of additional information was just a delay ing tactic,but stated it could not take the chance this court would reverse again on appeal.the case was continued for further icwa notice to the pueblo and navajo tribes.
for the next hearing on february,the department reported it had sent further icwa notices on january.many responses had been received,some based on the previous mailing.at the hearing,mother pointed out a slight discrepancy in spelling for one of the surnames leivas was misspelled as leyvas and claimed there was a lot of misinformation on the form.mother continued to provide more information about family members and tribes.she now said the mission indians were part of her heritage.the court suggested mother counsel have her fill out another form,but also reminded that the only issues this court addressed were apache and yaqui.n o other tribes were raised in appeal.
the court called the matter again after taking a recess.mother stated under oath that the form now contained all of the information she had at the time.mother wanted a brief continuance to contact one more cousin and was ordered back the following monday with the completed form so that she could attest to the form accuracy and completeness under oath.the court again referred to this court remittitur,indicating this court had directed corrected notices only as to the yaqui and apache tribes.the court stated it was allowing notices to other tribes solely as a courtesy.
the court established father had no icwa issues,as he had been born in iran.
mother failed to show up at the next hearing,and the matter was continued.
on march,mother appeared and claimed she needed more time to obtain additional birth dates to complete the form.the court continued the matter to march.on march,mother failed to appear,having left the courthouse before the case was called.the court issued a warrant for mother arrest.
mother appeared before the dependency court on march,and stated under oath that she now had given the court a complete form to the best of her knowledge.the court ordered the department to send out new icwa notices and set the matter for a progress hearing on may,days hence,regarding icwa.
for the may,hearing,the department reported a third round of icwa notices had been sent to more than different tribes,as well as the secretary of the interior and sacramento office of the bureau of indian affairs.the social worker provided verification that all notices had been received,except there had been no confirmation of receipt as to four tribes the san ildefonso pueblo,cabazon band of mission indians,hopi tribal council and hopi tribe of arizona.the social worker requested a continuance to allow her to these four tribes.
mother,father and the de facto parents were present at the hearing on may.the juvenile court acknowledged all notices had been sent at least days before the hearing and receipt had been confirmed except for return receipts from the four tribes.the court ruled the law only required days notice from date of receipt and did not require icwa receipts.it found all notices were received more than days before the hearing.the court observed again that this court prior decision had ordered only that the yaqui and apache tribes be properly noticed,and it found such had been done.
the court therefore found icwa notice was proper as to the apache and yaqui tribes and there was no reason to believe that icwa applied.accordingly,the court reinstated the order terminating parental rights in the minors 
both parents again timely appealed.
standard of review 
when a judgment is reversed with directions,the appellate court order is contained in its remittitur,which revests the jurisdiction of the subject matter in the lower court.in re francisco,supra,th at,d.importantly,when an appellate court reversal is issued with directions requiring specific proceedings on remand,those directions are binding on the trial court and must be followed.in re justin th,d.this is because the parties already have litigated all other issues at the selection and implementation hearing,and it is not necessary to have a complete retrial.this is particularly so when there has been a limited reversal and remand with directions to remediate a defective icwa notice.in this way,the child is afforded the protection of the juvenile court and,at the same time,his or her case is processed to cure the icwa error,which is more expeditious than a full rehearing in re francisco,at,d in re justin,at,d.the trial court must follow the directions of the appellate court and can not modify or add any conditions to the judgment as directed.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.any action that does not conform to those directions is void.in re francisco,at,d.
we review the juvenile court findings of fact under the substantial evidence test,which requires us to determine whether there is reasonable,credible evidence of solid value to support the court order.melinda superior court th,d.
discussion 
the juvenile court properly found icwa does not apply 
mother contends the parental termination order must be reversed because the juvenile court did not wait for a determinative response from all of the additionally noticed tribes and return receipts.she argues that newly adopted section et prescribes a strict sixty day waiting period for a tribe to respond before making any icwa applicability finding.father also makes this contention,arguing the juvenile court is prohibited from making a determination that icwa is inapplicable until sixty days has sic passed following the service of proper and adequate notice on the tribes entitled to it without a determinative response from each of those tribes.father,joined by mother,additionally contends that reversal is called for because notices to a number of tribes were misaddressed and there is no evidence the notices were delivered to the proper recipient.we disagree.
appropriate notice to the yaqui and apache tribes were given 
the juvenile court found that appropriate notice was given under icwa to the yaqui and apache tribes as ordered by this court.substantial evidence supports this finding.indeed,in her opening brief,mother admits that t he record shows that on december,the department sent notice to the yaqui tribe citation,and that it received a letter response on december,stating that the children were not members of,or eligible for membership in,the tribe.citation.additionally,the letter indicates the correct birthdates and name spelling of the children.citation.the record also shows full notice compliance with each of the eight apache tribes.the federal register identifies eight recognized apache tribes to receive services from the united states bureau of indian affairs.federal register,december,et the department sent out notices to the eight apache tribes and bia on december and,with proof of certified receipts by the indian representative citation,and also the correct birthdates and names of the children on the forms.citation.it received letter responses back from seven of the eight tribes.citation.as to the jicarillo apache tribe,no response was ever received back from the tribe.citation.however,the sixty day waiting period was complied with.mother therefore admits there was compliance with icwa notice for the yaqui and apache tribes under our limited remand.although father is silent on this issue,he apparently does not disagree.
the juvenile court therefore complied with our remand order,and it properly reinstated the order terminating parental rights.
b.the juvenile court did not err in setting the special hearing on remand 
mother and father argue that even if notice is deemed to have been properly given,the juvenile court termination order must be reversed because section purportedly adopts a strict waiting period for a tribe to respond before the court may make a finding on icwa applicability.father argues the court determined icwa was not applicable only days after the department sent notice to the four tribes in question,on april.
section,subdivision d provides that,except for the detention hearing,n o proceeding shall be held until at least days after receipt of notice by the parent,the tribe,or the bureau of indian affairs.see also a no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent and the tribe or the secretary.section,subdivision e states that i f proper and adequate notice has been provided pursuant to section,and neither a tribe nor the bureau of indian affairs has provided a determinative response within days after receiving that notice,the court may determine that icwa does not apply to the proceedings,provided that the court shall reverse its determination of the inapplicability of the icwa and apply the act prospectively if a tribe or the bureau of indian affairs subsequently confirms that the child is an indian child.the statutory provisions therefore prevent the juvenile court from setting a hearing to terminate parental rights any earlier than days after notice is received.they allow a tribe or the bureau days after receipt of notice to confirm that a child is an indian child.
father contends that failure to wait for a period is a ground for reversal of an order terminating parental rights because it deprives the tribes of a full and fair opportunity to respond.he cites california rules of court former rule f,effective january,former rule f,effective,which provided that i f,after a reasonable time following the sending of notice under this in no event less than determinative response to the notice is received,the court may determine that icwa does not apply to the case unless further evidence of the applicability of icwa is later received.italics added.father argues under this provision the failure to wait days requires reversal of the termination order.see in re justin,supra,th at,fn,d.this provision,however,was deleted when the rules were amended,effective february.the rule amendment left standing rule h,which states that i f it is determined that icwa applies,the juvenile court hearing must not proceed until at least days after those entitled to notice under icwa have received notice.this rule makes clear that the juvenile court is constrained only by the time limitation after notice before terminating parental rights.
at first blush,the waiting period under section,subdivision e might appear at odds with the period prescribed in section,subdivision d,and in the abstract might compel a limited reversal of a termination order entered before expiration of the period.however,we need not resolve that conflict since the termination order in this case may be affirmed on several grounds.
first,and foremost,it is undisputed the court acted well after the notice period had already expired as to the yaqui and apache tribes.
second,as the department argues,the record establishes that mother was not cer
