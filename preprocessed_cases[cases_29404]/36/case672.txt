appeals from a judgment on reserved issues granting joint physical custody of his son joey to and,joey mother,and allowing her to take joey with her to live in israel during the school year.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm.
background 
we use the parties first names to simplify and humanize our opinion in this intensely contested custody case.in re marriage of smith d,fn.
jonathan and,an israeli citizen,met in and soon were living together.they never married.when gave birth to joey in september,jonathan signed a voluntary declaration of paternity and the birth certificate.the couple separated in late,when joey was two,and jonathan moved into another house in the summer of,while and joey were in israel visiting family.in july jonathan married michelle,and lives with her and her son,his stepson ryan.before michelle,jonathan had been married to three other women,and jonathan has three adult children from two of those earlier marriages.
in july,when joey was nearly four,jonathan filed a petition to establish his paternity of joey,requesting joint legal and physical custody and reasonable visitation.in october,he filed an order to show cause requesting sole legal custody and shared physical custody with primary custody to him,after and joey returned from a summer trip to israel three weeks after the date of september.in response,requested sole legal and physical custody of joey,with the right to move to israel with joey,and reasonable visitation for jonathan in the united states and israel.she represented that her visa to remain in the united states was set to expire in november.
after hearing in march,the trial court granted the paternity petition as to status only,reserving all other issues.the parties agree that a june interim order divided physical custody equally.appellant appendix jonathan contains an unsigned and explicitly temporary custody order proposed by g.in june,the parties stipulated to the appointment of a privately compensated temporary judge for all purposes.
on march,after days of trial,the trial court issued a page amended statement of decision on the bifurcated issues,making factual findings,awarding jonathan and joint legal and physical custody of joey,and allowing to relocate to israel with joey during the school year.joey was to live with jonathan during most of the summer and longer school holidays,as well as during visits in israel.
the court acknowledged that jonathan and shared custody equally,both were competent parents,and joey was well bonded to both.two parents living in the same location would be ideal for joey,but as had indicated her intent to relocate,the standard was joey best interest under those circumstances.s o long as the court does not find that the party intending to move is moving in bad faith,instead of assessing what would be the very best circumstances for the child,the court must determine how the child interest will best be served by that living arrangement which causes him the least detriment after one parent moves away.based on the evidence,including an expert child custody evaluation by anthony aloia and the testimony at trial,both jonathan and were fully adequate to care for joey organizational,educational,social,emotional,physical and moral needs,so the tipping factor becomes comparing the level of detriment the child will suffer under each scenario.
gal had returned late from israel with joey after the summer of because father was diagnosed with cancer,and she wished to stay with her family until tests were completed.while the court found this entirely reasonable,it noted that could also have accommodated jonathan offer to fly to israel and bring joey back.showed a sense of ownership of the child on her part and her determination to do things the way she chose rather than acting more cooperatively.nevertheless,this did not damage joey.further,there was no showing that would not comply with future orders,as she did return with joey after her family obligations were met and allowed jonathan immediate time with joey,and had always returned with the child each time they had traveled to israel.
the court also found that as soon as the parties separated in late,expressed her desire to return to israel and her family to raise joey.still,jonathan paid for a lawyer to help get a green card and permanent resident status in the united states.when the support she received from jonathan fell below what she considered adequate,she decided to return to israel and stopped her efforts.current immigration status requires her to leave the united states when the custody case is concluded.
the court found that was not negligent in abandoning her immigration claim,because the claim itself was probably based on false contentions.admitted that she had falsely stated that she attended tel aviv university and had been a captain in the israeli army although she did serve.as her qualifying work was with one of jonathan companies,he would be in a position to disclose the misrepresentations,and would use that power to control her.simply did not wish to remain in the united states as a permanent resident,and had good faith reasons to relocate to a country where she could obtain employment independent of jonathan,be near her family for emotional and financial support,and find a better environment to raise joey.
the court found a variety of events including the false statements on the visa application showed situational ethics and that she will deviate from truth if it is in her interest.had taken prizes that she had not won at a charity picnic,and encouraged joey to say he was six to get on a ride at legoland when he was a few months shy of that age.none of these events,however,was directly related to her parenting.joey,who had been primarily raised by,had been troubled by lying about his age,which showed that he had internalized a positive value system.
an earlier order had required and jonathan to use a website to communicate about joey.while used the website less than jonathan and often did not respond to his frequent and detailed emails,the court found generally credible that the email system was simply too difficult for her in the way it was established,given her dyslexia and adhd established by an expert declaration.although smoked,there was no evidence that she did so in the presence of the child.the parties tendency to engage in mutual verbal combat was not inflicted on or shared with joey.and michelle mutual animosity showed no alienation of joey or attempts to interfere with each other relationship with him.
jonathan also intended to move away from his house in beverly hills to santa barbara,la jolla,or carmel,which diminished his ability to provide stability in physical surroundings.whichever parent joey lived with,joey would experience a new home,school,and friends.a move to israel would reduce his time with his stepbrother ryan,and the court weighed that detriment against the greater detriment if he were not permitted to relocate to israel with his mother.
the court found no evidence that had mental health or disability issues causing harm to joey.as to the parties considerable attempts to raise issues regarding each other character,aloia had testified that joey was an exceptional child,and as joey had spent more time with,whatever character defects she might have did not produce a negative effect.aloia had testified that she was a good competent and acceptable parent.while alleged misbehavior by jonathan in his interactions with her,no evidence showed that he behaved inappropriately with joey,and jonathan was equally acceptable as a parent.
neither parent would fail to cooperate with court orders.jonathan would without hesitation foster and joey relationship.although had shown some controlling behavior,she also had tried to encourage jonathan participation in joey life and to share information with jonathan,and would do so in the future.has a tendency to lie or shave the truth in circumstances that she perceives to be to her benefit but that are not generally harmful to others.she was the more controlling in her relationship with jonathan,and had a sense of dominion over joey,but the evidence did not show that she tried to alienate joey from jonathan,instead consistently showing that she wished to involve jonathan in joey life.the court does not believe that gal will use her larger timeshare to keep important information from jonathan or attempt to exclude him from the child life or attempt to alienate the child from him.
joey would suffer detriment from the move without question,so the court must seek the custody schedule that gives him the least detriment.significant evidence showed that his connection to was stronger.aloia had testified that joey emotional connection to would tip the balance in favor if he had to choose,and the court had gleaned from undisputed testimony the strength of joey relationship with,supported by history of providing joey primary care.
joey had already lived in israel for longer periods of time with,was fluent in hebrew and accustomed to the israeli lifestyle,and the presence there of significant family members was an additional positive factor.jonathan would not be losing custody.although his would decrease,it would still be as much as to percent including visits to israel,which jonathan could afford.
this was obviously a close and difficult case and the basis of the court s decision is a somewhat slender reed on which to base such a momentous change.however,change must occur in the life of the child and his parents and whether the scale is tipped heavily or only lightly,the court must rule in the direction where it tips.
the court reviewed and summarized its findings under in re marriage of lamusga cal th lamusga and in re marriage of condon th condon,and provided details of the order for joint legal and physical custody.
the court entered judgment on may.jonathan filed a motion to set aside and modify the custody order,alleging that he had just discovered that had been driving sometimes with joey in the car on a california driver license that had been suspended on november,following a drunk driving arrest and vehicle impound in october.responded that she had been pulled over in october but there had been no arrest and no charges filed.had a valid international license,and she had learned for the first time when she received jonathan motion that her california license had been suspended.she immediately went to the department of motor vehicles,which confirmed that there was no case against her and her alcohol level had been well within legal limits,lifted the suspension,and issued her an interim california license.
at a hearing in august,testified that in october she had been pulled over and taken to a highway patrol station,where she had been tested and told that her blood alcohol level was very low.she showed the officer a temporary california license,which was returned to her.she had not been given a ticket,or told that her california license would be suspended.the court stated that it believed had a valid temporary california license at the time she was stopped,that had not been arrested based on the dmv setting aside of the suspension,that description of what occurred when she was stopped was correct,and that although she had been driving on a suspended license once her california license was suspended,all other licenses were suspended as well,she could reasonably have believed that she had a valid license to drive as she also believed her florida and international licenses were valid.joey care had not suffered.the court also declined to set aside its judgment based on failure to advise jonathan about joey ongoing swimming lessons that summer.
in an order filed november,the trial court denied the motion to set aside and to modify.jonathan filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
the trial court noted that each party disputed multiple issues and incidents reflecting poorly on the character and parenting ability of the other,most of which were not central to its findings.similarly,such incidents which jonathan continues to discuss do not control our decision.
i.the trial court was not required to make findings under family code section.
jonathan argues that the court failed to make necessary findings regarding whether measures were necessary to prevent from abducting joey.section,subdivision b,requires eight such findings in a custody order when the court becomes aware of facts which may indicate there is a risk of abduction of a child.jonathan points out that the temporary custody order by a different judge states that because of gal immigration status,the court has a responsibility to make a order,but the temporary order also makes no finding that there is a risk that gal would violate the court orders.the judge who presided over trial concluded in the statement of decision that there was no showing that was unlikely to comply with future custody orders or was likely to refuse to return joey to the united states during jonathan appointed custody times.had traveled to israel a number of times with joey and had always returned,and in,when her father was diagnosed with cancer,she returned with no compulsion when her family obligations were satisfied.nevertheless,the court did require to register the judgment with the israeli court system and to stipulate to continuing jurisdiction of the california court,and ordered that who did not have the financial resources to post a bond would forfeit all child support if she failed to comply with any court order,as provided under section,subdivisions b b and b h.
no findings under section,subdivision b were required given the trial court finding that there was no risk that would abduct joey.
ii.the trial court imposed adequate protective measures.
jonathan argues that the court imposed grossly inadequate protections for international relocation in violation of condon,supra,th.condon established that a child best interest in an international relocation case requires guaranteed enforceability of the california custody order in the foreign country there,australia.id.at.the court of appeal concluded that the trial court erred in failing to guarantee enforceability,and on remand the judgment must require a concession to california continuing jurisdiction,and must create sanctions to enforce that concession at a minimum,such sanctions should include the posting of an adequate monetary bond within the relocating parent means and the potential forfeiture of all or some support payments upon proof the parent is disregarding essential terms of the court order or has violated the concession of jurisdiction by pursuing modification of the california order in the foreign country courts.id.at.
here,the order included a requirement that before leaving california for israel,must file a stipulation consenting to california continuing jurisdiction and further stipulate that she would not file any action seeking modification in any but a california court she also must file the stipulation in the israeli courts.was further required to register the judgment with the israeli court system and submit and file proof of such registration.the court found that did not have adequate resources to establish a bond.therefore,the court ordered that days after jonathan filed a declaration contending that violated any custody order,all child support would be deposited into a trust account established and owned by jonathan with as a beneficiary,to be used to pay for the costs of any litigation anything left over would be paid to 
jonathan argues that the absence of a bond is fatal.he does not dispute the court finding that did not have the resources to post a bond,however,and condon refers to a bond within the relocating parent means.condon,supra,th at.condon also contemplates another possibility,whether or not the parent has the funds to post a substantial bond,in the form of terminating or reducing child support payments if the custodial parent attempts to frustrate the custody order and the foreign court refuses to enforce it.id.at.under the circumstances in condon where the mother had once moved the children to france and had defied a court order by removing the children to australia without allowing any access to the father,the court of appeal commented that registration of the california c
