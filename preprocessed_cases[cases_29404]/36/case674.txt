factual and procedural background 
in light of the limited nature of mother appeal,we only briefly summarize the underlying facts of the dependency proceedings.in december,the juvenile court asserted dependency jurisdiction over then under section,subdivision b.mother was years old at the time she was also a dependent of the court.the court found mother left with his maternal grandmother without making appropriate plans for his care,and mother whereabouts were unknown.in october,the juvenile court sustained a supplemental petition alleging mother failed to consistently reside in maternal grandmother home,in violation of juvenile court orders.the court further sustained allegations that mother frequently left maternal grandmother house with and their whereabouts were unknown,and that mother failed to permit the case social worker to have sufficient access to 
from april to june,and again from august through september,was placed with his paternal grandmother during this period mother partially complied with a reunification plan,but at times lost contact with los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs and was intermittent in visiting.in september,the juvenile court ordered placed with mother,under the supervision of dcfs on august,the juvenile court terminated dependency jurisdiction.
visitation with paternal grandmother 
as of september,paternal grandmother was to have unmonitored overnight visits with however,in april,dcfs reported mother had not made available for the visits.mother said she did not want to visit paternal grandmother and would fight the court visitation order.at a review hearing in june,mother denied that she was refusing paternal grandmother visits,but indicated she wished to be present during the visits.mother explained that she did not have a good relationship with paternal grandmother,and she expressed concern that paternal grandmother would make false allegations about her and interfere with her relationship with dcfs reported paternal grandmother had not made any false allegations about mother.dcfs also noted paternal grandmother had raised for much of his life and had done a great job.the court ordered mother to make available for unmonitored visits with paternal grandmother it denied as untimely mother request for a stay of the order.
in july,mother filed a section petition asking the court to modify the order allowing paternal grandmother unmonitored visits.mother argued that when the court ordered visits for paternal grandmother in september,had just been returned to mother custody after living with paternal grandmother for two years.mother argued that while visits at that time might have been important to help with the transition,the transition was now complete.mother contended this visitation schedule is a burden on mother and is interfering with mother right to exercise her parental authority.furthermore,since the relationship between paternal grandmother and mother is strained as a result of paternal grandmother not being in agreement with mother having custody of,forcing visitation against mother wishes is a direct infringement on mother fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody and control of her son,and as such violates the constitution see troxel granville.mother further argued she was concerned paternal grandmother would have a negative influence on emotional and behavioral well being,due to the negative relationship between paternal grandmother and mother given that mother objects to the visitation pursuant to family code e,there is a rebuttable presumption that the visitation of with his paternal grandmother is not in his best interest.mother requested that the court limit paternal grandmother visits to once per month for three hours,in a public setting,with mother present.the juvenile court ordered a hearing on the petition.
in a july,report,dcfs indicated paternal grandmother had only had one visit with since.the visit reportedly went well said he wanted to stay with paternal grandmother instead of returning home to mother.the social worker arranged a schedule for visits to take place every monday from to however,dcfs reported mother had not complied with the visitation schedule.dcfs also stated there was no indication that paternal grandmother had a negative influence on emotional or behavioral such that restricting visitation to three hours each month would be warranted.
in august,dcfs recommended that the court terminate dependency jurisdiction.the department also recommended that the court refer the matter to the family law court for further discussion of a visitation schedule with father and paternal grandmother.at an august,hearing,the court indicated it would terminate jurisdiction and grant mother full legal and physical custody of,with monitored visitation for father.mother argued the court should not order visitation with paternal grandmother.as she had contended in the section petition,mother asserted her relationship with paternal grandmother had deteriorated and she did not agree that paternal grandmother should have unmonitored visits.counsel contended there was no evidence paternal grandmother had done anything to jeopardize mother custody of,or that paternal grandmother had said anything negative to about mother.counsel asked that the court order visitation with paternal grandmother.counsel for dcfs argued it would disrupt stability to deprive him of contact with paternal grandmother,with whom he had a very strong bond.the court ordered unmonitored visits with paternal grandmother,every other monday from to.the court formally denied mother section petition on the ground that the request was not in best interest.the court explained 
there is a presumption that a custodial parent objections to a grandparent visitation is in the best interest of a child,and the court must accord that position of the custodial parent with great weight.however,that parent decision regarding visitation is not immune from judicial review,and i the judge and i reviewed what we have here.is young,and he has spent a substantial part of his life in the care of his paternal grandmother.he has a positive relationship with her.he is bonded to her.she is a link to the paternal family.in fact,she is the one who was assisting to have a relationship with his father while the father was in custody.it clearly is in his best interest to preserve this relationship there has been any evidence that paternal grandmother has attempted to interrupt or interfere with my orders that should be in his mother custody with family maintenance services it is not in best interest to disrupt his very strong bond with paternal grandmother.
mother timely appealed.
discussion 
i.the juvenile court did not violate mother fundamental parenting rights by issuing an order granting paternal grandmother visitation with 
mother contends the juvenile court a lacked authority to order grandparent visitation b paternal grandmother could only secure a right to visit by filing a petition in the family court and c the juvenile court order unlawfully infringed on her fundamental parenting rights.we disagree.
a.the juvenile court was authorized by statute to issue a visitation order 
under section,w hen the juvenile court terminates its jurisdiction over a minor who has been adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court prior to the minor attainment of the age of years,and an order has been entered with regard to the custody of that minor,the juvenile court on its own motion,may issue an order determining the custody of,or visitation with,the child.
at least two courts have construed section as authorizing a juvenile court to enter an order upon termination of jurisdiction that provides for visitation between the child and a nonparent.in re hirenia th hirenia,concerned requests for visitation by the appellant,the former partner of the dependent child adoptive mother.by the time of the appeal,the adoption was finalized and the juvenile court had terminated dependency jurisdiction.the court found the appeal was not moot because,under section,a juvenile court order of visitation with a nonparent may be entered or continued after the dependent child is adopted by another person.although the adoptive mother objected to an order granting her former partner visitation,the court noted the child had formed a close,bonded relationship with appellant even if there were some conflict between the parties,it would nevertheless be permissible to enter a visitation award in favor of appellant if she is able to establish a substantial parental relationship with the child,continuation of which would be in the child best interests.hirenia,at.
similarly,in in re robin th,cited in hirenia,the appellate court found section authorized the juvenile court to award visitation to a de facto parent unrelated to the child for visitation occurring after the termination of dependency jurisdiction.the court noted that even if both parents object to visitation with a third person,the court may order it as strong as the rights of such parents must be,there may be instances in which a child would be significantly harmed by completely terminating his or her relationship with a person who has lived with the child for a substantial portion of the child life been regularly involved in providing care,nurturance and guidance for the child appropriate to the child stage of development and,been permitted by a biologic parent to assume a parental role.the needs of the child,which are the most important consideration,may sometimes require that a visitation award be made to such a de facto parent.citation.in re robin,supra,at,italics omitted.
we agree with these interpretations of section.under section,the juvenile court had the authority to issue an order for visitation between and paternal grandmother.mother suggests the juvenile court was required to refer the matter to the family law court instead of issuing a visitation order.however,mother offers no support for this contention,which directly contradicts the express authority the court has under section to make visitation orders when the court terminates dependency jurisdiction over a minor.by empowering the juvenile court to issue custody and restraining orders,the legislature has expressed its belief that the juvenile court is the appropriate place for these matters to be determined and that the juvenile court orders must be honored in later superior court proceedings.citation.in re roger th.
further,the juvenile court was not required to apply family code section.in cases,grandparents may petition for visitation under family code section,which provides,in relevant part a on petition to the court by a grandparent of a minor child,the court may grant reasonable visitation rights to the grandparent if the court does both of the following finds that there is a preexisting relationship between the grandparent and the grandchild that has engendered a bond such that visitation is in the best interest of the child.balances the interest of the child in having visitation with the grandparent against the right of the parents to exercise their parental authority f there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that the visitation of a grandparent is not in the best interest of a minor child if the parent who has been awarded sole legal and physical custody of the child in another proceeding,or the parent with whom the child resides if there is currently no operative custody order objects to visitation by the grandparent.
however,due to the separate and distinct purposes of the juvenile and family courts,many family code provisions do not apply in dependency proceedings.in re josiah cal th,dependency proceedings are governed by their own rules and statutes unless otherwise specified,civil code and code of civil procedure requirements do not apply.thus,for example,in in re jennifer th,the court concluded civil code section now family code section,which established a presumption that joint legal custody between parents is in the best interest of a minor child when the parents have agreed to joint custody,did not apply to a juvenile court issuing custody orders upon termination of dependency jurisdiction.id.at.similarly,in in re chantal cal th,chantal,the california supreme court considered whether a juvenile court issuing a visitation order upon termination of dependency jurisdiction is required to apply family code section,which permits a family court to require parents involved in a custody or visitation dispute to participate in counseling for not more than one year.the court,adopting much of the reasoning of jennifer,concluded family code section did not apply in a juvenile court proceeding.chantal,at.
this case is no different.while grandparents rights to visitation are governed by family code provisions in a family law matter,nothing in family code section indicates it similarly governs visitation in a dependency context.see in re alexandria th,statutes not part of the welfare and institutions code do not apply to juvenile court proceedings unless they are expressly applicable juvenile court had no authority to make orders concerning child support.mother argument that a juvenile court may only award a grandparent visitation after applying family code section,is undermined by section,subdivision i,which requires the juvenile court to consider grandparent visitation when a child is removed from his or her parents,and by section,which allows the court,on its own motion,to make visitation orders when terminating jurisdiction over a minor,without any mention of presumptions contained in the family code that apply to a family court custody or visitation determinations.
moreover,it is inconsistent with the dependency system purpose of protecting children who have been abused,abandoned,or neglected,and requires consideration of the totality of a child circumstances,to require that the juvenile court apply statutory procedures or presumptions regarding grandparent visitation that are intended for use in the family court,which is designed to provide presumptively fit parents a forum in which to resolve,inter alia,private disputes about custody of and visitation with children.chantal,at,see in re claudia th,a statute outside of the welfare and institutions code is not necessarily barred from dependency proceedings,but courts should determine whether the statute is consistent with the overall purposes of the dependency system.section was the proper source of authority for the juvenile court order for visitation following the termination of dependency jurisdiction.chantal,at.
b.the visitation order did not infringe on mother fundamental right to parent 
mother also asserts the visitation order,issued over her objection,infringed on her right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of her child.in support of her argument she relies on troxel granville troxel.in troxel,the united states supreme court considered the constitutionality of a washington state statute that permitted any person to petition a superior court for visitation at any time,and authorized the court to grant visitation rights whenever doing so may serve the best interest of the child.troxel,at.a plurality of the court found a visitation order issued under this breathtakingly broad statute and allowing grandparent visitation over the objection of the children sole parent,was an unconstitutional infringement of the parent fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of her children.id.at.
the plurality opinion noted that in the case before it,the trial court order was not founded on any special factors justifying state interference with the mother fundamental right to
