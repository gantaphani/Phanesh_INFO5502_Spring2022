early in the parties marriage,patricia duffy managed the parties checkbook.she failed to record checks or to add and subtract correctly,however.in her words,her management of the checkbook was a disaster.she had never managed a checking account before and had no experience with managing finances.vincent duffy consequently took complete charge of the family finances.
at some point in their marriage,vincent and patricia duffy purchased a residence on of an acre in woodland hills.they discussed the purchase before making it but patricia did not ask the purchase price of the residence.she read and signed the purchase papers,however.
during the parties marriage,vincent duffy made a series of investments.in,he and patricia duffy purchased unimproved real estate in leona valley for.they discussed the investment beforehand.although patricia did not ask and vincent did not tell her the purchase price,she signed the purchase papers.the property appreciated nicely in value over the years,selling in november for.
sometime before,vincent duffy invested in an auto body shop he was to own jointly with its operator.patricia duffy learned about this investment after the fact.she did not know how much vincent had invested in the shop.she did not ask.she explained that usually when i asked him questions about money,i was given a very dismissive wave of the hand type answer.she had asked vincent questions about money before he made the auto body shop investment but usually did not receive answers,or received very curt ones.over the years,vincent duffy invested additional sums in the shop.he did not discuss these additional investments with patricia.she did receive additional information about this investment upon request,however.she knew the auto body shop was not making money,knew enough money had to be produced each month to pay the rent,and eventually learned that the investment was tied up for a lease term on the auto body shop.at one point she objected to the investment,believing the other investor was taking too much money from the business.the investment was a total loss.
at some point,the parties and a partner,larry brown,invested in a house in bullhead city,arizona.patricia duffy knew about the investment beforehand.she knew the purchase price.when the partners sold the house several years later,she was aware of the sale price.upon inquiry,she learned there were problems with the sale of the bullhead city property.she knew the partners had not been paid and were litigating the matter in court.
at one point,vincent duffy loaned to the son of a childhood friend to start a nightclub in atlanta.the loan is secured by the real property upon which the nightclub stands.when patricia duffy asked,vincent duffy told her about this investment in general terms.he did not provide details.patricia did not ask how much vincent was investing in this venture.
patricia and vincent duffy discussed ahead of time their purchase of a timeshare in cabo san lucas,mexico.they specifically discussed the purchase price.
as part of vincent duffy severance package from mca records in,he received from a plan and shares of mca stock from two separate stock plans.he initially rolled over the proceeds into the individual retirement account ira at investment savings loan association.patricia duffy accompanied him when he did this.
vincent duffy later opened a brokerage ira account with sean dillon dillon,a stockbroker at paine webber and the son of a childhood friend.patricia duffy was aware that vincent had opened a brokerage account.upon dillon recommendation,vincent sold the mca stock.
at some point between and,vincent duffy transferred the account to ed flynn flynn of hanifen imhof,another stockbroker who was the son of a childhood friend.he told flynn that his investment objectives were to make a lot of money and to be safe and conserve the account.
in february,the value of the ira brokerage account was.at the time,the portfolio contained nine stocks.flynn recommended that vincent duffy sell these stocks and buy five specific technology stocks,one of which was excalibur technologies excalibur.this company sells software,including a new type of internet video software,to commercial businesses and government agencies in north america,europe and elsewhere.flynn told vincent that this was a good solid stock about to increase in value.vincent duffy followed flynn recommendations.
between april and december,shares of excalibur increased in value from approximately per share to per share.on flynn recommendation,vincent bought and sold excalibur at different prices during this period.by november,the value of the brokerage account had increased to.
sometime in,flynn suggested that vincent duffy invest the entire portfolio in excalibur.vincent followed that advice sometime in.by july,the value of the brokerage account had declined to.vincent duffy expressed concern but flynn reassured him.the brokerage account remained invested solely in excalibur.in february,the price of excalibur shares dropped precipitously,reaching a low of.vincent duffy ceased trading in the stock.by may,the price had returned to per share.the value of the brokerage account was.
before the parties separated,patricia duffy saw some brokerage statements that had been mailed to the house,as well as prospectuses and other investment materials.she realized the mca stock was not reflected on these statements but asked no questions about this.she asked no questions whatsoever about the brokerage account.for a brief period of time when flynn moved to another brokerage house,vincent duffy had the statements mailed to his office.
according to expert witnesses,the investments in the ira account were far too risky and lacked adequate diversification.had the mca assets been invested in a more conservative manner,the yield would have been far higher.one expert calculated damages for vincent duffy alleged breach of fiduciary duty by using the difference between the highest value of the ira account and its value in may.

discussion 
on appeali 
vincent duffy contends the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court finding that he breached his fiduciary duty of full disclosure.we agree.
with limitations that are irrelevant to this case,family code section,subdivision a,reposes in either spouse the management and control of the community personal property,with like absolute power of disposition,other than testamentary,as the spouse has of the separate estate of the spouse.subdivision e of section provides that e ach spouse shall act with respect to the other spouse in the management and control of the community assets and liabilities in accordance with the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons having relationships of personal confidence as specified in section,until such time as the assets and liabilities have been divided by the parties or by a court.this duty includes the obligation to make full disclosure to the other spouse of all material facts and information regarding the existence,characterization,and valuation of all assets in which the community has or may have an interest,and to provide equal access to all information,records,and books that pertain to the value and character of those assets,upon request.italics added.
family code section,subdivision b,upon which section,subdivision e,relies for definition of the scope of spousal fiduciary duty,provides that e xcept as provided in sections,and of the probate code,a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other.this confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners,as provided in sections,and of the corporations code,including the following providing each spouse access at all times to any books kept regarding a transaction for the purposes of inspection and copying.rendering upon request,true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property accounting to the spouse,and holding as a trustee,any benefit or profit derived from any transaction by one spouse without the consent of the other spouse which concerns community property.italics added.
the duties specified in family code section,subdivision b,are derived from the corporations code sections upon which subdivision b relies.former corporations code section now section gave a partner the right to have access to,inspect and copy books of account.section now section conferred the right to disclosure,on demand,of information regarding the partnership business.section now section required accounting for the benefits or profits derived from a partnership or benefits derived by a partner use of partnership property.section specified when a partner was entitled to a formal accounting.
the lower court found that,upon his termination from mca records,after approximately years of employment,vincent duffy received his interest in the mca records plan,or in cash,which he rolled over into an ira at investment savings loan association.he also received shares of mca records stock from a stock investment plan and an additional shares of stock from another company plan.the court further found that vincent duffy thereafter made investments of these assets without consulting with patricia duffy or obtaining her advice or agreement.while vincent duffy told patricia duffy about an initial investment,he did not tell her about subsequent investments,assuming she would realize he was making such investments,nor did he tell her that he was using funds from the mca profit sharing ira rollover to make these subsequent investments.further,he did not tell her how he invested the shares of mca stock he received 
the court also found that f rom time to time throughout the marriage,patricia duffy attempted to question vincent duffy about financial affairs.when she did,he usually did not respond or if he did,he was very curt,treated her in a dismissive manner,indicating she was not to talk about it.inasmuch as there were requests by patricia duffy for economic information which vincent duffy ignored,the court found that vincent duffy had breached his fiduciary duty of full disclosure with respect to investment of the mca assets.at no point in its findings does the court mention any of the community other investments 
it is settled that appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence is governed by the substantial evidence rule.bixby pierno cal d.this court views the entire record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court findings.bowers bernards d.accord,campbell southern pacific cal d.we must resolve all conflicts in the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the findings.watson department of rehabilitation d.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance.toyota motor sales,superior court d.bowers,supra,at.
patricia duffy had no financial training or background.prior to marriage,she had no experience in handling finances.her attempt at handling the parties finances early in their marriage was,as she acknowledged,a disaster.thereafter,vincent duffy generally handled finances.
sometime before,vincent duffy had invested in an auto body shop.he subsequently invested additional sums.the investment was a total loss.patricia duffy acknowledged that she knew of this investment.when asked whether she had asked vincent duffy how much he was investing,she said she had not done so.when asked why,patricia explained,well,usually when i asked him questions about money,i was given a very dismissive wave of the hand type answer.she had asked him questions about money before he made the auto body shop investment but usually did not receive answers,or received only very curt ones.with respect to this investment,she did receive some material information upon request,however.she knew the auto body shop was not making money,knew enough money had to be produced each month to pay the rent,and eventually learned that the investment was tied up for a lease term on the auto body shop.
patricia duffy had participated in the purchase of unimproved real property in leona valley.she also knew about their investment in a house in bullhead city,arizona,before it took place.she knew the purchase price.when vincent duffy and his partner sold the property,she knew the sales price.she also learned,upon inquiry,that there were problems with the sale and that the parties were litigating the sale in court.patricia duffy had some information about the atlanta nightclub for which vincent duffy had made a loan,although she knew no details.she asked no detailed questions.
patricia and vincent duffy discussed ahead of time their purchase of a timeshare in cabo san lucas,mexico.they specifically discussed the price.
patricia duffy accompanied vincent duffy when he rolled over his proceeds into the ira at investment savings loan association.she was aware that he opened a brokerage account.before the parties separated,she saw some brokerage statements that had been mailed to the house.she realized the mca stock was not reflected on these statements but asked no questions about this.
this is the sum total of the evidence upon which the lower court relied in finding that vincent duffy breached his duty of full disclosure with respect to the mca assets.there is no evidence that vincent duffy ever refused to provide information about the investment of these assets.similarly,there is no evidence that patricia duffy ever asked any questions concerning the investment of these assets.to the contrary,she testified that she asked no questions.there is not even any evidence that vincent duffy continued to treat her requests for financial information in a dismissive manner after.indeed,with respect to some investments,the record reflects the contrary.patricia duffy could secure pertinent investment information when she sought it.she received it with respect to the bullhead city real estate investment,the cabo san lucas timeshare and,to some extent,the auto body shop investment.
patricia duffy argues that this makes no difference for two reasons.first,vincent duffy historical pattern of giving her curt and dismissive answers when she sought financial information justifies the inference that he ignored her requests in this instance.as noted above,the historical pattern is inconsistent.it was possible for her to obtain information upon inquiry.moreover,she testified directly that she asked no questions concerning investment of the mca assets.it therefore can not be inferred that she did ask and received no response.
second,patricia duffy argues,it would have been futile for her to ask,so she was not required to do so.as we have noted,it is not clear that it would have been futile for her to ask for information.doing so in the past occasionally had yielded results.she did not testify that she believed it would be futile or that she had been so intimidated in the past that she was afraid to ask.there is no evidence even that she had any particular interest in the status of the mca assets.more importantly,the evidence on this point is not uncontroverted.according to vincent duffy,he provided patricia with considerably more financial information than she testified he had provided.the lower court made no finding that it would have been futile for patricia to seek information about the investment of the mca assets.to the contrary,the court found that there were requests by her for economic information which vincent duffy ignored.
whether an act would have been futile normally is a question of fact.it may be determined as a question of law only if the facts are undisputed and permit only one reasonable inference.people ex rel.state pub.wks.bd.superior court d.inasmuch as the evidence in this case does not compel an inference of futility,we can not excuse patricia duffy failure to inquire on this ground.ibid.
in summary,there is no evidence,substantial or insubstantial,that patricia duffy ever sought information about the investment of mca assets,which information vincent duffy failed or refused to provide.there consequently is no evidentiary support for the trial court finding that vincent duffy breached his fiduciary duty of full disclosure upon request.
vincent duffy further contends the finding can not be upheld on the ground that he breached some other fiduciary duty.again,we agree.
initially,vincent duffy argues that we should not consider this as an alternative means of upholding the judgment.if the trial court,having selected one theory upon which to rule and rejected another,selected the wrong theory,we nonetheless may uphold the judgment on the alternate theory unless it is based on disputed facts.united pacific ins.hanover ins.d,fn.here,the facts concerning what vincent duffy did in making investment decisions,the investments he made and whether these conform to a particular standard all are undisputed.we therefore may consider an alternate theory even though the trial court chose not to do so.
fiduciary duty requires the fiduciary to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.in re marriage of reuling,supra,th at,d.one is a fiduciary when one person reposes confidence in the integrity of another.ibid.in that event,the fiduciary can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the other party without the latter knowledge or consent,citation and fn.omitted.in some circumstances,fiduciary duty also includes a duty of care in the management of property.see,subd.a.
the question is whether the fiduciary duty owed by the spouse managing community assets to the other spouse includes a duty of care.deciding this question requires statutory interpretation and some historical review.
in interpreting a statute,a fundamental rule is that the court must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in determining the intent,the court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.citation.the words must be read in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citation.in ascertaining the legislative intent,courts should consider not only the words used,but the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history and public policy citation.people aston cal d.
before,only the husband had the right to manage and control community property.former.he owed a fiduciary duty of loyalty to the wife in doing so.vai bank of america cal d.
while the husband did owe a duty of loyalty,he apparently did not owe a duty of care.as one note writer has observed evidently a husband is free to make unwise purchases,to speculate freely in stocks and securities or to use personal property foolishly without the wife consent,for in these situations the desirability of freely transferable personal property is thought to outweigh the harm suffered by the wife.citation.bank of california connolly d.to extend the duty further,another commentator stated,would hamper the exercise of his husband business initiative,prejudice the rights of those who deal with him,and generally hinder commercial transactions.id.at.
rosenthal rosenthal d,upon which patricia duffy relies,does not suggest otherwise.there was no question in rosenthal of whether the husband had breached his fiduciary duty by making speculative investments.the question was whether,after entry of an interlocutory divorce decree,the husband should be allowed to continue managing the community assets.the appellate court thought not,noting evidence that the husband has persisted in expending large sums of community money in a highly speculative oil business.at.inasmuch as p ouring money into a speculative business may empty the community estate as quickly and completely as a fraudulent concealment of assets,the husband persistence threatens to dissipate and waste the community assets.were the management of the community estate left to the husband and were he allowed to continue the community oil speculations in the hope of future profit,the community property would remain undivided and subject to speculative risk for an indefinite period.ibid.in these circumstances,the wife interest would continue to be at her husband mercy.ibid.the court consequently concluded that appointment of a receiver was necessary to conserve the community assets for division and distribution.
the lesson to be learned from rosenthal is simply this,the spouses interests may diverge,the managing spouse willing to risk dissipation in a speculative investment in hope of greater returns in the future,the other spouse desiring to conserve the existing estate until its division and distribution.this being the case,a spouse who had shown a propensity for making speculative investments should not be allowed to continue handling the community assets,for he can not be relied upon to exercise his duty of good faith and loyalty.it does not suggest that a managing spouse owes a duty of care in choosing investments.
in re marriage of quay th,d is of no greater help to patricia duffy.in quay,the trial court,over the wife objection,allowed the husband to manage community funds while the dissolution was pending.the husband knew the wife did not want money loaned to a company owned by the husband friend.knowing this,the husband loaned a large sum to the company.inasmuch as the parties were in adverse positions and the right to manage community property was being litigated,this was a breach of fiduciary duty.at.it was a breach of the duty of good faith and loyalty,however,not of a duty of care.nothing in quay suggests that a spouse owes a duty of care in managing community assets.
from to the revision of former civil code section,both spouses had a joint right to manage the community personal property the managing spouse had a duty to act in good faith in doing so.former,subd.e.in,the supreme court noted that a managing spouse duty of disclosure stems in part from the confidential nature of the marital relationship it also arises from the fiduciary relationship that exists between spouses with respect to the control of community property.in re marriage of modnick cal d,citations omitted.the asset concealed in modnick,however,was a bank account opened in into which the husband had deposited sums during the marriage.id.at.the dispute thus was over a asset.modnick consequently does not stand for the proposition that the duty of good faith found,as of,in the amended version of former civil code section,subdivision e,is the same as the fiduciary duty the husband previously owed to the wife.
recognizing this,a series of cases,beginning with
