on july,the court granted father petition and allowed him to move in with mother and minor.the court returned custody of minor to father as well as mother,under a family maintenance plan.the court continued this arrangement at a review hearing held july.
removal of minor from parents on dpss section 
in january,dpss recommended minor dependency be terminated and he remain in the custody of parents.dpss reported parents appeared to have resolved their substance abuse problems in an appropriate manner.they appeared to be managing their home and getting along well and had consistently demonstrated their ability to provide minor with an appropriate,safe,and nurturing home.the social worker report containing the recommendation that the dependency be terminated was served on counsel for parents on january.parents appeared in court on january,at which time the court continued the hearing to february.
on february,however,before the court took any action on the recommendation to terminate the dependency,dpss filed a supplemental petition pursuant to section,seeking to continue the dependency pending further investigation of parents substance abuse.dpss alleged parents had resumed using controlled substances shortly after their last court appearance on january.mother had been arrested on february,for being under the influence,at a property at which cocaine was allegedly being sold.several other adults at the property were determined to be under the influence of narcotics.according to the police report,items found at the property included marijuana,an substance,three firearms and ammunition,a sheet,and substantial amounts of cash.there were about seven small children at the property as well,whom the officers took into protective custody.
dpss also learned parents had left minor with his grandparents on january,and had not returned to pick him up.father had not contacted the grandparents regarding minor as of february.mother was in jail,and father whereabouts were unknown.
mother told dpss she and father had used cocaine on january,and father had disappeared.father,however,told dpss he and mother had an argument,and she drove away and left him stranded.father repeatedly denied using cocaine on january,and stated a drug test would be clean.
the social worker then spoke again to mother,who stated she had lied about father using cocaine on january.however,father tested positive for cocaine on february.
on february,the court found the allegations of the supplemental petition true and granted custody to dpss.it granted reunification services to mother and father and ordered them to participate in counseling educational programs.
continuation of reunification 
in august,dpss recommended the court return minor to parents and provide parents with six months of family maintenance services.dpss noted both parents had completed substance abuse and parenting programs both were working full time both had fully complied with random drug testing,and all results had been negative both had had regular weekly contact with minor and were appropriate during visits and both had made significant progress with their case plans.the prognosis for returning minor to the home appeared good.
a month later,however,dpss changed its recommendation,seeking to have the court terminate services to parents and set a section hearing within days.dpss stated parents had not attended their substance abuse classes and had been terminated from their programs.they had not submitted to random drug testing as requested by the social worker.they had not obtained a legitimate means of support and did not have a plan of support for minor if he were returned to them.at a recent visit,parents home was found to be filthy,very hot,and apparently without electricity.both parents were unemployed and did not have the means to provide for minor.
documentation submitted by dpss showed parents had failed to show up for drug tests on september and.a report from the riverside county department of mental health dated september,stated mother had made l ittle progress toward positive change in her substance abuse program,and her case had been closed due to lack of attendance and failure to contact program.the department report on father of the same date stated he had made n o progress toward positive change and had failed to return to treatment or contact facility.
dpss further reported that parents had attended an intake session for a substance abuse program on september,but had not returned for treatment until september.mother had failed to show up for a perinatal appointment on september.parents had been given referrals for individual counseling on august,but as of september,neither parent had attended counseling or called to schedule an appointment.
on october,the court conducted a hearing,which it characterized as a review of the case initiated by dpss february section petition.the court received in evidence letters showing parents reenrollment in substance abuse programs on september.it also heard testimony from mother,who explained her reasons for being discharged from her drug program and for missing drug tests.mother said she was discharged because she missed three sessions due to food poisoning and a trip to oregon due to her grandfather illness.she missed one drug test because she had lost her identification and another because she forgot about the test and went to reno.
the court found that return of minor to parents would create a substantial risk of detriment and that continued placement outside the home was necessary.in evaluating parents performance under the reunification plan,the court stated it would not count against father reunification period the time mother family maintenance plan was in effect.therefore,it considered both parents to be at the review stage in their reunification plans.
the court stated it appeared from the dpss status report that parents had regularly participated in reunification services.both had completed a parenting program.a may assessment stated mother had regularly participated in an outpatient drug program.a june letter showed father compliance with his drug program.an august report stated father was making good progress in treatment and had negative drug tests.
the court stated it was not impressed with mother being discharged from her drug program for nonattendance,or with either parent failure to appear for drug tests in september.however,it stated the only question was whether reunification services should continue.t
