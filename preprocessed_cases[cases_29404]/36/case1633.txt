introduction 
this case involves two appeals filed by kimberly in an ongoing juvenile dependency proceeding pertaining to kimberly son,nicholas,who was born on august.we ordered the appeals consolidated because the primary issue in both cases is whether the juvenile court erroneously concluded that kimberly former boyfriend,thomas,is nicholas presumed father and is entitled to have nicholas placed in his home during the pendency of these proceedings 
kimberly has consistently maintained that thomas is not nicholas biological father and that he has no parental rights in these proceedings.thomas contends that the relationship he has developed with nicholas qualifies him as a presumed father even though he admits he is not nicholas biological father.the alameda county social services agency the agency refused to take a position with respect to this issue until we ordered it to do so.the agency now argues that the juvenile court finding that thomas is nicholas presumed father was rebutted by evidence that thomas is not nicholas biological father.
ii.statement of facts and procedural history 
a.the dependency petition 
on february,the agency filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that nicholas was taken into custody pursuant to section,subdivision b,of the welfare and institutions code because his parents failed to adequately supervise and protect him.in addition,the petition contained allegations that nicholas stated that he did not want to live with kimberly because she was physically abusive toward him.thomas was identified as nicholas alleged father.the following events constituted the factual basis for the petition.
on january,thomas obtained temporary custody of nicholas after filing a petition to establish a parental relationship with nicholas in alameda county superior court.in his january petition,thomas alleged the following facts thomas lived with kimberly from may until december and from january until september.thomas and kimberly are the parents of nicholas who was born on august.kimberly can not keep a job,is often homeless,and has been in trouble with the law.since their separation,kimberly has prevented thomas from having contact with his son.most recently,the two fought over nicholas during a holiday visit in december at the home of thomas mother,carol,who lives in lakewood,california.kimberly attacked and bit thomas.the police were called and kimberly was arrested for felony assault.while kimberly was still in jail,thomas returned to his home in alameda county and brought nicholas with him.
in his petition,thomas asserted that family and friends of both thomas and kimberly supported his request for custody of nicholas and have acknowledged that kimberly can not adequately care or provide for nicholas.thomas also submitted letters of support from his friends and family.in one letter,thomas sister explained why thomas should be considered nicholas real father even though he is not the boy biological father.
on february,kimberly appeared at the fremont police department and reported that thomas took nicholas without her permission.kimberly told police she was in jail in los angeles when thomas took nicholas from the home of thomas mother to live with him in union city.kimberly gave police a copy of a los angeles county protective order dated september,restraining thomas from having contact with kimberly or nicholas until march.police further determined that thomas had an outstanding misdemeanor assault warrant.they also discovered that thomas had obtained the january temporary custody order.
kimberly gave police the following information thomas was not the biological father of nicholas.the two met when kimberly was pregnant and both had wanted thomas to be nicholas father.thomas was thus named as the father on nicholas birth certificate.kimberly and thomas never married but they lived together with nicholas.after a few years,the couple had problems,which led to domestic violence.thomas was arrested for battering kimberly and the restraining order was issued.the couple tried living together again despite the restraining order but they could not get along and often fought about how to raise nicholas.kimberly told police about the holiday visit at thomas mother home which resulted in her arrest for battery and thomas arrest for outstanding warrants.kimberly reported that,after thomas was released,he took nicholas to union city without kimberly knowledge or permission.
police went with kimberly to thomas work.thomas told the officer his version of the holiday visit and that he had obtained temporary custody of nicholas.he complained that kimberly was an unfit mother,that she took drugs and that she was homeless.thomas told the police that the outstanding warrant against him was for failing to complete an anger management class after he was arrested for battering kimberly in.police arrested thomas on the outstanding warrant.thomas refused to give permission to release nicholas to kimberly.the police therefore placed nicholas in the custody of the agency.
detention proceedings 
a february,detention hearing report described nicholas as a very bright and articulate four and year old who appears physically healthy and developmentally on target.nicholas had reported that his mother went to jail because she bit his father and that his parents often fought over him.nicholas stated that he did not want to see his mother because she was mean to him and hit him.he also reported that his father smokes cigarettes,but his mother smokes weed.kimberly had told the agency that thomas was not nicholas biological father.thomas responded that,although kimberly periodically claimed he was not nicholas father,she also filed for child support.the agency identified the home of removal as the home of the parents and recommended that it retain custody of nicholas and place him in a suitable family home or private institution pending further proceedings.
a detention hearing was held on february.a transcript of that proceeding is not included in the appellate record.however,the juvenile court order indicates that the matter was continued for a contested hearing,and that the agency was granted discretion to release nicholas to thomas.
according to a february court report addendum,the agency placed nicholas in thomas care on february following a satisfactory home evaluation.thomas was living in a house with roommates,was working as a wholesale distributor and had enrolled nicholas in daycare.thomas was encouraged to complete his anger management classes as required by the los angeles county court order.the agency reported that kimberly planned to return to southern california and work as a nanny.kimberly told the agency that she appeared to be a transient because she had to move often to get work as a nanny and to elude thomas,whom she described as a stalker.kimberly was expecting a baby in early april and was currently residing in a bay area shelter as to the recent domestic violence incident with thomas,kimberly claimed she acted in she bit thomas because he was trying to choke her while she was holding nicholas in her arms.
kimberly had a supervised visit with nicholas on february.nicholas did not exhibit any fear of his mother.however,after the visit,he repeated that his mother had hit him in the past with a belt and that she was mean.nicholas continued to express his desire to live with thomas.the agency recommended that nicholas be detained in the home of his father,pending jurisdictional hearing.
the detention hearing continued on february.again,we have no transcript of the proceeding.according to a february minute order,the juvenile court found that the welfare of the minor required that he be removed from his mother home.the agency was granted continuing discretion to place nicholas with thomas pending further proceedings.the court further ordered that nicholas was to have supervised visits with kimberly.
jurisdictional proceedings 
in its february,hearing report,the agency opined that nicholas could not be safely placed in the home of his mother or his alleged father.kimberly was transient and had no concrete plan for the near future.nicholas had alleged that his mother physically abused him and expressed the wish that he not be alone with her.in addition,kimberly had engaged in domestic violence while nicholas was present.thomas also had a history of domestic violence against kimberly committed while nicholas was present.furthermore,thomas was considered by the agency to be a caretaker,who could not pass the required requirements because of his conviction for domestic violence nicholas was aware of his parents fighting and their acts of physical violence against each other and would likely require therapy to address this issue.
the agency had determined that this family had four referrals to child services in los angeles during the period between february and august,but it had no information about the nature of these referrals.in addition,kimberly had a battery conviction for the december altercation with thomas.thomas had a conviction for possession of marijuana and a conviction for battering kimberly.he had also been arrested on february,for driving without a valid license,subd.a.the child abduction charges kimberly made against thomas that same day,however,were determined to be unfounded.
the agency recommended that kimberly be allowed supervised visitation and that thomas should have unsupervised visits with nicholas.according to the agency,t he minor seems to have a strong bond with thomas and he knows thomas as his only father.the agency further recommended that nicholas be declared a dependent of the juvenile court,that he be removed from the physical custody of both parents,and that both parents receive reunification services.
the jurisdictional hearing commenced on february.thomas submitted evidence of a petition for de facto parent status,which he had filed in superior court the previous day.in his petition,thomas maintained that he is the only father nicholas has ever known and that nicholas would be devastated if he discovered thomas was not his father.thomas further stated that i consider nicholas to be my son.i love him as much as any father would love a natural son.according to thomas,he and kimberly agreed thomas would be nicholas father when kimberly was still pregnant.thomas was present when nicholas was born,cut his umbilical cord,and was the first person to hold him immediately after his birth.thomas name was put on nicholas birth certificate.during the next few years,thomas lived with nicholas and supported him.
attached to thomas petition was an investigation report prepared by a family court services counselor.the counselor had not interviewed kimberly but reported that information from friends and relatives of the family supported thomas allegations of kimberly drug use,transiency,lack of gainful employment and violence toward others.the counselor reported that kimberly father had witnessed kimberly verbal and physical abuse of thomas,and he described his daughter as impulsive and assaultive,and said that thomas was honest,consistent and forthright.also attached to thomas petition was a copy of a complaint filed in the superior court in los angeles on december,seeking a judgment establishing thomas obligation to pay child support for nicholas.according to that complaint,thomas is named as the father of nicholas in a declaration of paternity on file with the los angeles county district attorney.
a transcript of the february hearing is not included in the appellate record.however,the court commissioner,the honorable beverly daniels greenberg,issued an order that day finding that thomas had made a preliminary prima facie showing of paternity.the jurisdictional hearing was continued,nicholas was to remain with thomas pending further hearing,and the commissioner indicated she would review thomas status at the next hearing.in the meantime,the agency was ordered to facilitate visitation between kimberly and nicholas.
at the continued dispositional hearing on march,commissioner daniels greenberg asked the parties to address whether thomas was a presumed father under family code section,subdivision d which grants presumed father status to a man who both receives a child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.thomas counsel argued that thomas was a presumed father both under the statute and pursuant to a may,los angeles county superior court judgment which obligated thomas to pay child support for nicholas the agency counsel argued that thomas admission that he is not the biological father rebutted the presumption he was nicholas father.agency counsel further argued that the los angeles judgment was not controlling because it was a default judgment and there was no finding in that case that thomas was a presumed father.finally,counsel expressed concern about the agency potential liability since thomas could not be certified and thus could only gain custody of nicholas if he was a relative or presumed father.kimberly counsel took the position that the mother right to custody and visitation should have priority and should not be trumped by a.
commissioner ruled that thomas was nicholas presumed father.thereafter,thomas submitted to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.initially,kimberly contested the court jurisdiction.however,after she changed counsel and the dependency petition was amended,kimberly submitted to the court jurisdiction at an april,hearing before the honorable julia spain 
at the april hearing,kimberly also identified a man named jason as nicholas biological father and asked that a dna test be ordered.judge spain ordered that jason be tested.the court further ruled that the agency had continuing discretion to facilitate visitation between kimberly and nicholas.finally,the court ruled nicholas placement with thomas was proper in light of the commissioner finding that thomas was the presumed father.
disposition 
the agency filed a court report addendum on may,in anticipation of the dispositional hearing.the agency reported that thomas had moved to a new residence in hayward and that kimberly had moved to a different shelter.kimberly was working for a temporary agency and was visiting nicholas on a regular basis.she was caring and appropriate during visits although nicholas continued to state his desire to live with thomas.the agency had been unable to obtain enough information from kimberly to locate jason 
the agency recommended that the court continue placement of nicholas with thomas.however,the agency also urged the court to adopt the proposed findings set forth in its jurisdictional court report.as noted above,in that report the agency recommended that nicholas be declared a dependent of the juvenile court and be removed from the custody of both parents.
the dispositional hearing commenced on may,and both thomas and kimberly contested the agency recommendation.kimberly new counsel argued that thomas admission that he was not nicholas biological father rebutted the presumption that thomas was nicholas natural father and deprived thomas of standing.judge spain rejected this contention,stating h e does have to be a biological father to be a presumed father.kimberly counsel also complained that thomas was interfering with kimberly right to visitation with her son.the court requested that the agency worker attend the next hearing to address the issue of visitation.the matter was then continued for a contested hearing.
the agency filed a dispositional hearing report on may.according to the report,thomas failed to bring nicholas to a scheduled visit with kimberly on may.instead,he left a telephone message that he and nicholas were in los angeles and intended to relocate there in the near future.the agency worker called thomas in los angeles.thomas reported that he lost his job because kimberly had disrupted his life by,among other things,demanding visits with nicholas.thomas was irate and extremely critical of kimberly.the agency worker told thomas he did not have permission to take nicholas out of the county.thomas responded that he had informed both kimberly and the agency that he might be moving.thomas also reported that he had given notice at his apartment.the agency worker reminded thomas of the pending court proceedings and urged him to return to the county immediately.thomas responded that he only had a plane ticket for himself.again,the agency worker urged thomas to return with nicholas.later,thomas mother,carol,contacted the agency to express her view that nicholas should be taken away from kimberly.the agency worker urged carol to encourage thomas to return nicholas to the county.
in its may report,the agency recommended that nicholas be declared a dependent of the juvenile court and that he be removed from the custody of both thomas and kimberly.the agency also recommended reunification service plans for both kimberly and thomas.
the contested dispositional hearing commenced may.at that hearing,kimberly counsel again disputed the finding that thomas was nicholas presumed father.judge spain ruled that issue was not before her because the time to contest the commissioner finding or to request a rehearing had past.the court then heard testimony from sylvina cooper,the agency worker assigned to handle nicholas case.
cooper testified that the agency originally recommended that nicholas be placed with thomas because the two appeared to have a very good relationship.thomas was nurturing,had a good routine for the child,was cooperative and appeared stable enough to do it.the agency changed its recommendation after the may incident.cooper now recommended against placing nicholas with thomas because thomas was hampering reunification efforts with kimberly and because the agency had lost trust in him.in addition,thomas had lost his job,given notice at his apartment and had failed to address his anger problem notwithstanding the los angeles county order that he do so.according to cooper,thomas was no more stable than kimberly.
at the may hearing,the agency requested that nicholas be immediately removed from thomas care and that he be placed in a shelter.thomas,who had returned from los angeles with nicholas and appeared at the hearing,reported that he was still living in his apartment and that his landlord was willing to ignore his notice.thomas also reported that he would eventually like to relocate to southern california to be closer to family and find better work.however,thomas did not intend to move in the near future.
the court characterized thomas behavior as foolish,and as changing the posture of this case.however,the court did not share the agency concern that thomas posed a health or safety threat to nicholas.the court also noted that thomas had not been expressly told to stay in the county.after further discussion,the court concluded the agency had a gross overreaction in this instance,and stated that it was appalled at the way this has been handled.over the agency objection,the court then conducted an ex parte meeting with nicholas and his counsel.
after meeting with nicholas,the court described him as one of the most delightful children i have had the pleasure to spend time with in quite some time.the court stated that the meeting with nicholas gave it greater confidence to follow through with its intention to leave him in the placement with his father.according to the court,nicholas had made it clear that he felt safest and happiest with thomas and that he readily volunteered he confident his daddy loves him the most.thus,after obtaining assurances from thomas that he would not remove nicholas from the court jurisdiction or do anything to frustrate kimberly visitation rights,the court ruled that nicholas could stay with thomas.the court also rejected kimberly request for increased visitation because nicholas had told the court that his mother made him mad and sad and that visiting with her made him sad.the disposition hearing was continued to july.
on july,the agency filed another disposition report.the recommendation in this report was that dependency be continued with the minor placed in the home of his father.the agency reported that thomas had resumed living at his hayward residence,had changed employment and for the most part has been cooperative in complying with kimberly weekly visitation schedule.thomas continued to express his desire to relocate to southern california where he would have family support and stability.thomas maintained that kimberly should move to southern california if she wanted to see nicholas.kimberly was supporting herself and her new baby through afdc and living with a family in fremont while awaiting housing of her own.
the agency reported that nicholas had been seen by a therapist.at the boy insistence,thomas was present during the session.the therapist reported that thomas acted appropriately during the session.the therapist told the agency worker that nicholas appeared to be hypervigilent and easily agitated by noises.he was easily distracted,defiant and could be quite difficult to handle.the therapist was unable to formulate an opinion about nicholas behavior at this early stage of treatment but indicated she did not rule out hyperactivity or some type of trauma.
at the july,continued dispositional hearing,judge spain reversed her prior ruling and found that kimberly and any other party could present evidence to rebut the presumption that thomas is nicholas presumed father.the dispositional hearing continued for several days while the court heard testimony from several witnesses on issues pertaining to both disposition of this case and thomas status as the presumed father.
thomas expressly testified that he is not nicholas biological father.thomas testified that kimberly began living with him when she was pregnant with nicholas.kimberly told thomas that nicholas biological father did not want a relationship with her or the baby.kimberly and thomas agreed that thomas would be the father and his name was put on nicholas birth certificate.thomas also participated in the birth of nicholas and chose his name.
thomas testified that he is not the biological father of any child and that he can not have children.thomas claimed that his love for nicholas really has nothing to do with the fact that i ca have my own because that just recently happened.thomas explained i love this child as though he is biologically mine.and i do was raised by a stepfather,and i glad i was because he did very well raising me.and,you know,again,i very,very happy to do that for nick.and i do see any reason why i should be allowed to.thomas also testified that nicholas believes that thomas is his biological father and has never know anybody else to be his father.
kimberly testified that jason is nicholas biological father.kimberly stated that jason knows his relationship to nicholas and that the two have visited several times,most recently in october of.kimberly also testified that thomas threatened to break up with her unless she put his name on nicholas birth certificate.
closing arguments were heard on july.during his closing argument,thomas counsel conceded again that thomas is not the biological father but insisted that thomas is nicholas presumed father.nicholas counsel agreed that the presumption had not been rebutted counsel for the agency and kimberly counsel both maintained that the presumption was rebutted by thomas own admission that he is not nicholas biological father.
the juvenile court made its decision and shared it with the parties late in the day on july,after the court reporter had left for the day.according to a july minute order,the court adjudged nicholas a dependent of the juvenile court,found that the home of removal was the home of the mother,and placed nicholas in the home of his presumed father,thomas,under the supervision of the agency.the court also granted thomas motion to be declared nicholas de facto father.the agency was ordered to provide family reunification services to kimberly and family maintenance services to thomas.the minute order set forth handwritten findings that supervised visits between kimberly and nicholas shall continue and that thomas presumed father status will remain.the order also granted thomas permission to relocate to southern california and stated that after that move visits between minor and mother shall be every other weekend supervised visits for hours until such time court receives psych.eval.report.
on august,judge spain read her decision into the record.first,the court stated that commissioner granted thomas presumed father status and that ruling was not subject to challenge.second,the court found that the presumption had not been rebutted.the court expressly rejected the contention that thomas admission rebutted the presumption.according to judge spain,i f i were to agree with county counsel that thomas admission that he is not nicholas biological father rebuts the presumption,then what we would be doing is leaving nicholas fatherless.the court reasoned that,although kimberly had identified jason as the biological father,that man had not come forward to assert his rights.acknowledging that thomas may ultimately find that biology will prevail,the court concluded that,at this time,under the facts that had been presented to this court,i do not find that the presumption has been rebutted.and thomas will continue to receive the rights and benefits of being nicholas presumed father as well as the responsibilities.
with respect to disposition,the court found there was clear and convincing evidence that nicholas must be removed from kimberly physical custody.however,the court rejected the agency recommendation that nicholas be removed from thomas care.the court acknowledged that thomas had problems but concluded that thomas had been caring toward and responsible for nicholas.the court was also swayed by nicholas clear expression of his love for thomas and his preference to live with him.thus the court concluded that nicholas care and custody would be committed to the agency but that his placement should continue in thomas home.the court ruled that both kimberly and thomas were entitled to services and both were ordered to participate in psychological evaluations.the court also vacated its prior order that jason submit to a paternity test.finally,the court ruled that thomas could relocate to southern california with nicholas and return to the county for appointments and visits with kimberly.
six month review 
the agency filed a status review report on october.ruth levin had replaced sylvina cooper as the agency worker responsible for this case.nicholas and thomas had moved to lakewood,california to live with thomas mother.nicholas was physically healthy and had participated in a psychological evaluation and an attachment study that would be completed in the near future.kimberly was requesting that nicholas be returned to her care and thomas was seeking sole custody.
the agency reported that kimberly behaved appropriately during supervised visits and that nicholas appeared to have a good time with his mother and was reluctant to leave her.kimberly was residing with a couple in fremont in a home that was appropriate for visitation and overnight visits.the agency recommended that,although kimberly consistently expressed her desire to have nicholas returned to her,her living and financial situation were not sufficiently stable to grant that request.
the agency reported that thomas had not complied with the requirement of his case plan that he submit to random drug tests and there was no indication he had complied with the requirement that he participate in domestic violence classes.the agency worker reported that thomas had continued to express his anger toward and criticisms about kimberly in front of nicholas.the agency worker had experienced the intensity of the father anger over the phone and in person,and reported that thomas repeatedly complained about kimberly and her shortcomings as a mother.
thomas had also failed to comply with several conditions of the visitation plan.for example,he moved nicholas to southern california shortly after the august hearing notwithstanding the juvenile court order that he remain in the county until completion of the attachment study.thomas also failed to provide transportation for nicholas to attend visits every other week with kimberly.thomas told the agency he misunderstand the court visitation order and also complained that kimberly did not have to pay for any transportation.
the agency reported that kimberly was calling thomas home every day so she could talk with nicholas and that thomas interpreted these calls as an effort to harass him and to upset nicholas.the agency worker and thomas had a heated discussion about these phone calls during which thomas again expressed his anger and complained that both the agency and the court were siding with kimberly and ignoring nicholas needs.nicholas told the agency worker that he liked to talk to his mother on the telephone but that it made his father mad.nicholas also admitted to the agency worker that he sometimes got into trouble at school but asked the worker not to tell thomas,who would be mad at him.
the agency concluded that neither parent had made substantial progress on their case plan and that there were still many unanswered questions as to the allegations made by the parents against each other.in addition,the agency had not yet received the results of the attachment study and neither parent had completed the psychological evaluations ordered by the court.therefore,the agency recommended that the parents be ordered to comply with their plans and that the matter be continued for an additional six months.
judge spain conducted a review hearing on october.thomas appeared in pro per.at one point during the hearing,the agency counsel asked to address the issue of paternity.the court replied that the issue was previously litigated and was now up on appeal.the court further stated that for all purposes in this proceeding,thomas is the presumed father of nicholas,although we all aware that he is not the biological father.
the court admonished both kimberly and thomas to comply with the court prior rulings and the requirements of their case plan.the court also observed that it is my goal,over the period of time that i still have you in this court,to get the message across to you that the two of you are going to have to learn how to communicate so that nicholas is not the constant ball emotionally the two of you use against each other.it was made absolutely clear to me at the last hearing that both of you use nicholas to hurt each other.it absolutely clear,and you both need to get over it.
the court also modified its ruling regarding visitation.it ordered that visits were to alternate between alameda county and southern california,that thomas was to pay for transportation for visits in alameda and that either kimberly or the agency were to pay for her visits to southern california.the court also limited kimberly telephone privileges to three calls a week at a specified time.in addition,the court set a contested hearing date in response to kimberly request that nicholas be immediately returned to her custody.the court memorialized these rulings in a october minute order.
kimberly appealed from the juvenile court dispositional order on august.she appealed from the october minute order on december.as noted above,this court consolidated the two appeals.
iii.discussion 
thomas status as a presumed father 
kimberly contends that the juvenile court orders must be reversed to the extent they implement the court allegedly erroneous finding that thomas is nicholas presumed father.
the statutory framework 
the legislature has recognized that a parent who has a child removed for neglect,abuse or substantial risk thereof,in most cases should be provided with services to assist the parent in overcoming the problems that led to removal.in re zacharia cal th,d.courts have concluded that the word parent in the dependency statutes does not include de facto or stepparents.citations.id.at,d.furthermore,only a presumed,not a mere biological,father is a parent entitled to received reunification services and the opportunity to obtain custody of a dependent child.id.at,d.
when applying the dependency statutes,we use the definition of presumed father set forth in the uniform parentage act,et in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.as our supreme court has recognized,the statutory term presumed father is somewhat cumbersome.citation.adoption of kelsey cal th,fn,d.it can also be misleading.although the term presumed connotes uncertainty,the presumed father enjoys greater substantive rights under the family code than a man whose paternity is uncontested but who nevertheless can not obtain presumed father status.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,d.
to become a presumed father,a man must satisfy one of the conditions enumerated in section.the only relevant condition in this case is section,subdivision d section d,which provides that a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if h e receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.
except under circumstances not relevant here,a presumption under section is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence,subd.a.the presumption is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man,subd.c.
thomas qualified as a presumed father under section d 
in the present case,kimberly advances several arguments to support her claim that thomas is not nicholas presumed father.many of her arguments challenge the initial finding granting thomas presumed father status.we question whether these arguments are timely since this is an appeal from dispositional and review orders made by judge spain and not by commissioner.judge spain did not find that thomas established he was entitled to the presumption.rather,she found that the presumption of paternity established in the prior proceeding before commissioner was not rebutted at the contested dispositional hearing.nevertheless,because authority addressing this statutory presumption is confusing,and in order to make our own holding clear,we will address kimberly substantive claim that thomas did not initially qualify as nicholas presumed father under section d and then separately consider whether that presumption was rebutted under section.
kimberly contends the commissioner finding was erroneous because thomas was estopped from acquiring presumed father status,the commissioner should not have given collateral estoppel effect to the los angeles county support judgment,and the commissioner finding was not supported by substantial evidence.
kimberly estoppel argument is based on an apparent misreading of thomas january,petition to establish a parental relationship with nicholas.kimberly contends that estoppel applies because thomas intentionally lied to the court in his january petition,a judicial council form that thomas completed and signed the petition sets forth the following statement the court has jurisdiction over the respondent because the respondent this statement is followed by three options,each with a corresponding box to be checked as relevant.thomas checked the box next to the following option had sexual intercourse in this state,which resulted in conception of the children listed in item.kimberly argues that thomas committed perjury by checking this box and representing to the court that he had sexual intercourse in the state resulting in the conception of nicholas.but thomas made no such representation.kimberly was the respondent referred to in the question at issue and thus thomas representation was that the court had jurisdiction over kimberly because she had sexual intercourse in the state resulting in the conception of nicholas.there is no reason to question the veracity of that representation.
in completing the petition,thomas did identify himself as nicholas father.however,he has consistently used that term to describe his relationship to nicholas and there is no indication of any attempt to mislead the court about the nature of that relationship.indeed,the letter from thomas sister that was attached to the january petition disclosed that thomas is not nicholas biological father.thus,we reject kimberly contention that thomas was not entitled to presumed father status because he intentionally lied to the court.
kimberly collateral estoppel argument is equally misguided.there is nothing in the appellate record to suggest that the commissioner gave collateral estoppel effect to the los angeles county judgment obligating thomas to pay child support for nicholas.in fact,the commissioner expressly acknowledged the differences between the section presumption of paternity and the statutory requirements for entering a child support judgment.contrary to kimberly argument in this court,the commissioner simply viewed the child support judgment as factual evidence which,along with other evidence,supported her conclusion that thomas qualified as a presumed father under section d.
we also reject kimberly contention that the commissioner finding is not supported by substantial evidence.the commissioner was presented with substantial evidence that thomas participated in nicholas birth,that his name appeared on nicholas birth certificate,that he lived with nicholas for long periods of time,that he has provided nicholas significant financial support over the years and that he has consistently referred to and treated nicholas as his son.in addition,there is undisputed evidence that nicholas has a strong emotional bond with thomas and that thomas is the only father nicholas has ever know.this evidence more that adequately satisfied the requirements of section d.see,brian ginger th,d.
in this regard,it is important to clarify that thomas was not required to produce evidence establishing a biological relationship with nicholas in order to acquire presumed father status.a man may achieve presumed father status,with its attendant rights and duties,without being the biological father.in re zacharia,supra,cal th at,fn,d,construing former,which was repealed and replaced by,and without substantive change.by its very terms,the statute creates the presumption of natural fatherhood,arising out of a man acceptance of a child into his home and acknowledgment of it as his own.the man claiming the presumption ha s no burden to present evidence establishing his biological link with the child.comino kelley th,d.
thus,we reject kimberly claim that thomas did not initially satisfy the requirements of section d.however,this conclusion does not end our inquiry.we now turn to judge spain ruling that evidence presented at the dispositional hearing was insufficient to rebut the presumption that thomas is nicholas natural father.
the presumption that thomas is nicholas father was rebutted 
as noted above,the section presumption that a man is the natural father of a child can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.to properly evaluate the juvenile court ruling that the section presumption was not rebutted in this case,we focus on the two statutory terms we have just quoted from the relevant statutes.
first,the term natural father is not defined in section or elsewhere in the statute.thomas contends that natural does not mean biological.but he fails to support this contention with relevant authority and he offers no satisfactory alternative definition.instead he offers the irrelevant observation that paternity presumptions are intended to eliminate the stigma of illegitimacy.several factors lead us to conclude that the term natural father in section means biological father.
although the family code does not expressly define natural father,relevant statutory provisions indicate to us that the legislature has used the term natural to mean biological.for example,in section itself,one of the conditions under which a man can acquire presumed father status is if he and the child natural mother are or have been married to each other and the child is born during the marriage,or within days after the marriage is terminated,subd.a.here,the term natural mother certainly means biological mother.another example is family code section,which provides that when a husband gives his consent that his wife be inseminated artificially with semen donated by a man not her husband,the husband is treated in law as if he were the natural father of a child thereby conceived,subd.a,and the donor is treated in law as if he were not the natural father of a child thereby conceived,subd.b.the obvious intention of this provision
