alanna father,appeals an order terminating his reunification services at a review hearing under welfare and institutions code section.contends the court erred when it terminated his services at the review hearing,while at the same time extending reunification services to the child mother,krystal to the review date.he argues section,subdivision h allows the court to terminate reunification services to a parent at the review only when the court sets a hearing under section.further asserts the termination of his reunification services served no useful purpose and was therefore both an abuse of discretion and a denial of his right to substantive due process.
we conclude that the court action at the review hearing was authorized by section,subdivision g and that section,subdivision h does not bar termination of reunification services to one parent when services are extended for the other parent to the review date.in addition,the juvenile court did not abuse its broad discretion to fashion an order at the review hearing.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
alanna was born in november.her parents,and krystal,lived together for a short time before she was born.they separated after an incident of domestic violence for which was arrested.each parent struggled with intermittent homelessness and substance abuse.
after alanna birth,and krystal briefly reconciled.the family lived together in the home of,krystal former foster sister and krystal separated in june.cared for alanna,staying alternately with his sister and.in november,krystal moved back into home and returned alanna to her care.in early january,after krystal had a violent confrontation with another roommate,told her to leave.refused to return alanna to krystal,asserting that krystal neglected alanna and that krystal was using drugs.
in february,alanna came to the attention of the san diego county health and human services agency the agency after sought medical care for alanna but did not have the legal authority to consent to treatment.the agency filed a petition under section,subdivision b,alleging that alanna,then months old,required the protection of the juvenile court due to parental neglect,substance abuse and domestic violence.the court made true findings at the jurisdiction hearing and placed alanna in foster care.
filed a declaration stating that he did not know whether he was alanna father and requested paternity testing.name was not on alanna birth certificate and there were no prior judicial findings concerning paternity.after testing confirmed that was alanna father,the court recognized him as her biological father.
at the disposition hearing,the court ordered the agency to provide family reunification services to and krystal.each parent was to participate in a domestic violence program,general counseling,parenting skill classes,and substance abuse counseling through the substance abuse recovery management system program sarms.
by the time of the review in september,krystal had participated in services and had made great progress.she was in a residential treatment program.in addition,krystal maintained custody of an infant daughter born in august.the court anticipated krystal would reunify with alanna shortly after the review hearing.
in contrast,had done very little.he did not enroll in sarms.initially participated in other required programs,but was dropped from counseling services and attended a domestic violence program only sporadically.although he was very affectionate with alanna and she enjoyed being with him,he stopped visiting her in june.
in august,was jailed for three days for failing to enroll in sarms.he failed to enroll after again being ordered to do so.he did not appear for the review hearing in september.at that hearing,the court issued a warrant for his arrest and terminated his enrollment in sarms to open a place for someone who would take advantage of the program.with that exception,the court continued reunification services to both parents.
soon after the review hearing,alanna was placed on a home visit with krystal.in december,the agency filed a supplemental petition under section alleging that krystal was unable to care for alanna because krystal had left the infant sibling unsupervised and unattended.the court detained alanna in foster care.the social worker reported that krystal had been consistently participating in her entire case plan,but that she appeared to be suffering from depression.
during the second review period,did not visit alanna and did not remain in contact with the social worker.in february,he was arrested on a sarms warrant and was briefly incarcerated.in march,began the sarms program.within three weeks,he was out of compliance and the court issued another warrant for his arrest.at a subsequent hearing,again agreed to participate in drug court and again failed to contact sarms.he was incarcerated and ordered to report to sarms upon release.in april,entered a residential treatment facility.
at the review hearing in may,contested the agency recommendation that his reunification services be terminated.he testified that he had been homeless and slipped off the face of the earth for a little bit.had been sober for days the residential program was beneficial and included group therapy.he had tried but had not been able to visit alanna in april and may because of program restrictions on visiting hours and the foster parent schedule.had not seen alanna in almost a year.he apologized to the court for needing a break when everything was coming at me at once.
krystal was consistently working with service providers.however,due to concerns about the stability of her mental health,the agency believed the prognosis for reunification to be poor.nevertheless,the agency recommended continuing krystal services until the review date 
the court stated that,although not legally required,it would normally continue services to both parents even if only one parent had a realistic chance for reunification.however,here,the court was not going to provide that opportunity.did not comply with case plan requirements and had not made an effort to visit alanna until recently.
the court terminated reunification services.at request and as a service to alanna,the court ordered his continued participation in drug court and authorized supervised visitation.the court found that krystal had consistently and regularly visited alanna and that she made some progress with her case plan.the court continued krystal reunification services to the review date.in the minute order,the court recited the findings required by section,subdivision g a,b and c.
discussion 
this case presents a question of first impression.when a section hearing is not set,does the court have the discretion at the review to terminate reunification services to one parent while at the same time continuing services to the other parent until the review date asserts that the court has the statutory power to terminate reunification services at the hearing only under narrowly limited circumstances.in re natasha th,d.he argues that section,subdivision h allows the court to terminate reunification services only when it sets a hearing under section.he further contends that the court did not have a rational basis for terminating his services and that,considering the nature of his constitutionally protected interest in a relationship with his daughter,the court abused its discretion and violated his right to substantive due process.
the agency responds that there is no language in the statutory framework that requires the court to treat both parents in the same manner,and states that each parent may take different routes through the dependency system.the agency asserts that the court acted within its discretion in terminating reunification services.
issues of law are not forfeited on appeal 
the agency argues that has forfeited the issue on appeal because he did not raise it in the trial court.nevertheless,the agency urges us to address the issue as a matter of first impression of broad public interest.
replies that the issue on appeal presents a question of law,which is not subject to the doctrine of
