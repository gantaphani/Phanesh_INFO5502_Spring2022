three sisters,ages eleven,eight,and five the children,who are dependent children of the court,have lived with their aunt for most of their lives.the children are under a permanent plan of foster care in the home of the aunt,who is their de facto parent.the los angeles county department of children and family services the department filed a supplemental petition under welfare and institutions code section,alleging placement with the aunt was no longer effective in the protection of the children.the department asked the dependency court for an order detaining the children from the aunt pending the resolution of the petition.finding it would be extremely detrimental for the children to be removed from this placement,the dependency court denied the department request.the department petitions for a writ of mandate directing the dependency court to vacate the order denying the detention request.the department contends welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d deprives the dependency court of discretion to allow the children to remain with the aunt,because the aunt had been convicted,after the children were placed with her,of a criminal offense that would have precluded placement of the children with her initially.we hold that welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d does not deprive the dependency court of discretion to allow a dependent child to remain in his or her placement,because welfare and institutions code section does not apply to removal of dependent children from an existing placement.accordingly,we deny the petition.
facts and procedural background 
maria was born in july,angela was born in october,and jessica was born in december to their mother and respective fathers.each child was removed from her parents at birth.maria was declared a dependent of the court in february and angela was declared a dependent in february.in,maria and angela were placed in the home of their maternal aunt,cheryl,in san bernardino.jessica was detained in cheryl home at birth.in,jessica was declared a dependent and placed in cheryl home.the children live in cheryl home with cheryl biological children and the children older brother,whom cheryl has adopted.
in,cheryl was convicted,by plea,of felony infliction of corporal injury upon her son in violation of penal code section,subdivision a.she received a probationary sentence.a supplemental petition under welfare and institutions code section was sustained and the children were removed from cheryl care.
cheryl own children were declared dependents of the court in san bernardino,but cheryl had successfully reunified with them.on may,after cheryl had completed anger management,child development,and parent relations classes,the dependency court ordered jessica and angela returned to cheryl.at the hearing on may,the department recommended against returning the children to cheryl on the ground that cheryl recent physical abuse of her son,recent marriage,and recent return of her own three children created too many stressors.however,the department did not argue that,because of cheryl felony conviction,welfare and institutions code section precluded return of the children to her.the department did not seek review of the order returning jessica and angela to cheryl home.
on october,the dependency court ordered maria returned to cheryl.the department recommended against returning maria to cheryl,because it was a violation of department policy for the social worker to recommend the placement in light of cheryl criminal record for child endangerment.the department did not seek review of this order.
in october,the dependency court ordered a permanent plan of foster care for the children.in,the social worker reported that cheryl hoped to adopt maria,angela and jessica.
on november,cheryl was arrested for inappropriate physical discipline of her daughter.she was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct.she was given a probationary sentence.
on february,the department filed a supplemental,welfare and institutions code section petition,alleging the previous disposition had been ineffective in the protection of the children.at a hearing on february,the department requested an order detaining the children from cheryl.the department asserted the dependency court was required by welfare and institutions code section to detain the children from cheryl,because cheryl had suffered a conviction of penal code section.the department argued the dependency court had no discretion to refuse detention.
the dependency court denied the request.there is definitely one good thing about having served in the dependency court for years.you tend to have an overview.i clearly understand the function of welfare and institutions code section and agree with it.it to protect children from being placed in a home where there is a criminal conviction for child abuse but when the legislature created that,were they thinking of the case we have now before us and i seriously do not think so.the statute should be strictly construed,and it reads clearly whenever a child may be placed in the home of a relative.today hearing is not a question of placement at all.these children were placed in this home a long,long time ago if the legislature had intended this,i sure they would have said that whenever a child may be placed or removed from the home of a relative that that person may not have a criminal record involving child abuse.it is my opinion that the statute was never intended for this case.in the four years since that statute has been enacted i have never had a case of this sort where the department asked the court to actually remove the child because of a criminal conviction i not being asked whether to place the children in the aunt home.i am being asked to remove the children it has been their home for many,many,many years.and i think it would be unconscionable to remove them.
concerning cheryl conviction in,the dependency court stated s he had been asked to do a parenting class,which she did,and on her own,she did an extensive anger management class,which had not even been required by the court.and that referee was recommending to the judge of that court that these children be returned to her home because of her insights into what she had done.concerning the recent altercation that she had with her daughter,i looked at the factual situation.it was at best inappropriate.mother had returned from hospitalization for an ectopic pregnancy and was apparently not feeling well.the daughter was being a teenager at a very best having run up a humongous phone bill and then wants the pizza man to deliver.mom picked up a small bamboo stick and she chased the girl around and lashed out and struck her on the shoulder.the police department was called.took the people aside and counseled everybody and left.the police department goes back to the police station and finds out mother has a conviction,and then they come back and they take her off.
the dependency court found that neither the convictions nor the other evidence presented by the department established a factual basis for removal of the children from cheryl.maria suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and stress disorder,and cheryl had met all her needs.the record is replete with an accolade as to the aunt care of these children.it is the opinion of this court that it would be extremely detrimental at this time for the court to remove these children from this placement.speaking to cheryl,the dependency court said y our devotion to the children can not be questioned i consistently amazed at the marvelous appearance of these children in court.they are well nourished.they are beautifully dressed,and they seem to be very happy young children 
the department filed this petition for writ of mandate challenging the denial of the detention request.we issued an order to show cause and stayed the disposition hearing on the welfare and institutions code section petition.cheryl and the children oppose the petition for writ of mandate.
