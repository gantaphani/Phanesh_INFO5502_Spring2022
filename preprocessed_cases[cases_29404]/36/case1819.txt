background 
in,respondent became pregnant with.at that time,respondent lived in hoopeston,illinois,and had eight children.the two youngest children lived with their father in tennessee.respondent remaining six children were wards of the state of illinois,per a neglect finding.during her pregnancy,respondent asked her department of children and family services dcfs caseworker,jacqui walters,what would happen if she had her baby here in illinois.walters responded that it would be up to the dcfs investigative unit to determine whether the baby should be taken into dcfs custody.afraid that dcfs would take custody of this child as well,respondent began making plans to move to tennessee.
on march,respondent saw her obstetrician,suzanne trupin,at a clinic in champaign.trupin told respondent to return the next day,and respondent did so.at the march,appointment,trupin told respondent to report immediately to covenant hospital in champaign,as the birth of her baby was imminent.instead,respondent got in her car and headed for tennessee.respondent made it as far as crawfordsville,indiana,before the contractions became too much to bear.respondent checked herself into a local hospital,where she gave birth to that night.
on march,amy west from the indiana child welfare service called the hoopeston police.west explained that hospital personnel in crawfordsville were concerned because respondent,who had given birth the day before,could not provide a local address,saying only that she was from hoopeston.the hoopeston police were familiar with respondent,as trupin office had called them the day before after respondent failed to report to covenant hospital as instructed.the police then informed west that termination proceedings were pending in illinois as to six of respondent children.at this point,west contacted jacqui walters at dcfs.
walters,in turn,contacted the vermilion county state attorney office,which immediately filed a petition for adjudication of wardship in the vermilion county circuit court.the state petition alleged that,who was one day old,resided in an environment that was injurious to his welfare.see ilcs b west.in support,the state alleged that the respondent had already been declared unfit as to six of her other children,in relation to whom termination proceedings were pending.later that same day,the trial court held an ex parte emergency shelter care hearing.at the hearing,walters described the events that led to birth in crawfordsville.when asked whether she had notified respondent of the emergency shelter care hearing,walters replied that she had not because she was not sure exactly what hospital she in,and they concerned she will flee with the baby.at the hearing conclusion,the trial court found that it was a matter of immediate and urgent necessity to temporarily remove from respondent custody.in support,the trial court cited both the prior neglect findings and the possibility that respondent would flee with and conceal him from illinois authorities.
on march,the trial court held a second emergency shelter care hearing,for which respondent was present.the state again called jacqui walters,and she repeated most of her previous testimony.walters then explained that the terminations that were pending as to respondent six other children were based in part upon respondent diagnosis with borderline personality disorder,antisocial disorder,and psychotic features.according to walters,respondent mental illness posed a risk to the children.although respondent was supposed to be receiving treatment,she had missed of her last counseling sessions.at the hearing conclusion,the trial court again found that it was a matter of immediate and urgent necessity to temporarily remove from respondent custody.this time,the trial court cited both respondent effort to secret the child from the department of children and family services and respondent serious mental health issues,which directly impact her ability to care for the child and her children.the trial court then granted temporary custody of to dcfs.
on april,the trial court held an adjudicatory hearing.the state first called ann kapella,a child protection investigator with dcfs.kapella testified as to a march,conversation with respondent,in which respondent stated that she did not go to covenant hospital as instructed by trupin because she did want to give birth to the baby here in the state of illinois.according to kapella,respondent told her that she was afraid that dcfs would take this baby as well.the state then called jacqui walters,who again testified as to respondent diagnosed issues.walters explained that,although respondent was receiving treatment for her mental illness,that course of treatment was not yet complete.finally,respondent herself testified,confirming that she left for tennessee after the march appointment because she was scared of the removal of this child.at the hearing conclusion,the trial court found that was a neglected child due to an injurious environment.in support,the trial court cited both respondent psychiatric condition that remains untreated and respondent decision to hide the birth of this child by leaving the state without making any provision or arrangement for the birth of the child elsewhere.on this latter point,the trial court added 
to take off in a car when you were obviously so close to giving birth,so close that the hospital in champaign was trying to find out where you were.that was an extremely dangerous thing you did.that was injurious to the child welfare.
a dispositional hearing followed,and the trial court entered an order finding that respondent was unfit to care for and that it was in best interest to be made a ward of the court.custody was again awarded to dcfs.
respondent appealed,arguing that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the uniform jurisdiction and enforcement act uccjea ilcs et west because,at the time the wardship petition was filed,had never lived in illinois the failure to notify respondent of the march,hearing rendered that hearing improper and the trial court adjudication of wardship was against the manifest weight of the evidence.with one justice dissenting,the appellate court rejected all of respondent arguments and affirmed the trial court judgment.d.we granted respondent petition for leave to appeal a.
discussion 
before this court,respondent repeats the arguments raised below.we address each of these in turn.
subject matter jurisdiction 
this issue requires us to construe section a of the uccjea,which defines the circumstances under which a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination.ilcs a west.the principles governing our inquiry are familiar.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.accordingly,courts should consider the statute in its entirety,keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the legislature apparent objective in enacting it.people davis.the best indication of legislative intent is the statutory language,given its plain and ordinary meaning.illinois graphics nickum.where the language is clear and unambiguous,we must apply the statute without resort to further aids of statutory construction.davis toshiba machine,america.the construction of a statute is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.in re estate of dierkes.
under section a,a court of this state will have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if 
this state is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding,or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state 
a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph and 
a the child and the child parents,or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent,have a significant connection with this state other than mere physical presence and 
b substantial evidence is available in this state concerning the child care,protection,training,and personal relationships 
all courts having jurisdiction under paragraph or have declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child under section or or 
no court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in paragraph,or.ilcs a west.
in the case of a child less than six months of age,the uccjea defines home state as the state in which the child lived from birth with a parent or a person acting as a parent.ilcs west.
respondent argues that,under section a,indiana is statutory home state and therefore the only state with jurisdiction to make a custody determination as to.in support,respondent contends that was less than six months old when these proceedings commenced,was born in indiana,and lived his entire life with his mother within the state of indiana prior to being brought to illinois by dcfs.the state counters that has no home state for purposes of the uccjea and that illinois therefore has jurisdiction under sections a and a.we agree with the state.
we begin with the home state definition,which states that i n the case of a child less than six months of age,home state means the state in which the child lived from birth with a parent or a person acting as a parent.ilcs west.although no illinois court has yet construed this language,several other courts have issued decisions that we find both relevant and instructive.
in in re,the mother,who lived in missouri and had several termination proceedings pending in missouri,crossed the border into kansas to give birth.kansas authorities contacted missouri authorities and asked them to pick up the baby from the hospital.the missouri authorities did so,and a neglect proceeding was commenced.in rejecting the parents argument that kansas possessed exclusive home state jurisdiction over the baby,the appellate court explained that t he requirement that the child live with the mother from birth requires more than the mother and newborn child staying at the same hospital for a brief period,at,quoting in re adoption of baby girl,d.accordingly,the court held that kansas is not the home state of simply because and her mother stayed in a hospital there for two days after birth has never lived with her parents at all,at.the court promptly added,however,that missouri was not the baby home state either.on this point,the court explained that,a t the time the first petition was filed,did not live in missouri with her parents at all,and her placement by dfs,with a person acting as a parent,did not make missouri the state in which she has lived since birth,because she was born in kansas,at.
another helpful case is adoption house.in that case,a delaware adoption agency preplaced two babies with two different families,one living in pennsylvania and one living in delaware.both babies were born in pennsylvania hospitals,and both left the hospital with the adoptive parents.two months later,the agency filed petitions in delaware family court to terminate the parental rights of the babies birth parents.on its own motion,the court raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.after briefing by the parties,the court explained that t he state in which the homes of their placement are located constitutes the state in which each child has lived within the meaning of the uniform definition of home state.adoption house,at.consequently,the court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the baby placed in pennsylvania,as that baby had lived from birth in pennsylvania but it did have jurisdiction over the baby placed in delaware,as that baby,although born in a pennsylvania hospital,had lived from birth in delaware.adoption house,at.although not directly stated,the implicit underpinning of this ruling is that,by itself,the temporary hospital stay in pennsylvania was insufficient to confer home state jurisdiction on that state.on this point,at least,adoption house is entirely consistent with 
the pennsylvania superior court likewise touched upon this issue in joselit joselit.in that case,a pennsylvania couple gave birth to a son in pennsylvania hospital.at eight months old,the baby developed complications and was admitted to a new york hospital,where he was kept for several months.in the meantime,the couple separated,and the father filed a custody petition in pennsylvania.the wife moved to dismiss,arguing that new york was the more convenient forum.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.in reversing,the appellate court stated 
initially,the trial court concluded that the child resided in new york during hospitalization and recuperation and that new york,therefore,had become the home state of the child during that period.we are constrained to disagree.the hospitalization in new york was temporary and did not effect a change in the child domicile or home state.during this entire period,the child was subject to the control of one or both parents who resided in scranton,pennsylvania.the child home state did not change merely because of temporary hospitalization in another state.emphases added.joselit.at,at.
in other words,like the courts in both and adoption house,the court in joselit refused to use a temporary hospital stay as a basis for conferring home state jurisdiction.
we find these cases entirely persuasive.by itself,a temporary hospital stay incident to delivery is simply insufficient to confer home state jurisdiction under the uccjea.again,the best indication of legislative intent is the statutory language,given its plain and ordinary meaning.illinois graphics,at.section defines a newborn home state as the state in which he or she has lived from birth with his or her parents.the crucial question,of course,is what did the drafters of the uccjea mean by live,a verb that can mean many different things depending upon the context.did they mean,as respondents seem to suggest,nothing more than to be alive see webster third new international dictionary.that,for purposes of the uccjea,a child lives in every jurisdiction in which he or she draws a breath or did they mean,as the case law teaches,something more like to occupy a home see webster third new international dictionary.we are convinced that they meant the latter.when people speak of where a mother and newborn baby live,they do not speak of the maternity ward.instead,they speak of the place to which the mother and baby return following discharge from the hospital.in many parts of illinois,the mother hospital of choice may be located in another city or even another state.hoopeston mothers,we now know,may deliver in champaign.galena mothers may deliver in dubuque.yet no one would respond a hospital in champaign or a hospital in dubuque if asked where these mothers and babies live.rather,they would respond hoopeston or galena because that is where these mothers and babies live,as that term is commonly understood.
as importantly,allowing a temporary hospital stay to confer home state jurisdiction would undermine the public policy goals of the uccjea,which include ensuring that a custody decree is rendered in that state which can best decide the case in the interest of the child.emphasis added,comment,at consider,again,a galena mother who chooses to deliver her baby in a dubuque hospital.in addition to living in illinois,this mother may work in illinois,have a husband and other children in illinois,pay taxes in illinois,attend church in illinois,and send her children to illinois schools.clearly,if the occasion arose,illinois would be the state which can best decide a case involving the interest of thi
