hershel oscar rosenbaum rosenbaum and his children appeal the district court order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity.
rosenbaum was arrested as he stood outside a fair selling promotional tickets that he had received for free from a radio station.he was wearing a with the logo of the station his children,ages eight and four,were standing beside him.he was arrested for abuse,neglect or endangerment of a child,and obtaining money under false pretenses.officers walked his children across the street to the car where their mother was waiting.on the way,they told the children that what their father did was wrong,that you know what your father did was wrong,and that he was going to jail for what he had done.rosenbaum spent eight hours in jail and was released on bail.he had in fact not violated any statute.there is no scalping law in nevada no other charge applied to his conduct.the charges against him were ultimately dropped.
rosenbaum and his children brought a suit against washoe county,county sheriff dennis balaam,county deputy sheriff lieutenant james forbus forbus,and michael haley,for damages resulting from the unlawful arrest.they claimed a violation of two constitutional rights the right to be free from unlawful arrest under the fourth and fourteenth amendment,and the substantive and procedural due process right to family integrity under the fourteenth amendment.they also brought state claims for libel,assault,battery,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,false arrest,and false imprisonment.
the county defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity,and the district court granted the motion.the district court held that while the arresting officer,forbus,did not have probable cause to arrest rosenbaum,he was entitled to qualified immunity because a criminal statute,collecting for benefit without authority,which was offered by the defendants to justify the arrest,was ambiguous.
significantly,the statute on which the district court relied in finding qualified immunity was unknown to forbus at the time of the arrest.it has no published authority or legislative history.while there is a factual dispute about when the county defendants found this statute,it is clear that it was found at some point after the arrest and even after rosenbaum was released.the rosenbaums allege that it was the district attorney who found it after this case was brought,almost two years after the arrest.the county defendants claim that it was officer forbus who found the statute.a westlaw search of nevada law found not a single reference to this statute other than in this case.
the district court further held that while the officer comments to the children were offensive,they did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court ruling on qualified immunity for the unlawful arrest and affirm the district court ruling on the right to integrity of the family.

standard of review 
this court reviews a district court ruling on summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity de novo.mcsherry city of long beach,cir,cert.denied.summary judgment will be granted or affirmed where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in making this determination,we will consider all of the facts in the light most favorable to rosenbaum.see scott harris.
discussion 
the court applies a analysis to determine whether officials are entitled to qualified immunity whether the facts alleged show that the officer violated a constitutional right and if so,whether that right was clearly established at the time of the event.see ashcroft.these two questions may be considered in either order.pearson callahan.the linchpin of qualified immunity is the reasonableness of the official conduct.anderson creighton,w hether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action,assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,the rosenbaums allege that the officials violated two constitutional rights the right to be free from unlawful arrest and the substantive due process right to family integrity.we will consider each in turn,addressing first whether the right was violated,and then whether the law was clearly established such that the official would have been on notice that his conduct was unlawful.
