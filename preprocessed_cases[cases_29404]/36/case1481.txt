the plaintiff in this action asserts various property claims against her late husband estate.plaintiff principal claim is for the recovery of community property used to improve the husband separate real estate during the parties marriage.plaintiff other claims relate to personal property left in the husband possession when the parties separated.
the trial court disposed of all of plaintiff claims adversely to her,some by summary adjudication,and the rest by a defense judgment after trial.plaintiff challenges all of those determinations on appeal.
as we explain,we conclude that the judgment contains errors of law that require reversal and remand.
the plaintiff is this action is virginia ginni bono plaintiff.the defendant is john clark,executor of the estate of john bono defendant.john bono decedent was plaintiff husband.
plaintiff and decedent were married in and separated in.
prior to his marriage to plaintiff,decedent owned real property located at canada road in gilroy,california.decedent and his brother had purchased the gilroy property in for.the two brothers later divided the property.following that division,decedent property comprised some acres and included a by trailer.sometime after,plaintiff moved into the trailer with her son.up until then,the trailer had never been occupied.at that time,the trailer was dilapidated it had no electricity,no telephone service,and no laundry facilities.despite the condition of the trailer,plaintiff testified that the property was worth in,when she and decedent married.
throughout their marriage,the bonos used the trailer on the gilroy property as their residence.during that time,they made extensive improvements to it.among other things,they converted a large porch into several rooms bedroom,dining room,laundry room,office,and they added a large family room and a concrete patio.they remodeled the kitchen and bathroom and installed new carpet in the bedroom.they installed a new well and brought electrical service to the property.the improvements effectively converted the trailer into a home.according to plaintiff testimony,the total cost of the improvements was between and.
the bonos separated on labor day.plaintiff moved from the property at that time a mutual restraining order,issued in september,prevented her from returning.
in june,decedent petitioned for dissolution of the marriage.plaintiff answered the petition in august,and both parties filed property declarations.thereafter,however,neither party took any action to resolve their property disputes or to bring the dissolution action to a conclusion.
in november,while the dissolution action was still pending,decedent died.

procedural history 
in january,plaintiff filed her first amended complaint against the estate.the complaint stated two causes of action the first was for declaratory relief the second was for conversion.in the prayer of the complaint,plaintiff sought a declaration of her community property rights,a determination of community property funds expended to improve decedent separate property during the marriage,and damages for conversion of plaintiff separate property.
defendant promptly answered plaintiff complaint.
thereafter,in october,defendant moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,for summary adjudication.plaintiff opposed the motions.
the trial court heard and decided defendant motions in november.the court denied summary judgment,but partially granted the summary adjudication motion.as to the first cause of action,for declaratory relief,the court concluded that neither the statute of limitations nor the doctrine of laches barred relief as a matter of law.nevertheless,the court concluded,plaintiff had no right to reimbursement of community funds used to improve decedent separate property,because she consented to the use of those funds for that purpose.turning to plaintiff second cause of action,for conversion,the court granted summary adjudication on the ground that it was.
in february,the matter proceeded to trial on the remaining issues.during the bench trial,the court gave the parties wide latitude in putting on evidence,despite the prior summary adjudication order.thus,plaintiff was permitted to offer evidence in support of her theory that she had a pro tanto community property interest in the decedent property despite the prior ruling denying her reimbursement claim as a matter of law.defendant was allowed to offer evidence in support of the estate laches defense.
in march,the trial court filed its statement of decision.in it,the court first described the two issues that were previously adjudicated adversely to of community property contributions to the real property and conversion of her separate explained that those claims were res judicata.the court next rejected plaintiff claim of a pro tanto community interest in decedent real property.the court also disposed of plaintiff community property claims to certain items of personal property,including livestock and motor vehicles.finally,the court determined that plaintiff was guilty of laches in bringing this action.
in april,the court entered judgment for defendant.
plaintiff promptly appealed both from the judgment and from the earlier summary adjudication order.
discussion 
first cause of action community property claimsa.laches 
we consider the affirmative defense of laches at the threshold,because the trial court finding of laches,if affirmed,would be dispositive of the first cause of action for declaratory relief.
standard of review 
defendant urges us to review the trial court finding of laches deferentially,for an abuse of discretion only.see,in re marriage of plescia th,d i n the absence of a palpable abuse of discretion,the trial court finding of laches will not be disturbed on appeal.citation.accord,in re marriage of copeman th,d.
we decline to do so here.as the california supreme court recently recognized,there are circumstances in which it is error to review a laches determination under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,the appellate court erred in applying abuse of discretion standard where the trial court laches determination was the basis for its grant of summary judgment,which is subject to de novo review.
generally speaking,the existence of laches is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court in light of all of the applicable circumstances,and in the absence of manifest injustice or a lack of substantial support in the evidence its determination will be sustained.citations.miller eisenhower medical center cal d.in other words,appellate courts review such determinations for manifest injustice or for lack of substantial evidence.ibid.
in cases such as this,where the finding of laches is made after trial,the proper appellate focus is the evidence in support of the finding.even the two appellate decisions cited above,which employ the deferential abuse of discretion standard,do not disregard the evidence.see,in re marriage of plescia,supra,th at,d in light of the record,the trial court did not palpably abuse its discretion.and see,in re marriage of copeman,supra,th at,d t he trial court finding of laches was supported by the evidence.as the california supreme court recently explained generally,a trial court laches ruling will be sustained on appeal if there is substantial evidence to support the ruling.johnson city of loma linda,supra,cal th at,d,citing miller eisenhower medical center,supra,cal d at.we therefore examine the trial record for evidence in support of the trial court finding of laches.
the doctrine and its application here 
laches may bar relief in equity to those who neglect their rights,where such neglect operates to the detriment of others.see generally,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.given its nature as an equitable defense,however,there are recognized limits on application of the doctrine of laches.for one thing,the doctrine is not applied strictly between near relatives.berniker berniker cal d,citing rottman rottman,spouses.more generally,laches is not technical and arbitrary and is not designed to punish a plaintiff.it can only be invoked where a refusal would be to permit an unwarranted injustice.whether or not the doctrine applies depends upon the circumstances of each case.hiett inland finance cal.
the defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.johnson city of loma linda,supra,cal th at,d,quoting conti board of civil service commissioners cal d.
laches implies that the plaintiff should have done something earlier.hill hattrem d,fn.whether the plaintiff should have acted sooner depends on the circumstances of the particular case.
in this case,defendant argues that plaintiff should have sought resolution of her claims while decedent was still alive.defendant charges plaintiff with unreasonable delay for not pressing her property claims during the nearly three and a half years between the filing of the dissolution action and decedent death,johnson city of loma linda,supra,cal th at,d,delay of more than three years in seeking reinstatement unreasonable.
plaintiff counters that if there was a delay at all,it was neither unjustified nor chargeable solely to her.first,as justification for not pursuing her claims sooner,plaintiff points out that she was unrepresented during most of the time the dissolution action was pending because she was without the economic means to hire an attorney.next,plaintiff argues that the failure to pursue the dissolution action to conclusion should not be laid solely at her feet.according to plaintiff,the petitioner in the dissolution an equal or greater obligation to conclude the action and to resolve the property issues promptly.moreover,she asserts,it was in decedent best interest not to bring the matter to trial,since he continued to enjoy exclusive control of the property she claimed as long as the action was still pending.finally,plaintiff points out,she filed a claim with the estate within six months of decedent death and then filed this action some eight months later.thus,she argues,there was no delay.
we disagree with plaintiff implicit assertion that a party inability to afford counsel necessarily justifies delay,carrasco craft d.lack of funds to hire attorney does not always excuse default davis thayer d.same default not excused.we find more persuasive plaintiff argument that decedent bore the primary responsibility for concluding the dissolution action,howard thrifty drug discount stores cal th,d,plaintiff burden to avoid dismissal statute.
but we need not decide here whether plaintiff is responsible for an unjustified delay in concluding the dissolution action.even assuming that the trial court was correct in finding that plaintiff unreasonably delayed,that finding alone will not support a laches defense.delay is not a bar unless it works to the disadvantage or prejudice of other parties.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,equity,original italics.see also,conti board of civil service commissioners,supra,cal d at,fn.compare earlier california cases cited in zakaessian zakaessian d.
we therefore turn to the more critical inquiry whether defendant has demonstrated prejudice.
prejudice may be shown where the plaintiff delay causes detriment to the defendant.see,in re marriage of plescia,supra,th at,d prejudice shown where delayed more than nine years before seeking support arrearages during that period,had retired and could no longer pay the support order nealis carlson d,prejudice shown where delayed eight years after knowledge of final divorce decree before making claim of invalidity during that period,had adopted a child,changed his will,and died.compare,field bank of america d,no prejudice shown where plaintiff long inactivity actually benefited defendant by its accrual of trustee fees during the delay.
here,defendant claims the estate has been prejudiced because decedent death deprived it of one of only two witnesses to the transactions in question.death of important witnesses may constitute prejudice.stafford ballinger d.accord,garrity miller cal,getty getty d,zakaessian zakaessian,supra,d at,the death of a material witness is only one factor in determining whether laches is present.
in this case,however,defendant offered no evidence at trial to demonstrate whether and how the estate was prejudiced by decedent unavailability as a witness.the trial judge who earlier denied summary adjudication of the laches defense aptly noted in his order plaintiff and decedent stipulated to maintain the status quo of the property in their possession and thus greatly reduced the possibility that the delay would cause problems in locating specific items of property and even though decedent is dead,defendant may have other witnesses,records and evidence at his disposal to adequately represent the interests of decedent estate.at trial,defendant offered no evidence of prejudice.to the contrary,the estate presented its own evidence,produced its own witnesses though not the executor,and vigorously plaintiff.and although defendant trial counsel argued below that the estate had not abandoned its laches defense,he offered the court no trial evidence to support that closing argument.on appeal,defendant defends the trial court finding of prejudice with this observation the trial court witnessed the difficulty on the part of the defendant in contradicting or modifying the testimony of the plaintiff,since she and the decedent were the only ones privy to the information concerning the acts surrounding the marital residence.
prejudice is never presumed rather it must be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain his burdens of proof and the production of evidence on the issue.miller eisenhower medical center,supra,cal d at,citing conti board of civil service commissioners,supra,cal d at.see,miller eisenhower medical center,supra,cal d at,finding no evidence of prejudice and thus no support for the trial court finding of laches.
defendant bore the burden of production and the burden of proof on this issue but failed to carry either one,having offered no evidence at trial on the issue of prejudice.s ince we do not presume prejudice,and since respondents did not prove prejudice,the defense of laches fails.conti board of civil service commissioners,supra,cal d at.
having determined that there is no substantial evidence of laches,we turn to a consideration of the other issues raised by plaintiff with respect to her first cause of action.
community property claims real property 
plaintiff asserts a community property interest in decedent separate real property,based on the fact that the parties used community funds to improve the property.defendant challenges that assertion.first,he argues,plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement,because she consented to the use of community property funds to improve the property.in addition,he contends,she has no right to a pro tanto interest in the property.that contention rests in part on a claimed lack of legal authority and in part on the implication that plaintiff failed to plead such a claim against the estate.before addressing the parties specific contentions,we set forth the applicable legal principles,beginning with the standard of review.
standard of review 
questions of fact concern the establishment of historical or physical facts their resolution is reviewed under the test.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.thus,for example,a trial court finding that a particular item is separate or community property is limited to a determination of whether any substantial evidence supports the finding.in re marriage of dekker th,d.
questions of law relate to the selection of a rule their resolution is reviewed independently.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco,supra,cal d at.likewise,where mixed questions of fact and law require a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values,the question is predominantly legal and its determination is reviewed independently.citation.ibid,in re marriage of dekker,supra,th at,fn,d.
in this case,we apply the substantial evidence standard to the trial court factual findings as to the existence and character of the parties property.by contrast,the trial court determination of what legal principles apply is subject to our de novo review.
recovery of community property expenditures 
a.the rule and its extension to improvements 
when community property is used to reduce the principal balance of a mortgage on one spouse separate property,the community acquires a pro tanto interest in the property.in re marriage of moore cal d,in re marriage of marsden d.this principle is known as the rule.see generally,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,to kirkland et,cal.family law practice and procedure ed.division of specific property,to.the rule has been extended to cases involving separate commercial property.in re marriage of frick d.it has also been applied where the parties refinanced a separate residential mortgage during marriage.in re marriage of branco th,d.
until recently,however,no reported appellate decision had considered whether the rule properly extends to community expenditures for improvements to one spouse separate property.
last year,the third district court of appeal addressed that issue.see,in re marriage of wolfe th,d wolfe.after exhaustively tracing the development of the law in this area,the wolfe court discarded the gift presumption for such improvements.wolfe,supra,th at,d.as the court remarked there is little logic in a rule that presumes an unconditional gift when one spouse uses community funds to improve the other spouse property as we explained,our courts do not indulge such a presumption when community funds are used to assist in the purchase or to reduce an encumbrance on a separate asset.the application of community funds results in what amounts to of the asset.citations.there is no reason to presume a gift when funds are applied to improve separate property.id.at,d,original italics.
this year,the second district court of appeal,division two,also addressed the issue of improvements to separate property.see,in re marriage of allen th,d allen.agreeing with wolfe,the court rejected the notion that a wife consent to the use of community funds to improve her husband separate real property raises a presumption that the funds were a gift of the funds to the husband.allen,supra,th at,d.
in reaching its conclusion,the allen court reversed the trial court contrary determination.the trial court there found itself constrained by the holdings in two earlier cases,in re marriage of jafeman d.jafeman and in re marriage of camire d.camire.allen,supra,th at,d.both jafeman and camire indulge in the presumption of a gift of community property in these circumstances,but both cases also predate the moore marsden rule.allen,supra,th at,d.as the allen court noted,developments in family law have eroded the underpinnings of the gift presumption on which those cases rely.id.at,d.see also,in re marriage of gowdy d,hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra,concluding that camire is of questionable precedential value because it predates enactment of the statutory presumption that joint title acquisitions during marriage are community property.
as the allen court explained a spouse who consents to the use of community funds to improve the other spouse separate property does not necessarily intend a gift where community funds are used to make capital improvements to a spouse separate real property,the community is entitled to reimbursement or a pro tanto interest under the rule both because its rationale applies equally to the reduction of an encumbrance and to capital improvements,and also because the legal underpinnings of the alternative rule citation,have been destroyed by intervening changes in family law.allen,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.the rule is based upon the principle that where community funds contribute to the owner equity in separate property,the community obtains a pro tanto stake in the property citation.because contributions to capital improvements also increase the property equity value,moore rationale applies as well to capital improvements made to separate property.id.at,d,subd.a separate property contributions to the acquisition of community property include payments for improvements.
we agree that the rationale of the rule applies with equal force to capital improvements,as a matter of both logic and fairness.we therefore adopt the principles expressed in wolfe and allen.in doing so,we necessarily disagree with earlier cases,such as jafeman and camire,to the extent that they apply a gift presumption to expenditures for capital improvements to a spouse separate property.
application to this case 
having adopted the principles announced in wolfe and allen,we next consider how they apply in this case.
we first address defendant implication that plaintiff pleading does not support a pro tanto recovery.according to defendant,plaintiff seeks only reimbursement on behalf of the community.we do not read plaintiff complaint so narrowly.see code civ,liberal construction of pleadings.her prayer asks for a determination of the community property funds expended on decedent property and the increased value,and or reimbursement for said funds.in our view,that request adequately states an alternative claim for a pro tanto interest in the property.
we turn next to a consideration of the nature and extent of plaintiff entitlement to recovery.neither wolfe nor allen provides much guidance on this question,given the procedural and factual contexts in which those two cases were decided.
in wolfe,the wife sought limited recovery,asking only for reimbursement of her share of the cost of the community improvements to the husband separate property.wolfe,supra,th at,d.the wife there made no claim to any equity appreciation nor,apparently,did she assert a pro tanto interest in the husband property as a result of the improvements.ibid.the court agreed that the wife was at least entitled to of the amount expended on the improvement.ibid.given the nature of the wife claim,the evidentiary record,and the judgment below,the wolfe court found it unnecessary to remand for that determination.ibid.
in allen,by contrast,the appellate court concluded that remand was required.as the court explained it is premature to address the issue of the proper measure of the community reimbursement rights or pro tanto interest in the present case.because the trial court excluded evidence on the issue,it made no findings regarding the contested issues of whether community funds were in fact expended for improvements to the family residence and,if so,the amount of any expenditures.nor did it allow evidence on the issue of increase in value attributable to such expenditures.this is a difficult and complex issue,which we decline to address in a vacuum.while we do not believe the difficulty in calculating damages requires a different result citation,we remand for further factual development.allen,supra,th at,d.
in this case,the record is somewhat more well developed than in allen,but it is still incomplete.the trial record here includes plaintiff testimony that the improvements were funded with community property.defendant attempted to undermine that evidence with questions suggesting that some improvements were funded with money from decedent inheritance.but that attempt was unsuccessful,and defendant offered no evidence tracing any expenditures to separate property sources belonging to decedent,in re marriage of higinbotham d.based on plaintiff uncontradicted testimony,the trial court made a factual finding that certain improvements were made and paid for with community funds.in addition to evidence showing the source of the money used for improvements,the record also includes testimonial evidence of the amount of money spent on those improvements.by plaintiff estimates and recollection,the cost of the improvements totaled between and.but despite the fact that plaintiff testimony was uncontradicted,the court made no factual finding as to the cost of the improvements.similarly,the record includes undisputed testimonial no judicial the question of whether the improvements enhanced the value of the property.see wolfe,supra,th at,d,noting that improvements do not always enhance the value of an asset indeed,improvements may well diminish the value of property.finally,while there was a stipulation at trial concerning the sales price of the decedent separate real property in,the record contains no evidence of the value of that property as of the date of separation six years earlier 
given the evidentiary gaps in this record,remand is necessary for a factual determination of the nature and extent of plaintiff entitlement to recovery for the community property expenditures to decedent separate property.
if the trial court determines that the improvements to the trailer did not enhance the property value,plaintiff recovery will be limited to reimbursement of of the community funds spent on improving the decedent property.wolfe,supra,th at,d.
however,in the event that the court finds that the improvements contributed to an increase in the property equity value,the community will be entitled to a pro tanto interest in the property.allen,supra,th at,d.in calculating the community pro tanto interest,the following principles apply.first,the separate property estate is credited with both and appreciation in the value of the property.next,the community contributions to equity are considered.finally,the community interest in the property,expressed as a percentage,is multiplied by the appreciation in the property value during the marriage.we discuss each of those principles in greater detail below,with a focus on their application to this case.
first,the decedent separate property interest includes both and appreciation in the value of the property.see,in re marriage of marsden,supra,d at.appreciation as separate property,subd.a,acquisitions and profits as separate property,earnings and accumulations as separate property.in the factual context of this case,in order to remain faithful to statutory separate property precepts,we consider it appropriate to depart from the approach to appreciation in three respects.first,under the traditional rule,apportionment typically begins with the date of marriage.that rule makes sense in the context of monthly mortgage payments,which the community presumably begins making immediately.but in the case of community improvements,which may not begin immediately upon marriage,equity may dictate awarding the separate estate any market appreciation occurring before community improvements actually begin.for that reason,the separate property interest also might include any but equity increases,increases occurring between the date the parties married in and the date the community began improving the property.there is a second way in which our approach to appreciation departs from the traditional moore marsden formula the point at which separate property appreciation is recognized in the calculation.in moore,the court apparently assumed that all appreciation occurred during the marriage and it divided that appreciation between the separate property and community property estates according to their respective interests.in re marriage of moore,supra,cal d at.in marsden,the court credited the husband separate property estate with premarital appreciation,but it did not incorporate that premarital appreciation into its calculation of the respective separate and community percentage interests.in re marriage of marsden,supra,d at.here,however,we are dealing with improvements that began long after decedent initial acquisition of the some undetermined time after the parties were married.we are not dealing with a separate property loan extant at the time of marriage being partly satisfied by community payments,as was the case in both moore and marsden.until the community began improvements,all of the equity appreciation belonged to decedent as his separate property,as a result of his initial purchase of the property.in this case,that appreciation contributed more to the fair market value of the property than its acquisition cost did.in fairness,that appreciation should be credited to decedent separate property estate just as if it were an element of the acquisition costs.the third and final departure we take from relates to the valuation date.contending for the traditional valuation date,plaintiff argues that the property fair market value must be determined as of the trial than six years after separation in this case.we reject plaintiff contention.in the first place,the two cases she cites in support of that contention are distinguishable.see,in re marriage of priddis d,in re marriage of walters d.the cited cases were decided under former civil code section,subdivisions a and b see now,which involves the division of community property in dissolution proceedings.by contrast,this case involves an interest in separate property,which was adjudicated in a civil action against decedent estate.here,then,the relevant statute dictates crediting the separate property estate with appreciation.see,subd.a the earnings and accumulations of a spouse,while living separate and apart from the other spouse,are the separate property of the spouse.for these reasons,the right of the community to share in the property appreciation begins with the funding of improvements and ends as of the date of separation.
after crediting the separate property estate with the equity appreciation to which it is entitled,the next step is to consider the community contributions to equity.in this case,the community financial investment in the property took the form of improvements,rather than acquisition or debt reduction expenditures.for that reason,care must be taken to include only capital improvements,and then only to the extent that those capital improvements enhance the property value,in re marriage of moore,supra,cal d at,holding that it is improper to include mortgage interest and property taxes in calculating the community share since such expenditures do not increase the equity value of the property.and see,wolfe,supra,th at,d noting that improvements do not always enhance the value of an asset.furthermore,in this case,there may be reason to consider the value of the acreage separately from that of the home,if the improvements enhanced only the residence,allen,supra,th at,d noting the lack of evidence on the issue of increase in value attributable to such expenditures.
once the amount of the investment has been determined,the community interest in the property is calculated as the ratio of the community investment to the total separate and community investment in the property.in re marriage of moore,supra,cal d at,quoting bare bare d.that ratio,expressed as a percentage,is then multiplied by the appreciation in the property value during the marriage prior to separation.see,in re marriage of marsden,supra,d at.plaintiff would then be entitled to of the resulting amount as her community property share 
the principal effect of our holding is to put capital improvements on the same footing as expenditures for property acquisition or for mortgage reduction.in our view,as we explained,there are no meaningful differences among those three avenues of equity accretion and therefore no principled reason to distinguish among them.nevertheless,we recognize that our holding creates an apparent anomaly on another front.in effect,it puts community contributions to separate property on a different footing than separate contributions to community property.in the latter case,recovery is limited to reimbursement,without interest,subd.b separate property contributions to community property,if traced and unless waived,are reimbursed without interest or adjustment for change in monetary value.under our holding,by contrast,the investment of community funds entitles the community to share in the separate property appreciation,even if the fair market value has increased disproportionately to the increase in equity resulting from the community improvements.in re marriage of moore,supra,cal d at,quoting bare bare,supra,d at.in an inflationary real estate market,that entitlement may represent a tremendous boon to the community.when compared to the limited recovery for separate property contributions th
