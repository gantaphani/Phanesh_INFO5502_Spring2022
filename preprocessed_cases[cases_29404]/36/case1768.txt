petitioner tommy joe holmes claims that he is entitled to payments from an optional annuity elected by his deceased,linda ann mcwhorter,as part of her teacher retirement benefits.her son alan brad kent,who is the executor of her estate and only heir,joined by his cassie elizabeth kent as respondents,disagree.they argue,first,that mcwhorter designation of them as beneficiaries of her other retirement benefits covered the optional annuity as well or at least showed her intent that they receive the annuity,and second,that holmes and mcwhorter divorce decree divested him of all interest in her retirement benefits.the trial court granted holmes summary judgment.the court of appeals rejected the kents first argument but agreed with the second,thus concluding that while holmes was entitled to receive the annuity payments because his designation as beneficiary was never changed,after the divorce he had no right to retain the payments unless mcwhorter intended for him to have them if on remand it were shown that she had no such intention,a constructive trust should be imposed on the payments in favor of mcwhorter estate holmes petitioned this court for review.the teacher retirement system of texas has filed an amicus curiae brief arguing that the court of appeals decision will adversely affect thousands of trs retirees and beneficiaries.we reverse and render judgment for holmes.
trs allows a retiree to elect,instead of a standard service retirement annuity,an optional annuity that provides reduced payments to the retiree during her life and,at death,continued payments to and throughout the life of a designated beneficiary under this option,if the beneficiary does not survive the retiree,the retiree payments increase to those of a standard annuity,but only prospectively if the beneficiary survives the retiree,payments cease when the beneficiary dies only one beneficiary can be designated,and changing the designation is restricted since the value of the optional annuity,and hence the cost to trs,depend on the beneficiary longevity.statutory amendments in and allow a retiree who has designated a spouse as beneficiary a change or revocation if the spouse files a notarized consent or if a court in a divorce proceeding approves or orders the change or revocation trs is authorized to prescribe the form the retiree must use if the designation is revoked,the retiree receives the higher payments of a standard annuity going forward as if the beneficiary had predeceased the retiree.if the designation is changed,the new beneficiary receives payments for the shorter of his life or the original beneficiary life expectancy at the time the retiree retired thus,a change or revocation should not statistically increase and may actually decrease the cost to trs of the retiree original election of the optional annuity.
trs reads the statutory provisions strictly to require that a retiree submit the change or revocation to trs on a prescribed form and that the divorce court approval or order specifically direct the change or revocation a divorce decree general award of retirement benefits to the retiree does not,in trs view,satisfy the requirements.according to trs,these statutory requirements protect the trust fund from the claims of multiple beneficiaries that arise when there is uncertainty regarding the beneficiary of the benefits and the resulting costs of litigation.they also protect retirees and beneficiaries,trs argues,by providing a clear,certain system for assigning retirement benefits.
when mcwhorter retired in may at age after years of teaching,she elected an option annuity and designated holmes as the beneficiary.the trs form she signed correctly explained that she could not name joint primary beneficiaries of this optional annuity and that she would receive 
a reduced annuity payable throughout my life with the provision that upon my death of the reduced annuity shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to the person designated hereupon as primary beneficiary.if my primary beneficiary designated hereupon predeceases me,my annuity payment will increase to the standard annuity amount 
mcwhorter was also entitled to a payment at her death.
a year later,while going through a divorce,mcwhorter signed a trs form stating 
i hereby designate the following person s as my primary beneficiary ies to receive any payments which may be due under the teacher retirement system law of the state of texas following my death joint beneficiaries to share alike,with right of survivorship only alan brad kent and cassie elizabeth kent.
the form stated that w hen received by the teacher retirement system,this form revokes any previous beneficiary designation made by the member on a prescribed teacher retirement form.nevertheless,mcwhorter submission of the form did not meet the statutory requirements for a change in the optional annuity beneficiary because it designated two people,not one,and it was not accompanied by holmes notarized consent or a divorce decree ordering a change trs notified mcwhorter by letter that it had accepted the change for the death benefits but explained that to change the beneficiary of the optional annuity,she would be required to submit the appropriate form,which trs enclosed,and submit it with either holmes notarized consent or a c ertified copy of a court order from the court with jurisdiction over the marriage ordering the change.the letter added that by statute 
the new beneficiary is entitled to receive monthly payments for the shorter of either the remainder of the life expectancy of the original beneficiary designated at retirement,or the remainder of the new beneficiary life.
another year passed,and mcwhorter and holmes divorce became final.the decree awarded mcwhorter 
a ny and all sums,whether matured or unmatured,accrued or unaccrued,vested or otherwise,together with all increases thereof,the proceeds therefrom,and any other rights related to mcwhorter retirement benefits through the teacher retirement system,and any other plan,retirement plan,pension plan,employee stock option plan,employee savings plan,accrued unpaid bonuses,or other benefit program existing by reason of mcwhorter past or present employment.
the decree also divested holmes of all right,title,interest,and claim in and to such property and required that he execute all instruments necessary to effect this decree.
mcwhorter attorney submitted the divorce decree to trs and requested information concerning the current status of mcwhorter account and all available options which she might have with respect to payment of her retirement.trs responded in a letter,explaining in detail what it had on file for mcwhorter,the requirements for changing or revoking an optional annuity beneficiary,and the effects of each.the letter advised mcwhorter that trs would not accept the divorce decree as a basis for changing or revoking the beneficiary because it did not clearly order the change or revocation.the letter suggested that it might be possible for mcwhorter to have the decree clarified and set out decretal language it would accept.alternatively,the letter explained that mcwhorter could submit a notarized consent by her former spouse.the letter emphasized that mcwhorter would also be required to use prescribed forms,and it enclosed forms for revoking or changing the beneficiary and for a former spouse notarized consent.mcwhorter never complied with trs instructions.a little over a year later,she died.
mcwhorter will left everything to her son alan.in accordance with the beneficiary designations on file,trs made a payment to the kents and began making optional annuity payments to holmes of per month.the kents sued holmes for an order clarifying and enforcing the divorce decree,compelling him to execute whatever instruments trs required to transfer annuity payments to the kents,imposing a constructive trust on payments he received,and enjoining him from accepting future payments.the trial court granted summary judgment for holmes.the court of appeals held that mcwhorter designation of holmes as beneficiary of the optional annuity had not been changed because mcwhorter did not ful
