background 
jamie edelkind,a computer technology expert,married suzanne boudreaux in,who gave birth to their son,sage,in.the family lived primarily in atlanta,georgia,and edelkind operated his own business.they had a lavish lifestyle.edelkind and boudreaux separated as a precursor to divorce in,and they entered into a settlement agreement in.the settlement agreement required that,aside from a few months early on,edelkind would pay a month in child support.however,litigation over various aspects of the divorce and agreement ensued.see,edelkind boudreaux.on september,with the issues finally resolved,a georgia court entered a final judgment and decree of divorce in.it incorporated by reference the terms of the settlement agreement,and the decision was made retroactive to judgment.in the judgment,the court found edelkind in willful contempt of his child support obligations,and ordered him to repay his arrearage of plus of interest.the georgia court found that edelkind has wholly failed to pay any amounts as child support to boudreaux in the past five months while by his own testimony maintaining an affluent lifestyle and standard of living.
while litigation was pending before the georgia courts,in,boudreaux and sage moved to louisiana.edelkind lived in georgia until when he moved to massachusetts after marrying his new wife,linda,in.after boudreaux moved to louisiana,edelkind stopped paying child support.
in,edelkind sent a number of checks to satisfy his arrearage,all of which were returned for insufficient funds,and boudreaux sought assistance from the state of louisiana to obtain child support for sage.also in,edelkind declared bankruptcy,and boudreaux eventually received a check from the bankruptcy court amounting to.
edelkind continued to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in massachusetts with his new wife,with whom he had three children.he lived in a mansion,drove expensive cars,hired two nannies,and sent his children to private schools.he marketed himself as a technology expert who owned several important patents.while these assets,including the home and cars,were paid for using his wife name and accounts,edelkind was heavily involved in the management of their joint finances throughout this time,edelkind did not fulfill his child support obligations and evaded garnishment by opening up bank accounts without using his social security number.
boudreaux efforts to enforce the child support obligations culminated in a hearing in a louisiana state court for which both bordeaux and edelkind were present with counsel.at the hearing,edelkind testified about his earning capacity and work history.after examining the evidence and testimony,the louisiana state court found that i f edelkind would have conducted himself in an honest and forthright manner in his business and legal dealings,he would have no problem obtaining employment and thereby fulfill his child support obligations.the louisiana court entered a judgment in november judgment,holding that edelkind owed nearly in back child support,and would have to pay approximately a month from then on.to reach those sums,the louisiana court recalculated the amount owed,based on findings regarding edelkind and boudreaux earning capacities.in so doing,the court rejected a litany of edelkind excuses,including ongoing troubles with the securities exchange commission.the court found edelkind was in contempt of court for his wilful and contumacious violation of the orders of the court for failure to pay child support.it said the arrearages in child support are particularly egregious.it also found that edelkind has put all of his assets beyond his creditors,including his.based on these findings,the court sentenced edelkind to days in jail,unless he would make an immediate payment of.after that hearing,edelkind paid the,but after the hearing,he still did not consistently pay the child support that he owed.
on october,edelkind was indicted for willfully failing to pay child support in violation of,from december to the date of the indictment.in late november,the government moved for a continuance,asserting that it was still waiting for certain sealed records to be provided by the louisiana state courts,and that it was still verifying certain pieces of evidence.edelkind opposed this motion,but after a conference,the district court granted the motion.edelkind then got a new lawyer,and eventually moved for a continuance of his own,which was also granted.
at trial,the foregoing story was presented.the government also presented statements edelkind allegedly told the fbi when he was interviewed that edelkind tried to hide money from boudreaux by opening bank accounts without using his social security number,and that he received compensation of at least around to.the government also presented evidence that edelkind could use linda money as he saw fit,even though the funds were in her name.taking into account all of the support payments actually made by edelkind from january of forward,he owed nearly at time of trial.the only documented support that he voluntarily paid since was that he had a lawyer send.
after a series of motions,the case was tried before a jury,and edelkind was convicted.following trial,edelkind moved for a judgment of acquittal or new trial,which was denied.edelkind was sentenced to months imprisonment,the statutory maximum,and ordered to pay restitution of approximately.edelkind filed a timely notice of appeal.

statute of limitations 
edelkind contends that his willful failure to pay child support is not a continuing offense,and,consequently,he could have been convicted for acts that were outside the statute of limitations.the pertinent statute states that any person who wilfully fails to pay a support obligation with respect to a child who resides in another state,if such obligation has remained unpaid for a period longer than years,or is greater than is guilty of a crime.a.
the statute is subject to the general statute of limitations provided for under a,because section does not contain a specific limitations period.see united states monts,cir.edelkind argues that the crime is complete when the child support payments reach years or is greater than and the statute of limitations starts to run at that point.here,the payments reached at the latest,on october.edelkind argues that the statute of limitations period ended on october,and therefore the october,indictment was untimely.in response,the government contends that the violation is a continuing offense and a continuing offense,by its very nature,does not terminate until the date of the indictment or the voluntary termination of the illegal activity.united states,cir internal quotation omitted.according to the government,since edelkind has never fully paid his arrearage in child support payments,the offense terminated only at the date of indictment.
in united states brazell,cir,we stated,a defendant continual wilful failure to satisfy his child support debt constitutes a continuing offense.edelkind argues that brazell does not control this case for two reasons the statement is mere dictum and brazell concerned the application of a sentence enhancement for the continued failure to pay child support while on probation but this case concerns the statute of limitations period for failure to pay child support.see brazell,at.assuming arguendo that the language in brazell has only persuasive value,we still conclude that a is a continuing offense for statute of limitations purposes.
first,other circuit decisions that have directly addressed this issue in other legal contexts are in agreement with brazell that section a is a continuing offense.see,united states russell,cir ex post facto clause united states muench,cir venue united states crawford,cir venue.moreover,the majority of state courts that have addressed this issue agree that the wilful failure to pay child support is a continuing violation.see harvill texas,criminal nonsupport is a continuing offense.wisconsin monarch,these cases establish that the crime of nonsupport continues until the last date the defendant intentionally fails to provide child support that he or she is legally obligated to provide.the statute of limitations runs from that point.state james,state wood,see also toussie united states,d white,dissenting the continuing offense is hardly a stranger to american jurisprudence.the concept has been extended to embrace such crimes as embezzlement,conspiracy,bigamy,nuisance,failure to provide support,repeated failure to file reports emphasis added citing towns state,but see people monaco,holding,by a divided court,that michigan legislature did not intend the criminal nonsupport of children offense to be a continuing one 
second,the statutory language and congressional intent support a conclusion that a a violation is a continuing offense.see toussie,at.a particular offense should never be construed as a continuing one unless the explicit language of the substantive criminal statute compels such a conclusion,or the nature of the crime involved is such that congress must assuredly have intended that it be treated as a continuing one.the nature of a continuing offense is that each day acts bring a renewed threat of the substantive evil congress sought to prevent.id.at.from a plain reading of the statute,congress clearly intended the offense to be a continuing one.the statute punishes the failure to pay child support if such an obligation remained unpaid for a period longer than years,or is greater than.a emphasis added.congress thereby imagined the criminalized conduct to last continuously beyond a period or the accumulation over.
in addition to this statutory language,congress overriding concern when enacting the that resulted in was two continuing harms parents shirking the burden and the moral,legal and financial obligations to their own children and the negative effect on the custodial parents who must continually renew their tedious efforts to enforce support orders against parents.see,at t he burden of caring for these children will be placed on the shoulders of the it rightfully belongs.cong.rec,daily ed statement of roukema id.at statement of in many instances,women or men with custody who have to rely upon the civil process system time after time after time find that the parent that owes the money does not pay child support many times.see also cong.rec,daily ed statement of hoyer noting the effect of the law was to criminalize a person neglecting to pay his child support obligation for over six years.congress thereby intended the criminal penalties to prevent the continuous harm to the custodial parent and his or her child welfare that is renewed each day by the deadbeat parent daily failure to pay child support.it is the nature of child support that it typically arrives periodically to cover the living expenses of a child during the intervals between payments,so the failure to continue to make payments does bring a renewed threat of the substantive evil congress sought to prevent.toussie,at.moreover,congress intended the statute to penalize parents who intentionally flee across state lines so as to continuously evade enforcement of child support orders by courts,cong.rec,daily ed statement of hyde.congress thereby characterized a violation as an intentional and continual evasion of court processes,which is generally a continuous offense.see united states merino,cir.like those who flee and evade court processes,the consistent failure to pay ongoing child support obligations as ordered by state courts is a threat to the integrity and authority of the court,posed by a recalcitrant defendant who refuses to abide by lawful court orders.id.
furthermore,under edelkind theory,the crime is complete whenever is owed.under his theory,if a defendant owes,for example,a month in support,and refuses to pay,the crime is complete every single month.in one year,the defendant could conceivably be responsible for twelve separate crimes of,each carrying with it a potential sentence of up to months for a total of a months maximum.under a continuous offense approach,however,the defendant would only be accountable for one continuous crime involving losses of,and would be subject to just a month maximum sentence.congress clearly did not intend to attach lengthy for this crime,but merely wanted to use the threat of a maximum to create an incentive for deadbeat parents to fulfill their ongoing obligations to their children.see,cong.rec,daily ed statement of kohl 
against these authorities,edelkind argues that under toussie and united states irvine,a section a violation should not be deemed a continuing offense.toussie concerned whether the requirement to register for the draft constituted a continuing offense.in toussie,the government argued that the crime continued to be committed each day that toussie did not register,at,a proposition the court rejected.the draft registration statute did not,the court ruled,expressly make the crime continuing,and t here is also nothing inherent in the act of registration itself which makes failure to do so a continuing crime.failing to register is not like a conspiracy which the court has held continues as long as the conspirators engage in overt acts in furtherance of their plot.id.at.the fact that the first draft registrations clearly were viewed as instantaneous events,the registration period was limited to six days,and not a continuing process indicated to the court that there is nothing inherent in the nature of failing to register that makes it a continuing offense.id.
in irvine,t he defendant,clark irvine,wa s charged in the indictment,that on the day of december,as the agent and attorney of berkely,he wrongfully withheld from her the amount of her pension,to wit,and continuously withheld it until the time of finding the indictment in september.at.the question was whether constant withholding of the money extended the statute of limitations.the court held it did not,stating that w henever the act or series of acts necessary to constitute a criminal withholding of the money have transpired,the crime is complete,and from that day the statute of limitations begins to run against the prosecution.id.at.it is unreasonable to hold that twenty years after this he can be indicted for wrongfully withholding the money,and be put to prove his innocence after his receipt is lost,and when perhaps the pensioner is dead id.
these cases are distinguishable.unlike in irvine and toussie,the statute here,does clearly contemplate a prolonged course of conduct,toussie,at,as it typically takes many months,if not years,of missed payments to reach,and,in fact,the statute explicitly speaks of,in the alternate,a period longer than years,suggesting prolonged conduct.this is unlike cases where a single act such as withholding of a single pension payment,or failing to register within the period,is the basis for the crime,as the obligation and potential harm here constantly increases by the imposition of
