the los angeles county department of children and family services dcfs appeals from an order of the juvenile court requiring dcfs to make retroactive payments to a relative caregiver,maternal grandmother adela,for the benefit of the detained minor children,darlene born january,and twins ivory and issaiah born july,collectively referred to as children or respondents.dcfs contends that the order violates the separation of powers and that adela was required to exhaust her administrative remedies before a court could consider the funding issue.we agree,and therefore reverse the order.
factual and procedural background 
initial detention 
on october,the juvenile court detained the children from parental custody after dcfs filed a petition on their behalf.the detention and filing were based on allegations that the children had been exposed to domestic violence between their mother mother and the twins father,juan,and that mother had a history of substance abuse and had tested positive for methamphetamine on october.mother and juan lived with the children in the home of maternal grandmother adela until juan was asked to leave because he was abusive towards mother.
dcfs first detained the children on october.mother informed the dcfs social worker,marissa medina,that adela had always cared for darlene.the child had lived with adela since the age of one month because mother was incarcerated the child identified adela as her mother.when medina sought to detain all three children,adela offered to care for them.mother was willing to move out of the residence.the same day that medina received the necessary clearances,mother moved out of the home,and dcfs detained the children with adela 
efforts to obtain asfa funding 
the initial detention hearing was held on october.the court ordered that all three of the children be detained with adela t.the court set a jurisdictional hearing for november,and ordered dcfs to report on the status of asfa funding at that time.at the jurisdictional hearing,dcfs reported that the children were still living with adela however,when asked if the report addressed asfa,county counsel indicated that it did not.the court therefore ordered a supplemental report addressing the results of any asfa investigation that has been done and the status of the funding for any relative or non relative extended family member.the court set december,as the date it would receive the report.the december,date was then continued to january.
dcfs submitted a report for the january,hearing.the investigating social worker,alexander cisneros,completed an assessment of adela t.according to cisneros investigation,adela had no dcfs,child abuse,or criminal histories.she had known the children since birth,and had been residing with them and mother.she showed a strong commitment to the children and was willing to provide them a permanent home if reunification failed.she also expressed that she was financially capable of providing for all of the children needs.cisneros described the home as a,with front and rear yards and fencing.the conditions of the home seemed appropriate.adela daughter also lived in the home,as well as a nephew.
rosemarie ostoich,the asfa social worker,also conducted a home assessment,yielding similar results.ostoich concluded that the home met asfa standards,but only upon completion of a corrective action plan within days,including some repairs and.in addition,ostoich had to obtain clean livescan results for adela and the adult nephew residing in the home ostoich concluded that asfa approval was pending in order to obtain the results of further criminal clearances on adela and her adult nephew as well as completion of the corrective action plan.
as of january,adela informed dcfs that she had completed the corrective action plan and submitted to a livescan,but the results were still pending.cisneros attempted to contact ostoich to determine whether adela had completed all corrective measures,but had not heard back in time for the report submitted in january.the juvenile court continued the matter to february,and ordered dcfs to obtain asfa approval by that date.the court adjudicated the section petition,ordered the children dependents of the court,placed them in suitable care with adela,and ordered reunification services for mother and juan 
on february,dcfs still had not provided a report on the status of asfa funding.the court continued the matter to february,for dcfs to provide an update on the asfa evaluation.on february,dcfs requested a continuance so that it could comply with court instructions.dcfs reported that asfa could not approve the home because the adult nephew was undocumented and could not livescan without identification.adela had been instructed to seek funding from the department of public social services welfare department.the court continued the matter to february.
on february,with asfa supervisor joe chavez present,dcfs explained its efforts to obtain asfa approval.after the initial detention of the children,dcfs had referred the matter to its kinship support division,which received the referral on november.the same day,social worker ostoich was assigned to the matter.over the next two weeks,ostoich attempted to reach adela to schedule an appointment for a site visit,notified the primary social worker of the need for livescan results for adela and any other adult living in the home,and checked the criminal record system for livescan results,which were unavailable.on november,ostoich was able to schedule a site visit for december.adela informed ostoich that she had not yet submitted to a livescan ostoich advised her to submit to a livescan as soon as possible.
ten days later,on december,ostoich attempted to retrieve the livescan results,but there was still no record of them.ostoich also attempted to contact adela,but her telephone was disconnected.ostoich sent her a letter asking her to contact her primary social worker.ostoich also contacted the primary social worker to notify her that without livescan results the home could not be approved.the same day,ostoich sent a five day alert to adela primary social worker as well as her supervisor regarding the potential denial.
on december,ostoich again attempted to contact adela,but the telephone remained disconnected.in early january,adela made the repairs to her home necessary for compliance with the corrective action plan.however,on january,ostoich left a message for the primary social worker and her supervisor letting them know that she was unable to approve the home due to the fact that she was still lacking livescan results for adela and the adult nephew living in the home.on january,ostoich again checked the criminal record system,which yielded no results for adela or the adult nephew.accordingly,asfa approval was denied on january.
the juvenile court was upset about the lack of communication between the asfa social worker and the field social workers.it continued the matter to march.
on march,the adult nephew submitted to a livescan.it yielded negative results.initially adela had reported that the nephew was undocumented and did not have appropriate identification to submit to a livescan,but later told dcfs that he worked all the time and was unable to submit to a livescan.by the time the livescan was completed,asfa had already closed the original referral.dcfs submitted a new referral on march.
on march,dcfs reported to the juvenile court that it had received livescan results for adela submitted in october and the adult nephew submitted in march.neither had a criminal history.dcfs explained that on five prior occasions in november and december and january and february,adela had been advised by a social worker that her home would not be asfa approved until the nephew submitted to a livescan.adela initially told the social worker that she did not need financial assistance.however,in january,adela indicated that she was having financial difficulties and changed her mind about financial assistance.with the encouragement of her social worker,adela received public assistance through the welfare department for the month of february.
the court continued the matter to april,for asfa completion.at the april,hearing,dcfs reported on the new asfa referral,opened on march.the referral was assigned to social worker ostoich and the home appeared to meet asfa criteria.the court ordered that asfa approval be obtained by april.
on april,dcfs noted that adela was taking excellent care of the children.social worker ostoich had conducted another home assessment on april,but asfa approval remained pending.the court ordered azuzenna aguayo the current dcfs social worker,ostoich the asfa social worker,and chavez the supervising social worker to be present for the next court hearing on may.
on may,chavez reported that adela asfa home assessment had been completed and approved as of april.during the may hearing,the court went through the chronology of the case and stated its belief that adela home met asfa requirements on december.the court wanted to know if dcfs was sticking with their april date,to which county counsel answered yes.the court then set an order to show cause for sanctions osc as to why the court should not order retroactive funding.
osc proceedings and the court order for retroactive funding 
on may,chavez submitted another report which once again explained the chronology of the efforts to obtain asfa approval beginning on november.the report indicated that the files concerning prior referrals on adela had been ordered from archives on december,but that livescan results and the information on the prior referrals was not available when asfa approval was denied in january on february,adela had said that she really did not need the funding and that she would keep all three children if she could adopt them.chavez wrote that the kinship support division of dcfs had made a diligent effort to complete an assessment for the home of adela prior to the final approval as of april.
dcfs explained to the court that,the state regulations cite that an assessment should be completed within days or denied closed.the original referral remained open for about days with significant issues pending,and was denied on january.the new referral was not received until march.social worker ostoich made contact with adela within one week and a site visit within two weeks thereafter.dcfs also explained that,the regulations are that if a home assessment is denied the standards met date from that original referral can not be used for any subsequent referral.therefore,dcfs could not approve retroactive payments.the funding would begin as of the date of final.
the court nevertheless ordered retroactive payments from the date of detention october,without reference to any specific authority.the court explained that it was dcfs obligation to assess the home for safety if the home was not safe,dcfs should have removed the children from adela care.if it was safe,dcfs should have provided adela with funding at the outset.
on june,dcfs filed an application for rehearing,which was denied on june.on july,dcfs filed a notice of appeal,challenging the may,order for retroactive payments and the june,order denying the rehearing.along with the notice of appeal,dcfs filed a writ of supersedeas,which was denied by this court on july.
discussion 
standard of review 
dcfs presents a pure question of law whether the juvenile court acted in excess of its powers when it issued its order requiring dcfs to make retroactive asfa payments to adela dcfs argues that the court violated the doctrine of separation of powers and violated law which dictates that an applicant must exhaust her administrative remedies before a court may consider the issue of asfa funding.we review these purely legal issues de novo.redevelopment agency of the city of long beach county of los angeles th,d.
ii.applicable law 
subchapter iv,part e part e of the social security act et is the legislative source of child welfare funding.part e requires that states seeking federal financial participation for child welfare funding comply with specific requirements,subd.a.thus,if state and local child welfare agencies do not comply with federal requirements,they are not eligible for federal funding for foster care payments under part to ensure federal financial participation,california law requires that part e eligibility standards be met as a condition before any payment of benefits is made from either state or county funds.welf.in california,the agency responsible for administering the program under part e is the state department of social services dss.welf,providing that dss is the single state agency with full power to supervise every phase of the administration of public social services for which are received from the united states government or made by the state in order to secure full compliance with the applicable provisions of state and federal laws.
california law governing the detention of children under welfare institutions code section provides that,immediately following the placement of a child in the home of a relative the county welfare department shall evaluate and approve or deny the home for purposes of eligibility pursuant to section.welf,subd.d.
iii.adela was required to exhaust administrative remedies before a court could consider the issue of asfa funding 
dcfs position that the juvenile court order requiring it to make retroactive payments to adela violated the law is based on two arguments first,that the court action violated the doctrine of separation of powers,and second,that adela,as relative caregiver,was required to exhaust her administrative remedies before the juvenile court could consider the issue.
in support of its separation of powers argument,dcfs notes that dss is part of the executive branch of government.welf,et,et in administering and enforcing the program,dss and dcfs exercise the powers given to them by the legislature.the judicial branch of the government,therefore,has no authority to interfere with the performance of these duties,except as allowed through statute and by the administrative process.welf,et code civ,et,et dcfs cites in re ashley th,d,and in re harry th,d,as support for its position that the juvenile court may not interfere with powers that the legislature has specifically given to dss.
in addition,dcfs explains that title of the united states code,section a,requires a state plan that provides for an opportunity for a fair hearing before the state agency to any individual whose claim for benefits available pursuant to this part et is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.consistent with this federal requirement,california has adopted a system for a fair hearing,codified at welfare institutions code section et and government code section et.welfare and institutions code section specifically provides a request for a hearing,upon the filing of a request with dss,if an application for benefits is made and denied.
the hearing afforded by welfare and institutions code section is conducted by an administrative law judge or the director of dss.welf.if the applicant receives an adverse decision,he or she may request a rehearing within days of the decision.the director is required to grant or deny the request for rehearing within days the failure to act is deemed a denial.welf.
judicial review of the director final decision is governed by welfare and institutions code section,which allows applicants to file a writ petition with the superior court requesting review of the proceedings.the supreme court has held that when a hearing under welfare and institutions code section results in a decision adverse to the applicant,the exclusive remedy is to file an action for writ of administrative mandate in the superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section.green obledo cal d,fn.dcfs cites abelleira district court of appeal cal d,for the proposition that exhaustion of the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.dcfs further cites in re joshua cal th,d,joshua,as authority for its position that a juvenile court does not have the authority to order dcfs to make payments without an administrative determination of eligibility.
respondents do not disagree with dcfs position that the exhaustion of adm
