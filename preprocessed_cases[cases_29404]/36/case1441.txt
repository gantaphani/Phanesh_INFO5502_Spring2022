appellant,alvin,father,appeals determinations made by the juvenile court at a review hearing that he had been afforded reasonable reunification services in an attempt to regain custody of his son,alvin alvin,and that it would be detrimental to return alvin to his father home at that time.after review of the record,we conclude substantial evidence supports the findings of the juvenile court that the plan adopted for reunification was reasonable,father fully cooperated and complied with all aspects of the plan,and it would have been detrimental to return alvin to his father home at the time.but we disagree with the juvenile court finding that the los angeles county department of children and family services the department provided reasonable services to effectuate the plan.
the key to the original reunification plan was that father and alvin participate in conjoint counseling,but only after alvin had received eight sessions of individual counseling.the department effectively abdicated its responsibility to effectuate timely individual counseling for alvin,which precluded father from participating in conjoint counseling sessions with alvin.the juvenile court became aware of the delay and ordered that conjoint counseling proceed,when appropriate,even if alvin had not completed eight individual counseling sessions.the department again failed to take timely steps necessary to have father and alvin begin conjoint counseling.the resulting delay effectively precluded any meaningful visitation between father and alvin while the statutory time periods contemplated for completion of the reunification process were running.
we therefore reverse the finding of the trial court that reasonable reunification services were provided and affirm the other findings.
background 
alvin was first detained in at the age of seven,along with his,due to mother neglect.his parents,who did not live together,had joint custody of alvin at that time,pursuant to a order.alvin was released to his father,and in early,he was adjudicated a dependent of the juvenile court and placed in his father home under the supervision of the department.jurisdiction was terminated in mid with regard to alvin,and he remained with his father.
in july,when he was years old,alvin refused to return to his father home after visiting his mother,and ran away for a short time in order to avoid going back.he was again detained,this time in the home of his maternal grandmother,where his older had been placed under a permanent plan pursuant to welfare and institutions code section.the department filed a petition pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions a and b,alleging that father had,on numerous occasions over the past nine years,physically abused alvin by whipping him with a belt,causing welts and bruises on his body that father had allowed his girlfriend kimberly to physically abuse alvin by striking him with a belt and that father had allowed kimberly to use drugs in the home,in the minor presence.
adjudication was set for august.at that time,the court ordered the matter to mediation and continued adjudication to august.on august,pursuant to the mediation agreement,the parties agreed to the sustaining of an amended petition upon father plea of no contest,and they agreed to a case plan.the amended petition alleged more simply that father had on prior occasions,including in,physically disciplined the minor by hitting him with a belt,causing him unreasonable pain and suffering,and that father created a detrimental home environment by allowing kimberly to physically discipline the minor,placing him at risk of severe physical and emotional harm.allegations of bruises,welts,and drugs were eliminated.
father was ordered to be in counseling and attend parent education.the juvenile court also ordered that alvin undergo weekly individual counseling with a licensed therapist,and conjoint counseling with father when his therapist deemed it appropriate or upon court order,to be addressed after eight individual sessions.alvin was to continue to live with his maternal grandmother,and monitored visits with father would be allowed,to be liberalized in the department discretion.kimberly was not to be the monitor,and visits with kimberly would be allowed only with alvin consent.the department was ordered to provide reunification services.
a contested disposition hearing was set for october.on that date,however,the court was informed that the setting was in error,and disposition was not contested.disposition was therefore set over to october,and on that date,alvin was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court.
at the hearing of october,the court again ordered family reunification services.it also again ordered that father attend parent education and counseling,and that he and alvin participate in conjoint counseling upon his therapist approval or court order,after alvin completed eight individual counseling sessions.the court ordered the department to assist alvin caretaker in enrolling him in counseling,and to use funds under welfare and institutions code section,if necessary.monitored visits were again ordered,with alvin consent to be taken into consideration when scheduling visits,and kimberly was not to be a monitor.
the court then set a review hearing,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e,for april.father asked for an earlier,interim review hearing.he reported to the court that he would complete his parenting course the next day,and that he was in individual counseling,but was concerned that alvin had not begun his individual counseling.the court granted the request and scheduled a progress report for january.
on january,father reported that alvin had undergone just one counseling session,and asked the court to order that the eight initial sessions must be completed by the next hearing date,which was the review,scheduled for april.his attorney informed the court that father would be contesting the adequacy of reunification services at that time.
it also came to the court attention on january,that alvin had had no visits with father,because each month since october,alvin had expressed a desire not to see him,telling the social worker that he was not yet ready.the court therefore ordered that the minor be encouraged to visit with his father,and acknowledged that conjoint counseling was necessary for that purpose,stating,it looks as though until conjoint starts,this minor is not going to be willing to have visits.the minor attorney offered to speak to alvin and his grandmother about visits,and to confer with other counsel.
counsel for the department explained to the court why it had taken so long to get alvin started in individual counseling.maternal grandmother wanted a therapist close to her home,since she felt somewhat overwhelmed with two children engaged in activities in different parts of town.it took time to find a licensed therapist nearby and for maternal grandmother to take alvin to sign him up.counsel for the department explained,apparently,this was the only therapy center close to the maternal grandmother home.and so by the time she got around to doing it and by the time they signed it,it literally took that long.
the court suggested to the department that an explanation of the department reasonable efforts with regard to alvin counseling be included in its next report,and ordered that conjoint counseling begin as soon as alvin therapist deemed it appropriate,regardless of the number of individual sessions completed.
apparently unaware of that order,the social worker notes in his report prepared for the hearing of april,that in order for the minor to have completed sessions and for conjoint counseling to start,more time is needed.the court is respectfully referred to the attached letter from jules taitesel.in the attached letter,taitesel states that alvin had completed just three individual therapy sessions.there is no mention of conjoint therapy.the report explains that one session was cancelled for good friday,and others were not scheduled due to alvin transferring to a new school.thus,conjoint counseling had not begun.
the court found the report insufficient,ordered the department to prepare a full report,and continued the hearing to may.the report prepared for the hearing of may,states that alvin had completed five therapy sessions,but the social worker again expressed the belief that eight sessions were required before conjoint counseling could begin.it was also reported that alvin was no longer receiving tutoring services due to a lack of funding,but that he was adjusting well with his maternal grandmother,and had expressed a wish to stay with her.father was reported to be in compliance with the permanent plan and the court orders,including the completion of a parenting course the previous fall 
father therapist reported that father was ready to begin conjoint counseling.the department recommended that alvin placement continue unchanged,and that the court schedule a review pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f,for the following october.although it was not stated in the report,counsel for the department explained at the hearing that it was recommending that family reunification services be provided to father for an additional six months.
unhappy with his few visits and the lack of progress toward conjoint counseling,father again asked that the matter be set for a contested hearing.the court set it for june,and ordered that father have at least one monitored visits per week and that conjoint counseling begin immediately with the minor therapist.by june,the first conjoint counseling session had been scheduled for the following week.
alvin testified with regard to the whippings he received from father and kimberly when he lived with them,and how they made him feel that his father did not love him.he told the court that he did not want to go back to live with his father,because he was afraid that he would find himself in the same predicament,although he now believed that his father loved him,because he was fighting to get him back.
when asked if he would like to see more of his father,alvin replied that he did not really know.he testified that he was worried that if he went back to living with his father,he would not be permitted to see his mother as much as he is now,which is every weekend.that was most definitely not the only reason,however,that he did not want to live with his father.above all,alvin wanted to remain with his grandmother.he said,she gives me hope.and everybody else bribes me.i love my grandma.i want to live with her,plus my sister there.i want to stay with them.
social worker kent bennett testified that he was assigned to the case in july,and knew on october,that reunification services had been ordered,when he reviewed a copy of the court minute order of the same date.he said that the reunification services the department provided were based upon that minute order.
bennett admitted that he was mistaken regarding what allegations had been sustained.he had never seen a copy of the mediation agreement with the amended allegations,and he therefore continued to repeat the original allegations in each of his reports.after bennett read the mediation agreement to himself in court,he testified that he would not have done anything differently.
further,bennett testified that he thought that the present visitation order was appropriate,and he would liberalize visitation only in the discretion of the minor,or upon the recommendation of alvin therapist.bennett conceded that reunification would be very difficult without conjoint counseling.it was his belief throughout the proceedings,however,that alvin was required to have eight individual therapy sessions before starting conjoint counseling.he explained that it took so long to get alvin into therapy because he was on a waiting list,and when an appointment was finally made,it conflicted with maternal grandmother and the schedules.bennett testified that he was of the opinion that there was a substantial risk to alvin emotional if returned to his father at that time,because he did not want to live with his father.
father testified that he and kimberly had completed a parenting course,had learned disciplinary techniques that did not involve hitting.he had implemented the techniques with his other children,who pretty much adore him,and who jump into his arms when they see him.he did not want to force alvin to come home,but was unhappy that he had had only three visits with him,even though he had done everything required of him.
the juvenile court found that returning alvin to his father would create a substantial risk of detriment to his physical or emotional,making continued jurisdiction necessary the court found by clear and convincing evidence that father had complied with the case plan and that reasonable reunification efforts had been made,but ordered six additional months of reunification services.in addition,the court ordered that alvin remain placed with his maternal grandmother,and set a review pursuant to welfare and institutions code section,subdivision f,on december.father filed a timely notice of appeal from the order entered june.
discussion 
father contends that the juvenile court erred in finding that reasonable reunification services had been provided,and he contends that this court may,in its discretion,undertake an independent review of the evidence,because the facts are undisputed.he relies upon rosa superior court th,d,in which the appellate court exercised its discretion to consider an issue even though it may have been waived in the trial court,because the issue was purely a question of law.the issue there was whether a parent is precluded from receiving reunification services solely because she received months of services in a previous dependency proceeding where she successfully reunified with her child.id.at,d.the court did not hold that independent review of a contested issue is permitted whenever the evidence is not in substantial conflict.
when a finding that reunification services were adequate is challenged on appeal,we review it for substantial evidence.angela superior court th,d.in juvenile cases,as in other areas of the law,the power of an appellate court asked to assess the sufficiency of the evidence begins and ends with a determination as to whether or not there is any substantial evidence,whether or not contradicted,which will support the conclusion of the trier of fact.in re rocco th,d.even if there is no substantial conflict in the evidence,we must nevertheless draw all legitimate inferences in support of the findings of the juvenile court.id.at,d.
a finding that reasonable reunification services have been provided must be made upon clear and convincing evidence.in re monica th,d.when the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding or order is challenged on appeal,even where the standard of proof in the trial court is clear and convincing evidence,the reviewing court must determine if there is any substantial evidence that is,evidence which is reasonable,credible and of solid value to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.citations.in re jasmine th,d.
when applying the substantial evidence test,however,we bear in mind the heightened burden of proof.in re kristin th,d.under this burden of proof,evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.it must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.citation.in re monica,supra,th at,d.
the trial court found that reasonable services had been provided based on the attempt to get the child into counseling by january there is no question that it took so long,but apparently it was the grandmother,not the department.thus,the court found,in essence,that services were reasonable because alvin first appointment was accomplished within five months after the first order for individual and eventual conjoint counseling,and because the delay was caused by the grandmother.
visitation is an essential component of any reunification plan.in re mark th,d.to promote reunification,visitation must be as frequent as possible.in re luke th,d.where the minor is reluctant to visit,and family therapy is needed to promote visitation,such therapy may be critical to reunification.see in re nicholas t
