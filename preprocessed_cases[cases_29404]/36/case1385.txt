petitioner tracy mother is involved in a guardianship proceeding concerning her daughter,which was initiated by mother parents real parties in interest.mother contends respondent superior court violated her right to due process when it refused to provide her attorney with a copy of an investigation report and recommendation concerning the proposed guardianship,which was prepared by a court investigator pursuant to probate code section.mother asks this court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to give her or her attorney a copy of the investigation report and recommendation and any other report the superior court has or will consider in ruling on the guardianship proceeding.we issue the writ based on our conclusion the current probate court policy denying parties or their counsel copies of these reports rests on an erroneous interpretation of d.
facts and proceedings below 
in july,mother parents filed a petition to be appointed the temporary guardians of mother daughter.at an ex parte hearing a few days later,the superior court granted the petition and issued letters of temporary guardianship.mother parents also filed a petition to be appointed the permanent guardians of mother daughter.the trial court set a hearing on this petition for september.mother received notice of the latter petition and the september hearing date.
on september,mother went to the superior court and visited what she believed was the probate investigator office.she filed an opposition to the guardianship petition.she also asked a woman in the office if she could read the probate report.mother was referring to the investigation report and recommendation concerning the proposed guardianship,which a court investigator prepared pursuant to probate code section mother claims the woman denied her request to see the report,stating she did not know where the report was located.
the morning of the september hearing,mother counsel asked an unidentified person at the superior court if she could see the probate report.this person told counsel the report was unavailable.a few minutes later,the report was made available to counsel,but the court clerk said mother was not allow ed to read the report.mother counsel sat together with the attorney representing mother parents and quickly read the investigation report and recommendation minutes before the hearing commenced.
during the hearing,the superior court informed mother counsel it had not considered mother objections to the guardianship petition because mother had filed her opposition too late.the court continued the hearing to early november and ordered a report to be prepared by the department of children and family services dcfs the court ordered the temporary guardianship to remain in place until the next hearing.the parties worked out a visitation schedule for mother and her daughter.
before the conclusion of the hearing,mother counsel requested a copy of the probate report.the superior court responded as follows well,we do permit copies.however,counsel may review it and take whatever notes you wish to take,but because of policy and the existence very often in probate,investigative reports of statements made sic,the official report itself should not be copied.but you may certainly have as much time as you need to review it here in court.and you if you sic want to write notes,fine.if you want to write it out longhand,you know,it fine to help you.but we do release the report.
the court also informed counsel it would not provide her with a copy of the dcfs report.the court explained t he dcfs report will be made available to you that morning when you come to court.if you need more time,you can always hold the matter.you can review the report,and i hold it till sic the end of the calendar if you need more time than that.but counsel will not have to address any issue before the court without first seeing the report on that date,is all i can promise you.if you do see it the dcfs report,it means i have seen it either,because it has been provided.the court also explained,at the next hearing,the parties would have the choice of either arguing their case based on the reports and other information submitted to the court,or requesting the matter be set for an evidentiary hearing.
on october,mother counsel went to the probate department where the guardianship matter was being heard and asked to see a copy of the probate report.the clerk gave it to her,but said she could not take the report outside the department.mother counsel sat in the department for approximately one and hours and wrote down the whole report.she asked her secretary to type it up.counsel showed the report to mother.mother pointed to portions of the report she claimed were incorrect.
on november,the superior court held another hearing in the guardianship matter.that morning,mother counsel reviewed the dcfs report for the first time.the court continued the hearing to november.dcfs submitted another report to the court along with the results of ten drug tests.at the november hearing,mother counsel asked a dcfs case worker if she could have a copy of the report dcfs had submitted that day.the case worker declined to give counsel a copy of the report.according to mother counsel,the case worker said she would have given counsel a copy of the report if the matter were being heard in dependency court,but the rules in probate court were different than those in dependency court.
mother counsel informed this court,at the november hearing,the superior court terminated the temporary guardianship,ordered mother daughter be placed with mother,and set a trial on the guardianship petition for december.as of november,mother counsel had not yet had time to go to court and copy down longhand the two dcfs reports along with the results of the ten drug tests.the december trial was put over to january.on that date,after an conference the parties signed a stipulation settling certain of the issues.after the stipulation was filed,the court took the matter off calendar and reset a hearing on the petition,if necessary,for january.
discussion 
i.the case is not moot.
in a letter to this court filed on the eve of argument,respondent argued the case was moot and requested we dismiss the petition.the letter recited the then recent developments in the trial court mentioned above.respondent pointed out the court had decided to cancel the hearing for which the confidential reports at issue had been prepared and allow the daughter to remain with her mother.because petitioner access to these specific reports may no longer be needed or even relevant,respondent urges,this petition and its disposition are moot.
we disagree.in the view of this court,the case is not moot for two independent and sufficient reasons.
first,it is more than possible there will be future hearings in this very case at which similar confidential reports will be prepared and filed with the trial court.indeed the trial court scheduled such a hearing,if needed,for january.in addition,there is an ongoing possibility the department or some other agency or individual will initiate a new action claiming mother is no longer an appropriate custodian for her daughter.accordingly,it is not unlikely the issue of petitioner access to future confidential reports covered by this same code provision will in this same litigation involving these same parties.to require petitioner to initiate a new writ proceeding at that time and for this court to delay consideration of the issue until then would be wasteful of judicial if this court had not already researched and drafted an opinion and heard oral argument,as it has.
second,this is one of those issues we sometimes encounter where there is a continuing public interest in its resolution yet it is unlikely the issue can be resolved before it becomes moot.this is a widely accepted exception to the general rule courts should not decide moot cases.t he profusion of cases in which moot appeals have been decided in the public interest,makes it clear that mootness is not really a bar to production of a much needed advisory opinion in writ proceedings 
this writ proceeding presents an unusually strong case for application of the public interest exception.unless we consider and decide the issue hundreds if not thousands of future litigants in the same position as petitioner will continue to be denied copies of confidential reports important to the proceedings without knowing whether that denial is legal or constitutional.yet in most instances the hearing at which the petitioner needs the report will have taken place before an appellate court can consider and issue a writ.likewise,if we accept respondent invitation to find this case to be moot the probate court will be deprived of an appellate ruling on the issue of whether its current practices are legitimate.if so,a significant number of its current and future decisions might be overturned on appeal for procedural or constitutional error.
for either and both of the above reasons,we proceed to consider and decide this writ despite the fact access to the specific confidential reports in question is no longer an active issue.
ii.the current probate court practice of denying parties such as the natural parents copies of confidential reports or the opportunity to make photocopies of such reports is inconsistent with the terms of probate code section,subdivision d.
the parties focus their arguments on the issue whether the probate court interpretation of section,subdivision d section d comports with constitutional due process.for reasons explained below,we find it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue because we conclude the practice in question is not compatible with a proper interpretation of the statute.
we begin with the language of probate code section d 
the report authorized by this section is confidential and shall only be made available to persons who have been served in the proceedings or their attorneys.the clerk of the court shall make provisions for the limitation of the report exclusively to persons entitled to its receipt.italics added.
respondent offers three grounds for interpreting the above section to authorize the probate court practice of denying copies of dss reports to parents or their counsel.first,respondent contrasts the language of this section with the provisions in analogous dependency and family court proceedings which direct a copy of the report be served on the parent or parents ten days before the hearing.secondly,respondent urges these reports contain confidential information,particularly about the prospective guardian,thus warranting these uniquely restrictive practices.thirdly and most strongly,respondent argues the term receipt in the clause persons entitled to its receipt means only receipt of the information in the report and not the report itself.we have problems with all three of these justifications.
it is a far reach to imply from the provisions in the dependency and family court sections of the code requiring those responsible for preparing reports of this nature to provide or serve copies of same in those proceedings that the legislature intended to deny any release of copies of such reports in guardianship proceedings.if the issue in this case were to the effect the probate court failed to serve a copy of the report on petitioner or petitioner refused to comply with a request for such a copy until say instead of ten the hearing,respondent might have a point.it is fair to say the precise provisions of the dependency or family court processes do not apply to guardianship proceedings in probate court.but this does not mean the legislature intended or that the language of d permits the probate court to deny requests from parents or their counsel for copies of these reports.
nor do we find persuasive the contention these reports contain information so much more sensitive than that found in reports used in dependency court and family court as to require the far more restrictive measures the probate court has instituted.the reports prepared for dependency court proceedings,for instance,also present detailed and very personal information about natural parents,foster parents,potential and present guardians or adoptive parents,and the like.the code likewise designates most of the reports in these other proceedings to be confidential,and as such not available to the press or general public so there is nothing uniquely confidential about the reports in guardianship proceedings that would justify the uniquely restrictive policies the probate court has instituted,unless the legislature specifically authorized a special level of confidentiality for these documents.
this returns us to the language of d.it is true this provision requires the reports be confidential.but confidential as to whom that is,who is it the section seeks to deprive of access to the report the answer seems obvious the press and the general public including lawyers and parties involved only in other proceedings in probate court.but as the terms of the section make clear,it does not seek to keep these reports confidential from the persons who have been served in the proceedings or their attorneys.rather it specifically authorizes this defined category of persons to receive the reports.there is no dispute petitioner was served in the proceeding and thus,along with her attorney,is within the category entitled to the report as opposed to the category from which it is to be withheld.
respondent argues even this special group is only entitled to receive the information in the reports and not the reports themselves.but this interpretation runs contrary to the language the legislature employed.having defined the category of persons to whom the report is to be made available,the section then instructs the clerk to make provisions for the limitation of the report exclusively to persons entitled to its receipt.as a matter of grammatical construction and of logic,the pronoun its necessarily refers back to the noun report,not just the information in the report.indeed the words information in appear nowhere in d and courts generally avoid adding words to a statute when interpreting its meaning.websters dictionary,in turn,defines a recipient as one that receives and the term receives as to take possession or delivery of.consequently,this limited class of people is entitled to take possession of the physical report,not merely to borrow it long enough to copy a few passages or the entire report in long hand.
before the invention of the typewriter and carbon paper it would have been defensible to lend litigants in petitioner position the one and only original handwritten report and expect them to copy the report itself or salient portions in longhand.but we have gone far beyond that.in the era of photocopiers and scanners,to be a recipient of a document one must receive a photocopy or other duplicate original of that document.at a minimum,one must receive the original long enough to make such a copy through current means of electronic reproduction,and not be limited to handwriting a copy of the printed words.
we also find it noteworthy the probate court current policy is only calculated to achieve its presumed purpose as to some of those entitled to access these reports.that consists of those who can not afford to pay lawyers to spend hours copying the entire report or reports in who lack the time during court hours to do so themselves.the probate court current policy allows a party or a party lawyer to copy the entire report by hand,then transcribe it,and make as many photocopies as they want.so a more affluent party or one who has ample free hours during the court day can produce one or many copies of the confidential document.consequently,if parties or their lawyers are truly a threat to the confidentiality of these documents and their contents the probate court current policy would be destined to prove ineffectual in many cases,even were it consistent with the statutory language,which we do not consider it to be.
nor do we consider it possible to justify this disparate treatment of litigants on grounds those who ca afford lawyers or who work during the day or are disabled or illiterate are somehow more likely to breach confidentiality than those in a position to have thes
