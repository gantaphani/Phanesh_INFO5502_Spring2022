in february katia dunn was seized by city of elgin police officers acting pursuant to an custody order.katia and her mother,natasha dunn,brought suit against the city of elgin and the officers in the district court alleging that the seizure violated and caused serious emotional distress.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on all counts,and plaintiffs now appeal.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
on december,natasha and christian dunn were married in north carolina.less than two years later,christian abandoned natasha while she was pregnant with his child.natasha gave birth to katia dunn in november.because christian failed to provide support for natasha or katia,they moved from north carolina to illinois to be closer to natasha parents.
prior to leaving north carolina,natasha and christian appeared in a north carolina court to adjudicate katia custody.the north carolina court entered an order providing that christian would receive visitation during easter,christmas,and the summer.christian was also ordered to pay child support and contribute to katia medical expenses.furthermore,the order stated that the north carolina court would retain jurisdiction over future custody determinations.
christian failed to pay child support or medical expenses for katia.christian also did not appear for his first visitation during easter.natasha filed for divorce in illinois in december,and refused to allow christian to see katia when he came to illinois that christmas.as a result,christian filed a motion in north carolina seeking sole legal and physical custody of katia.
natasha received notice of christian motion in january.she retained a north carolina attorney for the sole purpose of obtaining a continuance and did not attend the hearing on february.the north carolina court denied natasha motion for a continuance and granted christian temporary exclusive care,custody,and control of katia.the court order contained the judge signature,the date,and a file stamp for rowan county,north carolina.it directed any and all law enforcement officers to serve and render any possible assistance to aid and assist christian in locating the minor child and delivering custody to christian.
early on the morning of february,christian went to the city of elgin police department.christian showed the north carolina order to sergeant mona mckinley.the order displayed no sign of having been filed in an illinois court.in fact,christian did not file the north carolina order in an illinois court because he did not want illinois to assert jurisdiction.after examining the order,sergeant mckinley informed christian that the elgin police could not enforce the order.sergeant mckinley also stated that the police would not physically remove the child from the home but that they could act in a peacekeeping capacity.sergeant mckinley then dispatched two officers to provide peacekeeping standby service for the child custody exchange.
pursuant to sergeant mckinley request,city of elgin police officers keith chrastka and jason lentz reported to natasha dunn home in illinois.officer chrastka examined the court order,realized it was not issued by an illinois court,and suspected it might not be enforceable.despite their instructions to provide standby service,officers chrastka and lentz told christian to wait in the driveway while they proceeded to the house.the officers repeatedly rang the doorbell and pounded on the door.when natasha came to the door,the officers told her that they were there to take katia pursuant to a north carolina custody order.natasha was told that if she refused to hand katia to the officers,they would take katia from her.although natasha told the officers that they could not enforce an order,officer chrastka replied that they were going to do it.officer chrastka further stated that there was nothing natasha could do to prevent katia from being taken.at that point,officer chrastka reached out and took katia.officer chratska carried katia outside and gave her to christian,who then drove away.
city of elgin police officers are told during training that standby service requires officers to keep the peace but to not take any other actions.furthermore,standard operation procedure number states that elgin police officers will not generally serve or enforce documents of civil process and that civil process is typically to be referred to the sheriff department.all were reviewed by all elgin officers during training prior to february.sergeant mckinley understood to mean that elgin police officers should not serve or enforce process documents.officers chratska and lentz also understood that elgin officers generally do not enforce civil documents.
natasha brought suit in the district court on her own behalf and on behalf of katia against the city of elgin and officers jason lentz,keith chrastka,and mona mckinley individually and in their official capacities.plaintiffs sought relief under and illinois law on the basis that defendants violated their constitutional rights and caused them severe emotional distress.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on all counts.plaintiffs now appeal the district court grant of summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs challenge the district court grant of summary judgment on three grounds.first,plaintiffs allege that the district court erred in finding that the plaintiffs could not show that the city of elgin violated by failing to train its officers.second,plaintiffs allege that the district court erred in finding that the officers were entitled to immunity from prosecution.finally,plaintiffs allege that the district court erred in dismissing their intentional infliction of emotional distress claim based upon the finding that the defendants conduct did not amount to extreme and outrageous behavior.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see dykema skoumal,cir.in doing so,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see id.a grant of summary judgment is proper if there no genuine issue as to any material fact such that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.tesch county of green lake,cir.
the plaintiffs first challenge the district court finding that the city of elgin is not liable under because there was no pattern of constitutional violations.we agree that plaintiffs were not required to prove a pattern of constitutional violations,as the district court held.however,plaintiffs claim still fails because they did not prove that the city of elgin failed to adequately train its officers.
a municipality can be found liable under if the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation.see monell dep t of soc,d.one example of this is where the municipality fails to provide adequate police training.however,inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for liability only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.city of canton harris,d.deliberate indifference may be shown in one of two ways.first,a municipality shows deliberate indifference when it fails to train its employees to handle a recurring situation that presents an obvious potential for a constitutional violation and this failure to train results in a constitutional violation.see board of county comm rs of bryan county brown,d robles city of fort wayne,cir.second,a municipality shows deliberate indifference if it fails to provide further training after learning of a pattern of constitutional violations by the police.see palmquist selvik,cir.
plaintiffs contend that the city of elgin showed deliberate indifference by failing to provide any training regarding standby service.they argue that because child custody disputes implicate protected constitutional rights,the city had a responsibility to instruct its officers on how to proceed with regard to custody orders.however,plaintiffs argument can not succeed because the city did adequately train its officers regarding standby service.first of all,the words standby service could arguably be considered clear on their face.if an officer is charged with merely standing by for peacekeeping purposes,extensive training should not be needed to educate the officer that he is not supposed to actively enforce orders.secondly,the officers were instructed in field training that standby service requires officers to keep the peace but not take any other actions.moreover,informed officers that civil orders generally should not be served or enforced by elgin officers.all of the officers in this case received training on,including,prior to february.
the fact that two police officers did not follow the policy set forth by the city of elgin is not enough to prove deliberate indifference by the city.rather,plaintiffs had to show that the city was aware that unless further training was given the officers would undermine the constitutional rights of others.see williams heavener,cir.there is no evidence to support this conclusion,and therefore plaintiffs can not proceed against the city under.
plaintiffs also challenge the district court finding that officers chrastka,lentz and mckinley are entitled to absolute immunity from plaintiffs claims.for the reasons stated below,we hold that the officers are not shielded by absolute immunity because they were following an order that was facially invalid.however,we also find that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitutional nature of their actions was not clearly established prior to this case.
both absolute and qualified immunity provide immunity from suit as well as immunity from liability.absolute immunity protects n officials whose official duties have an integral relationship with the judicial process.henry farmer city state bank,cir.absolute immunity is often described as quasijudicial immunity,because it derives from the immunity granted to judicial.see see also richman sheahan,cir absolute immunity is not primarily to protect the enforcement function performed by the deputies,but rather to protect the judicial function.because judges are not liable for their decisions,it is only reasonable to also immunize those acting pursuant to an official court order or who are enforcing a validly entered judgment.henry,at.qualified immunity protects governmental officers performing discretionary functions insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.unlike absolute immunity,qualified immunity will not protect knowingly unlawful or plainly incompetent acts.richman,at.
absolute immunity 
in this case,the district court found that the officers were protected by absolute immunity because the order did not in any way appear incomplete or invalid on its face and therefore the defendants only role was to follow the direction of the order.the defendants argue that the district court decision was correct because the order contained a judge signature,a date,and a north carolina file stamp as well as the order directing law enforcement officers to assist christian in gaining custody.we disagree.the absence of any indication that the custody order had been filed in an illinois court was enough to render it facially invalid.
it is axiomatic in our system of government that a state judge can not order an police officer to enforce its decisions.although the full faith and credit clause requires that states give effect to the judgments of sister states,it does not require that states adopt the practices of other states regarding the time,manner,and mechanisms for enforcing judgments.baker by thomas general motors,d.rather,the local law of the forum determines the methods by which a judgment of another state is enforced.restatement second of conflict of laws.therefore,the proper enforcement of a north carolina order in illinois is governed by illinois law.
under illinois law,foreign judgments do not become enforceable until they have been filed with an illinois court.see.comp.stat.comp.stat.c.illinois courts have explicitly held that a custody order issued by another state is not enforceable in illinois until a certified copy of the judgment is filed with an illinois circuit court.see gasaway gasaway,d,see also in re marriage of mauro,d.
here,christian chose not to file the north carolina custody order in an illinois court hoping to prevent illinois from asserting jurisdiction.this may have been logical,considering that illinois possibly had a superior jurisdictional claim under the uniform child custody act.see.comp.stat.comp.stat.however,this also rendered the north carolina order unenforceable in illinois.because the city of elgin officers were not acting pursuant to an enforceable order,they can not receive absolute immunity.
although the defendants are concerned this approach requires police officers to act as appellate courts,reviewing the legal validity of court orders before acting on them,our limited holding requires no such thing.illinois police officers are simply required to look for some indicia of authority from an illinois court before enforcing an order.orders entered by an illinois judge or marked with an illinois file stamp are sufficient to meet this requirement.the officers failure to perform even this minimal step to ensure that they had judicial authority,however,means that they can not now claim immunity.
qualified immunity 
even when they are not protected by absolute immunity,law enforcement officers typically receive qualified immunity for conduct performed within the scope of their official duties.see richman sheahan,cir.to determine whether qualified immunity is appropriate in a case,the court must decide whether the plaintiff has shown a violation of her constitutional rights,and,if so,whether those constitutional rights were clearly established at the time of the violation,such that a reasonable official would understand that what he was doing violates those rights.see morrell mock,cir.
plaintiffs claim a violation of their first,fourth,and fourteenth amendment rights.plaintiffs first amendment claim is without merit and need not be further addressed.plaintiffs fourteenth amendment claim is based upon the assertion that due process required that natasha receive notice and an opportunity to be heard in an illinois court before katia could be seized pursuant to an default order.this is in accord with our decision in morrell mock,cir.however,morrell also determined that this principle was not clearly established as late as,and therefore it would not have been clearly established in when katia was seized.see id.
plaintiffs fourth amendment claim is worthy of more extensive discussion.when determining whether a police officer conduct violates the fourth amendment,we must determine whether the conduct constitutes a search or seizure and,if so,whether the search or seizure was unreasonable.see donovan city of milwaukee,cir.for the purposes of this appeal,defendants have admitted that the officers conduct constituted a seizure.the defendants argue,however,that a seizure pursuant to a court order is per se reasonable.since we have already decided that the seizure was not pursuant to an enforceable court order,we therefore must decide whether a seizure pursuant to an court order that bears no seal of approval from the officers jurisdiction is reasonable.
defendants make much of the fact that their method of enforcing the order was appropriate.for example,they reported to plaintiffs house in full uniform and marked squad cars,showed her the order,provided her with the north carolina court dates,and allowed her to telephone her mother.however,the question at issue is not whether the method of enforcement was reasonable.rather,the question is whether it was reasonable for the police officers to believe they had the authority to enforce this court order at all.illinois rodriguez,d commenting that the constitutionality of a search or seizure pursuant to an invalid warrant is determined by examining the objective reasonableness of the officer belief that the warrant was valid.
we conclude that it was not objectively reasonable for the police officers in thi
