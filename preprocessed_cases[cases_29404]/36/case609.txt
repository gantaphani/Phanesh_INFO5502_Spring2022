petitioner appeals the denial of his petition to establish a parental relationship,as a third natural parent,with his niece child.the trial court ruled that petitioner met the statutory criteria of a presumed parent,but found the presumption was rebutted under the recently amended family code section,subdivisions c and d pursuant to section,subdivision c,the trial court found that recognizing only two parents child mother and biological father father would not be detrimental to child,and therefore ruled that,pursuant to section,subdivision d,an earlier filed judgment of parentage for child father rebutted petitioner presumed parent status.petitioner contends the trial court misinterpreted the statutory standard for evaluating detriment and thereby abused its discretion in finding there would be no detriment to child in denying petitioner parental status.
we conclude the trial court determination of no detriment under section,subdivision c appears to have derived from an improperly narrow construction of the statutory language,resulting in the trial court failure to consider all relevant factors under the statute.because the rebuttal of petitioner presumed parent status was contingent on the trial court evaluation of detriment under section,subdivision c,we will reverse the order denying the petition and remand for reconsideration.
statutory framework 
the uniform parentage act upa,specifically sections and,governs this action.the upa defines the p arent and child relationship as the legal relationship existing between a child and the child natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights,privileges,duties,and obligations,subd.b.the paternity presumptions of the upa are driven by state interest in preserving the integrity of the family and legitimate concern for the welfare of the child.in re nicholas cal th,nicholas.one purpose of the upa is to distinguish those who have demonstrated a commitment to the child regardless of biology and grant them the elevated status of presumed parenthood.th.
here,the trial court determined petitioner to be a presumed parent of child pursuant to section,subdivision d,which provides a person is presumed to be the natural parent of a child if the person receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child,subd.d.neither side contests this determination on appeal.the trial court found this presumption was rebutted,however,by clear and convincing evidence under section,subdivisions c and d a finding petitioner claims was erroneous for several reasons.
effective january,section,subdivisions c and d provide c in an appropriate action,a court may find that more than two persons with a claim to parentage under this division are parents if the court finds that recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child.in determining detriment to the child,the court shall consider all relevant factors,including,but not limited to,the harm of removing the child from a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.a finding of detriment to the child does not require a finding of unfitness of any of the parents or persons with a claim to parentage.d unless a court orders otherwise after making the determination specified in subdivision c,a presumption under section is rebutted by a judgment establishing parentage of the child by another person,subds.c,d.
in enacting the current version of section,subdivisions c and d the legislature made express findings a most children have two parents,but in rare cases,children have more than two people who are that child parent in every way.separating a child from a parent has a devastating psychological and emotional impact on the child,and courts must have the power to protect children from this harm.b the purpose of this bill is to abrogate in re th insofar as it held that where there are more than two people who have a claim to parentage under the uniform parentage act,courts are prohibited from recognizing more than two of these people as the parents of a child,regardless of the circumstances.c this bill does not change any of the requirements for establishing a claim to parentage under the uniform parentage act.it only clarifies that where more than two people have claims to parentage,the court may,if it would otherwise be detrimental to the child,recognize that the child has more than two parents.d it is the intent of the legislature that this bill will only apply in the rare case where a child truly has more than two parents,and a finding that a child has more than two parents is necessary to protect the child from the detriment of being separated from one of his or her parents.stats,ch.
ii.trial court proceedings 
petitioner initiated proceedings to establish parentage of child pursuant to sections,subdivision d and,subdivision c.petitioner is child biological uncle.mother is child mother and the respondent.father is petitioner.the court held an evidentiary hearing at which petitioner and mother were present.father was incarcerated at the time of the hearing and attended telephonically.
the following facts,established at the hearing on august,are not in dispute.petitioner and mother had been in a relationship for many years when mother conceived child.a separate paternity action,brought by mother,and genetic test established that father was child biological father.father abandoned mother during her pregnancy.he has been incarcerated for extended periods since child birth in total he has had approximately seven or eight hours of contact with child.mother has sole legal and physical custody of child,with no visitation to father.an unresolved child protective services cps case,which arose out of the brief window of contact between father and child,remained open as of the evidentiary hearing on petitioner parentage action.
aware that he was not the father,petitioner determined to raise child as his daughter.during mother pregnancy,petitioner accompanied her to prenatal appointments as well as parenting and birthing classes.petitioner was present and cut the umbilical cord at child birth in november.petitioner moved in with mother immediately after child birth and lived with mother and child for the first six months,during which time petitioner helped care for child.petitioner testified that he considered himself to be i n every way father.i helped feed,took turns with the middle of the nights,waking up,bonding,singing,goodnights.in may,petitioner moved to his own apartment but continued to see child on average three days and two to three nights per week.petitioner held child out as his daughter to all but a small set of family and friends who knew he was not the biological father.
in november,when child was about one year old,petitioner spanked child during a visit,leaving bruises.petitioner testified about the incident i made the mistake to spank my daughter i was completely unaware of my strength or her sensitivity.a few bruises were left,and quite an emotional scar on me once i saw the pictures.and cps was involved due to a mandated reporter.
mother noticed the bruising and called her counselor,who contacted cps.cps removed child from mother for several days.in the resulting investigation,cps found petitioner had caused the bruises which he admitted and had tested positive for illegal substances.cps returned child to mother custody subject to a case plan that prohibited contact between petitioner and child for six months.mother and petitioner adhered to the plan,during which time child lived exclusively with mother.after the no contact period and consultation with therapists,mother allowed petitioner to resume visitation in range of five to hours each week.petitioner visitation with child was ongoing at the time of the trial court hearing.mother and petitioner also have stayed in touch with a parenting coach or therapist for guidance on raising child.
mother testified that she would agree that petitioner has been the male role model in child life.child does refer to him as father,she stated.mother was aware that petitioner had issues including substance abuse but believed he was clean and sober until the november incident,when she became aware he had relapsed.as of the hearing,mother believed petitioner had regained and maintained his sobriety.
regarding the parentage action,mother testimony was that she absolutely acknowledges petitioner involvement and support of child in numerous ways,but is in a position where she is concerned that if she were to absolutely consent to this proceeding,that might affect her custodial rights in the future.due to the november incident,which left remarkable bruises on child,cps was very clear about the parameters of petitioner involvement,causing mother to feel very torn and afraid that even though she has continued to engage with the child therapist in hopes that she doing everything right by allowing child to resume a relationship with petitioner,at some point,some social worker can come into this picture and say,you know you should have been allowing for that,so we taking the child away.regardless of the outcome of the parentage proceeding,mother had no intention of keeping child from petitioner and would continue to allow visitation as long as he remained drug free.
father did not testify or interpose a viewpoint during the proceeding,except to disclaim at one point petitioner statement that father had shown no interest in being involved with child as a father.petitioner testified on the subject of detriment if he were denied parentage.he stated it was obvious to anyone who had seen them together that child recognizes me as dad that she asks for me up to several times a day in order to spend time together.petitioner described their bond as an emotional imprint of father and daughter,which would suffer if he did not have full authority to be there and have me legally and safely protect child if something were to go wrong if i do have those parent rights.petitioner also testified that if child was not a proper heir,he would not be able to name her for benefits,such as life insurance,and that if mother became incapacitated or unable to care for child,she would have no father figure to go with and would be at risk of entering the foster system,which is,number one,the most dangerous thing ever in all of our opinions as far as i been told.
mother testified she believed there would be no detriment if the court denied the parentage petition,because she had not and did not intend to withhold child from the petitioner.on,mother acknowledged that given child ties to petitioner,in that she knows him as her father in an emotional sense,it would be detrimental if that were taken from her.mother also acknowledged that if something happened to her,it would be detrimental to child if she went back to cps,but stated she did not know what would happen and would image sic it would be an uncle or a grandmother or sister.
in closing argument,petitioner,who was,objected that testimony about his purported drug use or relapse comprised accusations and hearsay and should not have been presented he argued the evidence presented by both sides showed he had satisfied the test to be determined a presumed parent pursuant to section,subdivision d.he pointed to the responsibilities he would have if granted parentage,including financial,and the fact that as a parent,he would be held accountable for any potential mistakes.he also argued that under the statutory scheme,being named a third parent would not impinge upon the rights of child mother or biological father.
the trial court stated its findings on the record.the court first determined that petitioner satisfied his burden of proof under section,subdivision d to establish himself as a presumed parent of child.the court then made findings under the clear and convincing standard of section,rebutting the presumption.the court found that recognizing only two parents,mother and father,would not be detrimental to child under section,subdivision c.the court reasoned there would be no harm from removing the child from a stable placement,because that removal had already occurred some time ago.based on this finding,the court concluded that pursuant to section,subdivision d,petitioner presumption of parentage was rebutted by the earlier judgment establishing father as a natural parent.
the trial court also made findings on specific factual issues.it credited mother testimony that she would continue to support the relationship between petitioner and child.it noted the possibility of consequences adverse to child best interest if the juvenile court were to consider mother actions to be inconsistent with the best interest of the child and it deemed unpersuasive petitioner assertions regarding his ability to name child as an heir or beneficiary,inasmuch as people can name whoever they want to as beneficiaries and can execute wills naming anyone to be heir of the estate.it similarly found unpersuasive the contention that child might be left without a parent if something were to happen to mother,because mother could name a legal guardian for child,assuming father was not then considered a fit parent to have custody.
the court denied petitioner petition to be recognized as a natural,third parent of child.petitioner timely appealed the court ruling following entry of the written order.
iii.discussion 
a.the trial court interpretation of stable placement under section,subdivision c and consideration of all relevant factors 
petitioner contends the trial court erred in interpreting the statutory mandate to consider the harm of removing the child from a stable placement as referring only to the living arrangement and not to the visitation or informal custody relationship between petitioner and child.by narrowly interpreting stable placement,petitioner contends the trial court failed to consider all relevant factors in evaluating the detriment child would suffer if she were removed from the stable relationship she has with petitioner.because the issue presented involves the interpretation of a statute and the application of that statute to undisputed facts,it is subject to this court independent review.city of saratoga hinz th,citing people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,international engine parts,feddersen cal th.
