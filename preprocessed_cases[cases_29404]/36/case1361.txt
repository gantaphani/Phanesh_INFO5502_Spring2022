introduction 
this matter arises after a judgment of marital dissolution was entered as to the marriage of brian and victoria davis.victoria appeals from a domestic relations order entered after brian brought an order to show cause with regard to the effect of a postdissolution enhancement of his retirement benefits on his obligation to pay spousal support.based on the nature of the retirement benefits at issue and the language of the judgment of dissolution,which incorporated the terms of the parties marital settlement agreement,the trial court ruled that brian spousal support obligation effectively terminated at the time he began participating in the enhanced retirement program.as we will explain,based on our independent interpretation of the relevant case law and the language of the judgment of dissolution,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the judgment of marital dissolution 
the parties were married on september.brian filed a petition for marital dissolution on january.victoria filed a response on january.on march,the parties filed a stipulation agreeing that brian would pay victoria per month as spousal support,pending further order of the court.brian employer was the los angeles city police department accordingly,the los angeles city fire and police pension plan was joined as an employee benefit plan claimant to the action for marital dissolution on december.
the parties reached a marital settlement agreement,which was incorporated into the judgment of marital dissolution entered february.therein,the parties agreed their date of marital separation was february.
brian began employment with the los angeles police department lapd on april.victoria has been employed by albertson since november.as part of their marital settlement agreement,they agreed that each would keep as their separate property all of their respective earnings after the date of separation.they agreed that victoria could keep as her separate property the pension benefits she had earned during the marriage.
victoria wished to keep the community property residence in newport beach the home contains a rental unit,which would provide supplemental income.this supplemental income was taken into account in determining the spousal support order and property division.to equalize the property division,the parties agreed that victoria would be awarded a reduced share of brian pension,percent rather than percent.in paragraph a,spousal support was set at per month commencing september,and continuing thereafter until the death of either party,the remarriage of victoria,or the date victoria receives the first payment that reflects her interest in brian pension,and the gross amount of that payment exceeds per month,whichever shall first occur,at which time spousal support shall terminate forever.in paragraph c,the judgment further provided neither the amount nor the duration of spousal support is modifiable under any circumstances,for any reason,and the court is without jurisdiction to modify the amount or duration of spousal support.in the event brian pays spousal support to victoria for a month in which victoria receives her interest in brian pension and the gross amount she receives exceeds,victoria shall immediately reimburse the spousal support she received for that month to brian.as to brian pension plan,the judgment provided in paragraph a brian pension plan,los angeles city fire and police pension system plan city safety xviii plan,shall be divided by a qualified domestic relations order prepared by attorney nancy bunn or other qualified preparer agreed to by both parties.the plan,which is fully vested,shall be divided to brian and to victoria,to equalize the division of community assets.
subsequent changes in brian retirement benefits 
shortly after the parties executed the stipulated agreement at the end of,brian retirement options changed.at that time,brian had been with the lapd for over years and had reached the maximum retirement available under his then current retirement tier,tier,percent of his final salary.on january,the city of los angeles department of fire and police pensions board the pension board offered eligible members the option of transferring from their current tier to tier,under which contributions to the pension plan could continue until a member reached years of services,rather than ceasing at years.tier allowed a member to retire at percent of his salary upon reaching years of service.brian elected this option,with the effect that it would increase both his and victoria monthly payments from his pension once he retired.brian reached maximum benefit retirement date,or years of service,on april.
on may,the pension board made available a second retirement option,the deferred retirement option plan the drop,for which brian was also eligible.the drop was intended to offer an incentive to officers who were eligible to retire to continue working for the lapd,as it was having difficulty recruiting new officers and retaining veteran officers.under the drop,eligible officers could retire and commence drawing their pensions while continuing to work and earning a salary for up to an additional five years.rather than actually receiving monthly pension payments,however,a drop account was created which would be credited monthly in the amount of the member pension payment.
according to materials distributed to members of the pension plan,the drop account is set up like a savings account within the pension plan.every month while the officer is in drop,his entire monthly service pension amount is deposited into his drop account.members would retire at the same percentage of their salary whether they chose the conventional retirement option or the drop option.the pension payment credited monthly to the drop account would receive annual cost of living increases and earn interest at the rate of percent per year.members could participate in the drop for a maximum of five years,but could leave service sooner 
upon discontinuing participation in the drop and terminating employment with the lapd,the member would begin to receive monthly pension payments based upon years of service and salary at the time of entering the drop,plus cost of living increases received while in the drop.at that time,members could receive the drop funds in a lump sum,or could elect to roll the funds over into a account.
under the drop,members are considered retired for purposes of pension calculations only.participants can no longer qualify a new spouse for survivor benefits,even though they continue to work for the lapd.no further service credit is earned during the drop participation period.participants in the drop have the same rights,privileges,and benefits as with active employment.drop account funds are not eligible for distribution until after actual as a sworn member of the fire or police department.
brian made the irreversible election to participate in the drop from its inception date,which was days after he reached his maximum benefit retirement date years of employment on april.thus,his ability to retire at percent of his salary was not impeded.he had planned to leave the lapd as of april,and obtain other employment,in order to augment his retirement income and purchase a home.instead,he decided to participate in the drop.
upon entering the drop,the monthly pension payment deposited into brian drop account was.victoria percent interest was,more per month than the spousal support award of per month.brian received two cost of living increases to his pension benefits after electing to participate in the drop,on july,and july.brian continued to make monthly spousal support payments,per month,to victoria throughout the time of his participation in the drop.
brian understood that victoria could not receive directly from the pension board her monthly interest in his pension from the date it commenced.prior to electing to participate in the drop,brian contacted victoria and offered to pay to her monthly her share of his pension benefits from his separate property earnings from the time the pension benefits commenced being credited to his drop account,in exchange for her agreement that because he would be advancing her share that the entire drop account would be designated as his separate property.victoria did not agree to the proposal.
bunn prepared a qualified domestic relations order qdro,but brian did not agree to its provisions.his attorney sent a letter to attorney bunn on april,advising her of his disagreement,noting that the qdro allowed victoria to accumulate her share of brian monthly pension payments in the drop account concurrently during the months he paid her spousal support without providing for reimbursement of these pension payments as purportedly required by the stipulated judgment.no agreement could be reached between the parties.
commencement of the proceedings now before us 
on september,brian filed an order to show cause seeking declaratory relief concerning the proper language of the qdro,and with regard to whether he should pay victoria her share of his pension and thereby terminate spousal support.
victoria filed a responsive declaration in opposition on december,requesting that the court file and certify the qdro previously drafted,and deny brian request for relief.she filed a supplemental memorandum of points and authorities on january.victoria filed a proposed qdro with the court on february.
brian filed a reply to the opposition on february,now acting in propria persona.
the matter was heard on march.victoria asserted that brian was not retired,and therefore the relief he sought should not be granted.the court stated that the evidence indicated brian status with the lapd was retired.finding further clarification regarding the drop was necessary,the court continued the hearing to april.victoria attorney requested that the city attorney present testimony at that time.
on april,victoria filed additional documents.on the same date,brian filed a supplemental declaration in response.
on april,deputy city attorney mary jo curwen testified.thereafter,the trial court found that brian service pension is entirely community property and that all funds in his drop account constitute his service pension entitlement accordingly,the court awarded percent of brian service pension to victoria.however,it further ordered brian to make an loan to victoria of deductible dollars a month.and then once she collects the drop money,then she pays him back for each month that she got.the court requested that the city attorney prepare a domestic relations order in keeping with the court ruling.
on june,the court entered the domestic relations order.it provided that brian service pension is entirely community property.all funds in brian drop account constitute brian service pension entitlement.further,of brian service pension is hereby awarded to victoria as her separate property and that any allowable cost of living adjustments shall be made applicable thereto that of brian service pension,including any allowable cost of living adjustments applicable thereto,is awarded to brian as his separate property.finally,at such time as drop account proceeds become payable to brian and victoria,claimant is hereby ordered to make the following adjustment in the parties respective interests in these drop proceeds and to make payment to the parties accordingly claimant shall deduct the sum of per month from victoria share of the drop account for each month in which victoria share of the drop account exceeds the per month that brian paid to victoria as spousal support,which sum shall then be credited by the plan to brian share of the drop account the deduction shall be a fixed sum no adjustment on account of cost of living increases or related to interest payable to the drop account and shall be by the plan for any partial month of entitlement.this adjustment shall be considered an adjustment in the respective community interests of the parties based upon the provisions set forth in the last sentence of paragraph c of the judgment and shall satisfy victoria obligation to brian arising therein.
victoria filed a notice of appeal from that order on august.
discussion 
characterization of the drop benefit 
we begin by discussing whether the drop account is accurately characterized as community property,or as brian separate property.while other california cases have considered the characterization to be given to different forms of enhanced retirement benefits,none have specifically involved a drop benefit.
we review de novo the issue of the characterization to be given as separate or community property to the enhanced retirement benefit at issue here.because its resolution requires a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values,the determination in question amounts to the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law.in re marriage of lehman cal th,d.we conclude based on our independent review that the trial court correctly determined that the drop benefits at issue here were community property.
in re marriage of lehman,supra,cal th,d,lehman,involved a voluntary retirement incentive vri retirement program,under which an employee of pg e was given the option of being credited with three putative years of service and enjoying a waiver of the normal actuarial reduction of percent for taking early retirement.the employee retired under the vri program,and his sought an order determining that she owned a community property interest in his retirement benefits as enhanced.id.at,d.the supreme court granted review in order to address the issue of characterization of retirement benefits as community or separate property under a defined benefit retirement plan.specifically does a nonemployee spouse who owns a community property interest in an employee spouse retirement benefits under such a plan own a community property interest in the latter retirement benefits as enhanced id.at,d,italics added.the supreme court answered the question in the affirmative.
the supreme court explained the right to retirement benefits represent s a property interest to the extent that such a right derive s from employment during marriage before separation,it comprise s a community asset lehman,supra,at,d,quoting in re marriage of brown cal d.the right to retirement benefits is a right to draw from a stream of income that begins to flow on retirement,as that stream is then defined.italics added.lehman,supra,at,d,quoting in re marriage of cornejo cal th,d,and citing in re marriage of gillmore cal d,and in re marriage of brown,supra,cal d at.the stream volume at retirement may depend on various events or conditions after separation and even after dissolution.citations.such events and conditions include both changes in the formula citations,and also changes in the basis on which the formula operates citations.lehman,supra,at,d.the stream volume at retirement may turn out to be less than feared,or to be even more than hoped for.ibid.that the nonemployee spouse might happen to enjoy an increase,or suffer a decrease,in retirement benefits because of postseparation or even postdissolution events or conditions is justified by the nature of the right to retirement benefits as a right to draw from a stream of income that begins to flow,and is defined,on retirement citations,with the nonemployee spouse,at one and the same time,holding the chance of more citations,and bearing the risk of less citation,equally with the employee spouse.because the nonemployee spouse is compelled to share the bad with the employee spouse citation,he or she must be allowed to share the good as well.id.at,d.
the employee spouse is free to change or terminate employment,to agree to a modification of the terms of employment including retirement benefits,or to elect between alternative retirement programs in a word,he or she is free to define the nature of the retirement benefits owned by the community.citation.but regardless how the employee spouse might choose to exercise such freedom,the nonemployee spouse owns an interest in what he or she chooses by owning an interest in the community.citation.it follows that a nonemployee spouse who owns a community property interest in an employee spouse retirement benefits owns a com
