lived with paternal grandmother for the first part of her life.this arrangement ended when paternal discovered mother had been stealing from her.mother kept the child from the paternal relatives for about eight months,but for the past few months she had permitted them to take the child on weekends.the paternal relatives stated the child was always dirty and injured when they visited her.the paternal grandmother stated told her the bruise under her eye occurred when mother punched her.paternal grandmother stated mother parents were also drug addicts.
was placed with her maternal great aunt.at the detention hearing,the court found father to be presumed father.on march,a social worker sent an incarcerated parent packet to father.the packet included blank paper,addressed,postage paid envelopes,a suggested reading list,and two chapters from a parenting handbook.the social worker advised father to attend parent education classes and any counseling services available at the prison.

in her april report,the social worker changed her recommendation for father from reunification to no reunification services.her recommendation was based on father admission that in he was sentenced to four years in prison,which meant he would be incarcerated for one more year,and was two years old at the time of detention.the social worker stated the bond could not be very strong because father had been incarcerated for most of young life.
in addition,the social worker opined the prognosis for this family was poor.it is unfortunate that both mother and father were both foster children at one time and the cycle has continued.mother seems too young and immature to fully appreciate the meaning of being a responsible mother and has emotional issues father stated that he was deeply involved with gangs,but is no longer involved with them.the undersigned has no way of knowing if this is true,but at the time of his gang involvement,father was not considering the fact that he was married and had a child.father is also young and has emotional issues from his past,but this is not the child fault and the child deserves a permanent home,free of drug abuse and gang violence.
on april,the court found the petition to be true and ordered ssa to provide reunification services to mother and father.father case plan required him to participate in counseling upon his release from prison.while incarcerated,father was to participate in any available inmate service programs to facilitate reunification,including drug treatment,parent education,vocational training,and counseling.

the social worker mailed father additional stamped envelopes because he had consistently remained in contact with the social worker and.she also sent him a book on parenting by the boys town organization.father reported the materials were helpful,and he requested more literature on child development and parenting.visited father once a month.the social worker concluded father cooperation with the case plan had been substantial,but qualified this by also stating father had substantial compliance with visitation,although limited participation in services due to being incarcerated.
the review hearing was continued to november.the social worker prepared an addendum report on november,changing her recommendation.she suggested the court terminate reunification services and schedule a permanency hearing under section hereafter hearing 
in her report,the social worker did not explain the specific reason for the change of recommendation,but rather reported on the following series of facts.father had called the social worker to reiterate his desire to reunify with when he was released at the end of.father stated he would like to receive more reunification services.the following day,the social worker spoke to mother,who relinquished her parental rights.mother indicated she would like the maternal great aunt to adopt mother did not want the paternal relatives to have contact with 
the paternal grandmother told the social worker she would like more visits with.she stated father was scheduled to be released in august,but it could be sooner due to good behavior.the social worker opined father and the paternal relatives had expressed a great deal of love for,and they were interested in being involved in her life.father often wrote to the social worker about his hopes to reunify with 
the social worker also noted was a happy,girl.appeared to be loved and well cared for by the maternal great aunt and her husband.they were interested in adopting her.
the court held a contested review hearing on november.counsel presented argument on whether father had made substantial progress with his case plan.father counsel noted the parties stipulation contained the finding father made substantial progress with his reunification plan.father requested visitation be extended from one hour to three hours with minor counsel stated the finding of substantial progress was based on a social worker prior report and it was erroneous,because,father has complied with any one component of his case plan besides visitation.
counsel for ssa joined in the statements made by minor counsel.she added father had certainly acquired job skills as a firefighter while in custody,and he had been visiting,but there was no evidence the child could be returned to his care in six months because he will still be incarcerated.because the case was moving towards a hearing,ssa did not believe an increase in visitation would be appropriate.
before ruling,the court asked father counsel to point to specific evidence in the record on which there could be a finding of substantial progress with the case plan.counsel pointed to father training as a firefighter,his efforts to become a better man,his consistent contact and commitment to,his correspondence with the social worker,his demonstration of taking responsibility,and his of parenting and child development.father counsel stated the social worker finding of substantial compliance was based on father extraordinary efforts in light of the limited resources available.
the court stated that after looking at the list of causes necessitating placement,the finding of substantial progress must relate to father efforts to alleviate or mitigate those specific issues.the court reasoned father actual progress with respect to the original problems of drug usage and violence was minimal.the court modified the stipulated proposed orders and findings by striking substantial and checking the box titled minimal.the court terminated reunification services and scheduled a hearing for february.
father timely filed a petition for writ of mandate cal.rules of court,rule,challenging the court factual findings for lack of substantial evidence.father asserts he did all that he could do while incarcerated.he contends the only reason the social worker changed her recommendation regarding his services was because mother decided to relinquish her parental rights.we find the court order is supported by substantial evidence and the court did not abuse its discretion in discontinuing father reunification services.
applicable law 
f amily preservation is the first priority when dependency proceedings are commenced.citation.to that end,w hen a child is removed from a parent custody,the juvenile court ordinarily must order child welfare services for the minor and the parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family.citations.in cases like the instant one,where the child is less than three years old and reunification services have been ordered,the court shall inform the parent or guardian that the failure of the parent or guardian to participate regularly in any treatment programs or to cooperate or avail himself or herself of services provided as part of the child welfare services case plan may result in a termination of efforts to reunify the family after six months,subd.a,italics added.whereas services are presumptively provided for months to children over the age of three and their parents,subd.a,the presumptive rule for children under the age of three on the date of initial removal is that services shall not exceed a period of six months from the date the child entered foster care,subd.a see in re christina th.the unique developmental needs of infants and toddlers citation justifies a greater emphasis on establishing permanency and stability earlier in the dependency process in cases with a poor prognosis for family reunification.citation.superior court th.
the status of every dependent child in foster care shall be reviewed periodically as determined by the court but no less frequently than once every six months,subd.a.the third paragraph of section,subdivision e,requires a specialized inquiry at the review for children like,who are under the age of three years on the date of the initial removal and are not being returned to the custody of their parents at that time.for such dependent children,if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent failed to participate regularly and make substantive progress in a treatment plan,the court may schedule a hearing pursuant to s ection within days.if,however,the court finds there is a substantial probability that the child may be returned to his or her parent or legal guardian within six months or that reasonable services have not been provided,the court shall continue the case to the month permanency hearing,subd.e,italics added,supra,th at.
thus,there are two distinct determinations to be made by trial courts applying the third paragraph of section,subdivision e.first,the statute identifies specific factual findings failure to participate regularly and make substantive progress in the treatment plan that,if found by clear and convincing evidence,would justify the court in scheduling a hearing to terminate parental rights.but this inquiry does not require the court to schedule a hearing the court may schedule a hearing,subd.e,italics added see in re jesse th,the statute makes clear that the court has discretion to set a section hearing at the review hearing under specified circumstances italics added.instead,it authorizes the court to set such a hearing if the required findings have been made,supra,th at.
the second determination called for by the third paragraph of section,subdivision e,protects parents and guardians against premature hearings.notwithstanding any findings made pursuant to the first determination,the court shall not set a hearing if it finds either there is a substantial probability that the child may be returned to his or her parent within six months or reasonable services have not been provided to the parent,subd.e.in other words,the court must continue the case to the month review if it makes either of these findings.however,the court is not required to set a hearing even if it finds against the parent on both of these findings.the parent is also entitled to continued reunification services with any necessary modifications if the court makes either of these findings in favor of the parent.citations,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
reunification services for incarcerated parents are specifically governed by section,subdivision e,which provides,the court shall order reasonable services unless the court determines,by clear and convincing evidence,those services would be detrimental to the child.in determining the existence of detriment,the court is to consider several factors,the likelihood of the parent discharge from incarceration within the reunification time limitations described in subdivision a,and any other appropriate factors.ibid.in ordering services for incarcerated parents,the court must consider what is available to that parent in determining the content of reasonable services,the court shall consider the particular barriers to an incarcerated,institutionalized parent access to those services and ability to maintain contact with his or her child,and shall document this information in the child case plan.ibid.thus,a parent may be required as part of their service plan to attend counseling,parenting classes,or vocational training programs if access to those services is provided.
we review an order terminating reunification services to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence.citation.in making this determination,we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders.citation.we do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent judgment,but merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.citation.kevin superior court th.
when was taken into protective custody,father was incarcerated.the trial court determined reunification services would not be detrimental to despite the social worker initial recommendation father not receive services because his minimum period of incarceration put him well beyond the six month period for a child under the age of three such as to which reunification was limited.ssa changed its recommendation before the disposition hearing,and the court ordered services for both parents,adopting the social worker case plan.
the services provided to father as an incarcerated parent were reasonable,and father does not allege the reunification case plan provided to him was unreasonable.the social worker sent him appropriate materials,and after investigating the services available in his institution,tailored a suitable case plan.as documented throughout the record,the fire camp offered excellent vocational training but could not offer father any meaningful resources.the social worker reported father had no access to drug treatment,counseling,anger management to address his issues with domestic violence,or a parenting class.but under section,father was not expected to participate in services that were not available.it is undisputed that,as required by his specifically tailored case plan,father took advantage of the vocational services offered,kept in consistent contact with the social worker and,and engaged in a course of parenting with materials supplied by the social worker.we conclude he substantially complied with the case plan offered to him.he clearly exhibited a strong commitment to his daughter regardless of the barriers he faced as an incarcerated parent.we commend him for making such a strong effort to turn his life around,away from a criminal gang lifestyle,and towards becoming a responsible and better man.
while father great strides in personal growth will certainly serve him well after his release from custody,it is simply not enough to compel reversal of the court orders.father substantial compliance with his case plan must not be confused with the requirement a parent make substantial progress towards reunification with a old child within the statutorily prescribed time period of six months.the one finding does not automatically compel the other.
as reasonably determined by the juvenile court,there was no evidence father made more than minimal progress with respect to alleviating or mitigating the problems that led to detention,namely drug abuse and domestic violence issues.the review hearing was held over eight months after detention,two months past the statutorily prescribed six month reunification period for a child age.unfortunately,father place of incarceration prevented him addressing the serious problems that led to detention.indeed,there is simply no evidence from which the court could reasonably conclude father,following his release from prison in august,could be able to safely care for while remaining sober,staying out of the gang,maintaining employment,and not engaging in domestic violence in front of 
simply stated,father case plan compliance,while commendable,was not enough to justify making wait any longer for the mere possibility of reunification with her father in the distant future.this conclusion goes to the heart of father appeal.how can substantial compliance with a reunification plan not be enough evidence to warrant an additional six months of reunification services we can certainly appreciate father frustration because he did all that was asked of him given the limitations presented by his incarceration.we can also understand why father feels ssa is to blame for setting him up for failure given the unavailability at his camp of counseling and programs he needed to reunify with 
we believe it was ultimately the juvenile court application of the statutory scheme that created these seemingly unfair circumstances.we appreciate there is ample and familiar case authority holding incarcerated parents must generally be provided reasonable services.see in re brittany th,go to prison,lose your child is not an appropriate legal maxim in most circumstances in re jonathan th,distance of prison can not be sole factor in denying services or visitation,overruled on other grounds in in re zeth cal th,subd.in determining reasonable services,court must take into consideration particular barriers to an incarcerated parent access to services.
as aptly noted by one treatise,seiser kumli,california juvenile court practice and procedure b,page hereafter seiser,there is also a statutory provision authorizing courts to deny services to incarcerated parents and it is one of the underutilized dependency provisions.section recognizes that mandating services for incarcerated parents in some cases may be detrimental to the child.in deciding the issue of detriment,the court considers many factors,including the age of the child,the period of incarceration,the nature of the crime,the services offered in custody,and the likelihood of the parent release within the reunification time limits,subd.e.
we agree with and embrace seiser conclusion that there are many cases in which the provision of services has little or no likelihood of success and thus only serves to delay stability for the child,particularly if the incarcerated parent is the only parent receiving services.this is especially true when the parent will be incarcerated longer than the maximum time periods for reunification efforts.it is also frequently true when the parent is incarcerated in a facility that has no services sufficient to help the parent work toward reunification and there is no reasonable way to provide services to that parent.indeed,to attempt services in such circumstances may be setting everyone up for failure,including the parent,agency,and child.thus,in cases such as these,it may be possible to show that providing services to the incarcerated parent would be detrimental to the child since it would delay permanency with no likelihood of success.juvenile courts and attorneys for social services agencies and children should carefully consider the question of whether providing services to an incarcerated parent would be detrimental to the child and should utilize this provision to deny services when appropriate.seiser,supra,b,to,italics added.
this statutory provision should have been applied in this case.for reasons not clearly apparent in this record,ssa withdrew its recommendation to deny father services,and the court approved the proposed case plan for both parents.of course this ruling can not be reviewed in this appeal at this late date,but the error necessarily affects our consideration of the court decision at the review hearing held pursuant to section denying father additional reunification services.moreover,we hope pointing out the error will serve to remind the court and attorneys to carefully consider in future cases whether providing services to an in
