background 
plaintiff father,john woolard,established the john woolard present interest trust in for his infant son.plaintiff was the trust sole beneficiary and defendant,the settlor brother,agreed to serve as trustee.the terms of the trust permitted defendant to distribute the income and principal of the trust for the sole benefit of plaintiff.the trust provided that payment of income or principal to a minor 
may be applied directly in the sole discretion of the trustee for the benefit of such person or may be made to any one or more of the following a directly to such beneficiary b to the legally appointed guardian of such beneficiary or c to a custodian under the uniform gifts to minors act in any jurisdiction.
the trust agreement allowed defendant to loan any part of the trust property to any person other than plaintiff father or entity upon adequate security and at current interest rates.
plaintiff father initially funded the trust with,but at one point it contained over.when plaintiff father died in,the value of the trust was approximately.it is uncontested that between and,defendant distributed more than to plaintiff father,including over in one period.defendant kept no record of the purposes for which the funds were distributed and never requested or received any receipts from plaintiff father indicating how the funds were benefitting plaintiff.defendant claims he believed the distributions were being applied for plaintiff benefit,but does not deny that he made the disbursements without any specific knowledge regarding how plaintiff father would use the funds.
the district court held that distributing funds to plaintiff father was an express violation of the terms of the trust.the court also found that defendant failure to keep any substantive records regarding the purposes of the distributions violated his duties under the illinois trusts and trustees act.finally,the district court held that defendant breached his fiduciary duties by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that the trust assets were used according to the trust purpose and solely for plaintiff benefit.because a trustee who breaches the terms of a trust agreement is personally liable for any losses that result from the breach,judgment was entered against defendant in the amount of the wrongful distributions plus interest.grot first bank of schaumburg,d,citation omitted.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,defendant argues that the district court erred in finding the distributions to plaintiff father violated the terms of the trust,that the district court ignored an exculpatory clause in the trust agreement providing for trustee liability only in the case of bad faith,and that there were adequate records of the trust activity.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.darst interstate brands,cir citations omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the record in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.darst,at citation omitted.illinois law governs defendant liability in this diversity action.
distributions to plaintiff father 
defendant first claims that distributing the trust assets to plaintiff father complied with his duties as trustee.defendant argues that the trust agreement granted him discretion to distribute funds to plaintiff father and that the illinois trusts and trustees act endowed him with authority to distribute funds to plaintiff father as an adult relative of the minor beneficiary.defendant also contends that since plaintiff father had a legal duty to support his son,it was appropriate to distribute the funds to plaintiff father and it should be presumed that plaintiff benefitted from the funds.plaintiff contends that this case turns simply upon a violation of the express and exclusive terms of the trust,which did not allow for distributions to his father.
it is axiomatic that the limits of a trustee powers are determined by the instrument which creates the trust.stuart continental.bank trust,citations omitted.when a trustee fails to administer a trust according to its terms,a breach of trust results.northwestern mut.life ins.wiemer,d,citation omitted.when a trustee breaches a trust agreement,whether wilfully,negligently,or by oversight,he is liable for any loss to the estate resulting from the breach and must place the beneficiaries in the position they would have held had the breach not occurred.grot,at citations omitted.
the trust agreement provided that distributions to a minor 
may be applied directly in the sole discretion of the trustee for the benefit of such person or may be made to any one or more of the following a directly to such beneficiary b to the legally appointed guardian of such beneficiary or c to a custodian under the uniform gifts to minors act in any jurisdiction.
none of the money was distributed directly to plaintiff and there was no legally appointed guardian or custodian.defendant contends that the district court ignored the provision allowing distributions to be applied directly in the sole discretion of the trustee for plaintiff benefit.defendant argues that by giving money to plaintiff father he was directly applying the money for plaintiff benefit.defendant position is that it was a direct application of funds for him to give money to plaintiff father and for plaintiff father to then give that money likely without defendant knowledge to colgate university,for example,to pay for plaintiff college tuition.this proposal can not be accepted.the existence of an intermediary makes it impossible to characterize this transaction as a direct application of funds.defendant can not find justification for the distributions within the terms of the trust agreement.
defendant next contends that the distributions were permitted by the illinois trusts and trustees act.the act grants a trustee authority 
t o distribute income and amounts of principal in such one or more of the following ways as the trustee believes to be for the best interests of any beneficiary who at the time of distribution is under legal disability or in the opinion of the trustee is unable properly to manage his affairs because of illness,physical or mental disability or any other cause 
a directly to the beneficiary 
to a duly appointed guardian of the beneficiary 
c to a custodian for the beneficiary under the uniform transfers to minors act 
d to an adult relative of the beneficiary 
e by expending the money or using the property directly for the benefit of the beneficiary and the trustee is not required to see to the application of any distribution so made and 
f to a trust,created prior to the time the distribution becomes payable,for the sole benefit of the beneficiary and those dependent upon the beneficiary during his or her lifetime,to be administered as a part thereof 
ilcs.defendant focuses on paragraph d,allowing distribution to an adult relative of the beneficiary.were it applicable to this case,paragraph d would provide authority to distribute the trust assets to plaintiff father while plaintiff was a minor,and thus under a legal disability.however,the trusts act merely establishes a set of default rules applicable when not in conflict with the terms of a trust agreement.the act provides 
a person establishing a trust may specify in the instrument the rights,powers,duties,limitations and immunities applicable to the trustee,beneficiary and others and those provisions where not otherwise contrary to law shall control,notwithstanding this act.the provisions of this act apply to the trust to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the instrument.
