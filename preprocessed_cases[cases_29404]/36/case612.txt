single mother of the five minor children involved in these cases,appeals from orders of the marin county juvenile court transferring these dependencies to contra costa county and denying a motion to reconsider that decision.all parties acknowledge the court erred by transferring the cases without considering whether transfer was in the children best interests.nonetheless,respondent marin county health and human services department the department asserts we should affirm the transfer orders because contra costa children family services contra costa cfs is now providing services and returning the case to marin county would further delay the dependency proceedings.we are not so persuaded.the orders are reversed and the cases remanded to marin county.
background 
at the time of these events,the children ranged from to years old.the family lived primarily in marin county from around until they moved to richmond in.
mother for years has struggled with abusive relationships,homelessness and unemployment.although child welfare records show a lengthy history of referrals alleging general neglect and physical,emotional and sexual abuse,the current dependencies represent the first time petitions were filed on behalf of the children.
in late mother lost her job and was evicted from her richmond home for nonpayment of rent.after plans for a new home fell through,mother stayed with the younger children in motels while the oldest daughter,year old nia,moved in with a maternal aunt.by january mother had exhausted her resources and could not find a shelter that could accommodate her and her family.unable to provide care for her younger children,mother asked contra costa cfs to place year old aaliyah,year old spencer,year old sidney and year old skylar in foster care while she pursued employment and stable housing.
contra costa cfs placed the four younger children in foster care and filed petitions alleging mother failure to protect and inability to provide support for all five children.all five children were detained.the court ordered two supervised visits per month and ordered contra costa cfs to refer mother to substance abuse treatment and parenting education.on march,mother admitted the allegations after the petitions were amended to delete an allegation that she was unwilling,as opposed to unable,to provide for the children care.the court sustained the petitions as amended.
an april,memorandum from contra costa cfs reported that mother had obtained transitional housing in marin county and expected to soon secure a studio apartment where she could live for up to two years while she looked for more permanent housing with space for her children.she had identified several resources for individual and family counseling,reconnected with advocates and resources she believed would help her with reunification,and was working intermittently through a temporary employment agency.aaliyah,skylar and sidney had been placed together in a foster home in solano county.spencer was in foster care in san joaquin county due to behavioral problems,while nia continued to live with her aunt in richmond.mother was confident that services in marin would be immensely helpful as she works to have her children safely placed back in her care.mother was also able to demonstrate key insights into her family dynamics,including mental health and behavioral needs,and identified areas where she is most in need of assistance.visitation was going well.
on april,contra costa cfs filed a disposition report.the social worker recommended that the court order family reunification services for mother and transfer the case to marin county.mother was participating in voluntary services including step meetings,counseling,and alcohol abuse education in marin.she expected to secure a studio apartment in marin through the next key program.
despite serious concerns about mother housing situation and her ability to cope with her children emotional problems,contra costa cfs reported that mother had proven herself to be a very strong advocate for her children and has been proactive in identifying services to help them,particularly spencer and sidney.prior to the children placement in foster care,she had them enrolled in appropriate schools,was in receipt of wraparound services and appeared to make good use of the resources available to her and the children.she has decided that it would be in her children respective best interests to move back to marin county,where services are more readily available.she is currently residing in novato,california and has already begun looking into community based social service and counseling organizations that will be able to provide services to her and the children.mother is very eager to resolve the family problems so she can have the children placed back in her care and the bureau contends that her receipt of family reunification services in her current county of residence is in the children best interests.
on april,the contra costa court transferred the matter to marin county.the marin county court noted marin was mother county of residence,accepted the transfer on may,and continued the case for a case plan review.
on june,the department asked the marin court to transfer the children cases back to contra costa county because it had recently discovered that this case is sensitive,meaning that a county employee has a familial relationship to some of the parties involved,which renders the department unable to continue to render services.an expedited hearing was held the following day.the department explained it had discovered that one of its employees was related to three of the children through their deceased father and had been contacted by a family member seeking information about placement.marin county social worker rosie hernandez explained that the department has a strict policy requiring transfer of any case when someone in the office is related to the child or children involved.
mother strenuously opposed the transfer,which she argued would create hardship for her and the children.she explained that she was living,working and participating in voluntary services in marin,so i f it goes back to contra costa,i would have to turn down work assignments,lose income and stability in order to meet the court obligations in martinez.nor was there any evidence that the proposed transfer served the children best interests.contra costa cfs had failed to provide adequate services before the initial transfer,and once the cases were sent to marin it caused further delay by failing to provide the department with case information.only one of the children,year old nia,was living in contra costa county,and none of them had contact with the side of the family purportedly related to the unidentified department employee.moreover,nearly two months after the transfer to marin m other still does have a case plan here or been provided with any services,and now it going to transfer again,and that going to result in yet another delay in services it could take any length of time for contra costa county to actually accept the transfer,to assign a worker to it,and she just going to be back in the same place that she was almost two months ago,which was not in a good position,this case was not in good condition when it came to our county in the first place.
the department did not dispute any of mother characterizations of events.its position,rather,was that its policy of transferring sensitive cases was compelled by concerns about possible breaches of confidentiality.the court agreed.it explained i think under the structure that at issue,confidentiality,the court the court is not going to leave the case in marin.i uncomfortable with some of the information that i heard in terms of an individual there at the department,now having been identified,that that that bothers me.but it would be much more of a larger problem if confidentiality if the risk of confidentiality was not removed,and the only way it appears to the court that i can remove that risk is return it to contra costa.the court urged the department and contra costa cfs to provide mother with appropriate services to relieve some of the
