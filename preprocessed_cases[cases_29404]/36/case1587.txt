this appeal raises an unsettled question under the interstate compact on placement of children icpc,et does the icpc prevent a california court from ordering visitation between a dependent child and his parent where a previous icpc evaluation found the parent home unsuitable for placement under the circumstances of this case,we conclude it does not.
the alameda county social services agency agency successfully petitioned this court for a stay of a juvenile court order allowing respondent emmanuel to visit his father home in florida for days at the end of august,during christmas holidays,and for four weeks during summer.we issued a writ of supersedeas and ordered expedited briefing of the appeal.we conclude the icpc does not bar visitation with a parent,and the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the visits were in emmanuel best interest therefore we affirm the visitation order.
background 
emmanuel and his brother gabriel live with their mother,beatrice,in oakland,california.in november,the agency filed a petition under welfare and institutions code section based on the mother alcohol abuse and emmanuel and gabriel were temporarily detained,first in foster care and then with their mother in a residential treatment program.at the dispositional hearing,the juvenile court declared emmanuel and gabriel dependents of the court and ordered their care,custody,control and conduct to be under the supervision of the social services agency,but permitted them to reside with their mother.thereafter,the agency has provided family maintenance services to the boys and their mother.welf,subd.a.the boys father,elijah,lives in florida with his girlfriend rebecca,their infant daughter,and rebecca son.
although the agency stated in each of its status review reports that it had not been in contact with elijah,on april,the juvenile court granted emmanuel request to visit his father in florida.a caseworker scheduled this visit to last from june or through august.however,on june,the caseworker told emmanuel mother she had received a negative oral report about elijah from florida child welfare authorities,and so she planned to ask the court to reconsider the order authorizing emmanuel visit.later that night,elijah arrived in oakland,and the mother allowed emmanuel and gabriel to return with him on a plane to florida.she explained to the caseworker the following day that she believed it was in the children best interests to visit their father.unsuccessful in her attempts to contact elijah,on june,the caseworker obtained an ex parte arrest warrant for emmanuel and gabriel and sought the aid of the florida police and child welfare office in bringing the boys into protective custody.florida authorities removed emmanuel and gabriel from their father home nearly a month later,on july,and the agency caseworker flew to florida and returned the boys to california on july.the children were placed in an emergency foster home on the night of their return and brought to a court hearing the following morning.at that hearing,the caseworker recommended that emmanuel and gabriel be removed from their mother and criminal charges be filed against both parents however,the court ordered the boys returned to their mother home.
at a review hearing on august,the juvenile court appointed counsel for elijah and ordered that an icpc study be undertaken for him.the agency then submitted interstate compact placement request forms with the florida department of children and families to assess the suitability of elijah home for placement of emmanuel and gabriel.emmanuel expressed a desire to live with his father however,florida denied the icpc placement request based on elijah extensive criminal record and past history with florida child welfare authorities.when the agency caseworker reported this result at a review hearing,the court directed her to resubmit the request and ask florida to elaborate on the reasons for its denial.the caseworker agreed and suggested the court also consider a visit of one or both of the children,say,during the summer at the next review hearing,however,the agency opposed emmanuel request to visit his father,contending that florida denial of the icpc placement request indicated potential danger to emmanuel during even a short visit.the court commissioner continued the hearing for one week,until june,to review the full icpc report from florida.
elijah and rebecca traveled by bus from florida to attend the june hearing.at this hearing,the commissioner heard extensive argument about the icpc and emmanuel requested visit from counsel for the mother,father,emmanuel and gabriel who had separate representation,and county counsel.only county counsel opposed visitation.the commissioner concluded he had authority to order visitation despite the icpc placement study and,finding visitation to be in the child best interest,approved a day visit for emmanuel to begin immediately.county counsel obtained an immediate stay of the commissioner order to seek rehearing.code civ.
rehearing commenced before a superior court judge on july.after hearing testimony from the agency caseworker about the aborted june visit and argument about the applicability of the icpc to emmanuel requested visit,the court took the matter under submission.on august,the court ruled that under controlling california law,the icpc does not apply to a minor visit with a parent in another state the icpc study assessing the suitability of elijah home for placement did not preclude a visit and the visit was in emmanuel best interest.accordingly,the court approved an immediate visit for emmanuel in his father home for the few remaining days of summer vacation via air transportation to be paid by the agency and also approved holiday visits and a visit in summer.the court denied county counsel motion to stay the visitation order,and county counsel immediately sought a stay from this court and petitioned for a writ of supersedeas.we issued a temporary stay of the august,order,granted the petition for writ of supersedeas,and ordered expedited briefing of the appeal.
discussion 
icpc does not apply to visitation in this case 
the icpc is an agreement among california and other states that governs sending,bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption,subd.b.the purpose of the icpc is to facilitate cooperation between participating states in the placement and monitoring of dependent children.tara superior court th,d.article defines placement as the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill,mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character,and any hospital or other medical facility,subd.d.in re johnny th,d,footnote omitted.
with regard to conditions for placement,article of the icpc mandates no sending agency shall send,bring,or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein,subd.a.before any child can be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption,the sending agency must give written notice to appropriate authorities in the receiving state,subd.b,and authorities in the receiving state must confirm that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child,subd.d.
in construing these provisions,california courts have concluded the icpc does not apply to placements with a dependent child natural parent.in re johnny,supra,th at,d tara superior court,supra,th at,d.in tara,the fourth district court of appeal rejected a broad interpretation of the term family free home in the icpc definition of placement that would have encompassed placements in the home of a child mother or father.tara superior court,supra,at,d.the sixth district court of appeal agreed with this reasoning and concluded icpc compliance is not mandatory for placement of a child in a parent home because article clearly limits the requirement of advance approval from an icpc receiving state to a placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption,subds.a b.in re johnny,supra,at,d.thus,under existing california case law,icpc procedures simply are not required for a placement of emmanuel with his father in florida.if the icpc does not apply to a parental placement,clearly it does not apply to a visit with a parent.
the agency argues these cases were wrongly decided,relying on contrary authority from other states see arizona of economic sec.leonardo app,of children fam.benway so d,an implementing regulation adopted by the association of administrators of the interstate compact on the placement of children aaicpc,and an opinion letter by the secretariat of this organization regulation states that the definition of placement in article of the icpc includes the arrangement for the care of a child in the home of his parent when the sending agency is any entity other than a parent,relative,guardian or guardian in the same vein,aaicpc secretariat opinion states that an interstate placement is excluded from coverage under the icpc only if parties on both the sending and receiving ends are exempt from the compact.thus,where a welfare agency in state a placed children in agency custody with their father in state b,the secretariat concluded icpc procedures should have been followed.
however,much as the agency would like us to,we need not reexamine california case law regarding application of the icpc to interstate placement with parents,because the juvenile court in this case did not order a placement but merely approved a series of visits.icpc procedures are not required for simple visits,visits ordered for their own sake and not as a prelude to placement.moreover,we conclude the existence of a prior icpc home study did not convert the visits in this case into a placement under the compact.
visits exempt from icpc 
by its own terms,the icpc governs only the placement of dependent children across state lines it does not apply to mere visits.aaicpc regulation regulation draws a clear distinction between the two concepts a visit is not a placement within the meaning of the icpc.visits and placements are distinguished on the basis of purpose,duration,and the intention of the person or agency with responsibility for planning for the child as to the child place of abode.whereas a placement involves the assumption of presumably child care responsibilities,regulation states t he purpose of a visit is to provide the child with a social or cultural experience of short duration,such as a stay in a camp or with a friend or relative who has not assumed legal responsibility for providing child care services.to further clarify the boundary between a placement and a visit,regulation creates a presumption that a stay intended to last no longer than thirty days will constitute a visit,but a stay of longer than days will generally constitute a placement except that longer visits coinciding with the beginning and end of a school vacation may be allowed.see also cal.rules of court,rule an order sending a dependent child out of state for more than days constitutes a placement.
the only aaicpc secretariat opinion to squarely address the difference between visits and placements also stresses the significance of duration.considering whether a parent may take a child who is in the custody of one state and bring that child into the parent,secretariat opinion observes that the need for icpc compliance depends on the length of the child stay with the parent if the visit is to be only a brief one and the agency having custody believes it to be safe and appropriate,the action might not constitute a placement within the meaning of the icpc.however,if the arrangement is to be for a significant period of time,it should be regarded as a placement.
it is clear from the record the juvenile court authorized only visits between emmanuel and his father.out of an abundance of caution,the court limited the longest of these visits to no more than weeks,less than the day presumed for a visit in regulation.the court purpose in approving these visits was also consistent with regulation,since the court did not order visitation as a preliminary step toward placement,but merely to provide contact of short duration between a child and his father.the icpc has no application in this context.
prior icpc evaluation did not convert visits into a placement 
despite the obvious intention of the juvenile court and all parties to facilitate mere visits between emmanuel and his father,the agency contends the visits must be conclusively presumed to constitute a placement under the icpc because the agency previously submitted an icpc placement request to florida authorities and received a negative evaluation of elijah home.this argument stems from the following sentence in paragraph of regulation a request for a home study or supervision made by the person or agency which sends or proposes to send a child on a visit will conclusively establish that the intent of the stay or proposed stay is not a visit.although a literal reading of this statement might appear to support the agency position,imposing such a conclusive presumption poses several problems.
as an initial matter,it is unclear whether the quoted language from regulation applies,by its own terms,to the situation before us.regulation conclusive presumption comes into play only when the party who requested an icpc home study is the same party who also proposes to send the child on a visit.despite the agency protestation to the contrary,the party who requested an icpc study of elijah home is far from clear in the appellate record.while the agency caseworker testified that elijah requested the study,correspondence from florida child welfare authorities,the agency own status review reports,and a brief the agency submitted below all state that the agency initiated the icpc evaluation.if the agency was the requesting party,respondents assert,the presumption does not apply because the agency is not the same party who proposes to send emmanuel to florida.on the contrary,the agency vehemently opposes the visit.
these semantic difficulties highlight the importance of discerning the rationale behind regulation conclusive presumption.in directing cooperation between member states in the placement of children,the icpc seeks,in part,to give authorities in a state where a child may be placed a full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement,subd.b.a november statement prepared by the secretariat of the aaicpc explains this goal of protecting states that receive dependent children for placement while protection of children proposed to be placed and actually in placement is paramount consideration sic,protection of the receiving state is also an important purpose.the states have agreed that their public officers and also private individuals and agencies placing children from or into their territory are required to follow the procedures of icpc.this is intended as a protection against receiving states having children dumped upon them.when children are placed without proper preparation,or when interstate placements go awry,the receiving state usually becomes responsible for rescuing the child and is thereafter usually saddled with the burden of finding suitable care and nurturing and paying for it.
accordingly,in keeping with this goal of protecting receiving states,the icpc prohibits conditional or contingent placement orders.in re luke th,d.icpc procedures must be completed before a member state can order a child sent into another state for placement.id.at,d,subds.b d.regulation serves this statutory purpose.regulation presumes that if a state requests an evaluation of a home for placement of a child under the icpc,a later attempt by the state to send that child into the home constitutes a step toward the sending state expressed goal of p
