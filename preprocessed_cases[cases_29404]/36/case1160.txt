father appeals an order of the juvenile court adjudging his three minor children dependents under welfare and institutions code section,subdivisions b and d,and ordering father to participate in family reunification services on appeal,father contends the evidence was insufficient to support the allegation that father sexually abused his old daughter,or the juvenile court finding that male siblings were at risk of harm we reject these claims and affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
on october,the department filed a petition alleging that mother and father had exposed the children to incidents of domestic violence and,on at least one occasion,father pushed and shoved mother,and father had sexually abused by touching her vagina under her clothes and on top of her underwear and that such conduct placed and her two brothers at risk of harm and sexual abuse.
the detention report indicated that on october,a social worker responded to a call from the los angeles police department to investigate allegations that father had sexually abused told the social worker that father molested her on two occasions.the first time,she was asleep but awoke when father placed his hands inside her panties and rubbed her vaginal area.the second time,was awake because she was too afraid to sleep.did not tell her mother about these incidents because she did not want to start an argument.
mother told the social worker that she and father had a very good relationship until mother learned father had a child outside of their relationship.mother believes father is still involved with the mother of the child because he often leaves on friday and returns on monday.father claims he is spending time with the child.arguments between mother and father have become more frequent and escalate into physical aggression.two weeks earlier,father pushed mother during an argument in the presence of the children.mother expressed the belief that father had not molested and indicated would have reported such conduct to mother.mother believed may have falsely accused father because she was angry with him for disciplining her.
father admitted he pushed mother during an argument and agreed to move from the home so the children could remain with mother.father denied molesting and indicated he recently had chastised her for being outside after dark and took exception to being corrected in front of her friends.
a social report prepared for november,included statements made to a social worker on november.in that interview,indicated her father regularly woke her during the night to cover her with a blanket.regarding the first incident of molestation,said father touched her on top of her clothes in her private area and under her clothes on top of her underwear.indicated her mother may have been in the bathroom during this incident.told her mother that if father returned to the home,she wanted a room with a lock to keep father out.cried during the interview.
brother,told the social worker he had heard his parents arguing and heard mother calling father names.sometimes father is too angry to sleep with mother and sleeps with instead.other brother,had seen his parents fighting and cursing.father once pushed mother very hard.once saw father slap mother face really hard but mother hit father back.s he does not let him just hit her.
father denied sexual abuse of and claimed he had observed that she recently had become more rebellious.
mother indicated she now believed allegations of father sexual abuse.told mother that father touched her inappropriately on two occasions.however,on the second occasion,he barely touched her because she moved away.mother wondered if father had engaged in this conduct in order to move to his girlfriend home.mother indicated that if father wanted out he should have said so but should not have touch ed my daughter.
the police report,which was included as an attachment to the jurisdictional report,indicated the family resided in a apartment.the three children shared a bunk bed with sleeping on the top bunk and her brothers sharing the bottom bunk.mother and father slept adjacent to the bunk bed.the police report indicated reported that on october,father stood over after she had gone to sleep and began to rub her vaginal area over her clothing.believed she was having a dream because she did not see father when she opened her eyes.the next evening,again believed she was dreaming when she felt father touch her vaginal area and,when she opened her eyes,father was not there.when was reinterviewed by the police,she said she had observed father standing over her while she slept and that father rubbed her vagina under her panties after her mother had gone to the bathroom.when father heard mother returning from the bathroom,father got back into bed.the following evening,said everyone was asleep when father began to rub her face with one hand and her vagina with the other.on this occasion,did not open her eyes and pretended to be asleep.
brothers both indicated they had not observed any inappropriate touching of by father.
on february,father admitted amended count b of the petition which alleged that,on numerous occasions,mother and father engaged in domestic confrontations in the presence of the children in which mother and father yelled at each other and father pushed and shoved mother.the parties submitted the remaining allegations of sexual abuse on the detention and jurisdictional reports with their attachments.after hearing argument,the juvenile court sustained the counts as amended to read that on one occasion,father sexually abused consisting of but not limited to touching vagina under her clothes on top of her underwear.such abuse by the father places the children at risk.
father counsel then argued there was no evidence male siblings were at risk of harm.the juvenile court expressly found they were at risk of harm by reason of father sexual abuse of.the juvenile court noted the abuse happened at night and father regularly awoke in the middle of the night to cover the children with blankets.further,younger brothers were approaching the age at which father began to molest.the juvenile court sustained this aspect of the petition under section,subdivisions b and d.
contentions 
father contends there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation he sexually abused and,even if there were,there was insufficient evidence that her male siblings were at substantial risk of sexual abuse.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence as to 
father contends the inconsistencies in various statements and the absence of any corroborating evidence precluded a finding that father sexually abused the child.the alleged inconsistencies were whether father placed his hand over or under underwear,whether saw who touched her and whether had been dreaming about the molestation.father also argues that,given the family sleeping arrangements,any abuse would have been noticed by another family member and it would have been impossible for father to stand over as she slept in the top bunk.father notes mother did not believe father had molested because would have told her and mother initially believed falsely had accused father because she resented his authority.father corroborated this aspect of mother statement when he told the social worker he recently had scolded for being outside after dark in front of her friends.father claims his denial of the sexual abuse allegations is entitled to great weight because he admitted the allegation of domestic violence.
father arguments are not persuasive.by submitting on the social worker report,father acquiesced in the juvenile court consideration of the evidence contained in the report,but retained the right to challenge the sufficiency of that evidence to support the findings.in re ricardo th,d in re th,d in re richard th,d.the standard of proof at the jurisdictional stage of the proceeding is a preponderance of the evidence.in re brison th,d.when the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding or order is challenged on appeal,the reviewing court must determine if there is any substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.
