does family code section,subdivision c barring an obligor spouse from asserting the defense of laches in an action to recover child,family,or spousal retroactively to facts that occurred before its enactment yes.
factual and procedural background 
in june,darrin fellows was ordered to pay child support to mary ann moyse.seventeen years later,on august,moyse filed a motion to register the child support judgment in california.she asserted fellows failed to pay any child support and the arrearages totaled.
on october,fellows filed an application to vacate the registration of the support order.fellows alleged the prior support order was invalid and he had paid all required support.fellows further asserted the equitable defenses of laches and estoppel.
in her opposition papers,moyse claimed she attempted to enlist the child support unit for bronx county,new york,and the legal aid society of new york,to enforce the order,but was unsuccessful in those attempts.further,she alleged that fellows moved repeatedly,making collection impossible.moyse succeeded in getting enforcement proceedings started in ventura,california,in,but after a series of venue transfers among ventura,tehama,and shasta counties,this attempt was unavailing as well.moyse renewed her efforts in to collect the judgment which resulted in further separate litigation between them which is still pending.finally,moyse brought these proceedings to enforce the child support order.
at the hearing on april,moyse testified no child support payments were made.fellows testified all child support payments were made.the parties called corroborating witnesses supporting their respective testimony.the trial court made the following findings 
fellows had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the child support was paid,except for a period of two years when the child lived with him and 
fellows would prevail on the defense of laches if he was allowed to assert it because moyse did not diligently pursue her support claims,and,as a result,fellows suffered substantial detriment.the trial court,however,concluded family code section,subdivision c,eliminated the defense of laches in this case.
as a result,the court confirmed the registration of the new york child support order,denied fellows application to vacate the registration,and determined that arrearages were due and owing from fellows.fellows appeals.
discussion 
ilegislative intent to retroactively apply section,subdivision c 
fellows argues the trial court erred in applying family code section,subdivision c hereafter section c to bar his laches defense because that defense was based on facts that occurred prior to the operative date of that section.fellows contends that the defense of laches has a substantive component precluding retroactive application absent clear legislative directive.we conclude the family code provides that clear legislative directive,and the trial court acted properly.
it is the general rule in california that statutes operate prospectively only.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.it is an established canon of interpretation that statutes are not to be given a retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent.aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d,see also code civ,no part of this code is retroactive,unless expressly so declared.
a retrospective law is one which affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions and conditions which are performed or exist prior to the adoption of the statute.citations.aetna cas.surety.acc,supra,cal d at.stated another way,a statute has retrospective effect when it substantially changes the legal consequences of past events.citation.a statute does not operate retrospectively simply because its application depends on facts or conditions existing before its enactment.western security bank superior court cal th,d.
here,section c was added in,and became effective january.stats,ch.it states,in an action to enforce a judgment for child,family,or spousal support,the defendant may raise,and the court may consider,the defense of laches only with respect to any portion of the judgment owed to the state.c.section c thus eliminates laches as a defense against a person,other than the state,who is owed child,family or spousal support.prior to the enactment of section c,case law recognized laches as a defense to an action to collect support.in re marriage of dancy th,d in re marriage of copeman th,d in re marriage of fogarty rasbeary th,d see also com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.
thus,under the law that existed prior to january,laches was a defense to moyse action to collect the back child support,and would have,in this case,barred her claim.under the law that exists after that date,laches is no longer a defense and would not bar moyse claim.thus,the application of section c to this case alters the legal consequences of past acts.the application of this statute here would be retroactive.consequently,we must determine if there is any clear legislative intent to apply this statute retroactively.
in re marriage of garcia th,d is the only reported case concerning the retroactivity of section c.garcia concludes that section c may not be applied retroactively in cases where the hearing on the motion to enforce a child support obligation predated the effective date of the statute.garcia,at,d.there,mother sought to enforce a child support order against father.id.at,d.father defended based on laches.id.at,d.at a hearing held prior to the effective date of section c,the trial court concluded that father had prevailed on his claim of laches and entered judgment in favor of father.ibid.after the statute became effective,mother argued on appeal that laches was not a defense to a child support order under the law that preexisted section c.garcia,at,d.as a corollary to her first argument,mother argued section c did not act retroactively because this provision was merely a clarification of existing law.garcia,at,d.the appellate court rejected both arguments,concluding that section c changed the law to eliminate laches as a potential defense.garcia,at,d.because the law had changed,and finding nothing in the statute that demonstrated a clear legislative intent to apply the law retroactively,the appellate court concluded that this section could not be applied retroactively.id.at,d.
it is on the question of legislative intent that we respectfully part company with the garcia court.while the language of section c is obviously silent on the subject of retroactivity,as are the statute legislative committee reports,we conclude the legislature intended that amendments to the family code shall be retroactively applied unless the legislation otherwise indicates.see 
in,the legislature directed the law revision commission to review statutes relating to the adjudication of child and family civil proceedings and make recommendations to the legislature regarding the establishment of a family code.the major concern addressed by the legislative resolution was the dispersion of family law in several codes,including the civil code,code of civil procedure,evidence code,probate code,and welfare and institutions code.recommendation family code cal.law revision com.preprint copy,fn.omitted.the family code reorganize d the major family law statutes in a new code and resolve d many procedural and technical inconsistencies in the pre existing law.id.at.
as part of this new code,the legislature enacted section which provides general transitional rules applicable to the family code.cal.law revision com,supra,at.we set forth the full text of this section in the margin 
section,however,is much more than a transitional provision.a straightforward application of section demonstrates that the legislature intended as a general rule that future amendments to the family code are to be retroactively applied.section,subdivision a b defines amendments to the code as new law.section,subdivision c provides that this new law here,section c applies on the operative date here,january,to all matters governed by the new law,regardless of whether an event occurred or circumstance existed before,on,or after the operative date.as noted by the law revision commission,in addition to governing other substantive provisions,section also governs itself.it therefore becomes operative on the date the family code becomes operative and applies to provisions enacted and operative before,on,or after that date.cal.law revision com,supra,at,italics added.
section provides that amendments to the family code,including the one at issue here,are intended to apply to past events unless the amendment provides otherwise,or the case fits into one of the particular exceptions enumerated in the remainder of section.because section demonstrates the legislature intended amendments to the family code shall apply retroactively,we conclude section c applies retroactively to conduct that predated that section.in doing just this,the trial court did not err.
fellows points to in re marriage of wood th,d,where the court asserted that section was not a model of clarity.without any analysis or citation as to why it came to that conclusion,the wood court concluded that an amendment to the child support statute could not be applied retroactively because the change was substantive and not procedural.id.at,d.
we respectfully disagree with the wood court based on our supreme court subsequent construction of the almost identical provision contained in probate code section rice clark cal th,d.probate code section is the section upon which section is modeled.cal.law revision com,supra,at in rice clark,supra,cal th at pages,d,clark received gifts under a will,trust,and other documents executed prior to a amendment to probate code section.the amendment eliminated the disqualification of persons who caused the instrument to be drafted from receiving assets from these instruments.clark argued the amendment to probate code section applied to the will and trust that was drafted prior to the operative date of that amendment relying on section of the probate code.id.at,d.the supreme court agreed.ibid.the supreme court held that probate code section,subdivision c mandates application of the law as amended in,even though the trust and will were executed prior to the amendment effectiveness.rice clark,supra,cal th at,d.the court further concluded that the purpose of probate code section was to make legislative improvements in probate law applicable on their operative date whenever possible.rice clark,supra,cal th at,d.
for this same reason,we conclude the substantially identical provision in section serves the same purpose and must be interpreted as the legislature intent that amendments to the family code shall be retroactively applied unless it states another intent in enacting those amendments or the exceptions to section apply.contrary to fellows argument,nothing in section,subdivision c provides that amendments which are substantive in nature are not retroactive,while mere procedural changes are retroactive.
the retroactivity of section c is also compelled by an independent reason.we presume the legislature intends for a statute to apply retroactively when the legislature amends a law to provide a remedy for a statute it perceives has produced unfair results.see in re marriage of powers d.here,in support of the bill that became section c,its author noted that over million children in california are owed over million in unpaid support,and that many of these children fail to thrive because there are not adequate resources to meet their basic needs.com.analysis,supra,at.with those children in mind,this amendment was specifically designed to prohibit a person who has violated a court order for the payment of child,family,or spousal support from raising the defense of laches unreasonable and prejudicial delay in response to an action to enforce the support order.id.at.
further,the bill was based on the premise that laches is a legal loophole used by obligors who are escaping justice by hiding from the child support system long enough to allow a defense of laches to shield them from ever having to pay the child support they have been to pay.com.analysis,supra,at.it is precisely the legislature intent to right this perceived injustice that dictates the retroactive application of section c.
finally,the retroactive application of section c creates certainty in litigation and eases the court task in ascertaining the correct result.laches generally covers a long period of time because it requires an unreasonable delay and prejudice resulting from that delay.in re marriage of garcia,supra,th at,d.without the retroactive application of this statute,in five years,when a father or mother raises the defense of laches,the court will be faced with the daunting task of trying to figure out if laches should apply to a child support judgment that is,or years old.in those instances,the delay of the obligee parent and the prejudice to the obligor may have occurred prior to,during,and after the operative date of section c.under the rule we have identified above,it is clear that laches simply will be inapplicable 
in his supplemental brief,fellows argues three of section exceptions apply here to avoid the general rule provided by section,subdivision c subdivisions f,g and h.we disagree.we shall address subdivisions f and g here,and subdivision h in the next section.
subdivision f of section provides no person is liable for an action taken before the operative date that was proper at the time the action was taken,even though the action would be improper if taken on or after the operative date,and the person has no duty,as a result of the enactment of the new law,to take any step to alter the course of action or its consequences.
fellows argues this subdivision applies because he had no no duty prior to january,to preserve evidence forever of his payment of his child support obligation and the new law can not and should not impose upon him a duty to attempt to do so long after the fact.the amendment to section c does not impose any duty on fellows to do anything.it does not deprive him of the defense that he paid his child support obligation or the ability to prove that he has paid that obligation.in this regard,fellows could still attempt to prove payment through his own testimony,through that of others who observed him make payments,or through the use of his bank records or those of moyse.all section c does is remove a defense of laches,delay of enforcement and prejudice from the list of defenses available to fellows.this defense presumes nonpayment but fellows had the duty to pay both prior to and subsequent to the amendment of section c.subdivision f does not assist him.
turning to section,subdivision g,that part of the statute provides if the new law does not apply to a matter that occurred before the operative date,the old law continues to govern the matter notwithstanding its repeal or amendment by the new law.fellows suggests this law makes no sense unless it is construed as follows new laws do not apply to substantive matters occurring prior to the new law effective date absent an express retroactivity provision.we disagree.
we start with the language of the statute when construing it.collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d.absent a compelling reason to do otherwise,we strive to construe each statute in accordance with its plain language.ibid.nothing in section,subdivision g states the application of the new law versus the old law is based upon whether the new law is substantive or procedural in nature.rather,section,subdivision g provides that if the new law does not apply,then the law that preexisted the amendment continues in force.given the general rule of retroactivity created by section,subdivision c,a new provision of the family code will not apply to a matter that occurred before the operative date when that new law expressly says so.here,the amendment to section c does not limit its application to facts that postdated its enactment.thus,subdivision g does not help fellows.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the trial court correctly determined the legislature intended the amendment to section c to be retroactive.
