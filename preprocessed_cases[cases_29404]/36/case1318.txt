armando appeals an order denying him services to reunify with his biological son,elijah,and finding jesse is elijah conclusively presumed father.armando asserts his right to due process of law was violated when he was not allowed to establish paternity under adoption of kelsey cal th,d,kelsey the court erred by not weighing competing policy factors in family code section when it determined jesse was elijah presumed father the court should not have found jesse was conclusively presumed to be elijah presumed father under section armando right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution was violated when the court denied him reunification services based on his status as a biological father and the court should have offered him reunification services because doing so was in elijah best interests.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
jesse married michelle in september in texas.the next month,they moved to san diego.on november,the same day the navy deployed jesse,they had sexual relations.one week later,michelle had sexual relations with armando.
jesse returned from deployment in may.shortly thereafter,he physically abused michelle and the navy ordered him to take anger management classes.while he did so,michelle went to texas to live with her mother.armando helped her drive to texas and stayed with her in her mother home.elijah was born in august and jesse was listed on the birth certificate as his father.
after michelle mother said elijah looked like jesse,armando did not want to be involved with him.michelle,however,sought to confirm paternity and asked armando to take a blood test.testing revealed a percent probability that armando was elijah father,but he took no legal action to establish paternity.michelle also had asked him to leave her mother home,presumably because of his disinterest in elijah,and he moved to denver,colorado.michelle reconciled with jesse and returned to san diego.
by,armando had moved to phoenix,arizona.in june of that year,while jesse was again deployed,michelle took elijah and his sibling,christian,to phoenix so she could go to school there.she made arrangements with armando to pay his rent in exchange for his watching her children while she went to school.several days later,she noticed a bruise that looked like a handprint on christian face.when she later noticed he was bleeding from his ear,she took him to the naval medical center in san diego.doctors determined the injury was nonaccidental trauma.consequently,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency removed elijah from michelle custody and filed a welfare and institutions code section petition on his behalf armando was identified on the petition as elijah alleged father.at the detention hearing,the court amended the petition to add jesse as a presumed father.elijah was subsequently detained with him.
at the august jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,the court made a true finding on the petition,declared elijah to be a dependent,and placed him with jesse.the court found jesse was elijah conclusively presumed father under section and armando was the child biological father,but not his presumed father.the court also denied armando requests for services and visitation.
discussion 
armando contends the court denied him substantive due process when it did not find he was a father within the meaning of kelsey,supra,cal th,d.
the agency asserts armando has waived his right to complain the court did not find he was a father under kelsey because he did not make a request to be so declared at the hearing.we agree.
a parent failure to raise an issue in the juvenile court prevents him or her from presenting the issue to the appellate court.in re lorenzo th,d.because armando did not ask the court to find he was a father within the meaning of kelsey,he has waived his right to raise the issue here.
armando asserts he sufficiently raised the issue of whether he was a kelsey father by arguing he was entitled to presumed father status and reunification services.we disagree.the issue in kelsey is whether the man demonstrated he made a full commitment to his parental,financial,and otherwise and was prevented from taking the child into his home by a third party.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.at the hearing,however,armando focused on facts that he claimed demonstrated he was a presumed father within the meaning of section,subdivision d.we note there is some overlap in the factors used to establish a man as a presumed father under that section and to establish a man as a father within the meaning of kelsey consequently,a party seeking status as a father under kelsey must be clear he wants to be so declared.because armando did not specifically address the kelsey factors or make any request at the hearing to be designated a kelsey father and focused on his status as a presumed father within the meaning of section,subdivision d,the court had no reason to believe he wanted to be designated a father under kelsey s.he is barred from raising the issue as error here.
even if armando had not waived his right to argue that he was entitled to be declared a kelsey father,he has not established his substantive due process rights were violated because the evidence shows he was not a father within the meaning of kelsey 
a biological father may be accorded parental rights and become a kelsey father when his attempt to achieve presumed parent status under section,subdivision d is thwarted by a third party and he made a full commitment to his parental,financial,and otherwise.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d,in re sarah th,d.we consider his conduct before and after the child birth,including whether he publicly acknowledged paternity,paid pregnancy and birth expenses commensurate with his ability to do so,and promptly took legal action to obtain custody of the child.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.he must demonstrate a full commitment to his parental responsibilities within a short time after he learned that the biological mother was pregnant with his child.adoption of michael cal th,d.he must also demonstrate a willingness to assume full custody.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.
armando made no such showing.at most,the evidence showed he sent diapers for one year and,on one occasion.he offered no evidence that he was unable to make further financial contributions.the only person he told he was elijah father was his mother,and she did not believe he acted parentally.there was no evidence he publicly acknowledged elijah was his child and when his paternity was questioned,he became uninterested in the child.further,at most,he lived with elijah for two weeks in michelle mother home after elijah birth and in his own home for days in.his role in was that of a babysitter,not a parent.he never moved to san diego to try and parent the child.he never claimed he was willing to take full custody to the contrary,he said he was in no position to take elijah and that placing the child with him would constitute abuse.these facts are insufficient to establish fatherhood within the meaning of kelsey in re sarah,supra,th at,d acknowledging the child as his to a few friends and family and caring for the child for a few months is insufficient to establish fatherhood within the meaning of kelsey when the father never sought to be listed on the birth certificate,never completed any paperwork with his employer to have the child named as a dependent or an insurance beneficiary,never provided a home for the child,contributed money for rent or food only once,and lived with the child only briefly in the mother home.
to demonstrate a full commitment to his parental responsibilities,armando was also required to take prompt legal action to seek custody.kelsey,supra,cal th at,d.however,he never took legal action to seek custody or to establish paternity,despite knowing shortly after elijah birth that there was a percent probability he was the child father.he never obtained a judgment of paternity or sought to be on the birth certificate.
armando asserts that he should be considered a kelsey father because michelle did not let him see elijah.however,because he did not fully c
