this appeal presents a question of first impression about the family code provisions that require spouses who are dissolving their marriage to exchange declarations of disclosure of assets and liabilities specifically,is a property settlement agreement valid and enforceable when executed by spouses after they have separated but before a petition for dissolution of marriage has been filed and without an exchange of disclosure declarations 
in this case,the spouses entered into a written agreement to resolve the property rights to their residence.the husband agreed to buy out the wife interest for the value of the equity.when they signed the agreement,they were separated,but a petition for dissolution of marriage had not been filed.the husband now contends the agreement is unenforceable because they did not exchange disclosure declarations before signing the agreement.
the trial court ruled the agreement was enforceable because the family code did not require disclosure declarations be exchanged before a petition was filed.the court stated the terms of the agreement would be incorporated into the judgment of dissolution of marriage that divided the community property.
we interpret section,subdivision a and the other provisions in chapter to mean that an exchange of disclosure declarations is not required for a agreement to be enforceable,even when spouses make the agreement in contemplation of dissolution.in addition,we do not read in re marriage of burkle th burkle as supporting an interpretation that extends the statutory disclosure requirements to agreements.
we therefore affirm the trial court order.
appellant william evans and respondent joy evans married in july.they separated in march.
the only significant asset in their marital estate was a house located in kern county.they agreed that william would buy out joy interest in the residence,and joy prepared a typed pre divorce agreement to that effect agreement.both parties signed the agreement on may.at the time of signing,the parties assumed the residence had a net equity of and the agreement accordingly called for william to pay to joy for her interest.
the terms of the agreement unequivocally show that it was made in contemplation of the dissolution of william and joy marriage.the agreement was entitled pre divorce agreement and the terms of the final payment were to be determined at the time of the final divorce agreement.further,the agreement specified that the disposition of any assets not covered by the agreement were to be set forth in the final divorce agreement.
before signing the agreement,neither party served the other with either a preliminary or final disclosure declaration.however,there is no indication in the record that joy was in possession of information pertinent to the contractual exchange and elect ed not to reveal that information to william.wonnell,the structure of a general theory of nondisclosure case res.thus,there was no failure to disclose intrinsic facts pertaining to the residence and no failure to disclose extrinsic facts pertaining to the general environment affecting the economic value of the residence.id.at.
after signing the agreement,william paid joy,leaving an unpaid balance of.
proceedings 
in february,joy filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.in early,joy and william served preliminary disclosure declarations on one another.
in october,joy served william with a final disclosure declaration.william never served joy with a final disclosure declaration.
at the time of the dissolution proceedings,their residence had an approximate fair market value of and was encumbered by a promissory note secured by a first deed of trust with an unpaid balance of,making the actual net equity of the residence about.the value of the equity was less than the william still owed joy under the terms of the agreement.
william brought a motion to set aside the agreement,claiming that the parties failure to comply with the disclosure declaration requirements of chapter prior to signing the agreement made the agreement invalid and unenforceable.the motion to set aside was bifurcated and heard on declarations and written argument.
in september,the trial court issued a tentative decision that the agreement was valid and enforceable.the trial court stated that by signing the agreement prior to filing a petition for dissolution,the parties failure to exchange disclosure declarations was irrelevant and did not prevent the enforcement of the agreement.the trial court ordered the terms of the agreement be incorporated into a judgment of dissolution of marriage dividing the parties community property.
in october,the trial court issued an order and agreed statement of facts.
in november,william timely filed a motion to appeal the order on the bifurcated issue,pursuant to california rules of court,rule d,which was granted by this court 
discussion 
judicial reviewa.issues presented 
the primary issue on appeal is whether a settlement agreement made before the filing of a petition for the dissolution of marriage,but in contemplation of it,is unenforceable due solely to the parties failure to first serve each other the disclosure declarations described in the family code.our answer is no.
during oral argument,william counsel identified two additional issues that would arise if he prevailed on the primary issue.
first,if the exchange of disclosure declarations was required,was william required to show prejudice in regard to the agreement to obtain an order setting it aside in other words,did he have to show prejudice to obtain relief second,was william failure to serve a final disclosure declaration after joy served hers in october fatal to his motion to set aside the agreement,which was prepared and signed over five years earlier because we have decided against william on the primary issue and concluded a agreement is enforceable without an exchange of disclosure declarations,we do not reach these last two issues.
standard of review 
this appeal presents questions of statutory construction,which are questions of law subject to independent review on appeal.california teachers governing bd.of golden valley unified school dist.th.
basic principles of statutory construction 
the primary function of a court construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.the first step in statutory construction is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.people valladoli cal th.
this plain meaning rule requires that the language of a statute first be given the meaning it bears in ordinary use.lungren deukmejian cal d.when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous there usually is no need for further construction,and courts adopt the plain,or literal,meaning of that language.ibid.
however,the plain meaning rule is not absolute.lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.if the literal meaning of a word or sentence,when considered in the context of a statute,is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute,its literal construction will not be adopted.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,bob jones university united states,a canon of statutory construction provides that literal language should not defeat the plain purpose of the statute.similarly,a literal construction of statutory language that leads to absurd results may be disregarded for a construction that furthers the legislative intent apparent in the statute.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d.
if statutory language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,it is ambiguous and a court will look to a variety of extrinsic aids to construe its meaning.people woodhead cal d.particularly,a court will consider the statute objectives,the evils it seeks to remedy,its legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute in question is a part,citing people shirokow cal d,morse municipal court cal d,pennisi department of fish game d.with these extrinsic aids,a court must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,in order to promote,rather than to frustrate the purpose of the statute,and to avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.people jenkins cal th.
ii.disclosure statutes 
general provisions 
chapter requires parties seeking dissolution of their marriage to prepare and serve both preliminary and final disclosure declarations of assets and liabilities on one another.disclosure declarations must include the full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which one or both parties may have an interest.in requiring such disclosures,the legislature set forth the following findings and goals 
a to marshal,preserve,and protect community and assets and liabilities that exist at the date of separation so as to avoid dissipation of the community estate before distribution,to ensure fair and sufficient child and spousal support awards,and to achieve a division of community and assets and liabilities on the dissolution or nullity of marriage or legal separation of the parties as provided under california law.
b to reduce the adversarial nature of marital dissolution and the attendant costs by fostering full disclosure and cooperative discovery,subds.a,b.
the legislature further stated that i n order to promote this public policy,a full and accurate disclosure must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation,and that each party has a continuing duty to immediately,fully,and accurately update and augment that disclosure to the extent there have been any material changes so that at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of any of these issues,or at the time of trial on these issues,each party will have a full and complete knowledge of the relevant underlying facts,subd.c.
preliminary disclosure declaration 
preliminary disclosure declarations are governed by section,which establishes that a fter or concurrently with service of the petition for dissolution or nullity of marriage or legal separation of the parties,each party shall serve on the other party a preliminary declaration of disclosure on a form prescribed by the judicial council.former,subd.a.
the preliminary disclosure declaration must include the identity of all of the declarant assets and liabilities,the declarant percentage of ownership in each,and must provide the other party with an income and expense declaration if one has not already been produced,subds.c,e.
final disclosure declaration 
section requires an exchange of final disclosure declarations.subdivision a of section establishes the timeframe in which a final disclosure declaration must be made,stating except by court order for good cause,before or at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of property or support issues other than pendente lite support,or,if the case goes to trial,no later than days before the first assigned trial date,final disclosure declarations must be served,subd.a.
section also provides the means by which parties to a proceeding for dissolution may waive final disclosure declarations.such a waiver may only occur after the exchange by both parties of preliminary disclosure declarations,and must be by the mutual,knowing,intelligent,and voluntary action of both parties,subd.d.
consequences of nondisclosure 
section restricts the actions of a court when final disclosure declarations are not provided it provides in part except as provided in subdivision d of section,section,or absent good cause as provided in section,no judgment shall be entered with respect to the parties property rights without each party having executed and served a copy of the final declaration of disclosure.
subdivision d of section provides for the mutual waiver of the exchange of final disclosure declarations.section addresses default judgments.thus,courts may enter a judgment when final disclosure declarations have not been exchanged in cases of mutual waiver or default judgment.the final exception in section allows a judgment to be entered when there is good cause for the failure to provide a final disclosure declaration and refers to section.
section addresses the failure of a party to serve the required disclosure declarations and the procedures a complying party must follow to obtain the remedies provided.first,a party that has complied with the disclosure requirements may request that a noncomplying party prepare and produce the missing declaration,subd.a.second,if the noncomplying party still fails to produce the appropriate declaration,the complying party may file a motion to compel a further response,file a motion for an order preventing the other party from presenting any evidence on issues that would have been included in the missing declaration,or file a motion showing good cause for the complying party to waive receipt of the missing declaration,subd.b.further,section,subdivision c provides that should a party fail to comply with any provision of this chapter,the court shall,in addition to any other remedy provided by law,impose money sanctions against the noncomplying party.italics added.see s hall is mandatory.
section,subdivision d directs a court that has entered a judgment despite a party failure to comply with the disclosure declaration requirements to set the judgment aside,emphasizing that t he failure to comply with the disclosure requirements does not constitute harmless error.the provision also states that courts are not required to set aside a judgment in certain situations where the court has granted a complying party voluntary waiver of the disclosure requirement,provided the complying party has not committed actual fraud or perjury,subd.d.
iii.interpretation of disclosure provisions 
william contends that the provisions in chapter should be interpreted to require the exchange of disclosure declarations before the parties enter into a agreement resolving their property rights.we disagree.
a.a preliminary disclosure declaration is required only after the commencement of a proceeding 
section explicitly mandates service of a preliminary disclosure declaration a fter or concurrently with service of the petition for dissolution.former,subd.a.the phrase a fter or concurrently is unambiguous as to the timing of the disclosure.service of a preliminary disclosure declaration is not required before the petition for dissolution is filed and served.instead,the petition prompts the requirement for an exchange of preliminary disclosure declarations and,therefore,preliminary disclosure declarations are obligatory only when a dissolution proceeding has commenced.
therefore,no violation of section occurs when spouses enter into a agreement without exchanging preliminary disclosure declarations.
b.a final disclosure declaration is required only after service of a preliminary disclosure declaration,and,therefore,only after the commencement of a proceeding 
section,subdivision a addresses the service of final disclosure declarations using language that is not as clear about timing as section 
except by court order for good cause,before or at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of property or support issues other than pendente lite support,or,if the case goes to trial,no later than days before the first assigned trial date,each party,or the attorney for the party in this matter,shall serve on the other party a final declaration of disclosure 
william argues the phrase before or at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of property should be interpreted to mean that section requires the service of a final disclosure declaration before a agreement is signed.we will assume for the sake of argument that section is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation proposed by william,is ambiguous.therefore,our task is to ascertain the legislature intent in order to promote,rather than frustrate that purpose,and avoid an interpretation leading to an absurd result.people jenkins,supra,cal th at.
we conclude that the reference in section to an agreement was intended to include only agreements.first,reading section contextually within the statutory scheme of chapter provides a clear timeframe for providing final declarations of disclosure.put simply,the plain meaning of the terms preliminary and final demonstrate the legislature intent to require first a preliminary declaration,followed by a final declaration 
because it is evident that the service of a final disclosure declaration is intended to occur after the service of a preliminary disclosure declaration,the time constraints governing the service of preliminary declarations dictate the earliest time at which a final disclosure declaration can be required.because a preliminary declaration is required only if a petition is filed,it logically follows that the exchange of final declarations is not required until later in that proceeding,not before the proceeding began.william proposed interpretation inverts this order and thus negates the plain meaning of the terms preliminary and final.
second,a general rule of statutory construction is that statutes are not read in isolation,but must be interpreted in a manner that brings harmony to the entire statutory scheme.rea blue shield of california th.reading sections and in the context created by other provisions in the family code,it becomes clear that the legislature did not intend the requirement for final disclosure declarations to apply to agreements.
division level 
division of the family code contains the provisions governing dissolution of marriage.the division general provisions clearly demonstrate that the application of its provisions is predicated upon the existence of a proceeding.for example,section states that part of division applies to a proceeding for dissolution of marriage,for nullity of marriage,or for legal separation of the parties.italics added.similarly,section defines the scope of the court jurisdiction i n a proceeding for dissolution of marriage nullity or for legal separation.
because sections and are part of division of the family code,these general provisions at the beginning of the division support the interpretation that the division requirements,including those relating to disclosure declarations,apply when there is a proceeding for the dissolution of marriage.
chapter level 
sections and also are part of chapter,a more specific level of statutory organization that concerns the disclosure of assets and liabilities.the general provisions in chapter specify that the chapter applies to any proceeding commenced on or after january,italics added.notably,section provides that in order to promote public policy a full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties,subd.c,italics added.
what is a proceeding 
the statutory language at the division and chapter levels establishes that the disclosure requirements in chapter apply when there is a proceeding.the statutory definition of this term is provided by section,which states in its entirety proceeding includes an action.this terse definition does not create an ambiguity because section identifies the method by which a proceeding is commenced 
a a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation of the parties is commenced by filing a petition entitled in re the marriage of and which shall state whether it is a petition for dissolution of the marriage or for legal separation of the parties.
this provision identifies precisely when a proceeding is commenced the filing of a petition.
therefore,the provisions in division and chapter stating that they apply to a proceeding are consistent with our interpretation of sections and to mean that disclosure declarations need not be served that is,before a proceeding has commenced.
public policy 
despite the plain meaning of the terms proceeding,preliminary,and final,william urges this court to expand the application of section.william contends p ublic policy requires that family code section be interpreted to require the exchange of declarations of disclosure before the parties enter into a agreement citing the legislative findings of section,william argues this court should focus on the intent of the parties to an agreement and conclude a final disclosure declaration must be served prior to any agreement between spouses who intend to divorce,regardless of when the agreement was made or whether a proceeding is pending.
william relies on burkle to promote his contention that disclosure declarations are mandated by the intent of the parties rather than whether an agreement was made or.
in burkle,a wife filed for dissolution of marriage in june.in august,both parties were seriously considering reconciliation,and resumed living together in september.burkle,supra,th at.in november,while the dissolution action was still pending,they executed an agreement resolving all present and future financial issues between them.ibid.they continued to live together for over four years,parting in april.ibid.in june,the wife filed a second petition for dissolution of marriage ibid.in that proceeding,the wife sought to have the agreement set aside as invalid and unenforceable.ibid.the wife challenged the validity of the agreement on many grounds,including the lack of service of the disclosure declarations mandated by chapter.id.at.
the trial court concluded the agreement was enforceable and the requirements of section,et for disclosure declarations only apply to agreements entered into incident to a dissolution of marriage or legal separation action that is proceeding to judgment.burkle,supra,th at.the appellate court agreed.ibid.
the appellate court stated that sections and were not intended to and do not apply to a postmarital agreement that was not executed in contemplation of the imminent dissolution of the marriage.burkle,supra,th at.the court supported its view of the legislature intent by stating 
the legislative findings and declarations in family code section make clear that the statute applies to agreements that contemplate a judgment dissolving the marriage,not agreements that contemplate a reconciliation.the structure and language of other provisions of the statute likewise make this intention clear.ibid.
the appellate court in burkle addressed the wife argument that a dissolution proceeding was pending when the agreement was executed,and therefore disclosure declarations were required,by stating 
none of these arguments is sufficient to induce us to apply a statute governing dissolution proceedings to circumstances in which the parties are not in fact using the judicial system to seek dissolution of their marriage.it may be a preferable rule,where a petition for dissolution has been filed,to require spouses who wish simultaneously to attempt reconciliation and resolve their financial disputes to file sworn disclosure declarations,unless the dissolution proceeding is dismissed.that,however,is a matter for the legislature,and not for the courts,to undertake.burkle,supra,th at,italics added.
in addition,the court acknowledged the role of the dissolution proceeding in footnote of the opinion 
needless to say,given the vagaries of available proof,the parties to a dissolution proceeding who hope to reconcile and at the same time resolve property issues in a postmarital agreement would be well advised to dismiss the proceeding before executing an agreement.dismissal will avoid the uncertainties attendant upon the need to later present sufficient proof that an agreement was executed while the dissolution proceeding was in abeyance and that neither party contemplated the imminent dissolution of the marriage.burkle,supra,th at,fn,italics added.
these statements indicate the burkle court did not believe the disclosure requirements of chapter applied when a petition for dissolution was not pending.therefore,we read burkle to mean that the requirements in sections and for the service of preliminary and final disclosure declarations apply when two conditions are met.first,the spouses who executed the settlement agreement are parties to a marital dissolution proceeding.second,the parties negotiated and executed the settlement agreement in
