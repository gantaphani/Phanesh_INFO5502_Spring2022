we must decide two related questions arising out of a protracted and contentious dependency dispute whether noncustodial grandparents,acting as de facto parents to grandchildren who are dependents of the juvenile court,have a substantive due process right to family integrity and association with those grandchildren and whether placing the grandfather name on the california child abuse central index caci violates his constitutional right to due process.
charles and patricia miller are grandparents of three young girls who had been removed from their natural parents because of neglect.they brought an action under against the county of yuba,yuba county human services agency,yuba county child protective services cps,and cps employees for conspiring to deprive them of the right to family integrity and for placing charles miller name on the caci.the district court granted yuba county motion for summary judgment,concluding that the millers have no constitutional right to visit their grandchildren when the children are dependents of the juvenile court,and cps,as well as the children biological mother,agree that visitation should cease.the court also held that the millers failed to show loss of a recognizable property or liberty interest in conjunction with injury to their reputation from placement of charles miller name on the index,and so failed to satisfy the test required to support a claim for defamation under.we agree and,as we have jurisdiction pursuant to and no other issue merits reversal,we affirm.
the millers grandchildren were removed from their parents home in may by the yuba county cps.the three girls were declared dependents of the yuba county juvenile court on june,and were placed with the millers,their paternal grandparents.the mother left california in november and reunification services for her were terminated june,the court ordered that the children would remain in the millers home.after returning to california in september,the mother successfully petitioned for visitation.a march petition for return of the children was denied.however,in august,at the recommendation of cps,the mother was given six additional months of reunification services.the court ordered placement of the minor children in the home of their maternal grandmother to facilitate the reunification efforts,and granted visitation rights to the millers.
in october,a call to cps from the office of the girls doctor raised concerns about possible sexual abuse.the children were examined at the university of california davis medical center child protection unit.as a result,all visitation with the children was terminated.penny elliott,a cps social worker,interviewed the girls,and on october submitted a child abuse investigation report to the california department of justice pursuant to california penal code to have charles miller name placed on the child abuse central index.however,his name was not placed on the index because his birthdate was mistakenly omitted.the millers were not interviewed by cps,nor were they notified of this report as the penal code did not then require that suspected child abusers be given notice.
in february the juvenile court transferred the case under a family maintenance plan to sutter county,where the mother had moved.the yuba city police department and the sutter county cps then investigated the sexual molestation charges.interviews with the children did not disclose molestation,so the yuba city police department closed the case.
the millers were granted supervised visitation by the sutter county juvenile court in may,and in august were granted unsupervised visitation and de facto parent status.apparently the mother began to neglect her children again in late,and allowed the girls to spend weekends with the millers and to live continuously with them from january,until february.at that point the mother took the girls to arizona,then to alaska,as a result of which the millers filed for guardianship in june.guardianship was granted on october.the millers have had custody ever since.
meanwhile,in july the millers met with the director of the yuba county department of health and human services,which oversees cps,to ask for an investigation to clear their names.on september,the original child abuse investigation report was resubmitted to the california department of justice.this resulted in charles miller name being listed on the caci.as california penal code et had been amended to require,a notice of report to the child abuse central index was sent to charles miller on september.
the millers filed suit,and have timely appealed from the summary judgment entered in favor of yuba county 
the millers argue that they have a substantive due process right to family integrity under the fourteenth amendment because they had assumed the role of parents to their grandchildren by providing for their care,comfort,and protection as well as their physical and psychological needs for a substantial period of time.they submit that de facto parents are entitled to the same protections extended to nuclear and biological families.the millers point out that rule a of the juvenile court rules of the california rules of court defines a de facto parent as a person who has been found by the court to have assumed,on a basis,the role of parent,fulfilling both the child physical and psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period.they also note that they attended all of the juvenile court proceedings and are a parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a dependent child within the meaning of california welfare and institutions code.given this relationship,the millers assert that they have raised a triable issue of fact that yuba county and cps social workers conspired to deny them their right to associate with their grandchildren,culminating in cps accusing charles miller of sexually molesting the girls.as they see it,placing miller name on the caci was intended to,and did deprive the millers of their constitutionally protected liberty interest in associating with their grandchildren.
while there is no question that parents have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in making decisions about the care,custody,and control of their children,see,troxel granville,d plurality opinion lee city of los angeles,cir citing kelson city of springfield,cir,we have never held that any such right extends to grandparents.the millers rely upon drollinger milligan,cir,which recognized that grandparents should enjoy the same constitutional protection afforded to the nuclear family.however,as we observed in mullins oregon,cir,that opinion is not helpful the drollinger court never explained its decision and the seventh circuit later questioned its precedential value in ellis hamilton,cir.
as we also noted in mullins,there is no authority for the proposition that a grandparent,by virtue of genetic link alone,enjoys a fundamental liberty interest in the adoption of her grandchildren.at.although the millers emphasize that they were not trying to adopt their grandchildren,just to associate with them,there was no existing family unit of which they were a part that yuba county sought to break asunder the grandchildren were,in fact,wards of the court at all relevant times.the millers interests in this case conflicted with the interests of the girls mother and their maternal grandmother,both of whom were also seeking to have the girls live with them instead of the millers.this distinguishes moore city of east cleveland,ohio,d,upon which the millers rely.in moore,there were no conflicting interests at stake in the grandchildren living arrangement,and there was no suggestion that the grandmother was in any way unfit to care for her grandson.troxel,at.here,with the agreement of the children biological mother and cps,the millers visitation rights were temporarily cut off after the girls were placed with the maternal grandmother and were prohibited altogether in the wake of evidence that the girls may have been sexually abused.this is consistent with troxel recognition that a grandparent interest in visiting grandchildren may conflic
