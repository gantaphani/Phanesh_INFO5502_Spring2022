in this dependency appeal,natasha mother seeks relief from the juvenile court order terminating her parental rights with respect to her youngest daughter,born june,pursuant to section of the welfare and institutions code at the november dispositional hearing in this matter,mother was bypassed for reunification services in accordance with subdivisions b and b of section.pursuant to those statutes,reunification services need not be offered to a parent if the court has previously terminated reunification services or parental rights with respect to a sibling or half sibling of the child and the parent has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or half sibling,subd.b.
mother argues that bypassing her for reunification was improper because the orders terminating services and parental rights with respect to half siblings were on appeal at the time of dispositional hearing and therefore could not provide an appropriate basis for bypass.she further asserts that since the juvenile court bypass decision was based on a patent legal error which violated her due process rights she has not forfeited the issue,despite her failure to raise it in the juvenile court or timely pursue it in this court.because we conclude that the juvenile court did not err in relying on subdivision b to bypass services for mother under the facts of this case,we need not consider mother other contentions and affirm the juvenile court order terminating parental rights.
background 
the minor who is the subject of these proceedings,was detained by the alameda county social services agency agency on june,when she was eleven months old.in its petition filed two days later,the agency alleged that was at substantial risk of harm because natasha numerous emotional,mental health,and substance abuse problems interfered with her ability to properly care for the minor.the petition referenced a number of recent examples of mother neglect.for instance,on may,mother called staff at the shelter where she was staying and asked them to pick her up at the bart station because she was unable to make her way home.when a staff member arrived,mother appeared quite intoxicated and was sitting on the curb with in a stroller next to her.the staff member had to help mother stand and navigate the stroller because mother was unable to push the baby.on june,mother,who again appeared intoxicated,reported to shelter staff that she had an altercation with a store owner while was in her care.according to mother,the store owner pulled her hair and she ripped his pants pocket,causing a wad of bills to fall out.mother then stole the and fled down the street with in the stroller.that same day,mother was observed yelling and cussing at the minor while doing her hair.on june,shelter staff had to intervene when mother,who admitted she was again intoxicated,vomited on herself and the minor.finally,mother had a history of marijuana use,and,according to staff,she smelled of marijuana while caring for 
sadly,mother was,herself,involved with the child welfare system as a minor,with referrals involving the maternal grandmother substance abuse and mental health issues dating back to.the family received services from march through october and from april through august.in,when she was years old,mother was briefly taken into protective custody after a physical altercation with the maternal grandmother.mother was reported to be difficult to manage and associated with older individuals who would buy her alcohol.she was threatening to people at school breaking someone nose,almost breaking someone jaw,and breaking three of her teacher teeth.
mother also had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations,with seven admissions prior to.she had been involuntarily detained pursuant to section three times,including once in after she threatened to hit a cousin with a carjack at the time petition was filed,however,mother was not engaged in mental health treatment.in addition,mother was reported to have neurological damage from a car accident when she was a child,which left her with significant cognitive delays.mother had also been arrested on a number of occasions and,when petition was filed,was on probation for resisting a police officer,subd.a and disturbing the peace,based on separate incidents occurring in.
in march,mother had been referred for voluntary services after it was reported that had three large scrapes on her bottom and that mother did not have stable housing.although mother was referred for numerous services,including services through the local regional center,she failed to follow through.moreover,despite assistance from both the agency social worker and her case manager from through the looking glass,a resource center for parents with disabilities,mother had failed to secure stable housing.
also of significance to the disposition in this case,mother has two older daughters born march and born february who were removed from her care in march due to allegations of neglect.according to the operative petition in this sibling case,the two minors were at substantial risk of harm because mother criminality,housing instability,mental health issues,and substance abuse impacted her ability to adequately care for and protect them.for instance,in july,mother had been arrested for child endangerment,subd.a,after riding with in a vehicle driven by an intoxicated person.upon investigation,it was discovered that the infant car seat had not been attached to the vehicle.the petition further recounted mother history of housing instability,noting that the family was living with the maternal grandmother at the time of detention,which presented a serious risk to the minors due to the grandmother serious mental health issues,substance abuse issues,and previous child welfare history with her own children.mother history of psychiatric hospitalizations and lack of current mental health treatment,despite her demonstration of behavior consistent with an ongoing mental illness,was also described.finally,the petition detailed mother historic marijuana use and reported that had tested positive for marijuana at birth.
mother was offered reunification services with respect to and,but these services were terminated in june the same month that was born due to her failure to reunify.on july,the juvenile court terminated mother parental rights with respect to both and.we recently issued an unpublished opinion upholding the juvenile court decision terminating parental rights.in re et,nonpub.opn.
as for,she was formally detained in the home of her paternal grandmother on june,father supported placement with the paternal grandmother.he reported concerns about mother ability,but would not go into detail.according to the agency,mother had shown an inability to protect the minor when she engages in substance abuse,criminal activity,her violent behaviors,all with the minor in her presence and care.moreover,in the agency opinion,mother developmental delays impacted her ability to make appropriate decisions and properly parent 
while jurisdiction and disposition were pending,mother did complete an assessment with the local regional center,and her case manager planned to refer her to the center independent living program ilp.mother also entered a residential treatment program in july,but left after two days.staff reported that she was getting into arguments with other clients and was not willing to abide by the rules of the program.thereafter,she claimed to be receiving counseling and substance abuse treatment through a local clinic,but failed to provide requested contact information so that this could be verified.in october,mother ilp worker reported that mother had left her several messages in which she sounded intoxicated.when the social worker asked mother about this report,mother became angry,yelling and swearing.further,when the social worker suggested that mother could clear up the matter through drug testing,mother declined.at that point,mother was living in a homeless shelter.she had not been participating in regional center services.
although mother had originally contested both jurisdiction and disposition and the proceedings were therefore continued repeatedly when the hearing was actually held on november,mother withdrew her request for a contest and submitted both matters.the juvenile court therefore found the allegations in the petition,as amended in court,true and concluded that the minor was a person described by subdivisions b and j of section.thereafter,noting that mother progress toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement had been minimal at best,the juvenile court declared the minor to be a dependent child and denied both parents reunification services.a hearing was set for february,pursuant to section so that a permanent plan could be developed for neither parent sought writ review of this setting order.
in its report filed in advance of the permanency planning hearing,the agency recommended that be adopted by the paternal grandmother.father was apparently in favor of this outcome.mother had been visiting irregularly in the home of the paternal grandmother,despite the agency offer for assistance with transportation and a set visitation schedule.on december,mother showed up unexpectedly and,after the grandmother agreed to supervise a visit in front of the house,mother exclaimed you not going to take my child from me.she also screamed and cursed at the grandmother,threatening to have people come to the home.although mother later called to apologize,mother supervised visitation was moved to a neutral setting.in the opinion of the agency,mother continued to struggle with the same issues that led to removal and had a history of being unable to care for her children,even with many supportive services from the agency and elsewhere.
at the permanency planning hearing on february,mother testified in opposition to the agency recommendation.she indicated that she had been taking parenting classes and receiving drug and alcohol education.mother also stated that she was attending meetings,participating in regional center services,and visiting with.she continued to look for housing.mother described her relationship and ongoing contact with,and her attorney argued that mother parental rights should not be terminated based on the beneficial relationship exception to adoption that is,that mother had consistently visited with the minor and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship,subd.c b i.
nevertheless,at the conclusion of the permanency planning hearing,the juvenile court found adoptable,declined to apply the beneficial relationship exception to block proposed adoption,and terminated the parental rights of both mother and father.in reaching this decision,the court noted that the case involving was on appeal and needed to be followed by all of the parties because the appellate decision could have ramifications in case that would need to be addressed.mother timely notice of appeal brought the matter before this court.
ii.discussion 
forfeiture issues 
mother contends that reversal is required in this case due to multiple errors in the dependency proceedings involving and,matters which were pending before this court at the time she briefed the present appeal.since we recently rejected all of these claims,upholding the juvenile court decision to terminate mother parental rights with respect to and in re,supra,nonpub.opn,these arguments are no longer available to mother.thus,her sole remaining theory in this case is that the juvenile court erred as a legal matter when it bypassed her for reunification based on the orders terminating services and parental rights with respect to half siblings,because those orders were on appeal,and therefore not final,at the time of dispositional hearing.
it is undisputed,however,that mother did not object in the juvenile court on this basis.rather,she submitted the matter of disposition to the juvenile court for its determination.generally,such a failure forfeits a parent right to pursue the issue on appeal.in re cal th,fn,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in in re th,in re dakota th,in re lorenzo th,in re crystal th.indeed,although an appellate court has the discretion to excuse such forfeiture,it should do so rarely and only in cases presenting an important legal issue,supra,cal th at.this is especially true in juvenile dependency cases,which involve the of children and in which considerations such as permanency and stability are of paramount importance.ibid.
moreover,in the present case,mother has arguably doubly forfeited the issue she is now attempting to raise because,not only did she fail to bring it to the juvenile court attention,she also neglected to seek timely appellate review of the matter in this court.generally speaking,an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.in re meranda th,meranda.the purpose of this rule is to balance the parents interest in the care and custody of their children with the children interest in the expeditious resolution of their custody status.in re th.
here,the dispositional order bypassing mother for reunification services was part of an order setting a permanency planning hearing under section.since a ll orders issued at a hearing in which a section hearing is ordered are subject to section,subdivision l and must be reviewed by extraordinary writ in re tabitha th,tabitha,mother was required to seek writ review of the juvenile court bypass decision in order to preserve her right to appellate review.see,subd.l failure to file a petition for extraordinary writ review within the period specified by rule shall preclude subsequent review by appeal of a setting order italics added see also cal.rules of court,rule e a when a party is present at the setting hearing,notice of intent to file writ petition must be filed within seven days from the date of the setting order.this she did not do.
again,however,this forfeiture rule is not absolute.rather,it must not be applied if due process forbids it.in re janee th,janee.generally,the forfeiture rule does not infringe upon a parent due process rights because of the numerous safeguards built into the dependency system,supra,th at.thus,application of the rule has only been found inappropriate on due process grounds when an error so fundamentally undermined the statutory scheme that the parent was prevented from availing him or herself of its protections.janee,supra,th at.moreover,defects must go beyond mere errors that might have been held reversible had they been properly and timely reviewed.id.at.
mother,of course,argues that this is a case in which her procedural failures should be excused.specifically,she contends that the error she complains of was legal in nature and was entirely fundamental to her case,depriving her of the many due process protections she would otherwise have enjoyed during the reunification period.we agree that bypassing a parent for reunification services is an extreme decision that has significant ramifications for both parent and child.see cheryl superior court th,cheryl the failure of a parent to reunify with a prior child should never cause the court to reflexively deny that parent a meaningful chance to do so in a later case.to the contrary,the primary focus of the trial court must be to save troubled families,not merely to expedite the creation of what it might view as better ones.on the other hand,permitting a parent to raise issues which go to the validity of a final earlier appealable order would directly undermine the dominant concerns of finality and reasonable expedition underlying all juvenile dependency proceedings.meranda,supra,th at.ultimately,however,we need not decide whether relaxation of the forfeiture rule is appropriate under the facts of this case.rather,we conclude that the juvenile court order denying mother reunification services pursuant to subdivision b of section was not error,and thus affirm on that basis.
validity of bypass order under subdivision b 
as a general rule,when a child is removed from parental custody under the dependency laws,the juvenile court is required to provide reunification services to the child and the child
