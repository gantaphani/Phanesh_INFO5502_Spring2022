dwayne and rosemary seek review of the juvenile court order terminating reunification services and scheduling a selection and implementation hearing under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision l and california rules of court rule b.the parents contend the court committed reversible error by not complying with the notice requirements of the indian child welfare act the icwa et.the san diego county health and human services agency the agency counters that the icwa is inapplicable because there was insufficient indication the children are indian children,and in any event,under in re pedro th,d pedro,this court lacks jurisdiction to proceed because the parents did not appeal the jurisdictional and dispositional order in which the juvenile court addressed the icwa issue.
we conclude the icwa notice requirement is applicable.further,we respectfully disagree with pedro,and conclude that given the court continuing duty throughout the dependency proceedings to ensure the requisite notice is given rule f,and the protections the icwa affords indian children and tribes,the parents inaction does not constitute a waiver or otherwise preclude appellate review.we grant the petitions with directions.
factual and procedural background 
dwayne and rosemary have twin sons,and.at six months of age,was hospitalized for vomiting,decreased appetite and excessive sleepiness.tests revealed he had two subdural hematomas and a humeral fracture.doctors concluded his injuries were inflicted nonaccidentally.
the agency took the twins into protective custody.on august,the agency filed a petition on behalf under section,subdivision e,alleging he had been physically abused the agency also filed a petition on behalf under section,subdivision j,alleging he was at substantial risk of serious physical harm based on the nature of injuries.
in reports for the detention hearing and the combined jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,the agency stated the icwa does or may apply,but the tribe was not yet known.in paternity questionnaires,dwayne claimed he may have cherokee indian heritage and rosemary claimed dwayne does have cherokee indian heritage.
at the september jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,rosemary counsel stated rosemary does indicate that she has some cherokee american indian heritage,but she was not clear as to whether or not it was enough and whether or not she or somebody in the maternal side is eligible for enrollment so it appears the icwa may be applicable.i not exactly sure.
the court found that at this time the icwa does not apply.however,the court asked the agency to make inquiries regarding the information rosemary provided.the icwa is not mentioned further in the record aside from the agency statements in subsequent reports that it was inapplicable.the parents neither raised an objection to the ruling at the juvenile court,nor appealed the jurisdictional and dispositional order.
in february the court sustained the agency petitions.at the review hearing,the court terminated reunification services and set a selection and implementation hearing under section.the parents petitions for extraordinary writ relief followed,in which they raised for the first time the argument that the court erred by not giving notice under the icwa.this court issued an order to show cause and stayed the section hearing.the agency responded and we heard argument.after argument,we requested and received supplemental briefing from the parties on the issue of federal preemption.we have also granted the application of california indian legal services and pauma yuima band of mission indians,a indian tribe,to file an amici curiae brief in support of dwayne petition.
discussion 
iapplicability of the icwa notice requirementa 
in congress enacted the icwa to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.the icwa recognizes that the tribe has an interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield,d.the icwa presumes it is in the best interests of the child to retain tribal ties and cultural heritage and in the interest of the tribe to preserve its future generations,a most important resource.citation.congress has concluded the state courts have not protected these interests and drafted a statutory scheme intended to afford needed protection.in re desiree th,d.
the icwa confers on tribes the right to intervene at any point in state court dependency proceedings.c in re desiree,supra,th at,d.of course,the tribe right to assert jurisdiction over the proceeding or to intervene in it is meaningless if the tribe has no notice that the action is pending.in re junious d.notice ensures the tribe will be afforded the opportunity to assert its rights under the icwa irrespective of the position of the parents,indian custodian or state agencies.in re kahlen d.
to implement the notice requirement,icwa provides that where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a,italics added.if the tribe is unknown,the notice must be given to the bureau of indian affairs the bureau,as agent for the secretary of the interior.a in re edward th,d.no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the tribe or the bureau.a.
the icwa defines an indian child as an unmarried person under the age of who is a member of an indian tribe or eligible for membership in an indian tribe and the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.rule,which implements the icwa in california courts,incorporates the icwa definition for indian child without modification.rule a a b in re santos th,d.
the icwa notice requirement is not onerous.c ompliance requires no more than the completion of a preprinted form promulgated by the state of california,health and welfare agency,for the benefit of county welfare agencies.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.when proper notice is not given under the icwa,the court order is voidable.
the parents contend they raised the possibility their children are indian children within the meaning of the icwa,and the court prejudicially erred by not complying with its notice requirement.the agency counters that the court had no reason to know the children were indian children as defined by the icwa.the facts are undisputed,and the issue is one of statutory interpretation that we review independently.bostean los angeles unified school dist.th,d.
the indian status of the child need not be certain to invoke the notice requirement.citation.in re desiree,supra,th at,d in re kahlen,supra,d at.in re junious,supra,d at.enrollment is not required to be considered a member of a tribe many tribes do not have written rolls.citations.while enrollment can be one means of establishing membership,it is not the only means,nor is it determinative.citation.recently enacted section codifies the state legislature intent that the icwa applies to children who are eligible for membership in an indian tribe,even if not enrolled r ule g also specifically provides that i nformation that the child is not enrolled in the tribe is not determinative of status as an indian child.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.moreover,a child may qualify as an indian child within the meaning of the icwa even if neither of the child parents is enrolled in the tribe.in the matter of iem.
o ne of the primary purposes of giving notice to the tribe is to enable the tribe to determine whether the child involved in the proceedings is an indian child.citation.in re desiree,supra,th at,d,italics added.a tribe determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.rule g.each indian tribe has sole authority to determine its membership criteria,and to decide who meets those criteria.citation.formal membership requirements differ from tribe to tribe,as does each tribe method of keeping track of its own membership.citation.in re santos,supra,th at,d.
the bureau has issued guidelines guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings,for the implementation of the icwa.the guidelines instruct that the icwa,the guidelines themselves,and any state statutes or regulations designed to implement the act shall be liberally construed in favor of a result that is consistent with the congressional preference of deferring to tribal judgment on matters concerning indian children,supra,at.
as to when the icwa notice requirement is triggered,the guidelines provide circumstances under which a state court has reason to believe a child involved in a child custody proceeding is an indian include but are not limited to the following i any party to the case,or public agency informs the court that the child is an indian child.ii any public or agency involved in child protection services has discovered information which suggests that the child is an indian child.v an officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child may be an indian child,supra,at,italics added.in a commentary,the guidelines caution that i f anyone asserts that the child is an indian or that there is reason to believe the child may be an indian,then the court shall contact the tribe or the bureau for verification.id.at,italics added.
the guidelines are not binding on state courts.in re santos,supra,th at,d.however,cases that have resolved notice questions have followed the guidelines in giving a broad reading to the obligation to give notice and redressing notice violations even where it is unclear that the child involved is an indian child.in re,in the matter of iem,supra,at,fn.in in re junious,supra,d at page,footnote,the court was persuaded that,insofar as the icwa notice provisions are concerned,the guidelines represent a correct interpretation of the icwa.the court noted,t he construction of a statute by the executive department charged with its administration is entitled to great weight.citations.in re junious,supra,at.we also find the guidelines notice provisions persuasive.
rule harmonizes with the guidelines by imposing on the court an affirmative duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition under section has been filed is or may be an indian child.rule d,italics added.further,under rule d t he circumstances that may provide probable cause for the court to believe the child is an indian child include the receipt of information from a party or other source suggesting that the child is an indian child.rule d a,italics added.
the agency contends the terms may and suggesting in rule make the rule broader than and inconsistent with the icwa requirement that notice to the tribe is required when the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved.a.the agency asserts rule sets a far lower standard for the sending of notice under the icwa than the statute itself imposes.however,rule imposes substantively the same criteria as the guidelines for determining when notice is necessary.because the guidelines correctly interpret the icwa notice requirements,it follows that rule also does so 
in any event,the icwa establishes only minimum federal standards,and the guidelines provide that state laws offering broader protections than the icwa should be applied unless they infringe any right accorded by the icwa to an indian tribe or child,supra,at.rule does not infringe on rights bestowed by the icwa.to the contrary,rule is an important and salutary measure,designed to foster the purposes of the icwa.
in accordance with the guidelines,courts have interpreted the icwa notice provision broadly.see,in re desiree,supra,th at,d notice requirement triggered by allegation in dependency petition that the icwa possibly applied in the matter of iem,supra,at statement that the mother paternal family had some indian blood sufficient to trigger notice requirement in re,agency inclusion in report of parent statement to psychologist that his father was mohican sufficient to trigger notice requirement in interest of d,notice requirement triggered by information parent is degree indian blood of the cherokee tribe but see in re and,counsel unsupported and vague statements regarding parent indian heritage insufficient to invoke the icwa.we agree that t o maintain stability in placements of children in juvenile proceedings,it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice and examining thoroughly whether the juvenile is an indian child.citation.in re,supra,at.
here,the agency noted in reports that the icwa may apply but the specific tribe had not been determined.in paternity questionnaires,dwayne stated he may have cherokee indian heritage and rosemary stated dwayne does have cherokee indian heritage.at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing,rosemary claimed she also had cherokee indian heritage on her maternal side,but her counsel stated she was unsure of the applicability of the icwa.dwayne again claimed cherokee indian heritage,but his counsel apparently believed actual registration in a tribe was required to trigger the icwa 
although rosemary and dwayne were unsure of their status,parents are not necessarily knowledgeable about tribal government or membership and their interests may diverge from those of the tribe and those of each other.citation.in re kahlen,supra,d at.further,the comments of the parents attorneys do not constitute invited error or other waiver of appellate review.there is nothing either in the icwa or the case law interpreting it which enables anyone to waive the tribe right to notice and right to intervene in child custody matters.citations.in re desiree,supra,th at,d.
the agency complains that the parents made no evidentiary showing.the agency notes parents can contact their family and any tribe they think they may have heritage with,and seek to obtain further evidence of their indian ancestry that would show their child is or may be an indian child,take steps to become enrolled members themselves,or to enroll their children,if they truly have indian heritage and are eligible,and bring that new information to the court and seek to modify the previous orders,require notice to the tribe,and compel the application of the icwa.the icwa,however,is designed to protect indian children and tribes notwithstanding the parents inaction.marinna,supra,th at,d in re kahlen,supra,d at.the agency does not distinguish between a showing that may establish a child is an indian child within the meaning of the icwa and the minimal showing required to trigger the statutory notice provisions.
our primary aim in construing any law or administrative regulation is to determine the legislative intent.citation.in doing so we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.committee of seven thousand superior court cal d.we conclude this information gave the court reason to know that indian child ren are involved.a.at a minimum,the facts suggested that and may be indian children within the meaning of the icwa.rule.supra,at.synonyms for the term suggest include imply,hint,intimate and insinuate.american heritage dict.college ed.
the icwa notice requirement was triggered here,and the juvenile court failure to secure compliance with the notice provisions of the icwa is prejudicial error.in re kahlen,supra,d at.thus,the matter must be remanded for reconsideration after proper statutory notice is given.id.at.
the agency contends this court lacks jurisdiction to consider dwayne and rosemary petitions.in its most fundamental sense,lack of jurisdiction means an entire absence of power to hear the particular subject matter of the case.citation.in re jody d.the agency does not claim we lack subject matter jurisdiction.rather,the agency asserts state law precludes appellate review of the icwa issue because the parents did not properly perfect their right of appeal.see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,to.
