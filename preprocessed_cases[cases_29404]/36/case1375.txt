a man and a woman entered into a premarital agreement shortly before their marriage.eight years later,the woman was in a automobile accident.at one point pronounced dead,the woman survived the accident.however,she suffered brain damage,internal injuries and numerous broken bones.she underwent fifteen reconstructive surgeries and is slated to have many more.
a couple of years after the accident,her husband decided to move on.he filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.he also filed a motion to determine the validity and enforceability of the premarital agreement.in particular,he sought a determination that the waiver of spousal support was enforceable the court entered an order granting the husband motion.
the wife later sought reconsideration of the order on the basis of a newly enacted amendment to family code section.the amendment added a new subdivision,subdivision c,to section.the subdivision provides that a premarital waiver of spousal support will not be enforced if enforcement would be unconscionable at the time sought.the court denied the wife motion and entered judgment.
the wife appeals.she contends that it is unconscionable to treat her as a disposable spouse to cast her off without spousal support once she has been damaged.she argues that it is against public policy to deny her spousal support when she is mentally and physically devastated and unable to earn a living.we agree.family code section,subdivision c is a codification of existing law.a court will not enforce a premarital waiver of spousal support,whether the premarital agreement is executed before or after the effective date of family code section,subdivision c,if at the time of enforcement it would be unconscionable to do so.we reverse the order enforcing the spousal support waiver and remand to the trial court.we affirm an order concerning the status of certain jewelry and an order and a portion of the judgment concerning attorney fees.

carol own declarations are not the only information in the record concerning her injuries.her mental impairment was obvious to the court.in denying warren request for attorney fees,the court stated that while carol conduct would otherwise be sanctionable,her less than coherent state of mind,her confusion and the ensuing interruptions and delays of trial were caused by a brain injury that occurred from an auto accident during the marriage.the court also noted that there was no conscious misconduct on carol part.in a separate order,the court found that carol had an accident in august of and that she suffered injury and was left with physical and mental injuries.
procedural history 
on june,the court bifurcated the issue of the validity of the premarital agreement in an action for the dissolution of the marriage of carol and warren.on august,the court ruled the premarital agreement was valid.the court neither ruled on whether the premarital agreement was unconscionable at the time enforcement was sought nor ordered that a hearing should be conducted on that issue.
carol asked the court to reconsider the august,ruling under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c she also requested the court to retroactively apply family code section,subdivision c,which became effective on january.stats,ch.on april,the court heard carol requests.the court declined to apply family code section,subdivision c retroactively and refused to change the prior ruling.once more,although again requested to do so,the court neither ruled on whether the premarital agreement was unconscionable at the time enforcement was sought nor ordered that a hearing should be conducted on that issue.judgment on reserved issues was entered on february.
carol filed a notice of appeal from the judgment on reserved issues,the august,ruling,and certain other rulings.she now asks this court to review the trial court interpretation of family code section,subdivision c.she also argues the court never conducted a hearing on whether or not it is unconscionable to enforce the premarital agreement under the circumstances at the time of enforcement.in addition,carol contends that the court erred in finding a necklace was warren separate property and asserts that she should have been awarded attorney fees.
discussiona.uniform premarital agreement act 
the uniform premarital agreement act upaa as adopted in california,family code section et,applies to premarital agreements executed on or after january.of particular importance to this case are sections and.
section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part parties to a premarital agreement may contract with respect to all of the following any other matter,including their personal rights and obligations,not in violation of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.
section,subdivision a provides a premarital agreement is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves either of the following that party did not execute the agreement voluntarily.the agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and,before execution of the agreement,all of the following applied to that party a that party was not provided a fair,reasonable,and full disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party.b that party did not voluntarily and expressly waive,in writing,any right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided.c that party did not have,or reasonably could not have had,an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the other party.
warren contends that the spousal support waiver contained in the premarital agreement was not in violation of public policy,under section,subdivision a,and satisfies the requirements of section,subdivision a,because it was not unconscionable when executed.carol,on the other hand,says that it is neither section,subdivision a nor section,subdivision a that governs in this instance.she contends it is section,subdivision c,which was added by amendment in,that is key.stats,ch.
section,subdivision c provides any provision in a premarital agreement regarding spousal support,including,but not limited to,a waiver of it,is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement of the spousal support provision is sought was not represented by independent counsel at the time the agreement containing the provision was signed,or if the provision regarding spousal support is unconscionable at the time of enforcement while both warren and carol were represented by independent counsel when the premarital agreement was signed,carol says the agreement is unenforceable under subdivision c because enforcement would be unconscionable at this time.carol urges us to apply subdivision c to the premarital agreement at issue,even though it was executed before the date subdivision c was added by amendment.warren says that the retroactive application of the provision is unwarranted.
warren is correct that statutes do not operate retrospectively unless the legislature plainly intended them to do so.citations.western security bank superior court cal th,d.carol has provided no citation to any authority or legislative history to show that the legislature intended a retroactive application.however,there was no need for the legislature to indicate such an intent.as we shall show,the common law in effect at the time section was amended already provided that a court would not enforce a premarital waiver of spousal support if at the time enforcement was sought enforcement would be unconscionable.see ibid.legislature may amend statute to clarify,rather than change,existing law.
common law 
spousal support waivers not unenforceable per se 
in arguing the common law applicable to the enforceability of premarital spousal support waivers,both parties cite the recent california supreme court decision of in re marriage of pendleton fireman cal th,d,pendleton.in that case,the court considered whether premarital agreements containing spousal support waivers are unenforceable per se.id.at,d.it held that they are not.ibid.
in addressing the question before it,the court undertook a review and analysis of the history of the upaa.the court noted that the legislature had deleted subdivision a from section of the uniform premarital agreement act uniform act prior to adopting the act in.the omitted subdivision would have expressly permitted the parties to a premarital agreement to contract with respect to modification or elimination of spousal support.citation.pendleton,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.when first introduced on march,senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,the california version of the uniform act,included subdivision a,and thus listed among the permissible subjects of a premarital agreement the modification or elimination of spousal support.the spousal support waiver provision was deleted by amendment.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.the amendment of senate bill that deleted subdivision a simultaneously deleted a provision,subdivision b of section of the uniform act,which provided if a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that modification or elimination causes one party to the agreement to be eligible for support under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution,a court,notwithstanding the terms of the agreement,may require the other party to provide support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.bill reg.sess,assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.as enacted,senate bill became civil code former section,now family code section.id.at,d.
in reflecting on the significance of the legislature deletion of subdivision a of section of the uniform act,the pendleton court made mention of two reports by the assembly subcommittee on administration of justice.the first was prepared for an august,hearing on senate bill.senate bill repealed prior statutory law governing premarital agreements and enacted the uniform act.in the first report staff advised that california courts did not permit enforcement of premarital agreements on spousal support and recommended deletion to allow california case law to continue to prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements.assem.subcom.on admin.of justice,on bill reg.sess.for,hearing.the second report,prepared after the amendment passed,stated that as a result of the amendment california case law would prevail on the issue of spousal support in premarital agreements.there is a split in authority among the states as to whether a premarital agreement may control on the issue of spousal support.some states,such as california,do not permit a premarital agreement to control this issue assem.subcom.on admin.of justice,on bill reg.sess.as amended.pendleton,supra,cal th at,d.
after reviewing this information,the pendleton court stated that neither of the two legislative reports provided an adequate explanation as to the legislative purpose in omitting subdivision a of section of the uniform act.pendleton,supra,cal th at,d.the court pondered two possibilities the legislature may have intended to deny couples the right to enter into any premarital agreement regarding spousal support by adopting what the committee report erroneously described as the existing case law under which premarital waivers would be per se unenforceable.alternatively,the legislature may have concluded that policy governing spousal support agreements,having been established by the court in the past,should continue to evolve in the court.ibid.ultimately,the court concluded that the legislature intended to permit the common law governing premarital waivers of spousal support to evolve in the courts.id.at,d.
the pendleton court then examined the applicable common law.it completed its analysis by stating that the common law policy,based on assumptions that dissolution of marriage is contrary to public policy and that premarital waivers of spousal support may promote dissolution,is anachronistic.pendleton,supra,cal th at,d.w hen entered into voluntarily by parties who are aware of the effect of the agreement,a premarital waiver of spousal support does not offend contemporary public policy.such agreements are,therefore,permitted under section,subdivision a id.at,d.the court then concluded we need not decide here whether circumstances existing at the time enforcement of a waiver of spousal support is sought might make enforcement unjust.it is enough to conclude here that no public policy is violated by permitting enforcement of a waiver of spousal support executed by intelligent,persons,each of whom appears to be in property and earning ability,and both of whom have the advice of counsel regarding their rights and obligations as marital partners at the time they execute the waiver.such a waiver does not violate
