the minor,was adjudged a dependent child under welfare and institutions code section all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise specified.thereafter,his mother,teresa teresa,relinquished him for adoption to a private adoption agency ica,for adoption by and and.at issue in this case is the validity of that relinquishment.specifically,the question posed is whether the birth mother of a child who has been adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court may relinquish the child to a private adoption agency.
the respondent juvenile court held that a dependent child may be relinquished only to a public adoption agency and found the relinquishment of the minor by his birth mother,teresa,to ica was invalid.petitioners,teresa and the prospective adoptive parents,and,petition for writs of mandate,prohibition and habeas corpus to overturn that court order,to vacate proceedings to terminate teresa parental rights,to direct real party in interest state department of social services dss to acknowledge relinquishments of dependent children to private adoption agencies,and to deliver the minor to ica to be placed for adoption with and 
construing the applicable statutes,section and family code section,we conclude that a birth parent may relinquish a dependent child to a private adoption agency,subject to the juvenile court power to limit the parent control over the child.since the juvenile court believed teresa could not relinquish the minor to ica,the court order finding the relinquishment invalid must be reversed.we shall remand the matter to the juvenile court to exercise its discretion under section,subdivision a,to determine whether teresa control over the minor should be limited to preclude a relinquishment to ica.
factual and procedural background 
when the minor was born,teresa was serving a sentence for burglary with prior convictions.the minor was placed in confidential foster care with and when he was two days old.
on that same day,the sacramento department of health and human services dhhs filed a petition alleging the minor came within the provisions of section because teresa had a substance abuse problem from which she had failed or refused to rehabilitate and which rendered her incapable of providing adequate care and supervision for the minor.
the juvenile court held a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing two months later on july.the court found the allegations of the section petition true,adjudged the minor a dependent child,denied reunification services,and committed the minor to the care,custody and control of dhhs.before the hearing,the minor foster parents,and,told the social worker they wanted to adopt the minor.at the hearing,the social worker advised the court that and were willing to adopt,but they did not have an approved home study.
two days after the hearing,on a notice,dhhs removed the minor from and home and placed him with and and almost immediately,and moved for an order determining they were de facto parents,which was granted.they also petitioned to modify the juvenile court order at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.they claimed dhhs misinformed the court that they were not appropriate adopting parents,which led the court to approve a permanent plan of adoption with another adoptive family.they further claimed there was new evidence showing that the minor had bonded with them.
in september,and,the couple with whom dhhs had placed the minor,sought and obtained de facto parent status.the juvenile court set a review hearing under section.
on september,teresa executed a statement of understanding and a relinquishment,relinquishing the minor to ica for adoption.the statement of understanding named and as adoptive parents.two days later,dss signed an acknowledgement and receipt of the relinquishment.and then moved to vacate the trial,for an order to transfer the minor to ica,and to continue the matter for a six month review.
about two weeks later,the chief of the adoptions policy bureau of dss wrote ica that the acknowledgement of the relinquishment was void because it did not comply with section,subdivision b.according to dss,under that subdivision,a parent may relinquish a dependent child only to dss or a licensed county adoption agency.a relinquishment to a private adoption agency,such as ica,is not permitted.this letter was based on the advice of dss counsel and the concurrence of the attorney general office.
on october,the juvenile court agreed with dss interpretation of section,subdivision b,and ruled the relinquishment was invalid.the parties stipulated that and home was suitable for the minor.the parties agreed to continue the modification hearing and to join it with a section hearing.
teresa,and petitioned this court for a writ of mandate commanding the juvenile court to set aside its order of october,and to enter an order vacating the trial date,directing dhhs to deliver the minor to the custody of and,and continuing the proceedings for six months.they also petitioned for a writ of prohibition prohibiting the juvenile court from conducting any proceedings to terminate teresa parental rights and from ordering the minor placed for adoption with anyone other than and k.they sought a writ of mandate directing dss to refrain from refusing to acknowledge relinquishment of a dependent child to a private adoption agency and to take all necessary steps to validate its acknowledgement of teresa relinquishment of the minor to ica.they petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to dhhs and and commanding them to deliver the minor to ica to be placed for adoption with and finally,they sought a stay of all dependency proceedings.
this court granted the stay and issued an alternative writ to the juvenile court to grant the relief requested or show cause why such relief should not be granted.
discussion 
petitioners contend teresa had the right to relinquish the minor to ica under family code section,which provides in part either birth parent may relinquish a child to the department or a licensed adoption agency for adoption by a written statement signed before two subscribing witnesses and acknowledged before an authorized official of the department or agency,subd.a.a licensed adoption agency means both a licensed county adoption agency and a licensed private adoption agency,see also,tit,l.since family code section makes no distinction between a public and private adoption agency,petitioners contend teresa could relinquish her child to either.
a relinquishment has no effect until a certified copy is filed with dss,subd.e.a relinquishment is filed when dss signs a receipt and acknowledgement of a certified copy of the relinquishment form,tit,a a.petitioners note the paperwork for the relinquishment supports their position that a dependent child may be relinquished to a private adoption agency.the statement of understanding that teresa completed is a dss form and states it is for use by the mother or presumed father of a child who is detained,a juvenile court dependent in care,or the ward of a legal guardian.yet nothing on the document limits relinquishment to a public adoption agency.the form by which dss acknowledges and confirms receipt of the relinquishment provides various reasons why an acknowledgement could not be issued that the relinquishment is to a private adoption agency is not among the reasons listed.
the relinquishment is final upon filing with the dss and may be rescinded only by the mutual consent of dss or the adoption agency to which the child was relinquished and the birth parent relinquishing the child,subd.e.there is an exception to this rule of finality if the relinquishment names the person or persons with whom the child is to be placed and the child is not placed with such persons,subd.g.in such circumstances,the relinquishing parent has days to rescind the relinquishment,subd.h.petitioners contend the relinquishment was properly completed and filed,so it is final and must be recognized by dss,dhhs,and the juvenile court.
real parties in interest dss and dhhs contend section,subdivision b hereafter b is a more specific statute than family code section and controls in
