family code section requires a court,upon the request of a party to a divorce proceeding,to seal any pleading that lists and provides the location or identifying information about the financial assets and liabilities of the parties.we conclude that section is unconstitutional on its face.the first amendment provides a right of access to court records in divorce proceedings.while the privacy interests protected by section may override the first amendment right of access in an appropriate case,the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve overriding privacy interests.because less restrictive means exist to achieve the statutory objective,section operates as an undue burden on the first amendment right of public access to court records.
factual and procedural background 
in june,janet burkle filed a petition to dissolve her marriage to ronald burkle.several months later,burkle moved to seal or redact certain pleadings.the parties son and his parents were considered persons of high public interest.on april,the trial court ordered the redaction of various documents in order to protect the son from possible harm.the court order redacted certain financial information based solely upon the potential impact that financial information may have on the son safety.the redacted financial information consisted of residence addresses,and names and account numbers for bank and brokerage accounts.the court,however,refused to redact account balance information.it also refused burkle request to seal the parties agreement in its entirety,allowing redaction only of addresses,residences and bank and brokerage account information within the agreement.
less than two months later,the legislature passed ab,adding section to the family code as urgency legislation.the governor signed the legislation and section became effective june.subsection a of section provides 
upon request by a party to a petition for dissolution of marriage,nullity of marriage,or legal separation,the court shall order a pleading that lists the parties financial assets and liabilities and provides the location or identifying information about those assets and liabilities sealed.the request may be made by ex parte application.nothing sealed pursuant to this section may be unsealed except upon petition to the court and good cause shown.
section defines pleading as 
a document that sets forth or declares the parties assets and liabilities,income and expenses,a marital settlement agreement that lists and identifies the parties assets and liabilities,or any document filed with the court incidental to the declaration or agreement that lists and identifies financial information,subd.c.
six months after the enactment of section,on december,burkle brought an ex parte application to seal pleadings under the authority of the section the documents to be sealed included such pleadings as burkle income and expense declaration,notices of lis pendens,motions to which the parties agreement was an exhibit,pleadings that contained street addresses of real property,a motion for summary adjudication,discovery motions,and so on.
the los angeles times and the associated press collectively,the press filed a request to intervene for the purpose of opposing burkle ex parte application,arguing that the press and the public have a presumptive right of access to records and proceedings in divorce cases,and that section is unconstitutional because it requires trial courts to seal divorce court records without providing for the analysis and the threshold inquiries required by the first amendment the trial court ordered the documents filed under seal conditionally,subject to further hearing,and granted the press request to intervene.
in his opposition,burkle argued that section was presumptively constitutional,and the press had failed to balance burkle right of privacy against the press right of access,and prove that the statute does not serve a compelling purpose or that it is not narrowly tailored to achieve its purpose.in response,the press argued that section is unconstitutional because it reverses the first amendment presumption that court records are open to the public,by requiring a trial court to seal records without evaluating whether the sealing is necessary to protect a compelling interest.the press also argued that burkle bore the burden of demonstrating that section furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest,and that he failed to do so.moreover,the press argued,even if a compelling interest existed in financial privacy,section is not narrowly tailored to protect that interest because it requires the wholesale sealing of entire divorce pleadings and files.burkle advanced similar arguments 
balancing a traditional access to court files in dissolution proceedings and the right to privacy,the trial court ruled that section violated the first amendment 
the court finds that while there is a compelling state interest underpinning family code,it is not narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest and unduly burdens the competing constitutional right of public access to civil court proceedings and records.the court concludes the statute is overbroad because it mandates sealing entire pleadings to protect a limited class of specified material.the court also observes that the defect is readily curable by the legislature.
the trial court explained it had no difficulty finding that a compelling governmental interest underpinned section,as the right of privacy is guaranteed by the california constitution.however,it observed there was no compelling interest in streamlining the process of sealing confidential information to the point that the court is totally divested of discretion in all instances.responding to burkle argument that discretion should be implied,consistent with the rule that doubts should be resolved in favor of constitutionality,the court observed that there is not even a glimmer that the legislature intended court discretion.it further stated,protection of the competing right of public access requires some discretion on a basis before entire pleadings are sealed on behalf of some small portion within them.the court continued 
the statute is not unconstitutional merely because it deprives the court of discretion as to what should be sealed,but because as enacted it seals the entirety of a pleading if any of the specified materials are included in it.thus,a page pleading filled with legal argument of genuine public interest must be sealed if a party home address appears even in a footnote.absent judicial scrutiny prior to such sealing,could indeed become an instrument of gamesmanship.the statute can not be deemed narrowly tailored because it necessarily will seal material in which there is no overriding right to privacy.
the trial court thereupon vacated its provisional sealing order,but ordered the pleadings to remain sealed for days to permit burkle to seek appellate review.this appeal followed 
discussion 
introduction.
in nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,nbc subsidiary,the california supreme court held that in general,the first amendment provides a right of access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings,and that constitutional standards governing closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting id.at,d.after an extensive examination of federal and state precedents,the court concluded it is clear today that substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases are presumptively open id.at,d.the court held that the statute under of civil procedure section governing public court sittings must be interpreted to preclude closure of proceedings that satisfy the historical considerations applied by the united states supreme court in globe newspaper superior court,d globe.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.the presumption of openness,or preclusion of closure,in ordinary civil cases applies unless the trial court provides notice of a contemplated closure,and holds a hearing and expressly finds that 
i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
this case requires us to decide whether the presumption of openness applicable to substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases likewise applies to court records in divorce proceedings and,if so,whether section is a constitutionally permissible restriction on the right of access under the standards announced in nbc subsidiary.we conclude the presumption of openness applies,and section is unconstitutional specifically,we conclude that 
in general,the same first amendment right of access applicable in ordinary civil cases applies in divorce proceedings.
no meaningful distinction may be drawn between the right of access to courtroom proceedings and the right of access to court records that are the foundation of and form the adjudicatory basis for those proceedings.consequently,court records in divorce cases,as in other civil cases,are presumptively open.
when a statute mandates sealing presumptively open court records in divorce cases,as section does,the state justification for the mandatory sealing rule must be scrutinized to determine whether the statute conforms to the requirements enunciated in nbc subsidiary.that is,a mandatory sealing rule is permissible only if an overriding interest supports the sealing rule a substantial probability of prejudice to that interest exists absent the sealing the sealing required by the statute is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and no less restrictive means is available to achieve the overriding interest.see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.
in this case,section mandated sealing of location and identifying information about assets and liabilities is supported by privacy rights,thus meeting the first requirement.moreover,the statute arguably meets the second requirement,as we ordinarily defer to legislative findings on the probability of prejudice,in the form of identity theft and the like,to the privacy interest protected by the statute.however,the statute clearly runs afoul of the third and fourth requirements,because it is neither narrowly tailored to serve the privacy interest being protected nor is it the least restrictive means of protecting those privacy interests.
in the succeeding sections,we discuss each point necessary to our conclusion that section is a constitutionally impermissible burden on the first amendment right of public access to court records 
b.the same first amendment right of access applicable in ordinary civil cases applies in divorce proceedings.
we begin where the supreme court ended in nbc subsidiary,with the now settled principle that substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases are presumptively open.the court reached that conclusion after exhaustively analyzing federal and state precedents on the first amendment right of access.while that analysis need not be repeated,we will describe the principles employed by the united states supreme relied upon in nbc confirm the existence and scope of the right of access,because those are the principles that must be used to determine whether the right of access applicable to ordinary civil cases also applies to divorce proceedings.
as nbc subsidiary instructs,the first amendment generally precludes the closure of proceedings that satisfy the high court historical considerations nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.these considerations,first identified in richmond newspapers,virginia,d richmond newspapers,were confirmed in globe,supra,d.globe,which established the first amendment right of access to criminal trials,considered that the criminal trial historically was open to the press and the general public,a uniform rule of openness the historical tradition and the institutional value of the open criminal trial was recognized in both logic and experience the utility consideration id.at.after analyzing the reasoning in globe and subsequent high court cases,our supreme court observed that 
t he high court has not accepted review of any of the numerous lower court cases that have found a general first amendment right of access to civil proceedings,and we have not found a single lower court case holding that generally there is no first amendment right of access to civil proceedings.under these circumstances,we believe there is no reason to doubt that,in general,the first amendment right of access applies to civil proceedings as well as to criminal proceedings.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.
the court stated its belief that the public has an interest,in all civil cases,in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system,and that interest strongly supports a general right of access in ordinary civil cases.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.in short,the court concluded that civil proceedings,like criminal proceedings,satisfied the high court two considerations historical tradition and the utility or institutional value of open trials.t he dicta in the high court criminal cases,and the clear holdings of numerous civil progeny of those cases,convincingly conclude that the utilitarian values supporting public criminal trials and proceedings apply with at least equal force in the context of ordinary civil trials and proceedings.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
the question for this court is whether divorce proceedings are sufficiently different from ordinary civil trials and proceedings to justify a different conclusion on the right of access.we do not think so.to be sure,the supreme court in nbc subsidiary stated that its opinion addressed the right of access to ordinary civil proceedings in general,and not any right of access to particular proceedings governed by specific statutes.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d.as to those proceedings,footnote referred to differing opinions from other courts in cases involving parental termination proceedings and juvenile proceedings,and listed the family code,as well as the code of civil procedure and the welfare and institutions code,as providing for the closure of certain civil proceedings nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d.while burkle relies on footnote to conclude that nbc subsidiary requirements do not apply to divorce proceedings,we do not agree.the supreme court care in confining its decision to the case at hand,and its mention of the family code among statutes that provide for closure of certain proceedings,does not portend or imply that divorce proceedings are not among the ordinary civil proceedings that are presumptively open.the court simply did not address that question.
to determine whether divorce proceedings are presumptively open,we follow the principles enunciated by the supreme court in nbc subsidiary proceedings that satisfy the high court historical considerations are presumptively open.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.we therefore assess those two considerations.
first,as nbc subsidiary directs,we look to historical tradition,and find nothing to suggest that,in general,civil trials in divorce cases have not historically been open to the public just as any other civil trial.to be sure,section of the family code provides an exception to the general statutory rule that the sittings of every court are to be public.code of civ.section authorizes the court,when it considers it necessary in the interests of justice and the persons involved,to direct the trial of any issue of fact joined in a proceeding under this code to be private section,however,is obviously the exception,not the general rule,in divorce cases.we do not doubt that divorce cases in particular and family law in general may produce a greater abundance of situations in which it is appropriate,in the interests of justice and the persons involved,to try a particular fact issue privately.the existence of an expressly limited exception to a general rule,however,does not obviate the general rule.we are not aware of,and burkle does not offer,any cases or commentary supporting the notion that divorce proceedings have ever been generally excepted from california historical tradition of presumptively open civil proceedings.indeed,in the context of court records,which we address in the succeeding section,california courts have made the point virtually unassailable n o california case holds or even hints that the principles articulated in these cases the generally open nature of court files vary when family law litigation is involved in general,court files in family law cases should be treated no differently than the court files in any other cases for purposes of considering the appropriateness of granting a motion to seal any of those files.in re marriage of lechowick th,d,fn.omitted lechowick.
second,and again in accordance with globe and nbc subsidiary,we look to the utility considerations the institutional value of the open trial globe,supra,at.enunciated in those cases.nbc subsidiary concluded that the utilitarian values supporting public criminal trials and proceedings apply with at least equal force in the context of ordinary civil trials and proceedings.nbc subsidiary,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.nbc subsidiary mentioned a court of appeal decision not ing the utility of open access in civil cases,and referred to probate and juvenile court cases.id.at,fn,d,see brian superior court cal d,upholding juvenile court discretion to permit press attendance at a fitness hearing and observing that the high court has repeatedly recognized the salutary function served by the press in encouraging the fairness of trials and subjecting the administration of justice to the beneficial effects of public scrutiny also describing a commission report concerning the benefit of greater participation by the press in juvenile court proceedings estate of hearst d.probate case stating that i f public court business is conducted in private,it becomes impossible to expose corruption,incompetence,inefficiency,prejudice,and favoritism jurisprudence favors a policy of maximum public access to proceedings and records of judicial tribunals.as the supreme court further observed 
public access plays an important and specific structural role in the conduct of civil trials.public access to civil proceedings serves to i demonstrate that justice is meted out fairly,thereby promoting public confidence in such governmental proceedings ii provide a means by which citizens scrutinize and check the use and possible abuse of judicial power and iii enhance the truthfinding function of the proceeding.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.
long before nbc subsidiary,the high court observed that in some civil cases the public interest in access,and the salutary effect of publicity,may be as strong as,or stronger than,in most criminal cases.gannett depasquale,fn,d.we are unable to discern,from policy and precedent,any principled basis for concluding that the same utilitarian values that apply with at least equal force in criminal and civil trials nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,somehow lose their potency in the context of divorce proceedings.
burkle insists divorce cases are not ordinary civil proceedings.consequently,the presumption of openness does not apply and nbc subsidiary test should not be used his rationale is that family law proceedings are governed by their own rules of court,making family law proceedings sui generis.the argument misses the mark for two reasons.first,it ignores entirely the analysis mandated by globe and nbc subsidiary for determining whether court proceedings are presumptively open whether they satisfy the high court historical considerations just discussed.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.second,the contention that family law proceedings have their own rules and may be considered sui generis is correct,but irrelevant.the same may be said of criminal proceedings and probate proceedings,which are nonetheless presumptively open.globe,supra,d see estate of hearst,supra,d at.a bsent strong countervailing reasons,the public has a legitimate interest and right of general access to court records,one of special importance when probate involves a large estate with trusts which reputedly administer and control a major publishing empire.
burkle asserts several other reasons for concluding the nbc subsidiary analysis is inapplicable in this case.none are meritorious.
first,burkle argues that financial privacy is an inalienable right now enshrined in the california constitution and was not at issue in nbc subsidiary moreover,when the california constitution was amended in to expressly provide for the broad construction of statutes furthering the people right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people business,the amendment specifically provided that it did not modify the constitutional right of privacy or affect the construction of any statute protecting the right to privacy from this,burkle deduces the nbc subsidiary test should not be used to evaluate the constitutionality of section.we do not agree.no authority supports the notion that the constitutional right of privacy is to be treated differently from any other potentially overriding interest for purposes of first amendment analysis.nbc subsidiary did not involve the right to privacy,but it implicated the right to a fair and impartial jury in civil proceedings.other overriding interests analyzed by the courts have been premised upon rights of constitutional dimension.globe,supra,d protection of minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment superior court of cal,d i privacy interests of a prospective juror during individual voir dire superior court,d criminal defendant right to fair and impartial trial.we scarcely need note that state constitutional privacy rights do not automatically trump the first amendment right of access under the united states constitution.neither constitutional right is absolute.in short,burkle suggestion that the california constitution tells us how those interests privacy and first amendment access must be weighed is without merit.
second,burkle contends that section specifies the grounds for sealing records,whereas nbc subsidiary involved an absence of legislative guidance and the consequent need for judicial intervention the statute at of civil procedure section,which provides generally that the sittings of every court must be not identify the findings that were necessary to close a civil proceeding.this argument ignores the fact that the supreme court analysis of section was necessitated by its conclusion that the first amendment provides a right of access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings,thus requiring section to be construed in accordance with first amendment requirements.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.precisely the same analysis necessarily applies to section.moreover,burkle argument presumes the very point at issue.the fact that section states the circumstances under which a pleading must be sealed on it lists and provides the location or identifying information about assets and not answer the question whether divorce proceedings are presumptively open,or whether the statute comports with the first amendment right of access 
in sum,the two considerations that require a presumption of openness in substantive courtroom tradition and the utility or institutional value of open with equal force in divorce cases as in any other ordinary civil case.divorce cases undoubtedly present issues different from those in other civil cases.in that sense,divorce cases are,as burkle suggests,sui generis.however,the factors that differentiate divorce cases from ordinary civil cases the intrusions into family privacy that accompany the dissolution of intimate not support burkle view that no first amendment right of access exists in divorce cases instead,the factors unique to marital dissolutions are weighed in the balancing process that necessarily occurs in a decision whether to close divorce proceedings or to seal records that are presumptively open.in other words,divorce cases are different only in that they present different factors to be weighed in the balance against first amendment access rights.indeed,the issues distinguishing divorce cases from other civil as psychological evaluations in child custody disputes and the often the subject of statutory exceptions to the general rule of public access,in which the legislature has already engaged in the necessary balancing of privacy rights and public access rights.nothing about these exceptions contradicts the conclusion that both historical tradition and the institutional value of open proceedings mandate a presumption of openness in divorce proceedings just as in other civil cases.accordingly,an assessment of the constitutionality of section must comport with the standards enunciated in nbc subsidiary.
no meaningful distinction may be drawn between the right of access to courtroom proceedings and the right of access to court records.
before applying the standards required by nbc subsidiary,we address burkle further contention that nbc subsidiary does not apply because section does not involve the closure of court proceedings,but merely the sealing of court records which can be accessed again at any time by any person upon a showing of good cause.burkle does not inform us as to the nature of the good cause the press or public could show to obtain access,nor does he cite any persuasive authority distinguishing the closure of court proceedings from the closure of court records for first amendment purposes the precedents suggest no such distinction.
as nbc subsidiary points out,numerous reviewing courts likewise have found a first amendment right of access to civil litigation documents filed in court as a basis for adjudication.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,fn,d,citing,for example,brown williamson tobacco cir,vacating orders sealing documents filed in civil litigation i n either the civil or the criminal courtroom,secrecy insulates the participants,masking impropriety,obscuring incompetence,and concealing corruption rushford new yorker magazine,cir,first amendment standards apply to issue of press access to documents filed in connection with a summary judgment motion in a civil case copley press,superior court th,d observing that the first amendment provides broad access rights to judicial hearings and records and that a lengthy list of authorities confirms this right in general,and in particular as it pertains to the press,both in criminal and civil cases fn.omitted.and,in green uccelli d,the court stated that the contents of the file of a divorce proceeding are historically and presumptively a matter of public record.id.at.see also lechowick,supra,th at,d i n general,court files in family law cases should be treated no differently than the court files in any other cases for purposes of considering the appropriateness of granting a motion to seal any of those files fn.omitted in re providian credit card cases th,d fn.nbc subsidiary test applies to the sealing of records,quoting judicial council of,advisory committee comment to california rules of court,rule rules and were adopted to comply with the supreme court decision.
in short,no basis exists for concluding that court records should be differentiated from courtroom proceedings for purposes of first amendment access rights.court records in divorce proceedings,like divorce proceedings themselves,are presumptively open,and the standards delineated in globe and nbc subsidiary apply.we turn now to those standards and their application in this case.
application of globe and nbc subsidiary principles to section compels the conclusion that the statute runs afoul of constitutional requirements.
section mandates the sealing of presumptively open court records at the request of either party to a divorce proceeding.under nbc subsidiary,the mandatory sealing of presumptively open records is constitutionally permissible only if an overriding interest supports the sealing rule a substantial probability of prejudice to that interest exists absent the sealing the sealing required by the statute is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and no less restrictive means are available to achieve the overriding interest.see nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d.under globe,the test is similar where the state attempts to deny the right of access in order to inhibit the disclosure of sensitive information,it must be shown that the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest,and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.globe,supra,at.under either formulation,section is unconstitutional,as it is not narrowly tailored to serve the privacy interests it is intended to protect,and less restrictive means of protecting the privacy interests are available.section thus fails the third and fourth factors of the nbc subsidiary test.
the first factor the overriding privacy interest.
we entertain no doubt that,in appropriate circumstances,the right to privacy may be properly described as a compelling or overriding interest.the right to privacy is an inalienable right guaranteed under the california constitution,and has been acknowledged as an overriding interest in certain individualized contexts.i,supra,at.privacy interests of a prospective juror during individual voir dire.the right to privacy extends to one personal financial information.valley bank of nevada superior court cal d,we may safely assume that the right of privacy extends to one confidential financial affairs as well as to the details of one personal life.this does not mean that parties who come to court,voluntarily or not,are entitled to privacy in respect of court records that are,as discussed at length,ante,presumptively public records nevertheless,if there is a substantial probability of prejudice to a privacy interest of higher value than the public right of access to court as,in this case,the avoidance of identity theft or other crimes relating to the misuse of personal financial statute narrowly tailored to serve the privacy interest may be constitutionally permissible.see i,supra,at.t he presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.
the second factor a substantial probability of prejudice to the overriding interest absent the sealing.
we are less sanguine about the existence of a substantial probability of prejudice to divorcing litigants privacy interests absent the sealing mandated by section.burkle asserts that the legislative history of section is replete with evidence of the legislature concern about the risk of identity theft and other misuse of the personal financial information which divorcing parties must disclose.the legislative history indicates that the bill author cited numerous anecdotes of stolen identities.more specifically 
according to the author,concerns about identity theft,stalking,kidnapping of the divorcing couple children,theft of art works and other property,and other crimes have instigated parties and their attorneys to file motions to make such records private under seal since the courts decisions in uccelli and lechowick stating that general principles against protecting personal information in civil cases apply to family law cases as well,concerns related to financial privacy and identity theft resulting from information made available to the public on the internet and public documents such as court filings have indeed proliferated.the author notes that accounts of the ease by which criminals have accessed financial and other identifying information of private individuals have attracted intense media attention.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
the press concedes that identity theft is a serious problem and that litigants have a privacy interest in their bank account and social security numbers.however,the press insists the state does not have a compelling interest in drawing a veil of secrecy over the financial as the assets held by the the heart of a divorce proceeding and the basis for a divorce court decision on the division of marital property.even if there is a compelling interest in protecting divorcing litigants from identity theft and other crimes,the press asserts there is no empirical evidence that section furthers that interest.
the legislative history provides scant evidence that sealing pleadings in divorce cases is necessitated by the risk of identify theft or other crimes,since it consists principally of anecdotes and concerns about identity theft.notably,the legislative history also shows the bill author cited intrusive and unjust media publicity about divorcing couples with substantial assets,and stated the public clearly has no need to know what assets a couple has accumulated,where those assets are located,and how those assets are to be divided.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.on the other hand,it is not the judiciary function to reweigh the legislative facts underlying a legislative enactment american bank trust community hospital cal d,and in some cases the existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is presumed.see dribin superior court cal d.consequently,while we entertain some doubt as to the linkage between access to court documents and identity theft,we defer,for purposes of this analysis,to the presumed legislative findings,and conclude that a statute narrowly drawn to protect divorcing parties from identity theft by denying the right of access to sensitive information would be constitutionally permissible.
the third factor the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve an overriding interest in protecting divorcing couples from identify theft and other misuse of private information.
section runs afoul of the constitutional requirement that a statute which seals presumptively open court records must be narrowly tailored to serve the privacy interest being this case,the avoidance of identify theft and other crimes founded on the misuse of private information.the reach of the statute extends far beyond the overriding interest in protecting divorcing litigants from identity theft,kidnapping,stalking,theft or other financial crimes,and the defect is apparent from the face of the statute.
section mandates the sealing,on request,of any as a declaration or document setting forth assets and liabilities,a marital settlement agreement,and any document incidental to a declaration or marital provides the location or identifying information about the parties assets and liabilities,subds.a c.consequently,routine as,in this case,a motion for summary judgment,discovery motions,and so any location or identifying information about assets may be sealed without regard to the content of the remainder of the pleading.moreover,the statute closes to public view not only the identifying information that would facilitate identity theft or other financial security numbers,account numbers,all information pertaining to any asset,including its existence,its value,the provisions of any agreement relating to the asset,and any contentions that may be made about the resolution of disputes over an asset.in short,much of the information contained in documents as to which sealing is mandated may be completely unrelated to the asserted statutory goal of preventing identify theft and financial crimes.
burkle asserts section is narrowly tailored to prevent the kind of harm the statute seeks to forestall because it applies only to divorce cases which require the parties to divulge personal financial information,and only to the pleadings that list and identify assets not to all pleadings.we are not persuaded.the harm that the statute seeks to overriding interest it must be narrowly tailored to,as burkle states elsewhere,the risk of identity theft and other misuse of personal financial information which divorcing parties are required to disclose.section,however,mandates the sealing of the entirety of any pleadings that list and identify or locate assets and liabilities.it is plainly not narrowly tailored to seal only the information which arguably presents a risk of identity theft or other misuse,such as credit card numbers,account numbers,social security numbers and the like.
burkle also contends the statute is narrowly tailored because it provides for particularized determinations in individual cases,citing globe,supra,at,fn.in globe,the high court held that a rule of mandatory closure of criminal trials during the testimony of minor sex victims was constitutionally infirm,because it failed to require particularized determinations in individual cases ibid.section,burkle claims,provides for not merely one but two particularized determinations in individual cases,because a party must ask for sealing,and the trial court reviews the documents to confirm they contain identifying information before ordering them sealed and documents may be unsealed if good cause is shown.again,we are not persuaded.an ex parte application that can not be denied unless the applicant asks to seal documents containing no asset information is not,we are confident,the kind of particularized determination contemplated by the high court in globe.moreover,the possibility of later unsealing documents,upon a petition and showing of good cause,is entirely irrelevant to the pertinent question under nbc subsidiary whether the initial sealing mandated by the statute is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding interest in protecting divorcing parties from identity theft and other financial crimes.clearly it is not 
the fourth factor less restrictive alternatives.
burkle argues that section is constitutional because the press did not meet its burden of showing there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.nbc subsidiary,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.the press only proposal,burkle asserts,was the redaction of specific identifying information instead of sealing the document in which the information appears.while burkle correctly states that the burden of demonstrating reasonable alternatives rests with the press id.at,fn,d,he suggests no reason why redaction is not a reasonable alternative to effect the statutory purpose he merely states that redaction is unnecessary where the sealing statute is already so narrowly tailored,and that any benign information is inextricably intertwined with prejudicial information.both points are without substance.as we previously concluded,the statute is not narrowly tailored,and the claim that benign and prejudicial information is inextricably intertwined is entirely speculative,since the statute allows sealing without any such assessment.see people jackson th,d redacting information from a search warrant affidavit was impossible because benign information was inextricably intertwined with prejudicial information.in short,it is obvious that less restrictive alternatives exist,and burkle argument to the contrary is without merit.see globe,supra,at.statute mandating closure could not be viewed as a narrowly tailored means of accommodating state compelling interest in safeguarding the of a minor t hat interest could be served just as well by requiring the trial court to determine on a basis whether the state legitimate concern for the of the minor victim necessitates closure.
section can not be interpreted or reformed to avoid constitutional infirmity.
finally,burkle alternatively argues that section should be construed to authorize judges to seal or redact only the specified financial information rather than the entirety of the pleading in which it was contained.specifically,burkle suggests that subdivision a,which states that 
the court shall order a pleading that lists the parties financial assets and liabilities sealed 
should be construed to mean that 
the court shall order that part of a pleading sealed,redacted.
this minor emendation,according to burkle,would be consistent with the legislative intent to protect only the specified financial information and is clearly preferable to outright invalidation of the statute.we conclude this is not a proper case in which to reform the statute to preserve its constitutionality.
it is settled that courts should interpret statutes to avoid constitutional infirmities and that,in an appropriate case,a court may reform or rewrite a statute to preserve it against invalidation.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,kopp.the rule is this 
a court may,rewrite a statute in order to preserve it against invalidation under the constitution,when we can say with confidence that i it is possible to reform the statute in a manner that closely effectuates policy judgments clearly articulated by the enacting body,and ii the enacting body would have preferred the reformed construction to invalidation of the statute.ibid.
the kopp standards for reformation of a statute are not met in this case.
the text of the statute and its legislative history make it apparent that we can not say with confidence that burkle proposed rewriting of the statute,or any other rewriting,would closely effectuate policy judgments clearly articulated by the legislature.kopp,supra,cal th at,d.the legislative intention was clear the legislature intended to establish procedures for keeping the location or identifying information about the assets and liabilities of the parties in a dissolution matter sealed.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.moreover,the procedures selected by the the sealing,on an ex parte basis,of any document containing information on marital assets and clearly intended to streamline the process of sealing documents in dissolution proceedings by entirely eliminating the need for individualized determinations of good cause to justify a sealing order however,the streamlining procedure selected by the sine qua non of the,as we have seen,incompatible with constitutional requirements.further,as the trial court observed,there is not even a glimmer of legislative intent to authorize trial court discretion to redact specified financial information,rather than to mandate sealing of entire pleadings.and,even if we were to construe section as burkle redact that part of the pleadings containing lists of assets and identifying statute as so construed would shield from public view not only the information necessary to achieve the legislative purpose of preventing identity theft and other crimes,but also,we presume,all other information pertaining to any asset or liability,including its existence,nature and value.information on the nature and value of marital assets,however,has little to do with the legislature only clearly articulated policy judgment its interest in preventing disclosure of identifying information and location of assets and liabilities that would subject divorcing couples to criminal activity.
moreover,an interpretation of the statute that would render it constitutional would necessarily amount to a wholesale revision of the statute,and would require us to interpret the statute to mean,in some respects,precisely the opposite of what it states.for example,section not only mandates sealing of pleadings with identifying information about assets without regard to the remainder of the pleading contents,but also prohibits unsealing except upon petition to the court and good cause shown,subd.a.as the press correctly points out,this provision effectively destroys the presumption of access to court records by automatically sealing them and placing the burden of showing good cause for unsealing them on the party presumptively entitled to access.this burden on the party presumptively entitled to access is,by definition,wholly at odds with the presumption.see oregonian pub.dist.court for dist.of or.cir,under the first amendment,the party seeking access is entitled to a presumption of entitlement to disclosure and it is the burden of the party seeking closure to present facts supporting closure mary d.the burden rests on the party seeking to deny public access to those records to establish compelling reasons why and to what extent these records should be made private.the legislature obviously intended this impermissible result,and we can not construe the statute contrary to its plain meaning.
to summarize,reforming section to render it constitutional would require us to construe the statute to provide for trial court discretion to redact rather than,as the statutory language provides,mandatory sealing.alternatively,it would require us to construe section to provide for mandatory redaction of parts of pleadings rather than,as the statutory language states,sealing of entire pleadings,and to determine which parts of the pleading should be automatically redacted and,it would require us to conclude that section does not place the burden of showing good cause for unsealing on the party presumptively entitled to access,when it plainly does exactly that.these constructions of the statute are not in accordance with its plain language,nor do they closely effectuate policy judgments clearly articulated by the legislature.kopp,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,it is impossible to discern how the legislature would have chosen to proceed in light of the constitutional infirmity we have described and we can not,consistent with the principles established in kopp,reform the statute to preserve its constitutionality.
conclusion 
the first amendment provides a right of access to court records in divorce proceedings,just as in other ordinary civil cases.while the interest in protecting divorcing parties from identity theft and other financial crimes may override the first amendment right of access in a proper case,section is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest.because less restrictive means of achieving the statutory objective are available,section is unconstitutional on its face as an undue burden on the first amendment right of public access to court records.
disposition 
the trial court order of february,vacating its provisional sealing order of december,is affirmed,and the stay ordered by the trial court is vacated.costs are awarded to respondent and intervenors.
all further statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise indicated.
section also states that the judicial council form used to declare assets and liabilities must require the filing party to state whether the declaration contains identifying information on the assets and liabilities listed therein.if the party uses a pleading other than the judicial council form,the pleading must exhibit a notice on the front page,in bold capital letters,that the pleading lists and identifies financial information and is therefore subject to section,subd.b.section further contains service requirements,subd.d and a provision stating that it does not preclude a party from using any document or information contained in a sealed pleading in any manner that is not otherwise prohibited by law,subd.e.
after the trial court april,redaction order,the parties counsel agreed on a procedure to redact portions of the files.section became law before that procedure could be implemented.the parties then deferred the redacting process because,according to a declaration from burkle counsel,each of the documents which was to have been redacted now is subject to being sealed under the new statute.
we refer to divorce proceedings for sake of simplicity.the statute refers to proceedings for dissolution of marriage,nullity of marriage,or legal separation,subd.a.
burkle response purported to incorporate a writ petition and reply she had filed with the court of appeal,and counsel declined the opportunity to resubmit his arguments to the trial court in a form complying with court rules.the trial court struck the improperly incorporated appellate pleadings from burkle response.
burkle moved to dismiss burkle appeal,asserting the trial court order was not appealable.this court heard oral argument on the appealability issue and,on july,denied burkle motion,concluding the order was appealable as a final order on a collateral matter.
burkle contends that section also violates equal protection and separation of powers principles.the trial court did not rule on these contentions,and we see no reason to consider them.
the parties have filed two requests for judicial notice and one motion to augment the record.burkle requests judicial notice of various documents relating to the legislative history of section.while a few of the items submitted are not properly cognizable legislative history letters to legislators from interested parties,the request is granted as to the remainder of the documents.see kaufman broad communities,performance
