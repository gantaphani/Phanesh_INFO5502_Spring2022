donald klug donald appeals from a postjudgment order denying his motion for division of a community asset omitted from the marital termination agreement mta specifically,the awarded to respondent lynn klug lynn in settlement of her legal malpractice lawsuit against the couple former attorney.donald contends the court erred in ruling that the settlement proceeds were lynn separate property.he argues that the malpractice cause of action accrued during the marriage and the settlement proceeds were a community asset.
the trial court ruled that the settlement was lynn separate property and not subject to division as an omitted asset because the cause of action for the malpractice case against christensen accrued after separation.italics added.a trial court decision will be upheld even where it is based on an incorrect rule of law,as long as a sound basis for the decision exists.in short,we will affirm a judgment or order if it is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case,even if it is right for the wrong reasons.citation.conservatorship of davidson th,d see davey southern pac.cal.because the trial court factual findings also support the finding that lynn cause of action for legal malpractice arose after separation,we shall affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
events during the marriage 
the parties were married on june.in january,donald engaged the services of attorney craig christensen christensen to set up a limited partnership to protect the couple assets from possible litigation involving donald medical practice.christensen prepared documentation for the klug family limited partnership kflp under which donald was the sole general partner and lynn the sole limited partner.lynn signed the documents creating the kflp without meeting or speaking with christensen.
in december,approximately one month before the parties separation,donald,as general partner of the kflp,withdrew from the community brokerage account.he personally carried the funds to england and deposited them in a new fortis hereafter referred to as garnick trust account under his control on the isle of man.earlier,lynn had told donald that she did not want the funds transferred overseas.
events after separation 
donald and lynn separated on january.at the time of separation,they had a percent community property interest in two businesses known as sierra hemodialysis,shi and sierra dialysis services sds.the other percent was owned by donald business partner.
donald filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage on december.in late december or early january,donald sold their community interest in shi and sds,netting million.in march,donald placed the proceeds of the sale in christensen corporate trust account before transferring million into a charitable remainder trust in donald name in lichtenstein.donald also transferred into a second charitable remainder trust in lynn name in roseville,california.christensen prepared the documents that created the charitable remainder trusts.
also in march,donald transferred of community funds to an account under his control on the isle of guernsey.christensen prepared the documentation used to transfer this money.
on june,in the family law proceedings the court entered a bifurcated judgment of dissolution as to status only.in october,donald transferred of community funds overseas to purchase an insurance policy to protect him against damages he anticipated in a pending lawsuit.
on december,lynn filed a complaint for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against christensen,donald,and others involved in the management,transfer and valuation of the community property.lynn alleged christensen negligently and carelessly represented,advised and counseled her and failed to protect her rights and interests in the preparation of the kflp.she further alleged that christensen failed to advise her of the probable actual conflict of interest that existed in the preparation of the kflp and thereby caused her to give up legal rights and interest in community assets that she would not have otherwise relinquished.she did not list the lawsuit in the mta,nor did she inform donald of the lawsuit or serve the complaint on him during negotiations for division of property in the dissolution proceedings.lynn eventually dismissed donald from the malpractice action.
in may,donald and lynn entered into a stipulated judgment and mta which purported to list and divide all community property assets and liabilities of the parties.the parties disagree on whether the mta resulted in an equal division of the community assets.
in may,lynn settled her malpractice lawsuit against christensen for.donald filed his motion for division of the omitted asset four months later.he stated that he would not have signed the mta had he known about the lawsuit.
c.the trial court decision 
after reviewing the extensive pleadings filed by donald and lynn and hearing oral argument,the trial court issued its written decision denying donald motion on october.the court began by framing the issues in terminology associated with the characterization of personal injury damages under the family code it all comes down to one question.did the cause of action arise during marriage or did the cause of action arise by the mere drafting of the estate planning documents or when they were acted upon in derogation to klug rights italics added.later in the written decision,the court shifted to the statute of limitation terminology,stating that t he general rule in a legal malpractice suit is that the cause of action accrues when the negligent conduct causes damage.italics added.citing budd nixen cal d,budd and neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,neel,the court explained that a cause of action for legal malpractice accrues when the negligent conduct causes damage and the client discovers,or should discover,the facts that establish the cause of action.the court described the and offshore transfers of funds by donald and christensen as the basis for the malpractice suit,and found that the cause of action against christensen did not accrue until after the parties separated.the court ruled that s uch a finding makes the recovery klug sole and separate property and not subject to division as an omitted asset.
discussion 
icharacterization of tort damages as community or separate property 
family code section,which authorizes a motion to divide an omitted asset,is applicable to either community estate assets or community estate liabilities the operable term is community.if the allegedly omitted asset is the separate property of one of the parties,it is not subject to division under section for purposes of applying section,the characterization of tort damages as separate or community property turns on when the cause of action arose.
the family code defines community property and separate property for purposes of characterization and division.section states the general rule except as otherwise provided by statute,all property,real or personal,wherever situated,acquired by a married person during the marriage while domiciled in this state is community property.
a cause of action to recover money damages,as well as the money recovered is a chose in action and therefore a form of personal property.vick dacorsi th,fn,d see parker walker th,d see also,every kind of property that is not real is personal.to determine whether a particular cause of action is separate or community property,we look to sections and which guide courts in the characterization and division of personal injury damages.
section,an exception to section,which characterizes personal injury damages as community property,reads in relevant part money or other property received or to be received by a married person in satisfaction of a judgment for damages for personal injuries,or pursuant to an agreement for the settlement or compromise of a claim for those damages,is the separate property of the injured person if the cause of action for the damages arose as follows while either spouse,if he or she is the injured person,is living separate from the other spouse.italics added.
section provides additional guidance on what constitutes community estate personal injury damages and how to divide them on dissolution.
a community estate personal injury damages as used in this section means all money or other property received or to be received by a person in satisfaction of a judgment for damages for the person personal injuries or pursuant to an agreement for the settlement or compromise of a claim for the damages,if the cause of action for the damages arose during the marriage but is not separate property as described in section,unless the money or other property has been commingled with other assets of the community estate.
b community estate personal injury damages shall be assigned to the party who suffered the injuries unless the court,after taking into account the economic condition and needs of each party,the time that has elapsed since the recovery of the damages or the accrual of the cause of action,and all other facts of the case,determines that the interests of justice require another disposition.in such a case,the community estate personal injury damages shall be assigned to the respective parties in such proportions as the court determines to be just,except that at least of the damages shall be assigned to the party who suffered the injuries.italics added.
the finding of a trial court that property is either separate or community in character is binding and conclusive on the appellate court if it is supported by sufficient evidence,or if it is based on conflicting evidence or upon evidence that is subject to different inferences citations.beam bank of america cal d,beam,see also millington millington d.
the legal malpractice cause of action 
a cause of action is a legal obligation the plaintiff seeks to enforce against the defendant.turner milstein d,citing frost witter cal.it does not come into existence or arise until all the elements have been established moreover,a cause of action is not property and can not be characterized until it exists.as a practical matter,a cause of action generally arises for the first time when the injury is suffered.see hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law,supra.once injury occurs,the injured party has a property interest which can be valued and characterized as separate or community property.
the elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.citations.if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence.citations.budd,supra,cal d at.actionable injury,however,may occur at any one of several points in time subsequent to an attorney negligence.hence,as with other causes of action,the determination of the date of injury is generally a question of fact.adams paul cal th,d,adams.
as we explained,the question whether the settlement was community property subject to division under donald section motion turns on whether the legal malpractice cause of action arose during the marriage or after separation.
the parties and the trial court confused and sometimes used interchangeably the terms arose and accrued when referring to the legal malpractice cause of action.the distinction between arose and accrue is important because statutes of limitation have a different theoretical basis and practical effect than causes of action as defined by substantive case law.once the distinction between the two terms is understood,it is clear the date lynn cause of action accrued for statute of limitations purposes was irrelevant to the question before the court in the family law is,when the cause of action arose.
statutes of limitation are legislative enactments that limit the time period in which a plaintiff can bring his or her cause of action in court.they do not alter the legal obligation and injury underlying plaintiff claim.instead,statutes of limitation set the period of time beyond which a plaintiff may not seek redress in court.norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart.for statute of limitations purposes,the time for filing a complaint starts to run on the date the cause of action accrued.although a cause of action for legal malpractice usually arises and accrues at the same time,delayed discovery sometimes tolls the statute of limitation and changes the date of accrual.budd,supra,cal d at,code civ.
t he legislative goal underlying limitations statutes is to require diligent prosecution of known claims so that legal affairs can have their necessary finality and predictability and so that claims can be resolved while evidence remains reasonably available and fresh.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jordache,citing laird blacker cal th,d.with certain exceptions not applicable here,the running of the statutory period does not extinguish the cause of action,but merely bars the remedy.adams,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
generally,a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitation begins to run when a suit may be maintained.citations.ordinarily this is when the wrongful act is done and the obligation or the liability arises,but it does not accrue until the party owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action thereon.citation.in other words,a cause of action accrues upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.citations.citation.howard jarvis taxpayers ass city of la habra cal th,d,italics added.however,for policy reasons related to the nature of certain torts,the legislature sometimes postpones accrual of a cause of action.in cases of professional malpractice,postponement of the period of limitations until discovery finds justification in the special nature of the relationship between the professional man and his client.neel,supra,cal d at.
although a cause of action for legal malpractice usually arises and accrues on the same date budd,supra,cal d at,the dates will be different in some factual circumstances.for example,the cause of action will arise when an attorney breaches the professional duty of care to and causes immediate damage before plaintiff discovers that he or she has suffered a legally compensable injury.the same cause of action will not accrue until discovery takes place.we can think of no policy reason why the characterization of a property interest as community or separate should depend on the date of discovery of the injury rather than the date all the elements of the cause of action were established.
when lynn cause of action arose 
we now consider the parties arguments and the trial court factual findings in light of our conclusion that characterization of the settlement as separate or community property turns on the date lynn legal malpractice cause of action arose.the trial court determination of when the malpractice plaintiff suffered actual injury is a question of fact.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,adams,supra,cal th at,d,see,samuels mix cal th,d.
on appeal,both parties emphasize the date the legal malpractice cause of action accrued.donald argues that lynn cause of action accrued three years before separation when christensen prepared the kflp.he relies principally on code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the statute of limitations for legal malpractice,in support of this argument code of civil procedure section addresses the commencement of a legal malpractice cause of action.for purposes of the statute of limitations,code of civil procedure predicates commencement of a cause of action upon discovery of the wrongful act or omission and delineates the circumstances that may toll the limitations period.donald relies on code of civil procedure,not for the commencement period in which to file a legal malpractice cause of action,but rather to define when a legal malpractice cause of action arises.
