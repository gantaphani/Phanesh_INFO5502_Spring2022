appeals from a purported order terminating her parental rights to her son,pursuant to welfare and institutions code section she contends she was denied due process,because the court did not conduct a contested hearing on the issue of termination.although,through her counsel,expressly waived that right,and agreed to submit the matter on the record,she immediately protested when the court announced its decision to terminate parental rights.she argued that her waiver was invalid and unenforceable due to extrinsic confusing similarity between the concepts of adoption and foster care in the vietnamese language which caused her to misunderstand the nature of the hearing.
because of the uncertainty regarding waiver,the court ordered the hearing trailed to the next day,expressly for the purpose of allowing the parties to do research on the how it should proceed.however,when the matter reconvened,the court concluded that the minute order entered at the end of the prior day had constituted a formal order terminating parental rights,and that it had no power to reconsider or modify that order.
we disagree.the court minute order for the first day of the hearing was confusing at accurate reflection of what had been a very confused proceeding.but the minute order,like the court oral statements,concluded with the statement that the hearing was trailed to at for f c section hrg.thus,taken as a whole,it can not be interpreted as the formal order which concluded the hearing.
in light of that fact,there is actually no order to appeal from.the section hearing was not completed.we consequently dismiss the appeal and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.
then age,was removed from the custody of his mother,in may of,after a report that had struck both him and one of his sisters with a stick,leaving welts and bruises.the jurisdictional petition filed by the orange county social services agency ssa alleged that was divorced from the children father,and that his whereabouts were unknown.and her husband allegedly had a history of domestic violence,played out in front of the children,placing them at risk of harm.on one occasion during the marriage,and the children allegedly fled to a battered women shelter in illinois.and her husband also were said to have had a history of physically disciplining the children,placing them at risk of harm.
the petition also alleged was aware that was physically abused by boyfriend,but failed to protect him.it was further alleged that had a history of allowing her boyfriends to physically discipline the children,which placed them at risk of harm.according to the petition,also engaged in altercations with her boyfriend in front of the children,which included the boyfriend throwing objects such as a dvd player,radio and television,which placed the children at risk of physical and emotional harm.in addition,the petition asserted had left her children alone all night on numerous occasions while she went out with friends had coached the children to deny their physical abuse when questioned by police officers and had attempted to hide the stick she used for discipline.

the court subsequently found the allegations of the petition to be true,took jurisdiction over the children and ordered a plan of reunification for although did participate in regular visitation during the entire period of reunification,that effort proved unsuccessful.in connection with the review hearing,ssa prepared a report which recommended that reunification services be terminated,and that three of the children,including,be maintained in foster care as explained in the report,ssa concluded that had not made sufficient progress to warrant return of her children to her custody.during the most recent period,she had terminated her individual counseling upon moving to new mexico,despite the fact the social worker had given her a referral to continue therapy there.she had also stopped her drug and alcohol testing.the report did acknowledge that she has expressed willingness to resume the children custody and has maintained a positive relationship with the children by visiting them consistently but concluded that was insufficient to outweigh the other factors,including her continued unwillingness to take responsibility for her children physical abuse,or to express any remorse about it.
the report also evaluated each of the children,describing them as being in good health,and developmentally on track.was described as shy,smart and active.it was also noted that the children continued to have difficulty getting along with each other.although and his brother were placed in the same foster home,the brother sometimes provoked,and they had to be kept separated when they cleaned their room and made their beds.the sisters had been placed in separate foster homes due to their inability to get along with each other.even so,they continued to have verbal altercations during visitation with m.the children were reported to have bonded appropriately with their foster parents.

when the hearing recommenced,ssa submitted its reports and all parties waived their rights to the preparer of the reports or to offer additional evidence.although argued that based upon ssa recommendation,and two of his siblings should be ordered directly into foster care,without any need for a section permanency hearing,the court declined to make such an order.instead,it ordered reunification services terminated on the basis they had exceeded the statutory maximum,and referred the matter for a permanency hearing.it also ordered a bonding study done,to evaluate the bonding between each child and,as well as among the children themselves.
the permanency hearing took place april.ssa stood by its recommendation for foster care,stating that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to and his two siblings,all of whom remained bonded with m.the court agreed with ssa recommendation,and ordered the three children into foster care.
