the,bradley wilson wilson appeals from the final judgments of the family court terminating his parental rights over his two children,mary and irene.wilson raises three arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the written consent that he submitted at the december,hearing is invalid under delaware statutory law because the family court was required to,but did not,conduct a more detailed verbal colloquy explaining the terms of the consent.second,he asserts that if the statute was applied correctly,his consent is invalid because the statute violates his right to due process under the united states constitution third,he argues that,even if the statute was properly applied and does not violate due process,his consent is invalid because the family court explanation of the correct timeframe for revoking his consent at the december,hearing was confusing and misleading,and caused him to miss the statutory deadline for revocation.
we have concluded that each of wilson arguments is without merit.therefore,the judgments of the family court must be affirmed.
nancy sanden sanden is mary and irene biological mother.in october,sanden was involved in a relationship with a man named samuel clifford clifford.at the time,both mary and irene were residing in clifford house.on october,the department of services for children,youth and their families dscyf,a part of the division of family services dfs,received an urgent referral from clifford.clifford reported that he had lost contact with sanden and was unable to care for mary and irene himself.dfs responded to clifford call and placed the children in foster care that evening.the next day,the family court removed the children from the legal custody of sanden and wilson,and granted legal custody to dfs.
the family court held the first of two preliminary protective hearings on november.wilson attended the hearing,and asserted confidence in his ability to care for the children.the court allowed dfs to place the children in wilson care while dfs retained legal custody.in early november,dfs discovered that wilson had taken the children to his sister home in new jersey without permission.dfs spoke with wilson,reminded him that he did not have legal custody of mary and irene,and demanded that he return the children to delaware immediately.when wilson refused to do so,dfs contacted new jersey police.wilson was arrested on a felony charge of interference with custody on november,and the children were returned to foster care.
on november,the family court held a second preliminary protective hearing,and granted physical custody of mary and irene to dfs.wilson did not attend the hearing because he was still incarcerated as a result of his november,arrest.sanden was also unavailable for the hearing because she was participating in an inpatient drug treatment program in philadelphia.on january,the family court held an adjudicatory hearing.the family court advised wilson that a condition of his bail precluded him from any contact with his children.the family court informed wilson that it would reinstate contact with his children if he were able to get his bail conditions modified.
on february,the family court held a dispositional hearing.the family court found that wilson bail conditions had been modified to allow him to have contact with the children if permitted by dfs.the family court also explained to both sanden and wilson that they had the right to file a petition to rescind dfs custody if they felt they were able to provide adequate care for the children.finally,the family court ordered both parents to review and complete family case plans prepared by dfs.under his plan,wilson was required to maintain employment,complete parenting classes,schedule and complete mental health and substance abuse evaluations and complete domestic violence counseling.
in march,pursuant to the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc dfs asked new jersey officials to assess wilson home and determine if it was an appropriate residence for the children.wilson failed to cooperate with the evaluation by new jersey officials.as a result,new jersey denied delaware icpc request.throughout march and april,dfs repeatedly called wilson to encourage him to discuss his case plan.wilson did not contact dfs,and failed to attend scheduled weekly visits with his children.in november,wilson left new jersey and returned to delaware to move in with a new girlfriend.
on november,the family court held a permanency hearing and approved two concurrent goals the children reunification with their parents and the termination of the parents rights in favor of adoption proceedings.the family court found that termination was an appropriate goal because both parents had failed to complete their case plans and were still unable to care for their children.
on april,the family court held a post permanency review hearing.at the hearing,wilson signed the case plan first developed for him by dfs in february.the family court found that wilson was making progress towards reunification by completing substance abuse treatment and obtaining a mental health evaluation.further,the family court found that the criminal charge against wilson for interference with custody had been dismissed,and that wilson appeared more willing to cooperate with dfs.
under his revised case plan,wilson had to obtain and verify meaningful employment,find stable housing,complete a psychological evaluation and recommended substance abuse treatment,meet with and follow any recommendations of a domestic violence liaison,complete parenting classes,comply with legal issues,engage in his children therapy and visit his children weekly.dfs provided several services to help wilson complete these goals.
wilson did not complete his case plan.after wilson left a job with a trucking service in march,dfs was never informed whether he found new employment.wilson tested positive for cocaine,first in may,and again in june,and was summarily discharged from substance abuse treatment.wilson refused to contact his domestic violence liaison and failed to attend parenting classes or contact the children therapist.wilson also refused to accommodate dfs repeated requests to evaluate his home suitability for the children.finally,wilson only occasionally attended scheduled weekly visits with his children.
dfs filed a petition to terminate wilson and sanden parental rights as a result of their failure to maintain employment and complete their case plans.the family court held hearings on the petition on september,october,and december.at the december,hearing,wilson told the family court he wanted to consent to the termination of his parental rights.
the family court asked wilson counsel how he wanted to present wilson consent to the court.wilson attorney replied that he would submit wilson written consent and wilson oral acknowledgment of his written consent before the court and on the record.after conferring with counsel,wilson submitted his written consent and provided a statement to the family court affirming his desire to consent to the termination of his parental rights.both wilson attorney and the family court instructed wilson that he had fourteen days to revoke his consent after submitting it.
at the end of the december,hearing,the family court announced it would release its findings as to the termination of sanden parental rights on january.in explaining the import of that decision,the family court engaged wilson in the following exchange 
the court and so you need to do that in a timely fashion.wilson,in your situation,once you have consent,obviously,it days you have to revoke that.you have if the courts grants if the court denies the petition,the court does not grant the department petition,then your rights will still be in tact.if the court grants the petition,because we usually do not terminate on sic of the parents rights without the other.so,in other words if the court grants the department petition,grants the petition then your rights will be terminated as well depending on what mother did in terms of the appeal.if it was denied,then your consent would obviously not be valid.do you understand 
wilson yes,so,if it was denied,then i still my parental rights would still be in tact 
at the january,hearing,wilson informed the family court that he had changed his mind and wanted to revoke his consent.wilson also stated that he called his attorney on january,the last day he could have withdrawn his consent within the period,but that his attorney had not gotten back to him at all that day.after hearing wilson request,the family court decided to delay its decision regarding sanden parental rights in order to allow wilson to file a motion to vacate consent.wilson filed his motion on march.on may,the family court denied that motion,stating 
father motion to vacate consent is denied.the court may revoke a parent consent if the parent revokes the consent within days by notifying the agency in writing or the agency and the parent agree to the revocation.in this case,father failed to notify dscyf in writing within days of his intent to revoke his consent.further,dscyf was not willing to accept father revocation.father has not alleged that the consent was obtained by fraud or duress.
the court finds that father consent was knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily entered.father had the opportunity to review the evidence presented and waived his right to recall witnesses for cross examination and to present evidence.after considering father motion and the response filed by dscyf,the court concludes that father has failed to establish any grounds to revoke his consent.this court has ruled that a change of heart later is not a sufficient basis to warrant granting a parents sic motion to revoke their consent.
standard of review 
our review of the family court decision to terminate an individual parental rights involves consideration of the facts and law,as well as the inferences and deductions made by the trial court to the extent that the issues on appeal implicate rulings of law,our review is de novo to the extent that the issues on appeal implicate rulings of fact,we conduct a limited review of the factual findings of the trial court to assure that they are sufficiently supported by the record and are not clearly wrong this court will not disturb inferences and deductions that are supported by the record and that are the product of an orderly and logical deductive process if the trial court has correctly applied the law,our review is limited to abuse of discretion 
consent to termination 
this court has held that f ewer rights are more sacred than those which derive from the relationship.therefore,a consent to the termination of parental rights must be made knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently generally,in evaluating the validity of an individual consent,this court must consider first,whether it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception and second,whether it was made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.
the requirements for an effective consent have been codified,with respect to the termination of parental rights,in title,section of the delaware code.the statute provides that an individual consent to terminate parental rights,which can be either written or oral,be signed or verbally confirmed in the presence of a judge,lawyer,or other designated official further,the official confirming a parent consent must certify in writing or orally before the court that he or she explained the consequences of the consent to the parent,and that the parent read or understood the consent and agreed to it voluntarily 
when delaware general assembly amended title,section of the delaware code in to reflect its current form,the synopsis to that legislation explained that the changes were intended to better reflect the requirements that a consent to termination be knowing,voluntary and intelligent 
the bill also tightens requirements pertaining to consents given by parents to the termination of their parental rights in a child by specifying what must be in their consent,by limiting persons authorized to take consents,and by requiring such persons to explain to the individual who is executing the consent both the contents of the consent and its consequences.these procedures are to assure that any consent is given knowingly and voluntarily 
section provides that an individual consent to terminate parental rights,verbal or written,is only valid if it contains certain statements.many of these statements address factual information about the parent and child whose relationship is to be severed once the consent is finalized.in addition,section requires the consent to include two statements that verify that the parent understands the consequences of submitting a consent to the court 
a statement that the individual executing the consent understands that after the consent is signed and confirmed pursuant to c and d of this title,it is final and may not be revoked or set aside for any reason unless the requirements of a have been met and 
a statement that the individual executing the consent understands that the termination will extinguish all parental rights and obligations that the individual executing the consent has with respect to the child,except for arrearages of child support 
wilson argues that his written consent was invalid because the trial judge did not adequately review the contents of that document with him on the record,during the december,hearing.in making that argument,wilson incorrectly seeks to impose a procedural barrier on the submission to the court of a written consent,which is only required where a parent consent is verbal.title,section of the delaware code provides the court may accept a parent or guardian verbal consent after a verbal review on the record of the information required pursuant to of this title.the statute does not impose this procedural requirement on the submission of a parent written consent,which,by statute,must already contain all of the information that would be required in that verbal colloquy.accordingly,section contemplates either a written or verbal consent,but does not require the family court to conduct a verbal review or colloquy after the submission of a written consent.
statute properly applied 
when wilson did not attend the first day of tpr proceedings on september,the family court discharged his attorney.the family court the same attorney to represent wilson after wilson appeared for the second day of the tpr proceeding on october.the family court scheduled a third hearing day on december,to allow wilson counsel the opportunity to review the entire record and present a defense to termination.
at the hearing on december,wilson attorney explained to the trial judge that wilson wanted to consent to the termination of his parental rights.his counsel stated that he had read and explained each part of the consent document to wilson,which they both executed on december,
i had an opportunity with my client to to the tapes from the hearing.two days of tapes is what i recall it being,almost a full two days.i also had the opportunity to talk to my client with the guardian ad litem last week to discuss in general the case.and i also had the opportunity to meet with my client at least twice since then to discuss whether or not my client feels it appropriate to consent and that even though we would have been able to present evidence that my client has been improving himself drastically.in fact,he been clean for months now,as far as any use of drugs.that,my client would be able,as of today,to take over the responsibilities immediately of being a parent and though he does feel very bittersweet about this,that because he loves the kids,he willing to consent.
at the december,hearing,wilson confirmed to the family court,on the record,that he consented to terminate his parental rights.the written consent covered all of the statutory elements which were required to make it valid,pursuant to section.in particular,wilson acknowledged within the written consent that he understood he was giving up his parental rights,the consequences of this decision,and that his decision was final and could not be revoked unles
