since september,when ann the minor was months old,her paternal aunt and the aunt husband have been her guardians.after almost four years had passed,her mother parental rights were terminated pursuant to probate code section,which provides that a trial court may declare a child free from a parent custody and control if the parent does not have legal custody of the child,the child has been in the custody of a legal guardian for at least two years,and the child would benefit from being adopted by the guardian,subd.a.
mother appeals,claiming that probate code section is an unconstitutional infringement upon her fundamental rights as a parent because it allows the termination of parental rights without a showing of current parental unfitness in the alternative,she contends that the trial court erred in applying the statute retroactively and that,in any event,principles of res judicata preclude its application to the circumstances of this case.we shall affirm the judgment.
as we will explain in the published parts of this opinion,probate code section reflects valid legislative determinations that where a parent has left his or her child in a guardianship for at least two years without rectifying the problem that required the guardianship,there is a compelling state interest in protecting the child need for stability,which takes precedence over parental rights,and that where the guardian wants to adopt the child,and the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child will benefit from being adopted by the guardian,there is a rebuttable presumption that a the parent is unfit to have custody of the child,in the sense the parent is not presently capable of properly caring for the child due to the parent situation,and b it would be detrimental to the child not to terminate parental rights in order to permit the adoption to take place.the presumption is rebutted if the parent demonstrates otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
we conclude that section is narrowly tailored to achieve the state compelling interest in protecting the child,and that the statute does not impermissibly infringe upon the parent liberty interest in the care,custody,and control of the child because the statutory scheme provides the parent with the requisite due process before parental rights can be terminated.
we also conclude that section is retroactive and applies after two years of the guardianship,regardless of whether any part of the period occurred before the statute became law.
here,the evidence supports the presumption that mother was presently unfit to properly care for the minor and that it would have been detrimental to the minor not to terminate mother parental rights in order to permit the guardians to adopt the minor.
in the unpublished part of our opinion,we reject mother other claim of error.
mother relationship with father resulted in the minor birth in march.mother has two other children,born in and,as a result of her relationships with other men.
mother has a long history of heroin addiction and has committed multiple criminal offenses,including assault with a deadly weapon.father also was a drug user.
in early september,father obtained custody of the minor after mother left a suicide message on his answering machine and law enforcement officers found known drug users around the children in mother apartment.when father was unable to care for the minor,his sister and her husband to whom we will refer as aunt and uncle,or as the guardians filed a petition for temporary guardianship and gave notice of their intent to adopt the minor.the trial court issued letters of temporary guardianship on september.
in october,mother and the minor aunt and uncle met with a mediator,and mother agreed that the temporary guardianship should remain in effect.she also agreed that she would not have visitation until she could demonstrate to the trial court that she had enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program.the court entered an order adopting the mediation agreement.
in december,mother consented to the aunt and uncle becoming the minor permanent guardians,which they have been since that time.because mother had not complied with the drug rehabilitation requirement,the trial court denied her visitation with the minor.
in early,mother was charged with six criminal counts involving heroin.because of her prior criminal history,she faced a possible life term under california three strikes law.thus,she told the minor aunt and uncle that she wanted them to adopt the minor.they filed a petition for independent adoption in may.however,after mother entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to only two years and eight months in state prison,she changed her mind and objected to the adoption.
in november,father consented to the termination of his parental rights.
in january,the minor guardians filed a petition to terminate mother parental rights on the grounds that mother had left the minor in their care for over six months,without any support or communication and with the intent to abandon the child,and the nature of her felony convictions showed her unfitness to have future custody and control of the minor.
the social worker reported in october that instead of completing a drug abuse treatment program,mother had relapsed into drug use,which resulted in a felony theft conviction.she was serving a sentence for the conviction,and her two older children were in a long term guardianship with mother sister.according to the social worker,the minor was thriving in the nurturing environment provided by the aunt and uncle,who had been married for almost years and had stable jobs.the social worker recommended that the court terminate mother parental rights.
in february,the trial court denied the petition to terminate mother parental rights.relying on in re jacklyn th,d,the court held that the judicial order establishing the permanent guardianship precluded a finding that mother had abandoned the minor within the meaning of family code section,and that the nature of mother felony convictions did not prove she was unfit to have future custody and control of the minor within the meaning of family code section.
mother was released from prison in february.one week later,the guardians filed the petition at issue here,to declare the minor free from mother care,custody,and control pursuant to probate code section,which became effective on january.stats,ch.bill.as noted previously,probate code section,subdivision a provides that in a guardianship proceeding,the trial court may declare a child free from a parent custody and control if the parent does not have legal custody of the child,the child has been in the custody of a legal guardian for at least two years,and the child would benefit from being adopted by the guardian.
mother opposed the petition on the grounds that probate code section is unconstitutional because it does not require a finding of parental unfitness,the statute can not be applied retroactively,and the guardians were collaterally estopped from relitigating mother fitness as a parent.
at the hearing on the petition to terminate her parental rights,mother introduced evidence that she was in a residential drug treatment program where she was taking classes involving parenting skills,drug education,relapse prevention,and anger management.she also submitted a letter from a recovery advocate with the female offender treatment employment program fotep,a program to help substance abusing female offenders reunify with their families.the letter stated that mother was in a fotep residential treatment program,was actively participating in group sessions,and was making progress in her personal recovery 
according to mother,she originally agreed to the guardianship simply because she was going to be incarcerated and,thus,would be unable to care for the minor.in her words i chose to enter into a guardianship because i knew my parental rights would not be terminated in that type of relationship.had probate code section existed at the time i was contemplating a guardianship,i probably would not have entered into one.claiming that the guardians had thwarted her efforts to have contact with the minor,and asserting that upon her release from prison she will be able to care for her,mother said she now opposes the guardians adoption of the minor.
the social worker reported that the guardians have clear criminal background checks and meet all requirements for adoption.they have a marriage,stable jobs,and a large home.the minor,who had been in their custody since she was months old,called her guardians mama and papa,and was extremely attached to them.in contrast,the minor had no relationship with mother,who had not had any contact with her for two years.the social worker recommended that mother parental rights be terminated so the guardians could adopt the minor.according to the social worker,the guardians were open to visitation between the minor and her after the adoption is finalized.
the trial court also received a recommendation from therapist carrie schucker,who had been retained by the guardians to determine if adoption was in the minor best interest.schucker stated that the minor was happy,relaxed,and bonded with her aunt and uncle,who as guardians had provided her with a structured,consistent,child centered environment for more than three and a half years.the minor does not remember visits that she had in and early with her now,and she does not appear to wish to see the.there apparently had been no visitation between the minor and her other.schucker opined that although mother does appear to be trying to turn her life around,adoption by the guardians was in the minor best interest.schucker explained the minor weathered a painful separation rupture from her birth mother at months with the love and support of the guardians,whom she considers to be her parents and feels secure and loved with them.a major change at this time in her primary attachments would cause her stress and emotional damage.furthermore,i ntroducing a birth mother and half siblings she does appear to remember would be confusing and emotionally difficult for her,especially with the risk of inconsistent contact this little girl does not have the emotional stamina to weather another loss.
the trial court concluded the guardians met their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the minor,who had been in their custody for more than two years,would benefit from being adopted by them,and adoption would be in her best interest.the court found that the minor had a relationship with her guardians,but no relationship with her mother.the court also emphasized that mother was not presently in a position to take custody of the minor and that she could not say when she could do so.in fact,the court noted,mother was not seeking to terminate the guardianship she just wanted to visit the minor.the court found that requiring visitation with mother and the was not in the minor best interests.hence,the court denied mother request for visitation and,pursuant to probate code section,terminated her parental rights.
discussion 
before addressing mother claims,it is helpful to set forth the relevant legal framework concerning guardianships.
upon hearing a petition for guardianship,a trial court may appoint a guardian of the person of a minor if it appears necessary or convenient,subd.a.when the petition concerns the custody of a minor,the court is also governed by sections and of the family code,subd.b guardianship of olivia th,d guardianship of jenna th,d.
family code section declares it is the public policy of this state to assure that the health,safety,and welfare of children shall be the court primary concern in determining the best interest of children when making any orders regarding the physical or legal custody or visitation of children,subd.a.determining a child best interest requires the trial court to consider various factors,including the child health,safety,and welfare any history of abuse by a parent or other person seeking custody of the child,which was committed against the child,or a parent of the child,or a cohabitant the nature and amount of the child contact with the parents and any habitual or continual use of controlled substances or alcohol by either parent.
family code section generally precludes an award of custody to a nonparent over a parent objection unless the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence that granting custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent is required by the child best interest,subds.a b.as used in this section,detriment to the child includes the harm of removal from a stable placement of a child with a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of his or her parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time.a finding of detriment does not require any finding of unfitness of the parents,subd.c.if the court finds that the person to whom custody may be given already has assumed the role of the parent of the minor,as described in subdivision c,ante,this finding shall constitute a finding that the custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child absent a showing by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary,subd.d.
thus,there is no requirement in a guardianship proceeding that the parent be found unfit in the sense the person is unfit to parent any custody of a particular child is awarded to a nonparent rather,the focus is on detriment to that child.in re cal d,guardianship of phillip d.nonetheless,as a practical matter,a finding that it would be detrimental to a child to be in a parent custody is ordinarily equivalent to a finding that the parent is unfit to have custody of the child.see in re jasmon cal th,d,in re dakota th,fn,d in re cody th,d.
when the trial court appoints a nonparent as guardian of the person of a child,the authority of the parent ceases,subd.a.it is the guardian,not the parent,who has the care,custody,and control of the child.once established,either voluntarily or involuntarily,a permanent guardianship continues until it is terminated.guardianship of zachary th,d.
a guardianship of a child terminates when the child attains majority,dies,is adopted,or becomes emancipated.in addition,upon petition of the guardian,a parent,or the child,the trial court may terminate the guardianship if the court determines it is in the child best interest to do so.
a parent seeking to terminate a guardianship has the burden of proof and must demonstrate something more than that the parent is now ready to take back the child,the parent must show his or her overall fitness and changed circumstances sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma of taking the child away from a guardian who is caring for and nurturing the child.guardianship of simpson th,d hereafter simpson.
before the enactment of probate code section,via senate bill,a child could be in a guardianship indefinitely if the parents did not seek to terminate the guardianship or were unable to do so,and the guardians were unable to show the existence of any of the grounds specified in the family code for the termination of parental rights see,et.as pointed out in a senate judiciary committee analysis,senate bill created an avenue for a guardian where the child has been in the custody of the guardian for a long time and the parent or parents are not likely to reclaim the child but the parent or parents do not fall under one of the categories covered by existing law.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
senate bill was intended to cover situations such as where a parent has voluntarily given a child to the guardian in a written guardianship agreement that may or may not have been entered in a formal court proceeding and,years later,the child has bonded with the guardian as a parent but grounds to terminate parental rights of the child birth parents would not apply.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra,at.for example,a drug addicted mother gives the child in guardianship,hoping to get herself rehabilitated but repeatedly fail s,creating a situation where the child is in the custody of the guardian for years without being in the foster care system.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra,at.the new provision enacted by senate bill would allow a child to remain in and be adopted into a loving home in which he or she has been living.adoption would take away any fear that someday his or her birth parent or parents would come back to reclaim him or her.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,supra,at.
thus,probate code section states in pertinent part a a proceeding to have a child declared free from the custody and control of one or both parents may be brought in the guardianship proceeding pursuant to part commencing with section of division of the family code,if all of the following requirements are satisfied one or both parents do not have the legal custody of the child.the child has been in the physical custody of the guardian for a period of not less than two years.the court finds that the child would benefit from being adopted by his or her guardian.in making this determination,the court shall consider all factors relating to the best interest of the child,including but not limited to,the nature and extent of the relationship between all of the following a the child and the birth parent.b the child and the guardian,including family members of the guardian.c the child and any siblings or.
section,subdivision b requires the trial court to appoint a qualified professional to investigate the aforesaid factors and submit findings regarding those issues in a written report required by family code section.the court also must provide the child parent with the procedural due process rights,including notice and counsel,that are provided in proceedings to terminate parental rights pursuant to the family code,subd.c see,et however,this statute does not apply to any child who is a dependent of the juvenile court,subd.d.
mother claims probate code section is unconstitutional because it permits termination of parental rights without requiring proof by clear and convincing evidence.not so.
the statute expressly states that t he rights of the parent,including the rights to notice and counsel provided in part commencing with section of division of the family code,shall apply to actions brought pursuant to this section,subds.a c.thus,probate code section incorporates provisions of family code section,which states a finding pursuant to this chapter shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence.here,the trial court expressly found that the burden of proof was by clear and convincing evidence,and that the guardians had met their burden.
in another constitutional attack on the statute,mother says it violates substantive due process by allowing the termination of her parental rights without a showing of current parental unfitness the contention fails for reasons that follow.
substantive due process prohibits governmental interference with a person fundamental right to life,liberty or property by unreasonable or arbitrary legislation.in re marilyn cal th,d.the deprivation of a fundamental right is permissible only if the conduct from which the deprivation flows is prescribed by reasonable legislation that is reasonably applied that is,the law must have a reasonable and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained id.at,d,and be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interest.in re david d.
parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care,custody,and management of their child.santosky kramer,d,in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.hence,there are substantive due process limitations on the power of government to sever parental rights.a state can not terminate a parental relationship based solely upon the best interests of the child without some showing of parental unfitness in re heather th,d,fn.omitted see quilloin walcott,d.in this sense,parental unfitness means that the child will suffer detriment if he or she remains in,or is returned to,the parent custody.in re,supra,cal d at,in re dakota,supra,th at,fn,d in re cody,supra,th at,d.
the united states supreme court has not specifically defined what some showing of parental unfitness entails.the terms which the states have utilized to describe parental unfitness are linguistically variable and include parents who have failed,refused or neglected to provide proper or necessary care children who are neglected,deprived,or abused children who are in need of supervision or parents who have failed to maintain contact with the child or to plan for his or her future.citation.in re heather,supra,th at,d.a proceeding to terminate parental rights is not intended to punish a parent but parental conduct is a factor likewise,the best interest of the child is not determinative but is an important consideration.citation.ibid.
t he welfare of a child is a compelling state interest that a state has not only a right,but a duty,to protect.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.children are not simply chattels belonging to the parent,but have fundamental interests of their own that may diverge from the interests of the parent.in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d.children have compelling rights to be protected from abuse and neglect and to have a placement that is stable,permanent,and that allows the caretaker to make a full emotional commitment to the child.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.
where the rights of children and parents conflict,the legal system traditionally protects the child interest.cynthia superior court cal th,d,where a child has been abused or neglected by a parent,the child interest must be given more weight in re angelia cal d.for example,where a child has been in placement under the jurisdiction of a dependency court for months and the parent has failed to correct problems which caused the child to be removed from the home,a showing of a substantial likelihood that the child will suffer serious trauma if separated from the present caregiver is sufficient to establish the requisite detriment to the child.in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d,in re bridget th,d.this is so because the child need for stability has come to outweigh the natural parent interest in the care,custody and companionship of the child.in re jasmon,supra,cal th at,d.
proceedings to terminate parental rights under the family code also emphasize the importance of a stable environment for the child.the purpose of the statutes governing the termination of parental custody and control is to serve the welfare and best interest of a child by providing the stability and security of an adoptive home when those conditions are otherwise missing from the child life.consequently,the state interest in the welfare of children justifies the termination of parental rights when a parent fails to communicate with his or her child for at least one year with the intent to abandon the child during that period,even though the parent desires to eventually reestablish the relationship.in other words,a child need for a permanent and stable home can not be postponed for an indefinite period merely because the absent parent may envision renewing contact with the child sometime in the distant future.in re daniel th,d.
simply stated,a child can not be abandoned and then put on hold for a parent whim to reunite.children continue to develop,and the legislature has appropriately determined a child needs a secure and stable home for that development.in re daniel,supra,th at,d in re debra d.the reality is that childhood is brief it does not wait while a parent rehabilitates himself or herself.the nurturing required must be given by someone,at the time the child needs it,not when the parent is ready to give it.
consistent with the aforesaid principles and provisions of law,we conclude,as we will explain,that probate code section reflects valid legislative determinations that where a parent has left his or her child in a guardianship for at least two years without rectifying the problems that required the guardianship,there is a compelling state interest in protecting the child need for stability,which takes precedence over the parent rights,and that where the guardian wants to adopt the child,and the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child will benefit from being adopted by the guardian,there is a rebuttable presumption that a the parent is unfit to have custody of the child,in the sense the parent is not presently capable of properly caring for the child due to the parent situation,and b it would be detrimental to the child not to terminate parental rights in order to permit the adoption to take place.the presumption is rebutted if the parent shows otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.section is narrowly tailored to achieve the state compelling interest in protecting the child,and the statute does not impermissibly infringe upon the parent liberty interest in the care,custody,and control of the child because the statutory scheme provides the parent with the requisite due process before parental rights can be terminated.
a court must,whenever possible,construe a statute so as to preserve its constitutional validity.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d.if the terms of a statute are by fair and reasonable interpretation capable of a meaning consistent with the requirements of the constitution,the statute will be given that meaning,rather than another in conflict with the constitution.citations.consequently,i f feasible within bounds set by their words and purposes,statutes should be construed to preserve their constitutionality.citation.metromedia,city of san diego cal d.
a fair and reasonable interpretation of probate code section demonstrates that it is constitutional.
before a guardianship is established and the child is taken from the parent custody over the parent objection,the trial court must find by clear and convincing evidence that granting custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child and that granting custody to the nonparent guardian is in the child best interest,subds.a b.if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person to whom custody is to be given is a person who has assumed,on a basis,the role of the child parent,fulfilling both the child physical needs and the child psychological needs for care and affection,and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time,subd.c,then this shall constitute a finding that said custody is in the best interest of the child and that parental custody would be detrimental to the child absent a showing by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary,subd.d.
in other words,a nonparent guardianship will occur,over the parent objection,only where there is either clear and convincing evidence of detriment if the child were to remain in the parent custody,or the parent has relinquished custody of the child to the person seeking to become the child guardian and has done so for such a substantial period of time that the person has become a surrogate parent and it is reasonably presumed that returning the child to the parent custody will be detrimental to the child absent a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary.
in the first instance,there is an express finding of detriment by clear and convincing evidence.in the latter instance,there is a presumption of detriment,logically following from the parent abandonment of parental responsibilities and custody of the child,which presumption the parent may rebut by a preponderance of the evidence.
where the parent consents to a nonparent guardianship of the child,the parent effectively concedes that the parent is not capable of properly caring for the child due to whatever situation the parent is experiencing,and thus that it would be detrimental to the child to be in the parent custody.a parent does not lightly place his or her child in a guardianship,because doing so deprives the parent of the care,custody,and companionship of the child until the parent can show that it is in the child best interest to be removed from the stable home provided by the guardian and returned to the parent custody.to regain custody,a parent must show his or her overall fitness and changed circumstances sufficient to overcome the inherent trauma that may result from taking the child away from a guardian who is caring for and nurturing the child.simpson,supra,th at,d.
in most cases of a voluntary guardianship,it will not be too difficult for a parent to establish that regaining custody is in the child best interest.simpson,supra,th at,fn,d.guardianship termination cases typically revolve around a drama of parental trouble and reformation.citation.when the parent is out of trouble,out of the military,or out of a hospital,he or she will usually be sufficiently fit to resume parental responsibilities,original italics.parents who place their child in a guardianship as the result of a military commitment or a transitory health or financial issue typically act quickly to regain custody when the crisis has passed,and they usually have maintained sufficient contact with their child in the interim,both of which demonstrate their ability to resume custody.
however,where a guardianship is involuntary,or is voluntary only in the sense that it is an attempt by the parents to avoid a dependency proceeding,it is not unusual for the child to be left in the guardian care indefinitely while the parents repeatedly and unsuccessfully try to rectify problems that gave rise to the guardianship.
in effect,the child is abandoned.but if the parent has maintained some contact with the child,and the guardianship is the result of a court order,the termination of parental rights on the ground of abandonment under family code section is extremely difficult to prove,if not impossible.in re jacklyn,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,the detriment to the child remains the same the child is deprived of the fundamental right to have a settled life in a stable,permanent home.in re marilyn,supra,cal th at,d.
for this reason,the legislature enacted section of the probate code hereafter section.
the termination of parental rights via section is analogous to the termination of parental rights via the family code in that the family code procedures are adopted in subdivisions a and c of section.parental rights may be terminated under the family code based on clear and convincing evidence,of various circumstances,including the parent has left the child in the care of another person for over six months,without any support or communication and with the intent to abandon the child,subd.a the parent habitual abuse of controlled substances or alcohol has rendered the parent unable to adequately care for and control the child,who has been a dependent of the juvenile court for one year,or the parent has failed,and is likely to fail in the future,to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child while the child has been in placement for a period,supervised by the juvenile court.the time limits set by these statutory provisions constitute a legislative recognition that a child has the right to a stable and permanent home and that it is detrimental to the child if the parent can not provide such a home within a finite period of time.
section similarly allows termination of parental rights under circumstances that are the functional equivalent of a showing that the parent is presently unfit to parent the child and that the child will suffer detriment if parental rights are not terminated.those circumstances are the parent inability to care for the child,resulting in the child placement in a guardianship the parent failure to regain custody of the child after two years or more have elapsed and the existence of a stable adoptive home with the guardian,who has met the child needs during this passage of time,subd.a.
the statute reflects a rational determination that if after the passage of two years,the parent has not resolved the problem resulting in the guardianship and has not ended the guardianship,then the parent currently remains incapable of properly providing for the child emotional physical needs,and has abandoned the child to guardianship limbo.in other words,the legislature has made a rational determination that,unless the parent can show otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence,the parent is presently unfit to parent the child,and it would be detrimental to the child to be kept in an
