factual and procedural background 
in december mother and father shared custody of on december,father contacted his attorney,peterson,and told him he had an emergency situation involving j.during a meeting between peterson,father,and father wife the following day,father stated that told him she was being subjected to inappropriate sexual contact initiated by the daughter of her mother boyfriend.stated the contact occurred regularly and that she did not like it.father informed mother,who denied anything was wrong and claimed was fabricating in order to get attention.father feared mother would fail to protect from sexual contact by the other child.father also told peterson that had informed her pediatrician of the sexual contact on december,peterson notified mother that father had requested an ex parte hearing to be held on december.peterson informed mother that father sought to take away her parental rights because of the alleged sexual abuse of j.the following day,mother retained counsel to defend against the allegations.
on december,the court conducted a temporary custody proceeding before judge ullman.at the hearing,peterson stated that had been sexually abused for almost a year and that mother knew about the abuse and failed to stop it.peterson denied making any knowingly false accusations of child abuse or neglect.judge ullman temporarily suspended mother rights of custody and visitation pending an immediate family court services fcs investigation.
on december,fcs child custody mediator diana connolly issued the fcs report,finding that had not been sexually molested.the fcs report concluded that engaged in mutual sexual experimentation with a child.such experimentation is considered a normal part of a child sexual development.
mother,on december,petitioned the court to adopt the fcs report and restore her parental rights.father filed a supplemental declaration opposing the fcs report.judge ullman adopted the report,with the modification that and the daughter of mother boyfriend have no further contact.
on december,judge ullman issued a mandatory osc for section sanctions and set the matter for hearing on february.effective january,judge ullman retired.an order after hearing,signed by judge mize,was filed january.
on january,peterson filed a declaration in opposition to mother request for sanctions.judge mize held a hearing on the motion on february.the court stated it had no problem setting the matter for long cause and waiving a pretrial conference.the court noted w hen we talking about that much money and that,effectively both,emotional a topic this court does not want to rush through it in a way that would make it appear that it did give full and adequate consideration to something like that.the matter was set for long cause hearing on may.
on may,trial began before judge kobayashi on the section request for sanctions.the court began by reviewing section and asking the parties whether the determination of falsity should have been made at the december,hearing.peterson answered in the affirmative and argued the court should dismiss the request since the finding of falsity should have been made in the underlying temporary custody proceeding.
mother argued that nothing in the language of section ties sanctions to the custody hearing itself.mother also argued that no contested proceeding had taken place in which she could litigate the issue of knowledge.the custody hearing consisted of the return of the fcs report and a request to adopt the report.peterson was not before the court at that time.
peterson argued the lack of a statute of limitations in section evinced a legislative intent to require litigation of the issue of falsity during the underlying custody proceeding.otherwise,disgruntled litigants could bring a claim for section sanctions forever.
the trial court again inquired whether prior to the sanctions motion a litigant should not request a finding of false allegations,or at least request a hearing to make such a finding.the court theorized there should first be a finding of false allegation.following such a finding,the issue of who made the finding could be litigated.the court also noted i think this is an issue that really should be looked at by the appellate court 
ultimately,the trial court issued a minute order dismissing with prejudice the request for section sanctions the court ruled that under section,the court dismisses the claim on the ground that the issue of falsity must be adjudicated in the underlying custody proceedings.here the petitioner did not request judge ullman to make any findings on the issue of false allegations.petitioner could have requested the trial court to join attorney peterson so that judge ullman,who had first hand knowledge of the facts,could have heard the motion.
during oral argument on the motion,mother requested the court take judicial notice of the fcs report.the court responded it a confidential report.our practice is,if there an agreement,only the agreement part is taken into consideration.if it a recommendation,only the recommendation part is considered.the other part,the discussion,consists entirely of hearsay information if there is an agreement,there is no need for a discussion of what transpired at the mediation.the minute order states the court ruled that the agreement portion only of the fcs report may be considered by the court.
mother requested the issuance of a minute order dismissing the sanctions request.judge kobayashi agreed and faxed to counsel the minute order dismissing the request on may.neither side requested a statement of decision or order after hearing.
mother filed a notice of appeal on may.on june,we dismissed the appeal as from a nonappealable order.on june,mother filed a petition for rehearing.we granted her petition and reinstated the appeal on june.
