maria mother appeals from the judgment of january,declaring her daughter,maricela,a dependent of the court after finding maricela was at risk of suffering serious physical harm as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child under the first jurisdictional prong of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b mother contends substantial evidence does not support jurisdiction because there is no evidence mother was neglectful.we hold the parental conduct to which this jurisdictional provision refers does not require parental neglect and conclude substantial evidence supports the finding.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
statement of facts and procedure 
maricela was born in to mother and father she lived with mother and her siblings.mother had a year relationship with father,during which father abused alcohol and hit mother.
mother had no control over maricela,who would come and go as she pleased,without telling mother her plans.mother did not know what maricela was doing.maricela associated with the wrong people,as she put it,used drugs drank,and fought.she stopped going to school.in,when years old,maricela gave birth to a child.her relationship with the baby father involved methamphetamine abuse and domestic violence.mother provided the baby with a home.
mother tried to control maricela by talking to her.she enrolled maricela in an independent study program and kept her at home.however,maricela frequently ran away for days at a time and continued engaging in risky,behavior.she chased after older men,had unprotected sex,and used drugs and alcohol.against her better judgment,mother gave permission to maricela to go out with a girl,and maricela did not return for two days.
when maricela left home on september,mother filed a police report and called the department of children and family services department because maricela threatened to take the baby from mother care.the department detained the baby and offered maricela a voluntary placement and services plan.maricela was placed in a group home in pasadena,was enrolled in school,and agreed to participate in counseling and a substance abuse program.
maricela stated she wanted to change and follow her program,but she continued abusing drugs,fighting,disregarding rules,and running away.on november,she ran away from the group home to the alleys of los angeles after she had assaulted two peers and a teacher.
maricela was detained on november,and a section petition was filed.mother denied she was unable to provide parental care and supervision.she did not believe that father getting drunk and hitting her was abuse.
maricela behavior improved in the group home.she complied with the rules of her school and the group home,was sober,and did not get into fights.
on january,maricela was declared a dependent of the court based on sustained allegations under section,subdivision b that she was at risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness as a result of mother failure or inability to supervise or protect her adequately.the dependency court found,this is a case in which it clear that mother is unable to provide care for this child,not just based on her chronic run away behavior,but because for whatever reason she is unable to control,motivate and get her daughter to do things she needed to do,which i consider to be appropriate parental care.custody was taken from mother,reunification services were ordered and unmonitored visits were granted.
discussion 
mother contends substantial evidence does not support the finding maricela was a child described by section,subdivision b.we disagree with the contention.
in reviewing the jurisdictional findings and the disposition,we look to see if substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,supports them.citation.in making this determination,we draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the dependency court we review the record in the light most favorable to the court determinations and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial court.citation.in re heather th,d.we do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent judgment,but merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.in re matthew d.
section provides in pertinent part t he purpose of the juvenile court law relating to dependent children is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who are currently being physically,sexually,or emotionally abused,being neglected,or being exploited,and to ensure the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of children who are at risk of that harm.this safety,protection,and physical and emotional may include provision of a full array of social and health services to help the child and family and to prevent reabuse of children.the focus shall be on the preservation of the family as well as the safety,protection,and physical and emotional of the child.see in re ethan cal th,d,in re nolan cal th,d,the overarching goal of dependency proceedings is to safeguard the welfare of california children.
section provides in pertinent part any child who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependent child of the court b the child has suffered,or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer,serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child,or the willful or negligent failure of the child parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the minor from the conduct of the custodian with whom the child has been left,or by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food,clothing,shelter,or medical treatment,or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child due to the parent or guardian mental illness,developmental disability,or substance abuse 
the record contains substantial evidence of the first prong for jurisdiction under section,subdivision b there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer serious physical harm or illness,as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately supervise or protect the child.maricela engaged in dangerous behaviors that threatened her life,health,and welfare.mother knew maricela was running away but failed to recognize maricela other problems.when mother learned maricela engaged in dangerous behaviors,her responses were ineffectual.the foregoing is substantial evidence that maricela was at substantial risk of harm as a result of mother inability to adequately supervise or protect her.
mother contends jurisdiction does not lie because there is no evidence she did anything wrong she was not negligent or abusive.we disagree with the premise of the argument.parental fault is not required to establish dependency jurisdiction to protect a child who is at substantial risk of serious harm as a result of a parent failure or inability to supervise or protect.
when construing a statute,we look first to its words,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the words their usual and ordinary meaning citation,while construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute purpose citation.pineda williams sonoma stores,cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.only when the statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,may the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.citation.id.at d.in re ethan,supra,cal th at,d.
as the language of the first prong of section,subdivision b is unambiguous,its plain meaning governs.the provision only requirement concerning parental conduct is that the parent failed or was unable to adequately supervise or protect the child.the application of the provision is not limited
