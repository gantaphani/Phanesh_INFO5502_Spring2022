these appeals arise from the court application of the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act the act,et during a welfare and institutions code section hereafter section proceeding on behalf of parents,rodney and leslie,separately appeal the court order placing with leslie and terminating its dependency jurisdiction over rodney contends the true finding that is a person described by section and the order placing with leslie must be reversed because they are findings and an order the court was not authorized to make under the act.he also contends the court did not comply with the act procedural requirements.leslie contends the court should not have terminated its dependency jurisdiction over because we conclude the court was not authorized under the act to make the challenged finding,we reverse that finding.however,because the material evidence introduced to support the finding supports an order the court was authorized to make under the act,we affirm the order placing with leslie and terminating the juvenile court jurisdiction over 
factual and procedural background 
in was born in arkansas to leslie and rodney.in they separated.in an arkansas state court granted rodney primary physical custody of and approved leslie visitation with every other weekend and three weeks in the summer.
during july summer visit with leslie in california,told her stepfather that while in rodney custody in arkansas he had sexually molested her.as a result of disclosure,leslie sought a restraining order in the california family court to retain in california and prevent her return to rodney custody in arkansas.a temporary restraining order was issued in.the continued order to show cause hearing for a permanent restraining order was scheduled in the family court for later in the month of august and the family court advised the arkansas court california was assuming emergency jurisdiction over 
before the order to show cause hearing set for late august,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a section petition on behalf in the california juvenile court,alleging she had been sexually abused by rodney.at the detention hearing held the same day,the juvenile court found the agency had made a prima facie showing is a person described by section,subdivision d and declared it was exercising emergency jurisdiction over her under the act,subd.a.the court gave the social worker discretion to detain in leslie home.the record does not reflect further proceedings in the california family court.
in september rodney asked the juvenile court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the court was properly taking emergency jurisdiction over under the act.the court declined to do so and set a dependency jurisdictional hearing to determine whether was a person described by section.
in october the court made a true finding that was a person described in section,subdivision d.shortly thereafter,the court contacted the arkansas court,which refused to allow the california court to have further jurisdiction over the matter,and requested the matter be transferred to arkansas.the california court did not tape record,or have a court reporter present during,the conversation with the arkansas court.the california court agreed to provide the arkansas court with the file and the transcript from the section dependency jurisdictional hearing,and the arkansas court agreed that custody would remain with leslie.in november the california court placed with leslie pending further order of the arkansas court,to which it sent a copy of the file and transcripts,and terminated the california court jurisdiction over 
discussion 
iprocedural requirements of the act 
rodney contends the true finding that was a minor described in section,subdivision d and the order placing with leslie pending further order of the arkansas court should be reversed because a true finding under section is not authorized by the act,and the placement order based on that finding is therefore not authorized by the act.he also contends the court erred by not communicating with the court in arkansas immediately after the filing of the section petition.
orders of limited and temporary duration 
in,concern over parents engaging in forum shopping to gain favorable custody decisions led the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws and the american bar association to approve the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja.west laws ann.uniform child custody jurisdiction act,prefatory note.california adopted the uccja and codified it in former civil code section et,which became effective in january.former.its purpose was to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict,promote interstate cooperation,litigate custody where child and family have closest connections,discourage continuing conflict over custody,deter abductions and unilateral removals of children,avoid relitigation of another state custody decisions,and promote exchange of information and other mutual assistance between courts of sister states.kumar superior court cal d.
in,the uccja was revised and the act was adopted.west laws ann.uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act,prefatory note.the act was adopted in california,effective january,and codified in family code section et.west laws ann.supp.uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act.states,including arkansas,and the district of columbia have adopted the act.ibid.the act is the exclusive method of determining the proper forum in custody disputes involving other jurisdictions and governs juvenile dependency proceedings,subd.c,subd.a in re nada th,d.
all parties here agree the act applied and the california court was required to follow the provisions of the act when presented with a child custody dispute subject to a sister state custody order.to resolve rodney assertion the court acted improperly by making a true finding that was a person described in section,subdivision d,we examine the procedure set forth in the act applicable to the assertion of jurisdiction over a child who is the subject of an existing sister state custody order and for whom the agency has filed a dependency petition.
section,subdivisions a,c and d contain the basic provisions of the act applicable to this case 
a a court of this state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in this state and it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child is subjected to,or threatened with,mistreatment or abuse.
c if there is a previous child custody determination that is entitled to be enforced under this part any order issued by a court of this state under this section must specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction the order issued in this state remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.
d a court of this state that has been asked to make a child custody determination under this section,upon being informed that a child custody determination has been made by a court of a state having jurisdiction shall immediately communicate with the other court 
under section a california court may enter a child custody order for a child subject to an existing sister state custody order only if it finds an emergency necessitating protection of the child from mistreatment or abuse and the order is limited in time to a specified period.except as authorized by section,a california court may not make an initial custody order or modify a sister state child custody order unless prescribed conditions not here present exist.the finding of an emergency should not be made in a rush to judgment but rather after a full and fair evidentiary hearing.citation.people beach d.see also matter of and,the court has the duty to take evidence on the issue of abuse to determine whether emergency jurisdiction is proper.unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to invoke emergency jurisdiction.roberts district court of larimer county,tenenbaum sprecher,glynn meslin.
here the only evidentiary hearing held was the dependency jurisdictional hearing on the section petition in which the juvenile court found was a person described in section,subdivision d as a child who has been,or there is a substantial risk will be,sexually abused by a parent.the true finding on the section petition with regard to is not authorized by the act because,although it may establish the required emergency,it has permanent rather than temporary ramifications with regard to custody.
the purpose of the section jurisdictional hearing is to determine whether the child is a person described by section the hearing is a condition precedent to a permanent custody disposition under the dependency scheme.the purpose of the section hearing is limited to a determination of the existence of an emergency,and under the act emergency jurisdiction may be exercised to protect the child only on a temporary basis.west laws,supra,uccjea prefatory note at.assumption of emergency jurisdiction does not confer upon the state exercising emergency jurisdiction the authority to make a permanent custody disposition.in re joseph,supra,th at,d.
rodney contends the true finding that is a person described in section,subdivision d is not a determination contemplated by section,subdivision c.the true finding under section begins the dependency process.it has no time limitations.that point is evident here,because the social worker prepared a case plan with a projected case completion date of march.in contrast to a section finding,the order assuming emergency jurisdiction under the act has time limitations.it must specify a period that the court considers adequate to allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having jurisdiction,subd.c.it remains in effect until an order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the period expires.ibid.because a true finding under section has no time limitations,it is not the type of determination contemplated by section furthermore,a finding of emergency under the act does not contemplate or authorize a finding that the minor is a person described in section.under the act,the jurisdictional finding is one of necessity in an emergency to protect the child who is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.thus,the hearing to determine whether an emergency exists under the act is a procedure separate and distinct from a section jurisdictional hearing.we conclude the juvenile court was not authorized under the act to make the section true finding,and reverse the finding that is a person described in section,subdivision d.
however,material evidence presented at a hearing in which the court makes a true finding under section,subdivision d,duplicates in part the evidence the court would receive when determining whether an emergency exists under the act.see in re joseph,supra,th at,d.at the dependency jurisdictional hearing here the parties were properly noticed,testimonial and documentary evidence was introduced and considered,and the juvenile court found true that had been or there was a substantial risk she would be sexually abused by rodney.this true finding,although unauthorized by the act,necessarily included a finding under the act that an emergency existed and it was necessary to protect from actual or threatened mistreatment or abuse the court section true finding was a finding sufficient to invoke emergency jurisdiction under the act.
the juvenile court then issued an order placing with leslie pending further order by the arkansas court.under section,subdivision c,the custody order should have been limited to a duration determined after consultation with the arkansas court.one reason for consultation with the sister state court is to determine from the sister state court a date by which it could realistically resume consideration of the custody dispute and make further custody orders within its jurisdiction.see,subd.d.by not limiting the duration of the custody order,the california court erred.under the act,the california court custody order is limited to the earlier of the order expiration date or the issuance of a custody order by the arkansas court.although the custody order is not of limited duration,because arkansas has agreed to hear the disposition of the matter and the california court has terminated jurisdiction,noncompliance with section,subdivision c by not limiting the duration of the custody order has not been shown by rodney to be prejudicial 
communication between courts under the act 
immediate communication 
rodney contends the court erred by not immediately contacting the court in arkansas when a california court is asked to make a child custody determination under the act and is informed that a child custody determination has previously been made by a sister state court having jurisdiction,the california court shall immediately communicate with the other court,subd.d.here,it is undisputed the california juvenile court did not contact the arkansas court until almost one month after learning of that court custody order.the california family court contacted the arkansas court on or before august.however,because the juvenile court assumed jurisdiction after that communication,the juvenile court was obligated to contact the arkansas court because it was asked to make a custody determination and it was aware of the existing arkansas court custody order.
the meaning of section,subdivision d is plain and unambiguous.a california court must contact the sister state court immediately.as a practical matter,we interpret this requirement to be as soon as possible after learning of the existence of proceedings in the sister state court the courts must resolve the emergency,protect the safety of the parties and the child,and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order,subd.d.to make an appropriate order under the act,the california court needs to know whether the sister state court wishes to continue its jurisdiction and how much time it requires to take appropriate steps to consider further child custody orders.the statute does not allow the california court to wait to contact the other court until it makes a determination under the act to assume emergency jurisdiction the california juvenile court erred when it did not sooner contact the arkansas court.
the error here,however,is not prejudicial.although the statute states the court shall immediately contact the other court,it does not provide any penalty for noncompliance.when a statute does not provide any consequence for noncompliance,the language should be considered directory rather than mandatory.in re charles d.in re melinda d.the directory and mandatory designations do not refer to whether a particular statutory requirement is permissive or obligatory,but simply denote whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will invalidate the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.in re charles,supra,d at.even though the california juvenile court erred here by not sooner contacting the arkansas court,the error does not warrant reversal in this case because there is no showing of prejudice.
record of communications between the courts 
rodney contends the court erred because it did not properly record the conversations it had with the arkansas court.a record must be made of the communications between the courts discussing matters,other than schedules,calendars,court records and similar matters,under the act,subds.c,d.the record must be inscribed on a tangible medium or stored in an electronic or other medium,and be retrievable in perceivable form,subd.e.
here,there were four communications between the california and arkansas courts.the conversations that occurred on or before august,and on september,were described in memoranda.the october and,conversations were described by the court on the record during a hearing the day following each conversation.written memoranda and reporter transcripts are tangible mediums and are retrievable by the parties.
rodney appears to argue the court should have recorded the conversations verbatim.however,a record includes notes or transcript
