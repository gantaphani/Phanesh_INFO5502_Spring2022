discussion 
entry into henderson residence 
creates a cause of action against a person who,acting under color of state law,deprives another of rights guaranteed under the constitution.section does not create any substantive rights rather it is the vehicle whereby plaintiffs can challenge actions by governmental officials.to prove a case under section,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the action occurred under color of state law and the action resulted in the deprivation of a constitutional right or federal statutory right.there is no dispute that the officers were acting under color of state law.the dispute in this case was whether the officers unreasonably searched henderson house in violation of her fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.
