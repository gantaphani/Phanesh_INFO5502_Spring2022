standard of review 
we review orders granting or denying a summary judgment motion de novo.fsr brokerage,superior court th,d union bank superior court th,d.we exercise an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
immunity of county 
in california,all government tort liability must be based on statute.government code section provides except as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person,subd.a.t his section abolished all common law or judicially declared forms of liability for public entities,except for such liability as may be required by the federal or state constitution.thus,in the absence of some constitutional requirement,public entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable.becerra county of santa cruz th,d.
mandatory liability 
a public entity may be directly liable for failure to discharge a mandatory duty.government code provides where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.
the term enactment as used in government code section means a constitutional provision,statute,charter provision,ordinance or regulation.this definition is intended to refer to all measures of a formal legislative or nature.citation.the term regulation,as used in government code section means a rule,regulation,order or standard,having the force of law,adopted as a regulation by an agency of the state pursuant to the administrative procedure act act.citation.the act rulemaking provisions apply to most state agencies and their regulations.citations.there are significant exceptions,however,both as to the agencies and types of regulations covered.citation.citations.for instance,the a ct does not apply to a regulation that relates only to the internal management of the state agency or a regulation that is directed to a specifically named person or to a group of persons and does not apply generally throughout the state.wilson county of san diego th,d.an employee manual of a juvenile dependency facility is not an enactment that imposes a mandatory duty on county employees.ibid.
one of the essential elements that must be pled is the existence of a specific statutory duty.citation.duty can not be alleged simply by stating defendant had a duty under the law that is a conclusion of law,not an allegation of fact.the facts showing the existence of the claimed duty must be alleged.citation.since the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by a statute or enactment,the statute or enactment claimed to establish the duty must at the very least be identified.citation.therefore,a litigant seeking to plead the breach of a mandatory duty must specifically allege the applicable statute or regulation.citation.unless the applicable enactment is alleged in specific terms,a court can not determine whether the enactment relied upon was intended to impose an obligatory duty to take official action to prevent foreseeable injuries or whether it was merely advisory in character.becerra county of santa cruz,supra,th at,d.
government code section contains a test for determining whether liability may be imposed on a public entity an enactment must impose a mandatory,not discretionary,duty the enactment must intend to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the party asserting section as a basis for liability and breach of the mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered.citation.whether an enactment is intended to impose a mandatory duty is a question of law for the court.becerra county of santa cruz,supra,th at,d.
as our supreme court has explained,first and foremost,application of government code section requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory,rather than merely discretionary or permissive,in its directions to the public entity it must require,rather than merely authorize or permit,that a particular action be taken or not taken.citation.it is not enough,moreover,that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d.
second,but equally important,government code section requires that the mandatory duty be designed to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff suffered.the plaintiff must show the injury is one of the consequences which the enacting body sought to prevent through imposing the alleged mandatory duty.citation.our inquiry in this regard goes to the legislative purpose of imposing the duty.that the enactment confers some benefit on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough if the benefit is incidental to the enactment protective purpose,the enactment can not serve as a predicate for liability under government code section.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
an enactment creates a mandatory duty if it requires a public agency to take a particular action.wilson county of san diego,supra,th at,d.an enactment does not create a mandatory duty if it merely recites legislative goals and policies that must be implemented through a public agency exercise of discretion.ibid.the use of the word shall in an enactment does not necessarily create a mandatory duty.morris county of marin cal d,fn,wilson county of san diego,supra,th at,d.
statutes and regulations 
terrell claims the following statutes and regulations create mandatory duties on the part of the county.
relative and sibling placement.terrell argues family code section,subdivision a,welfare and institutions code sections,subdivision c,subdivision b,and dss manual regulation require that a foster child be placed with a relative and siblings.we address each of these enactments.
family code section,subdivision a provides with full consideration for the proximity of the natural parents to the placement so as to facilitate visitation and family reunification,when a placement in foster care is being made,the following considerations shall be used placement shall,if possible,be made in the home of a relative,unless the placement would not be in the best interest of the child.diligent efforts shall be made to locate an appropriate relative.before any child may be placed in foster care,each relative whose name has been submitted to the agency as a possible caretaker,either by himself or herself or by other persons,shall be evaluated as an appropriate placement resource.
family code section concerns priorities for foster care placement.becerra county of santa cruz,supra,th at,d.this legislative preference for placement in the home of a relative is merely a legislative goal or policy that must be implemented by the county in the exercise of its judgment as to an appropriate foster care placement it does not create a mandatory duty.wilson county of san diego,supra,th at,d.foster care placement is a governmental function that involves the exercise of discretion.in addition,the purpose of the statute is to preserve the family relationship,not to prevent sexual abuse.moreover,the evidence is undisputed that no relatives of terrell were available for placement.
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision c provides when placement is used to attain case plan goals,the decision regarding choice of placement shall be based upon selection of a safe setting that is the
