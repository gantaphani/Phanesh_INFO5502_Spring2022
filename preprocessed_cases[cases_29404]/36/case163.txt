opinion of the court 
this appeal arises out of a federal civil rights lawsuit brought by persons under state court orders for failing to support their children.plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under contending the due process clause establishes a right to counsel,and,if indigent,a right to appointed counsel.defendants are new jersey state court judges and the administrative director of the new jersey courts the district court abstained under younger harris,d.we will affirm.
plaintiffs,michael anthony,anne pasqua and ray tolbert,are all under child support orders issued by the superior court of new jersey,chancery division,family part.because they failed to meet their child support obligations,they were arrested and incarcerated for civil contempt of a court order 
plaintiffs allege violations of their due process rights under the fourteenth amendment specifically,they contend the presiding judges failed to inform them of their right to counsel and,if indigent,to appointed counsel,and moreover,the judges failed to appoint counsel for them.plaintiffs contend they were indigent at the time of their hearings,continue to be indigent,and remain in arrears on their support obligations.as such,they aver there is a great likelihood they will again be deprived of their asserted rights because in the future they will be obligated to appear in similar contempt hearings.
based on the alleged deprivations and their fear of future deprivations,plaintiffs sued certain new jersey judges and the administrative director of the new jersey courts under.see creating liability for individuals who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage of a state,subject others to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws.according to plaintiffs,their constitutional deprivations occur under court rules and procedures promulgated and followed by defendants.
plaintiffs seek the following declaratory and injunctive relief a declaration that defendants failure to inform them of their right to counsel and to appointed counsel,as well as defendants failure to provide counsel,violated their constitutional rights and an injunction preventing future incarceration without notification of right to counsel and to appointed counsel,and requiring appointed counsel whenever a hearing might result in a deprivation of liberty.
plaintiffs also seek certification of a plaintiff class consisting of indigent new jersey residents under child support orders who may appear in similar contempt hearings.the proposed defendant class would consist of all new jersey superior court judges.finally,plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to immediately remedy the current alleged failures of the new jersey court system 
the district court did not reach the merits of the suit.after defendants filed a motion to dismiss in lieu of answer,the district court abstained citing younger harris.because it abstained,the district court denied plaintiffs motions for class certification and a preliminary injunction.the plaintiffs appeal the decision to abstain and the denial of their motions.because this appeal comes to us from a grant of a motion to dismiss under.b,w e accept all factual allegations in the complaints and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.we may affirm only if it is certain that no relief could be granted under any set of facts which could be proven.lorenz csx,cir.
before turning to the merits of abstention,we address standing.defendants did not contest plaintiffs standing nor did the district court address the issue.but we are under an independent obligation to examine standing,even if the courts below have not passed on it,and even if the parties fail to raise the issue before us,city of dallas,d citation omitted.upon review,we agree with the tacit understanding of the parties and the district court that plaintiffs have standing in this matter.
as formulated by the supreme court,standing requires the satisfaction of three elements 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotations,citations and footnote omitted.plaintiffs here meet all three prongs of the standing test.
first,plaintiffs allege they have been injured because of past constitutional deprivations and are likely to be injured in future child support contempt hearings.fears of future injury are based on the likelihood that plaintiffs,who allegedly remain indigent,will be summoned again before the new jersey courts for failing to meet their support obligations.plaintiffs contend they are unlikely to enjoy their asserted rights in any future hearings.see scalchi scalchi,the current law in new jersey does not require that counsel be assigned to an indigent in a support enforcement proceeding.prob.servs,admin.office of the courts,your guide to court preparation answers to common questions about child support enforcement hearings a lawyer will not normally be for this type of hearing.
furthermore,there is a causal connection between the alleged deprivations of plaintiffs constitutional rights and the conduct by the judges and administrator who promulgate and follow the current court practice.finally,plaintiffs injuries could be redressed by a favorable ruling of a federal court declaring the actions of the new jersey courts unconstitutional and issuing the appropriate injunctions.
our view on standing is in accord with most decisions rendered in similar suits.in challenges to current child support contempt hearings and to threatened future hearings,courts have explicitly held that plaintiffs have standing,parker turner,cir finding standing for plaintiffs demanding right to appointed counsel and other due process rights in future child support hearings johnson zurz,finding standing for plaintiffs demanding right to appointed counsel in current and future child support hearings lake speziale,similar to parker.other courts have assumed that plaintiffs have standing without directly addressing the issue,henkel bradshaw,cir mastin fellerhoff.
this suit focuses on a cognizable past injury for which declaratory relief is sought.the suit also seeks to prevent future injury for all indigents,notably those unaware of the rights alleged here,who will appear in child support contempt hearings before any new jersey superior court judge.hence,the injury here is not conjectural or hypothetical nor is the efficacy of the sought remedy speculative.
turning to the merits,w e exercise plenary review over the legal determinations of whether the requirements for younger abstention have been met.focus allegheny county court of common pleas,cir.if the requirements have been met,we review the district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion.id.
in younger,which involved a first challenge to california criminal syndicalism act,the supreme court held that,unless there were extraordinary circumstances,federal courts should not enjoin pending state criminal prosecutions.the ruling was based on traditional principles of equity and on considerations of comity.id.at.younger defined comity as a proper respect for state functions,a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a union of separate state governments,and a continuance of the belief that the national government will fare best if the states and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.id.at.
since younger,the supreme court has extended the doctrine to bar federal interference in other types of state proceedings.younger has been applied to civil enforcement proceedings and to other civil proceedings involving certain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state courts ability to perform their judicial functions.new orleans pub,council of new orleans,d listing court cases that have expanded the doctrine.younger has also been applied to certain state administrative proceedings.see ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.the boundaries for the application of the doctrine remain somewhat elusive.but from its inception,it has been clear that younger abstention only comes into play when an important state interest is implicated.
we have framed a test to determine when younger abstention is appropriate.in order for a federal court to abstain under the younger doctrine 
there must be ongoing state proceedings that are judicial in nature the state proceedings must implicate important state interests and the state proceedings must afford an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims.even if the necessary three predicates exist,however,younger abstention is not appropriate if the federal plaintiff can establish that the state proceedings are being undertaken in bad faith or for purposes of harassment or some other extraordinary circumstances exist such that deference to the state proceeding will present a significant and immediate potential for irreparable harm to the federal interests asserted.
schall joyce,cir citing middlesex county ethics,at.
all three predicates exist here.moreover,there is no showing of bad faith,harassment or some other extraordinary circumstance,which might make abstention inappropriate.as such,we conclude the district court was correct in abstaining in this suit.
pending proceeding 
ensuring the provision of child support is a function particular to the states.new jersey law provides new jersey courts with the authority to order and direct the payment of child support.in part,the statute reads 
pending any matrimonial action brought in this state or elsewhere,or after judgment of divorce or maintenance,whether obtained in this state or elsewhere,the court may make such order as to the care,custody,education and maintenance of the children,or any of them,as the circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case shall render fit,reasonable and just 
each plaintiff here is under a child support order.each order requires continual involvement by the new jersey courts.under new jersey law,parents are obligated to provide support until a child is emancipated.newburgh arrigo,as such,plaintiffs have been,and will remain,under their child support orders for many years.throughout the duration of the order,the new jersey courts are charged with monitoring,enforcing and modifying the child support obligations.see stat.ann.a providing for review and modification of child support orders providing for monitoring and enforcement of child support orders,including the institution of contempt hearings if obligors fail to make payments explaining the jurisdiction,duties,powers and responsibilities of child support hearing officers.as is apparent,the new jersey courts have performed their delegated functions with respect to plaintiffs child support orders.
plaintiffs contend that,because they are not currently appearing or scheduled to appear in any particular child support hearing,including a contempt hearing,there is no ongoing or pending proceeding this argument may carry weight in other types of suits.but given plaintiffs specific claims here and the particular nature of child support orders,the argument is unavailing 
in seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,plaintiffs focus retrospectively and prospectively.to the extent plaintiffs address past contempt proceedings,review is barred by younger.once a party has appeared in state court and has had an opportunity to present its federal claims in the state proceedings,a federal court normally should refrain from hearing the claims.juidice vail,d emphasis in original.the party must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in the district court,unless he can bring himself within one of the exceptions specified in younger.huffman,at.plaintiffs here had ample opportunity to raise any constitutional claims at their state contempt hearings.they also could have appealed any adverse decision to higher courts.see infra section.instead,they impermissibly attempted to bypass the state system and to seek relief in federal court.
addressing prospective injunctive relief,plaintiffs requested remedies will undeniably interfere with pending state proceedings.in new jersey,child support orders and the mechanisms for monitoring,enforcing and modifying them comprise a unique system in continual operation.each plaintiff here is party to an open case that will not terminate until the child support order is finally discharged.the new jersey courts retain continuing,exclusive jurisdiction over these matters,whether the claims are intrastate or interstate,see stat.ann.et,and the state courts constantly monitor plaintiffs compliance with their orders.the new jersey probation division,an arm of the state judiciary,is charged with oversight and reporting failures in meeting support obligations.the probation division and the new jersey courts are conferred with authority to ensure that payments are made and to remedy any failures to pay.id a new jersey superior court judge may revise and alter orders from time to time as circumstances may require.stat.ann.any party,including plaintiffs here,at any time,may request modification of a support order.see stat.ann.
for purposes of younger,such a comprehensive and fluid system designed to address the and realities of child support orders must be viewed as a whole,rather than as individual,discrete hearings.plaintiffs have acknowledged as much.their request for prospective injunctive relief acknowledges that because of their indigency and continued arrearages,they will be subject to future ongoing contempt proceedings.thus their request for federal court intervention to prevent alleged future constitutional violations constitutes impermissible interference with pending state proceedings.
this holding is in accord with younger.as the supreme court has explained,part of the purpose of younger abstention is to avoid duplicative legal proceedings and the disruption of the state justice system.steffel thompson,d see also juidice,at.federal court ruling and relief here would address issues that plaintiffs can raise in their own cases currently pending in the new jersey courts.federal ruling and relief also would interfere with and disrupt the new jersey court system,especially if the federal court must monitor and enforce the state courts compliance with a federal order.see parker,at stating that a federal order requiring state courts to provide appointed counsel and other asserted due process rights would necessitate continual federal court monitoring of the state courts.moreover,a federal court ruling could be interpreted as reflecting negatively upon the state court ability to enforce constitutional principles,a suggestion the younger doctrine seeks to avoid.steffel,at.
important state interest 
new jersey has an overriding interest in ordering,monitoring,enforcing and modifying child support obligations.any ruling in this action would surely affect this interest.as such,the second predicate of our younger test is satisfied.
two supreme court cases in particular illuminate our analysis.in juidice vail,the supreme court concluded that abstention under younger was appropriate with respect to pending contempt hearings.at.according to the court,a state interest in the contempt process,through which it vindicates the regular operation of its judicial system,so long as that system itself affords the opportunity to pursue federal claims within it,is surely an important interest w e think it is of sufficiently great import to require application of the principles in younger and its progeny.id.at.after juidice,the court applied the younger framework to determine whether abstention was appropriate when a corporation challenged the legality of certain procedures in texas.pennzoil texaco,d.in pennzoil,the court recognized the importance to the states of enforcing the orders and judgments of their courts.id.at.
