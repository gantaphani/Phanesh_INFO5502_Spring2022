in the final analysis,all that supported the trial court decision to set aside the stipulated judgment in this divorce case was an imbalance in the division of community property attributable to a in stock values subsequent to the filing of the judgment.not only is such an imbalance not enough to support a motion to set aside a judgment under section of the code of civil procedure in re marriage of connolly cal d,but section of the family code is plain that if a motion is supported only by an imbalance in the division of community property,the trial court can not grant the motion.we therefore reverse the order and direct the trial court to enter a new order denying the motion 
background 
the husband had an ira account composed of two high tech stocks.the account was all community property.the wife also had an ira account,of which a third was community.
in september,after over a year of litigation and after trial had been continued to allow for settlement discussions,the couple entered into a stipulated judgment in which the husband was to execute a rollover instruction transferring the sum of from his ira to the wife ira in order to balance said accounts based on the value of the two stocks as of june,
there was a delay of a little more than three weeks from the time the stipulated judgment was filed september,to the time when the husband attorney forwarded the ira rollover instructions to the wife attorney october.here are the circumstances behind that delay according to the uncontroverted declarations on both sides of the motion 
on september the wife attorney approved the stipulated judgment.the husband attorney learned of the approval that day and prepared the ira rollover instruction letter.the next day,september,the husband signed the instruction letter in his attorney office.the husband attorney kept the instruction letter in his file.
by september all parties and their attorneys had signed the stipulated judgment,and it was submitted to the court that day.it was not filed until september,and a conformed copy was received by the husband counsel on october.on october,the husband attorney formally withdrew from the case and wrote wife attorney,but neglected to include the ira rollover instructions with his letter.
on october,the wife attorney wrote to the husband,who was now in propria persona please provide me proof that you have instituted transfer of the sum of,which is the amount due as of june,together with any interest which has accrued on that amount to date of transfer.
the husband wrote back two days later saying he did believe it was up to him to take any further action regarding the ira transfer because it was up to the wife to use the execution instruction already provided by the husband erstwhile attorney.
on october the wife attorney replied that he had never received the transfer instructions.the husband called his former attorney that day,who then realized the oversight and forwarded the rollover instructions in a letter dated october.the wife attorney received the instruction letter,according to his own declaration,in late october of at which time he turned it over to the wife.
it was another three weeks or so,on november,before the actual rollover from the husband account to the wife account occurred.the way the rollover worked was that worth of stock was transferred to the wife ira on november.
on march,one day before the expiration of six months from the date of the filing of the stipulated judgment,the wife filed a motion to set aside that part of the judgment dividing the community property in the couple respective ira accounts.the wife presented evidence that the value of one of the high tech stocks had increased percent from june,to march,and the other stock had increased percent.she did not present any evidence of the value of the stocks on october the earliest date she might have received the ira rollover instructions or in late october when her counsel received them.
in a very brief hearing the trial judge granted the motion,ordering that the portion of the judgment regarding the division of the ira be set aside.the trial judge did not explain his reasons,but did ask husband counsel,did you read the declaration which presumably referred to the declaration of the wife and her counsel.this appeal followed.
discussion 
stock market fluctuations can not serve as the basis for a set aside motion 
traditionally,set aside motions in family law court have been governed by section when brought within six months after the entry of judgment,and by the common law of extrinsic fraud when brought afterwards.see in re marriage of stevenot d.after relief is no longer available under section an otherwise valid and final judgment can only be set aside if obtained through extrinsic fraud see also in re marriage of varner th,d.
the line between what was extrinsic fraud and what was,however,proved to be a repetitively troublesome issue in the family law field stevenot,supra,d at,and so in the legislature undertook to rationalize the area by enacting sections through of the family code,aka the relief from judgment chapter.see stats,ch,see generally rubenstein rubenstein th,d.
section and the relief from judgment chapter specifically family code section now coexist,operating as alternative bases for relief,depending on when the application is filed.within the time limit under section,a litigant may seek relief from a family law judgment under either the statute mandatory provisions where the litigant attorney is willing to swear to his own or its discretionary provisions where the court may relieve a party of the consequences of his or her own mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.alternatively,the litigant may seek relief under any of the specific grounds specified in family code section.however,after the six months pass,the litigant is limited to just the grounds specified in section,and still faces some time limits.for example,mental incapacity is one of the specified grounds,and subdivision d of the statute requires an action or motion to set it aside within two years after the date of entry of judgment.
there is one interesting interaction between the two statutory schemes family code section necessarily superimposes a per se rule on the trial court discretion under section section is plain that where the only reason to set aside a judgment is that it was inequitable when made,the trial court is affirmatively commanded not to set the judgment aside under any law.section reads notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,or any other law,a judgment may not be set aside simply because the court finds that it was inequitable when made,nor simply because subsequent circumstances caused the division of assets or liabilities to become inequitable,or the support to become inadequate.emphasis added.thus to whatever degree section jurisprudence might have,prior to the enactment of the relief from judgment chapter,countenanced the setting aside of a family law judgment because it was somehow inequitable,that discretion has now been expressly curtailed.
put another way,section represents a fixed legal principle that may not be substantively contravened by the trial court in considering a discretionary application for relief under section.in that regard,it has long been a feature of section discretionary jurisprudence that,even though the trial court decisions benefit from a highly deferential standard of review,they still can not offend fixed legal principles.see carroll abbott laboratories,cal d,accord,lee offenberg d.where sole issue is one of law,result can not contravene result demanded by law.
not that the case law prior to the enactment of section was particularly favorable to applications based merely on imbalances in the division of assets,particularly imbalances caused by,in the words of the statute,subsequent circumstances.the leading case on stock market fluctuations,in re marriage of connolly,supra,cal d,was quite clear that if information concerning a stock value is readily obtainable from newspapers,a trial court has ample grounds to properly deny a spouse request,even if the other spouse obtains wh
