this case arises from the temporary removal of ronald eidson minor daughters by tennessee child protective services and the tennessee department of children services after one of his daughters falsely accused him of sexual abuse.full custody was restored to plaintiff eleven months later,after his daughter recanted her accusation.one year later,plaintiff filed suit,charging that various wrongful acts by child protective services workers had deprived him of liberty without due process.the district court dismissed the action as,rejecting plaintiff arguments that the accrual of his cause of action should be deemed to have been extended due to application of the continuing violation doctrine or,alternatively,abstention principles.the district court ruling is.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
factual and procedural 
in september,ronald eidson had been awarded custody of his three children their mother,nancy eidson,was granted visitation rights.on november,his daughter amanda accused her father of sexual abuse.on november,child protective services cps responded to the accusation,sending cps investigator leilani mooneyham to interview amanda.after speaking with amanda,in the company of amanda mother,mooneyham determined that removal of both of plaintiff daughters,amanda and kathryn,from his custody was appropriate without conducting any further investigation,mooneyham removed both daughters on november,pursuant to a safety plan created by cps,and placed them with their mother.plaintiff was to have no contact with the daughters.
despite a tennessee law requirement that a hearing be conducted within three days following an immediate removal of a child from a parent custody,no such proceeding was initiated by the tennessee department of children services dcs.on may,dcs finally filed a petition in juvenile court alleging plaintiff children were dependent and neglected.at the conclusion of the ensuing hearing,the juvenile court awarded temporary custody of the children to dcs,which placed them with their mother 
on june,investigator myra ramey,who had been assigned to replace mooneyham,sent plaintiff a standard perpetrator notification letter,informing him that he was indicated for sexual abuse and that he had a right to appeal the decision.plaintiff alleges this letter served as notification that his name had been added to an internal dcs registry.
on june,plaintiff daughter recanted her allegations of sexual abuse and admitted that her mother had instigated the false charge.a hearing was held on june,where the juvenile court was informed of the recantation.custody of the children was removed from the mother and transferred to an aunt and uncle.
on july,the juvenile court returned the daughters to plaintiff for a trial period.plaintiff alleges that during the period,he and his family were subject to continual interference by dcs.the nature of the alleged interference is not identified in the complaint or in plaintiff appellate briefing.on october,after successful completion of the trial period,the juvenile court returned full custody of the children to plaintiff.one year later,eidson filed this action on october,in the eastern district of tennessee,claiming violations of his procedural and substantive due process rights under named as defendants are dcs and cps and several of their employees.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint as.on march,the district court granted the motion and dismissed plaintiff claims as barred by the tennessee statute of limitations applicable to actions.in its memorandum opinion and order,the district court concluded that plaintiff claims do not satisfy the requirements of the continuing violation doctrine.the court further rejected plaintiff attempt to invoke abstention principles to forestall dismissal.the court thus held the claims because all unlawful acts alleged in support of the claims occurred more than one year prior to the filing of the complaint.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
whether the district court properly dismissed the complaint pursuant to rule b is a question of law subject to de novo review.mezibov allen,cir.the reviewing court must construe the complaint in a light most favorable to plaintiff,accept all factual allegations as true,and determine whether plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of those allegations that would entitle him to relief.rutter,cir.yet,to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.mezibov,at.conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations will not suffice.id.see also,bell atlantic twombly,d explaining that complaint must contain something more than a statement of facts that merely creates speculation or suspicion of a legally cognizable cause of action.
continuing violation 
the statute of limitations applicable to a action is the state statute of limitations applicable to personal injury actions under the law of the state in which the claim arises.kuhnle,county of geauga,cir.the parties agree that a limitation period,borrowed from tennessee law,ann.a,applies in this case.plaintiff contends his cause of action did not accrue until the juvenile court proceedings concluded on october.he argues that his complaint,filed on october,was timely filed,because the date on which the period would have expired,october,fell on a saturday and the first business day thereafter was october.
the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run in a action is a question of federal law.kuhnle,at.ordinarily,the limitation period starts to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.id.at.i n determining when the cause of action accrues in section actions,we have looked to what event should have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her rights.id.quoting dixon anderson,cir.see also,bell ohio state university,cir hughes vanderbilt university,cir.
the precipitating event in this action,plaintiff concedes,was defendants initial removal of his daughters from his custody on november.at the time of the initial removal,plaintiff knew of the injury which is the basis of his claims.yet,plaintiff argues that defendants continuing wrongful conduct,from the date of the initial removal through the completion of the trial placement period on october,constituted a continuing violation,extending accrual of his cause of action.
the test for determining whether a continuing violation exists is summarized as follows 
first,the defendant wrongful conduct must continue after the precipitating event that began the pattern second,injury to the plaintiff must continue to accrue after that event.finally,further injury to the plaintiff must have been avoidable if the defendants had at any time ceased their wrongful conduct.
tolbert state of ohio dep t of,cir.see also,paschal flagstar bank,cir.a continuing violation is occasioned by continual unlawful acts,not continual ill effects from an original violation.tolbert,at quoting national advertising city of raleigh,cir.passive inaction does not support a continuing violation theory.paschal,at.
in evaluating whether plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to make out a continuing violation,it is necessary to first consider the contours of the civil rights claims he has asserted.in procedural due process claims,the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in life,liberty or property is not itself unconstitutional what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest without due process of law.zinermon burch,d quoting parratt taylor,d emphasis in zinermon.it is undisputed that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the custody of their children and that state intervention in the relationship between a parent and child must be accomplished by procedures meeting the requisites of the due process clause.see smith,cir.even a temporary deprivation of physical custody requires a hearing within a reasonable time.id.plaintiff has asserted a colorable procedural due process,that he was denied a hearing within a reasonable time.
to state a cognizable substantive due process claim,the plaintiff must allege conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest and that is in nature.mitchell mcneil,cir quoting county of sacramento lewis,d.the government interest in protecting children is just as compelling as the parents abstract fundamental liberty interest in family integrity.kottmyer maas,cir.here,the juvenile court finding of probable cause to remove plaintiff daughters,based on amanda accusation of sexual abuse,is supported by a compelling interest and does not,on its face,suggest government that shocks the conscience.however,to the extent plaintiff substantive due process claim is premised on allegations that defendants denied him a hearing for some seven months after initially removing his daughters and then deliberately perpetrated a fraud on the juvenile court,he makes a colorable shocks the conscience claim.
with respect to both due process claims,however,the district court determined that plaintiff was aware of the wrongful conduct well over twelve months prior to the filing of his complaint and his claims were therefore.the court rejected plaintiff reliance on the continuing violation theory.although the court reviews the district court decision de novo,the district court analysis of the continuing violation issue is clear and succinct and represents a useful starting point.
the district court acknowledged,with reference to the tolbert standard,that plaintiff had alleged wrongful acts by defendants that the initial removal of his daughters,the continued denial of custody without proper notice and hearing,as well as mooneyham perjured testimony in the may hearing.by the time the hearing was conducted,however,the district court observed,injury resulting from the alleged denial of procedural due process had ceased to accrue,as plaintiff had,by then,been afforded notice and a hearing.further,the court properly recognized that,by the conclusion of the may hearing,the premises of plaintiff substantive due process claims,mooneyham allegedly perjured testimony and the finding of probable cause to remove the daughters,were certainly known to plaintiff.the only allegation that was deemed to possibly amount to a continuing violation after the hearing was that of continued interference by defendants during the trial placement period.the district court considered the allegation too vague to make out a due process violation.accordingly,the district court held that plaintiff claims failed to meet the requirements of the continuing violation doctrine and that his cause of action accrued more than one year prior to the filing of his complaint.
plaintiff objection to this reasoning is groundless.he argues that his complaint contains allegations of three kinds of wrongful action that continued after the may hearing placement of his name on an internal sex offender registry continued prosecution of the neglect petition after amanda recanted her accusation and continued interference during the trial placement period.he insists the injury he sustained as the result of a continuous series of events did not accrue until october,when legal custody of his daughters was finally restored to him.yet,none of these allegedly continuing wrongful acts make out a deprivation of liberty without due process or otherwise suggest unlawful conduct and the complaint offers no reason to conclude any of them continued beyond october.granted,full legal custody was not restored until october,but actual physical custody of his daughters had been returned to plaintiff in july.that is,the injury resulting from the precipitating event had been substantially remedied in july return of plaintiff daughters having thus avoided any continuing constitutionally cognizable injury.
any harmful effects resulting from actions allegedly taken by defendants after the juvenile court proceeding are appropriately characterized as continuing ill effects,which do not make out a continuing violation.the letter plaintiff received informing him that he had been indicated for sexual abuse and his name placed in an internal database was not an unlawful act,but represents a reasonable precaution,incidental to his daughter allegation of sexual abuse.even though amanda subsequently recanted her accusation,the earlier inclusion of plaintiff name on the internal list,without more,hardly implicates any deprivation of liberty without due process.
plaintiff allegation of continued prosecution of the petition after amanda recantation appears to be based on the contention that defendants continued to fail to conduct the sort of thorough investigation that would have exonerated him.further,defendants are alleged to have known of mooneyham false testimony regarding his consent to the children removal and yet continued to refrain from informing the juvenile court.these allegations fail to establish a continuing violation,as mere inaction is not enough to satisfy the doctrine.tolbert,at paschal,at.
plaintiff has not identified any affirmative acts taken by defendants in furtherance of continued prosecution except for his vague allegation of continual interference during the trial placement period.this,too,hardly suggests unlawful conduct and,in any event,is nothing but an ill effect of the original removal of the children,since the juvenile court had awarded temporary custody to dcs in the may proceeding.considering the seriousness of the original accusation,and amanda recanting thereof,dcs was certainly justified in cautiously questioning whether the truth had in fact emerged and whether the daughters best interests were served by their return to their father household.dcs had a legitimate reason and arguably an affirmative duty to continue monitoring the children during the trial placement period.plaintiff complaint affords no support for the conclusion that the continual interference he complains of was anything other than ordinary inconvenience attendant to legitimate monitoring by dcs.
even viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff,they fail,due to their vagueness,to warrant a reasonable inference that the alleged interference rose to the level of a deprivation of liberty without due process.as the supreme court recently reiterated,even under rule b review,a complaint containing a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion of a legally cognizable right of action is insufficient.bell atlantic.at.factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.plaintiff complaint simply does not pass muster under this standard.
hence,it is apparent that plaintiff has failed to set forth facts facially establishing a continuing violation during the period immediately preceding the filing of his complaint.the district court did not err in rejecting plaintiff continuing violation theory.
abstention principles 
plaintiff alternative argument for extension of the date of accrual of his cause of action is based at least derivatively on abstention principles.plaintiff contends that if he had filed his claims prior to the completion of the state juvenile court proceedings,the district court would have been obliged to abstain.it follows,plaintiff argues,citing the sixth circuit ruling in shamaeizadeh cunigan,cir,that his cause of action did not accrue until the juvenile court proceedings concluded on october.the district court rejected this argument as well.the district court accepted the notion that a federal court would have been constrained to abstain from proceeding with plaintiff claims during the pendency of the juvenile court proceedings,but held this likelihood alone did not toll the running of the statute of limitations and did not relieve plaintiff of the responsibility to timely file his claims.the district court was also unpersuaded by plaintiff reliance on shamaeizadeh,holding that its reasoning applied only in the context of state court criminal proceedings.
despite plaintiff characterization of his argument,the ruling in shamaeizadeh is not based on application of abstention principles.yet,a
