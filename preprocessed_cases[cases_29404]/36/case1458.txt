appellant,bryan loyd bryan,appeals the trial court order modifying the custody arrangement of his two children.after the proper motions were filed,the trial court modified the prior physical custody order and awarded primary physical custody to shannan loyd shannan.we find the trial court based its decision on an improper consideration,reverse the order,and remand the matter to the trial court for a new hearing.
background 
bryan and shannan were married and had two children,now age five,and,now age four.on july,after four years of marriage,bryan filed a petition for dissolution of marriage.according to bryan he filed for dissolution due to shannan drinking problem.he claimed that after the birth of their youngest child,shannan became depressed and began taking medication and drinking heavily.shannan entered a rehabilitation program and remained there for a period of five and months.bryan began the dissolution proceedings while shannan was attending the rehabilitation program.simultaneous to the filing of the petition,bryan also filed an order to show cause for child custody.
shannan failed to appear at the order to show cause child custody hearing on august.the trial court awarded joint legal custody to both parents,with sole physical custody vested in bryan.shannan received no visitation with the children until both parties attended court ordered mediation or until further order of the court.the trial court subsequently entered a default against shannan,and a judgment of dissolution was ordered on september.in the judgment,as in the temporary order,the court awarded both parties joint legal custody of the two children with bryan awarded sole physical custody.the court further ordered shannan would have no visitation with the minor children until both parties attended court ordered mediation or until further order of the court.
on january,bryan filed a notice of motion for child support.also on january,shannan filed a motion for modification of child custody and visitation,requesting physical custody of the children and reasonable visitation.after a hearing on the motion on february,the trial court ordered physical custody to remain with bryan and ordered alternating weekend and holiday visitation with shannan.
on september,shannan filed another motion to modify the custody order.according to her motion,shannan claimed that due to bryan work schedule,the minor children were spending many hours with third party caregivers,day care providers and bryan parents,and that shannan is a homemaker and could care for the children in her home during the day.after a hearing on the motion,the trial court ordered an investigation through the court mediation department on the issue of custody and visitation.as a result,an investigator report was filed with the court and received into evidence.
according to the report,bryan worked from to monday through saturday.the children attended daycare from to five days a week,and were transported to and from daycare by bryan parents.bryan and the children were living with bryan parents,but bryan was hopeful of finding his own residence within the following year.the report indicated that the children were in a positive and nurturing environment.
the report stated that shannan had remarried and was a mother.shannan two children from a previous marriage resided with her,as did her newborn from her current marriage.shannan informed the investigator that she began experiencing symptoms of depression after the birth of and,as a result,began taking medication and drinking heavily.she entered a rehabilitation center,remaining there for approximately four months.while she was in the recovery center,bryan filed for dissolution.she claimed there was some confusion as to a court date,and as a result she did not appear at the hearing where bryan was awarded sole physical custody of the children.six months later,shannan was awarded visitation with the children and has consistently exercised her right to visit with the children.
shannan stated that she wanted physical custody of the children because she could be at home with them during the day and could provide for them emotionally and physically.shannan informed the investigator that she had not ingested alcohol or medication since her discharge from the recovery center and had learned coping skills to support her recovery.
the investigator noted that both bryan and shannan were appropriate parents.the report explained that bryan had done an excellent job in providing for his children and they were adequately cared for while he was at work.in addition,the children benefited from their relationship with their grandparents.although shannan depression and alcohol abuse had a negative impact on her children in the past,shannan appeared stable and competent at the time she was interviewed by the investigator.the investigator opined that the children would benefit from being in shannan care during the week,noting that this arrangement would maximize the amount of quality time each parent would have with the children.thus,the investigator concluded shannan should receive primary physical custody of the children with liberal visitation to bryan.
at a subsequent hearing on the motion,bryan testified that he was currently working fewer hours in that he no longer worked on saturdays.he acknowledged that shannan had consistently exercised her visitation rights with the children and that the visits were successful.as to shannan recovery,bryan stated that she was kicked out of the program for drinking,although she was subsequently readmitted.to bryan knowledge,shannan was not currently involved in any recovery program.
justin krizo,the investigator who prepared the report,testified that to his knowledge shannan was not participating in any recovery programs.he explained his recommendation regarding custody was based upon shannan increased stability.he explained shannan was remarried,had a stable residence and had completed her recovery with no further use of alcohol or drugs.he did not believe that removing the children from their father care would have an adverse impact upon them.
shannan testified that she never relapsed while in the rehabilitation center.she noted that she was erroneously discharged from the center and was subsequently readmitted.she stated that she no longer used drugs or alcohol.
after hearing the evidence and considering the investigator report,the trial court found shannan had demonstrated a significant change in circumstances by establishing a period of stability.she had achieved a period of recovery and was able to provide for the children in her home.due to the fact that shannan was able to provide for the children at home while bryan worked,the trial court determined that it would be in the children best interests to reside with shannan.consequently,the trial court ordered the children be placed in joint legal and physical custody of both parents with shannan having primary physical custody.bryan was granted visitation with the children.
discussion 
in making an initial custody determination,the court must make an award that is in accordance with the best interests of the child.burchard garay cal d.custody and visitation orders are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.montenegro diaz cal th,d,in re marriage of burgess cal th,d.although precise definition is difficult,it is generally accepted that the appropriate test of abuse of discretion is whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.in re marriage of connolly cal d.this standard of appellate review has been called the deferential abuse of discretion test.in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th at,d.
the sole issue presented in this case is whether the trial court abused its discretion in modifying the custody order.bryan argues that the trial court erred in finding that there had been a significant change of circumstances and that the court failed to give proper consideration to the children need for continuity and stability.
after hearing the evidence presented at the hearing,the trial court ruled as follows
