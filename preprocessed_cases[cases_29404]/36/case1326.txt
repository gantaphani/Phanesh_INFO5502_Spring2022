in this case we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by calculating income for pendente lite child and spousal support orders based on only the latest two months of a salesperson earnings.the trial court should have used a properly representative sample,which,on this record,would presumptively have been the previous months.
a.the complicated nature of husband.the sample the trial court used 
husband tracy riddle works as a commissioned financial advisor for a major investment firm.there are four components to his income,the first two of which are somewhat unusual in that they constitute the forgiveness of debt on an advance received by his employer during the marriage,and the forgiveness of the interest on the debt.
the circumstances behind these two components are these during the marriage,in order to lure husband away from his prior employer,his present employer paid him an advance against his future earnings of million.this amount was to be paid back every month in installments of,plus interest of.however,on husband earning statement the plus is included among husband earnings because the amount is also being forgiven in the same monthly installments in which it was supposed to have been paid back.in tax law,the forgiveness of debt is considered income.the reason for this convoluted system of payment is fairly obvious it allowed the employer to pay husband big bucks up front,but spread out the payment of tax on the payment over time so as to circumvent the progressivity of the tax codes.
there are two other components to husband earnings as shown on the employer earnings statement besides the and the on the debt.one is a monthly draw of.the other,and this the variable part,is the actual amount of commission husband earns for a given month,and that figure fluctuates.
wife susan riddle is,by her own description,a mom with no income.
at the initial order to show cause for pendente lite child support and spousal support on february,the trial court made an order that husband pay per month in child support,plus percent of any income in excess of in a month.it also ordered that he pay spousal support of plus percent of any income in excess of per month.both orders were predicated on a finding that husband gross monthly earnings were.husband timely appealed from that order 
the was arrived at by taking the combined figures on husband earnings for is,just the two months of january and february the draw,the commission,the forgiveness of the monthly installment to repay the principal on the advance,and the forgiveness of the installment on the interest.for those two months the total of these amounts was.the trial judge then divided the by six weeks,apparently because the last entry on the statement was as of february.six weeks from january through february.that number was.then that figure was multiplied by four to obtain a monthly income of.
however,the court then deducted an erroneous transposition from the principal forgiveness arrived at,which was then plugged into an xspouse software program apparently xspouse is a new rival to the dissomaster.the xspouse software then yielded two figures for child and spousal support.
the trial court deduction of the has not been challenged in this appeal,and there is authority albeit in the form of dicta for it,in in re marriage of kirk d.speculating that if repayment of debt arrangement was not truly voluntary,trial court would have discretion to deduct it from income on remand 
alternative samples the trial court might have used 
the contrasts starkly with the figures the court would have obtained if it had used a more representative time period than just the first two months of.the combined figure for the draw,commission,and forgiveness of for the previous months was,which would amount to an average of a month.assuming the was deducted from this average just like the trial court had deducted it from the figure,the result would be is only percent of the attributed as income by the trial court.
or,if one took the calendar months of as a more representative figure,the combined totals would have been,or a month.after deducting the forgiveness of principal the monthly income figure would be.which is about percent of.
finally,if one took just the last months prior to the february combined total of which included amounts deducted for january and february,but with the for january and february added back and divided that by,one would get,and after the was taken out,the total would be,or about percent of.
ii.discussion 
cash flow is not necessarily income 
at the outset we must reject husband argument that the only substantial evidence at the hearing necessitated a finding that his income was a mere a month because that was what his expert testified his cash flow was,and there was nothing to contradict it.while we recognize that family lawyers and forensic accountants sometimes use the phrase cash flow as a sloppy synonym for the word income as it appears in the support statutes,it is.in particular,the child support laws see,are very exacting as to the definition of income.as we pointed out in in re marriage of schulze th,d,the language was lifted straight from the internal revenue code.that means that if the tax laws say you have income because of the,you have income,and that income must go into the calculation of adjusted gross income under section,subdivision a,which in turn is the basis for income under section,subdivision a.now,there is authority in in re marriage of kirk,supra,d at page,as we have alluded to above,to ameliorate the harsh effects of assessing phantom income as imputed by the tax laws under the circumstances of a given case,subd,but that does mean that phantom income as imputed by the tax laws is any less income for purposes of section,subdivision a.
in this case there was evidence to contradict the expert testimony as to husband income being a mere a month.first,there are the figures from the employer earnings statement that we have already discussed.second,in addition,there was also the husband form for the calendar year,which showed wages,tips and other compensation of and medicare wages and tips of.note,however,that even using the higher of these figures,the monthly average would be,and assuming the deduction for the earlier loan,the figure would be,which was lower than any of the alternative sample calculations set forth above.though the contradicted husband income and expense declaration which asserted net monthly disposable income of,the court would have been entitled to consider the,as well as the employer statement,better evidence of what his real income was in february.see in re marriage of loh th,d presumptive correctness of tax returns.
so the theory that a a month cash flow should necessarily be equated in this case as the husband income simply is not tenable.
time samples must be fair and representative to determine fluctuating income 
but just because the husband has taken an overstated position by equating cash flow with income does mean the rest of his appeal is without merit.husband is quite correct that the trial court used an unjustifiable sample.
as regards sampling,this case is essentially a gloss on family code sections and,the two statutes which deal with the problem of calculating fluctuating income for support orders the aim of section is to give a trial court discretion to adjust the annual net adjustable income required for a support order when dividing net disposable income by does not accurately reflect the actual or prospective earnings of the parties.section gives a trial court the authority to adjust a child support order as appropriate to accommodate seasonal or fluctuating income of either parent.while both statutes are framed in discretionary terms,it is also well established that the discretion must be a reasonable one,exercised along legal lines,taking into consideration the circumstances of the parties,their necessities and the financial ability of the supporting spouse.in re marriage of rosen th,d,quoting in re marriage of laube d,bracket insert made by the rosen court.
the published case law articulating the basic common law principles as regards fluctuating income is still reasonably manageable at the moment.
from in re marriage of hall th,d,we learn that a court must arrive at a stable number in order to make a support order,even if income does fluctuate from month to month.see id.at,d the formula is always predicated on knowing what both parents income is in nominal static dollars at the time the order is made.
from county of placer andrade th,d,we learn that the idea behind this stable number is to have a reasonable predictor of what each spouse or parent will earn in the immediate future.see id.at,d the assumption underlying these calculations is that past income is a good measure of the future income from which the parent must pay support.the theory is that the court is trying to predict likely income for the immediate future,as distinct from extraordinarily high or low income in the past.
and,perhaps most relevantly to the case at hand,in re marriage of rosen,supra,th at page,d,has recently demonstrated,albeit in the context of calculating the good will in a small law practice,that the time period on which income is calculated must be long enough to be representative,as distinct from extraordinary.
in rosen,a panel of this court considered the case of a lawyer whose income varied dramatically in the four years prior to his divorce.in it was down at about,in it was up to about,then in it was down to about,but in it was way up to about.the lawyer presented expert testimony basing the goodwill value only on the historically abnormally good year of,and the trial court bought the expert valuation based on that higher figure.
the selection of the unrepresentative year was error,said the rosen court.the expert should have averaged the figures rather than just taking the latest figure in a transparent effort to inflate goodwill.see rosen,supra,th at,d under the facts presented here,we believe pat expert should have averaged it.a reasonable trier of fact could not help but conclude the expert chose to use bruce net income from of bruce highest earning to inflate the value of goodwill.the income for was not an average or reasonably illustrative of the lawyer earnings.ibid.
rosen involved a goodwill calculation,hence the focus of the court was on average annual income.the present case,by contrast,involves a support order so the focus,as we might deduce from county of placer,is not on prior average earnings calculated over many years in order to obtain a reliable figure,but on immediate prospective earnings on which support must be paid.even so,the basic principle which rosen applied to goodwill is also soundly applicable to support orders.indeed,it is a principle familiar to anyone who has ever read darrell huff classic,how to lie with statistics often used as a textbook in high school critical thinking courses,or had a course in elementary statistics or logic a sample must be representative of what is being sampled 
so what was implicit in rosen as regards a goodwill calculation we will now make explicit as regards to support orders it is a manifest abuse of discretion to take so small a sliver of time to figure income that the determination essentially becomes arbitrary.and under the facts of this case,no other word but arbitrary properly describes the trial court selection of the last two months to determine husband income.a mere two months is an embarrassingly short period on which to predict the annual income of a commissioned salesperson who works in the financial markets.and it is particularly too short under the record before us,where husband income for the previous months,previous calendar year,and immediately preceding months were all a pretty consistent in themselves,and,and if you used medicare wages,but b wildly inconsistent with the two month period.
we are forced to conclude that the trial court chose an unrealistic time sample in order to,as the rosen court might have put it,inflate the supporting spouse monthly income.
since both the child and spousal support orders were predicated on the unrealistic monthly income figure,they must both be reversed.the question then arises as to how much guidance we should give the trial court on remand.since section and are framed in discretionary terms,it would be outside the proper province of an appellate court to prescribe a rule for the precise parameters of a proper sample after all,the whole point of discretion is a recognition that there are times when there should be a rule.
we also recognize,of course,that,as in rosen,longer time samples are appropriate for measuring average annual income for purposes of goodwill valuations.however,as regard support,we may say that statutes appear to create a presumption that the most recent months is certainly an appropriate period in most cases.
while section is framed in terms of net monthly disposable income see,subd.a,section defines that phrase in terms of dividing the annual net disposable income by and section defines annual net disposable income in terms of annual gross income.in short,there is a heavy emphasis on months or annual income as a benchmark for the calculation.which is,come to think of it,only common sense anyway the income tax laws which,like support orders,are focused on income,are also framed,not in terms of artificially truncated and therefore unrepresentative slices of time,but in terms of whole years.
a longer period could,of course,be conceivably used under section if it were more representative of a party income.for example,a average might indeed yield a more representative overall income figure for a party who only wrote books for a living.one can readily imagine that in the book industry long production lead times and the tendency of initial sales to fall off hence royalties are likely to be highest with a book initial release would mean that a period of more than a year might be necessary in order to obtain a representative picture of an author income.
then again,a longer period could well have its problems in regard to a salesperson as distinct from an author,particularly a salesperson who worked in an industry that traditionally bobs and dips with interest rates,or the economy as a whole,real estate sales,or,as in the present case,securities sales.going back too far for such income earners only yields figures reflective of what the overall economy was in the past,not a figure,as the statutes and case law contemplate,of what the party income will be in the immediate future.in the present case,for example,going back to the late might only show what a commissioned investment advisor could make during the dotcom boom.that merely shows what was likely back in,not what was likely in february.
on the other hand,too short a period and the case before us practically represents a reductio ad absurdum for too short a period clearly exaggerates events in that period.here,husband obtained a whopping large commission in february,and the trial court predicated its order on the unrealistic theory that such commissions,clearly out of line with what he was making in just the previous to months,would continue indefinitely.we have only to flip the facts around to see the speciousness of the analysis had the husband had a lean two months in the period january through february,an order predicated on just those two months would have unrealistically understated his income.additionally,time periods that are too short may unrealistically exaggerate economic that may,over longer periods,smooth themselves out.surely anyone who has even casually followed the dow over the past decade knows that there can be periods of many months of up followed by many months of the course of a year a trend may emerge,but slicing just one small period of a few months is likely to yield a highly unrepresentative picture.
c.this order can not be justified on the basis of imputed income 
the court math and statistical errors were brought to the trial court attention by formal objections to the court tentative ruling in a hearing on the objections the court alluded to the idea that income should be imputed to husband based on his historical earnings 
the simple answer to this issue is that there is
