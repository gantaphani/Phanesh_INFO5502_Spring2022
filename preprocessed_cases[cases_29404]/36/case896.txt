factual and procedural background 
on may,the department filed a petition alleging that two sisters,each of whom has the initials and their brother,came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under subdivisions a,b,and g of section.at the time,older sister was seven,younger sister was three,and was five.petitioner was identified as the alleged father of the children.among other things,the department alleged that petitioner and the mother,mother,had a history of domestic violence that had placed the children at risk when they lived together.it was alleged that petitioner had left the family two years before and that his whereabouts were then unknown.the department also alleged that mother regularly hit the children with a belt and placed them at risk of harm by engaging in domestic violence with her boyfriend.furthermore,it was alleged that mother boyfriend physically and emotionally abused the children,including by placing them in a cold shower for extended periods of time as a form of punishment.
according to the disposition report,mother had obtained a restraining order against petitioner and had not seen him since march,when police took him away.the social worker recommended that the court order reunification serves for mother but wrote that services for petitioner would be inappropriate given the restraining order against him as well as his history of domestic violence against mother.
at the jurisdiction hearing in august,the juvenile court sustained the allegations of the section petition,as amended,and adjudicated the three children dependents of the court.the court found that petitioner whereabouts were unknown and that the department had made reasonable efforts to locate him.the court left the children in mother care.
on november,the department filed a section petition seeking to remove the children from mother care.according to the petition,mother mental state had deteriorated and she had failed to provide adequate care for the children,including meeting their medical needs,ensuring their attendance at school,and providing them with appropriate clothing and food.in addition,her boyfriend had been released from prison and had returned to the home,despite his being a suspected child abuser.on november,the court placed the children in foster care.
in a november status report,the department recommended terminating mother reunification services and ordering foster care as the permanent plan for the children.the report indicated that petitioner had been located in oregon and had indicated his willingness to travel to san francisco to visit the children.petitioner first appearance in the case occurred at a november hearing at which the court appointed counsel for petitioner and ordered supervised visits between petitioner and the children.
petitioner failed to appear at the review hearing,which was ultimately conducted in february.at the hearing,the court ordered the department to continue to provide reunification services to mother.there is no indication that petitioner asked for visits,reunification services,or any particular placement for the children at the time.
in march,petitioner filed a motion for presumed father status and sought monthly visits.in a declaration in support of the motion,he admitted he had not visited the children since late.the court granted the motion for presumed paternity status.
in an april status report prepared for the review,the social worker wrote that petitioner had not requested or received reunification services from the department and had not visited the children.at the time,older sister and were living together in a foster home in san francisco,while younger sister was living in napa at a foster home.the social worker wrote that mother had failed to substantially comply with her reunification plan and that police had to be called after she physically assaulted a visiting room supervisor during one of her visits with the children.the department recommended terminating further reunification efforts and setting a section hearing.
the review hearing was conducted in may.the court terminated further reunification services for mother and ordered foster care as the children permanent plan 
over the course of the next four years,the court conducted regular review hearings and continued the children placement in foster care.petitioner failed to appear at all but one of the review hearings held from through january.petitioner one appearance at a review hearing conducted between and january occurred in march.at the hearing,the court made no additional orders regarding visitation or services for petitioner.
as of june,the department had a seattle address for petitioner.the social worker wrote in her june status report that the parents had not visited their children.in the status report prepared for the december review hearing,the social worker reported that there had been no or telephone contact between the parents and the children.however,it was noted that petitioner had sent older sister and birthday gifts,which the social worker gave to the children.
the next status review report was filed on june.the department asked the court to set a section hearing for older sister and younger sister to upgrade their permanent plans from foster care to adoption.the social worker wrote that older sister,then years old,had moved to her prospective adoptive home in february.younger sister,then nine years old,was preparing to move to her prospective adoptive home on june.the department recommended that the court continue placement in foster care.the june status report reflected that there was no contact between the children and their parents.
the department provided notice of the june,status review hearing to petitioner at an address in washington state.he appeared in court on june,and asked for a contested hearing on the department recommendation to set a section hearing for older sister and younger sister.the court initially indicated it would set the matter for a contested hearing,which petitioner counsel estimated would take a full day.counsel for the department objected,arguing that a party must make an offer of proof to justify a hearing pursuant to sheri superior court th,d sheri.petitioner counsel responded that his client had a right to contest a referral to a section hearing,unfettered by an offer of proof.the court continued the matter and asked for briefing on the issue of whether an offer of proof is required to contest a referral to a section hearing.
when the court reconvened on july,petitioner counsel withdrew his request for a contested hearing,explaining that he had been a little careless on the law.he agreed with the department that sheri required him to make a showing as to why petitioner was entitled to contest the referral to a section hearing.he told the court he could not make the necessary showing.the court proceeded to admit the status review report into evidence and followed the department recommendations,setting a section hearing for older sister and younger sister to be held on october.
petition filed a timely notice of his intent to file a writ petition.we stayed the section hearing pending further order of this court.
