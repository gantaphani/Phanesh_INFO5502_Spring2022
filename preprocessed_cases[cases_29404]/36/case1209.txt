factual and procedural background 
mother and father were married in.daughter was born in.she is the only child of the marriage.the family was residing in california when father petitioned for dissolution of the marriage in may.mother and daughter moved to new york while the dissolution was september.a judgment of dissolution has since been entered and father has remarried.
in february,the family court issued an order in the still pending dissolution action,setting forth a very specific custody and timeshare schedule.the order provided that mother would have primary physical custody of daughter during the school year and that father would have primary custody over the summer and during certain school holidays.the order permitted father one visit per month during the times mother had primary custody and it specified the dates and times those visits would take place.the october visit was described in paragraph of the order as a visit in new york from october until october.italics added.
on august,the parties were in court for a settlement conference to modify the february custody order.after reaching an agreement off the record,mother and father and their counsel appeared before the court to make a record of the agreement.father counsel recited the modifications by going through the february order paragraph by paragraph.when she came to the modification of paragraph,counsel stated t he words in new york will be stricken.this is the change that underlies the instant proceeding.father claims that by striking the phrase in new york the parties intended to allow him to travel to california with daughter on his weekend visits.mother claims that the change meant only that father was not confined to new york but could travel locally when he came east to visit daughter.the only other reference to the travel issue during the august,hearing occurred at several points during counsel recitation of the agreement,when mother counsel interjected the proviso the pick ups and returns are in new york.at one point she clarified the only caveat is if father wishes to travel with the child in his custodial times on those monthly visits,that he is certainly free to do so.
after the entire agreement was read,the court asked the parties about whether they agreed to the proposal and whether they wanted it to be an order of the court.both parties answered affirmatively.the court then concluded it is an order of the court.who will prepare the order father counsel volunteered.
father counsel prepared a proposed order that reflected father understanding of the agreement.mother counsel objected.as pertinent here,paragraph of the proposed order stated in october father shall visit with his daughter from october until october.he shall pick up the minor child at school at the end of the academic portion of her day on friday,october,have care of her for an extended weekend and return her to school on tuesday morning,october father and of the minor child shall be in new york.paragraph stated both parents shall have the right to travel with the minor child wherever they choose within the united states 
on friday,october,the trial court signed the written order that father counsel had prepared.the order was filed on tuesday,october,and it was served by mail upon mother attorney on thursday,october.
meanwhile,on saturday,october,father sent mother an explaining his plan for visiting daughter the following weekend.father and his new wife had recently had a baby and father family from all over the world was gathering in california for a celebration over the weekend of october.father wanted to bring daughter to california for the gathering.because of the party,father told mother,i am therefore considering making an exception and bringing daughter to california for the weekend.he gave mother airline flight times and other particulars and let her know that he intended to pick daughter up from school on friday,october and return her to new york on october.
mother did not agree to the plan because she believed the plan exceeded their custody agreement.she went to court in new york city on thursday,october,and obtained a protective order directing that father not interfere with mother care and custody of daughter and that he not remove the child from the jurisdiction of this court.at this point,neither mother nor her counsel had received the signed,written order adopting father interpretation of the agreement.
armed with the october,written order,and unaware of the protective order,father flew to new york on friday,october,intending to collect daughter when she got out of school that afternoon.when father arrived at daughter school he was approached by two police officers who served him with the protective order mother had obtained the day before.father showed them the october order that he carried,but the officers told father that since the new york order was the more recent,the new york order would control.the officers warned father that unless he agreed to comply with the protective order they would arrest him.father returned to california and shortly thereafter filed a petition for an order to show cause why mother should not be found in contempt.in his petition,father cited both the august,proceedings and the october,written order as the court order mother allegedly disobeyed.
at the hearing on the contempt petition,the parties agreed that mother did not have notice of the october,order since the order had been served by mail only the day before father arrived in new york to pick up daughter.the matter proceeded on the assumption that the oral ruling of august,was the basis for the contempt.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court stated i think it clear from the transcript that father,the petitioner,was not prohibited from traveling during his custodial or visitation time.the court found that since mother knew of father intentions,she clearly had the opportunity and did not take that opportunity to request emergency orders from the california court that clearly had jurisdiction.the fact that she did not do that corroborates for me the fact that she knew that the orders as written here gave him,in fact,the right to travel.i also find that the petition in new york failed to alert the new york court as to the current custody orders in california.it appears that she intentionally misled the court,misled the court as to her rights.
since this was the second time in the course of the dissolution proceedings that mother was found in contempt,the court imposed the maximum penalty a fine,five days in jail,and hours of community service.she was also ordered to pay father attorney fees.code civ,subds.a,c.mother has paid the fine.she is released on bail pending the outcome of these proceedings.
