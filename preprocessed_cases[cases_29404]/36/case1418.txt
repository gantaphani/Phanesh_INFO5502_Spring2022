antoinette toni brinkman toni appeals a order preventing her on the theory of estoppel from presenting evidence that respondent bruce brinkman bruce owed a month child support rather than the per month recommended by a family court settlement officer.the estoppel allegedly covered the period between august,the date of the recommendation,and april,when bruce motion in limine was granted and the trial court ordered child support of per month.toni contends the trial court abused its discretion.bruce responds that the appeal should be dismissed because the order on his motion in limine is not a final,appealable order.
the parties dissolved their marriage on december,and the judgment provided for the support of their two sons,scott,and kyle.bruce agreed to pay a month in child support,cover the boys on his health policy,and pay half the day care expenses.in june,bruce stopped paying his share of the day care expenses,and by february,when toni filed her order to show cause osc for child support arrears,payment of day care fees,medical insurance arrears,and attorney fees,bruce had dropped the boys from his health policy.bruce responded to toni osc with a motion filed on february,also for modification of support,reallocation of custody time for the boys from percent with toni to percent with toni,and attorney fees.the matters were both heard on march,and the court ordered the parties to orientation and mediation with family court services on the custody issues,and to settlement officer james cox for an early disposition conference edc on the issues of unreimbursed medical costs,day care costs,and undisclosed assets.
cox received information on the parties assets and liabilities and as stated above,recommended reduction of support to per month.the recommendation consisted of handwritten notes on a preprinted family court settlement officer order form with the section stating it is so ordered and lines for signatures of the parties,the attorneys,and james frederic cox,family court settlement officer judge pro tempore,superior court crossed out.the notes stated that bruce was to sell a half share in some tickets to toni bruce was to pay toni child support of per month starting august,half of child care expenses,half of medical insurance costs,and half of unreimbursed health care costs and bruce was to provide toni with a copy of his tax return.the notes also stated,omitted asset issue resolved.cox proposed considering all issues to erc early resolution conference for resolution.cox initials are written immediately under the notes.
the form on which cox wrote his recommendation contains a printed advisement stating in relevant part.all prior orders shall remain in effect except as modified hereby.the court retains jurisdiction to implement and interpret the below agreement.either party that prepares a formal order executing this agreement shall submit it first to opposing counsel or party for approval by signature,and may then submit it to the judge pro tem according to local rules 
the next day,on august,bruce attorney delman smith wrote toni attorney jeralyn spradlin to confirm the tentative agreements reached at the early disposition conference yesterday,august,with jim cox,the letter stated.the issue of child support has resulted in an indicated decrease to per month.smith suggested meeting and conferring on childcare reimbursement and mentioned two possible arrangements to resolve the attorney fee issues.he concluded,p lease advise immediately as i am leaving for vacation and would like to prepare accordingly.bruce immediately reduced his support payments to per month without following the procedure set forth on the form.however,he did resume paying for day care.spradlin stated at the trial on april,that she advised smith by phone that toni objected to the reduction to.
after the recommendation,toni osc was mentioned in toni august,erc statement but there are no references to action taken by the court.spradlin stated at the april,trial that the osc had been continued pending the outcome of the custody and visitation issues and finally was taken off calendar subject to reappearance on the calendar when the custody and visitation issues were finally addressed.smith observed,counsel has stated on the record that the prior motion was taken off calendar.the court file should note that.if it was taken off calendar,there no retroactivity.spradlin retorted,it was subject to reinstatement.it was taken off calendar.there is no mention of the february,osc after august,in the clerk transcript on appeal.the custody issues proceeded on a separate track to an early resolution conference erc,went to assessment,and were finally resolved in july.toni timeshare was increased to percent.
immediately thereafter,on september,toni filed a new motion to modify the support order of march,and asking for arrearages on the same facts as the osc.the march order did not address ongoing support but ordered each party to pay half of all medical costs,exclusive of the insurance premiums,and it referred the other issues raised in the february,osc to cox.when the matter finally came up for trial on april,spradlin said the motion was simply to get the february motion back on calendar the same day,the day set for trial on the support issues,bruce filed his motion in limine requesting the court to bar toni from presenting evidence or claims for child support other than the recommendation based on estoppel.that day,and in the formal order filed on june,the court ordered toni estopped from asserting the sum of or any sum other than of child support pursuant to the recommended order of settlement officer james cox dated august,which with such recommended order is deemed to be enforceable as if formally entered.toni motion to modify support dated october is set for a long cause hearing bruce was ordered to pay his share of the medical and day care expenses per the original court order.this appeal ensued.
issues on appeal 
toni contends the trial court abused its discretion in estopping her from holding bruce to the original order of per month.bruce contends that the april,order is not appealable because it did not dispose of the entire child support arrears issue but set a trial date for determining the amount of day care and medical expenses owed for the time preceding the recommendation,from february,to august.bruce asserts that because these issues were not covered by the april order,that order was not final and appealable therefore,toni appeal is premature and should be dismissed.
appealability 
bruce asserts the decision on his pretrial motion in limine during the trial of the child support arrears issue is not a final order because the stamped entry on the minutes for april,and paragraph of the formal order filed on june,both indicate that the remainder of the proceeding was set for long cause hearing on june,which eventually was continued until october.the record of the long cause hearing which the parties agree occurred in october is not before the court on this appeal,so it is as a practical matter impossible to fully evaluate the prejudice to toni if any caused by the order granting the motion in limine.
toni states that her motion was a motion made after a final judgment of dissolution,and the order denying it is an order made after final judgment.thus,the order is directly appealable as a matter of law.code of civil procedure,subd.b in r e marriage of schroeder d.p orders relating to child support arrears are directly appealable.in r e marriage of tibbett d at.
an appeal,other than in a limited civil case,may be taken from any of the following from an order made appealable by the provisions of the probate code or the family code.code civ,subd.a.family code section allows an appeal to be taken from an order or judgment under this division as in other civil actions.this division refers to division in which section appears.division relates to support,including child support.toni amended notice of appeal states she appeals from the whole and every portion of the judgment made and entered in the action on april,which is adverse to toni and in favor of bruce the june,order on the april,trial finally determined that the cox recommendation applied from through the present orders relating to child support arrears are appealable.in re marriage of tibbett,supra,d at.
effect of cox recommendation 
bruce and the district attorney relied on cox recommendation as if it was an order.bruce immediately began paying the reduced amount,and the district attorney entered the reduction in the family support computer spradlin claimed she orally objected to smith about bruce payment of the reduced amount,but stated she did not put the matter on the court calendar for resolution because i t was an order.the trial court comments focused on toni acceptance of the lesser payments apparently without objection until she filed her support modification motion on september,months after the august recommendation,and bruce reliance on that.
the original a month child support order was filed on december.an order for child support continues in effect until the order is terminated by the court or terminates by operation of law,subd.a.termination by operation of law occurs when the child reaches the age of majority,a predetermined contingency happens,or the child support obligation is discharged in bankruptcy but see in re marriage of cordero th,d a.a court may modify or terminate a support order as the court determines to be necessary,subd.a following the procedures described in sections to.a party must show changed circumstances to justify a modification.et the statutory procedures for modification of child support require a party to introduce admissible evidence of changed circumstances as a necessary predicate for modification.see,in re marriage of popenhager d.child support modification requires changed circumstances in re marriage of mulhern d.abuse of discretion to base spousal support modification order on evidence that failed to establish changed circumstances.where child support orders are concerned,contested factual issues require an evidentiary hearing.citation.the procedures also require judicial findings when requested.and citation.as the above requirements suggest,the statutes contemplate that the determinations necessary to support a child support modification will be made by a judge,not simply left in the hands of parties equipped with a computer program.thus,it would constitute an abuse of discretion for the trial court simply to substitute the use of a computer program for the required consideration and appropriate weighing of the statutory factors.citations.in re marriage of cheriton th,d.
we have found no section in the family code that allows a recommendation of a family court settlement officer to terminate or modify a duly entered support order of the family court.california rules of court,rule,allows parties to stipulate that a case may be tried by a temporary judge.the parties in this case did so.nevertheless,settlement officer cox did not issue an order at the end of the settlement conference.he filed a copy of his recommendation in the court file so that upon a return i can be up to speed on the case.he testified that from the overall method that it written here,the fact that i x out my signature line down below and signed up above without an order indicates to me that this was an advisory remark,or an advisory whole discussion only.there is no order on this page.he also testified that he could not remember seeing either toni or bruce before but he might have advised one or both of them to follow the recommendation n ot as an order,but as a solution.
consequently,the december,support order remained in operation until april,at the earliest when the court ordered the recommendation enforceable.but see further discussion,infra.if bruce wanted cox recommendation to have the force and effect of an order in august,he should have complied with the procedure described on the form to obtain an order.spradlin either would have objected,and the matter could have been set for hearing and resolved or she would have consented,in which case there would be no problem.
next,should we uphold the trial court ruling estopping toni from seeking child support arrears based on a month because she did not formally object to bruce unilateral reduction of support to per month in the last part,we absolved toni of blame for bruce failure to obtain a modification order based on the recommendation.bruce raises the same argument in support of his claim of estoppel.i f toni had indicated her disagreement with cox per month indicated order,bruce could have initiated proceedings to bring the question before the court for a formal order based upon cox recommendation.whether,after a formal contested hearing,the court would have adopted cox recommended per month amount can never be known for certain,but in support of the judgment,the trial court impliedly found that such a formal order would have been made if bruce had not been lulled into not proceeding to a formal hearing by toni silence and acquiescence.this argument is unpersuasive in this context also.
bruce also claims that toni acceptance of per month is e stoppel by conduct he claims toni and her counsel intentionally and deliberately led him and the district attorney to believe that a particular thing was true and to act upon such belief.bruce claims toni induced him to believe that she would not claim child support above per month for that period of time between august of and the conclusion of the child evaluation and adjudication process.
whenever a party has,by his own statement or conduct,intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief,he is not,in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct,permitted to contradict it.the party seeking to establish an estoppel must show by clear and convincing evidence in re marriage of fell th,d that the party to be estopped knew the facts the other party was ignorant of the true facts the party intended his conduct would be acted upon,or acted in a manner that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it so intended and the other party relied upon the conduct to his injury.where one of the elements is missing,there can be no estoppel.citations.the doctrine acts defensively only.it operates to prevent one from taking unfair advantage of another but not to give an unfair advantage to one seeking to invoke the doctrine.citation.in re marriage of thompson th,d.
bruce was not lulled into not proceeding to a formal hearing by toni silence and acquiescence,nor was her acceptance of per month estoppel by conduct.both parties knew that the august,recommendation was not an order and that toni did not agree to the reduction.spradlin stated without contradiction by smith at the april,hearing that she telephonically notified smith of her objection to the order but that she was waiting for resolution of the custody issues to pursue the support matter.she stated she did not write nor object to the recommendation because w e did have to object to it,it was an order.bruce admits in his brief on appeal that e veryone knew that the resolution of the underlying issue would quite likely change the time share component of the guideline calculation,requiring a prospective some time within the next few or several months.since everyone knew that the custody issues would affect the support issues,since litigation on the custody issues was proceeding with all the speed the court system could muster,and since the original support order had not been modified,toni did not lull bruce into not proceeding to a formal hearing by her silence and acquiescence.
at the april,trial,the court inquired whether estoppel applies since there been a period of time in which the was accepted without controversy as stated above,spradlin responded that the matter was not without controversy.there were several times when it was mentioned.it was not brought to the forefront because the modification motion was still pending.smith did not dispute this version of the events.
furthermore,both parties had initiated proceedings for modification of support in february both of which were sent to cox,and neither party pushed those
