factual and procedural background 
olivia lived with her mother lenore and two older sisters.otis had little contact with olivia but paid child support for her.in june olivia telephoned otis complaining she had been injured when lenore beat her with a belt.otis took olivia to the hospital where it was determined her finger was broken.olivia became a dependent of the juvenile court under section,subdivision a based on findings lenore subjected her to excessive discipline and olivia had suffered,or was at substantial risk of suffering,serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally.the court placed olivia with her adult sister and ordered reunification services for the parents,including unsupervised visits for otis.
otis reported a history of alcoholism but said he had been sober for several years.his criminal history included a felony conviction for driving under the influence and a arrest for spousal abuse involving lenore.otis was years old and lived with his mother,two brothers and sister.although otis wanted olivia placed with him,he acknowledged he did not have appropriate housing for her.
on september,the court held a special hearing to order otis into sarms.otis indicated he was prepared to accept the order.the court ordered otis to participate in sarms and explained its various requirements,including not using or possessing any alcohol or illegal drugs,testing on demand,attending all required counseling and treatment,following the rules of the program and cooperating with sarms staff and the social worker.the court admonished otis that failing to comply with these requirements could result in a finding of contempt of court for disobeying a court order,which meant he could be placed into custody,terminated from sarms or asked to go to dependency drug court see super.san diego,local rules,div.vi,rule.otis said he understood the order,including the consequence that a missed drug or alcohol test would be considered a failed test.he received a copy of the sarms client guidelines and agreement,and acknowledged receiving the sarms agreement as to his recovery services plan.the court set sarms review hearings for october and november.
when otis did not appear for the october hearing,a bench warrant was issued and withheld until the november hearing.otis appeared on november and requested a hearing on the order to show cause osc re contempt.the contempt declarations alleged that from september to october,otis did not submit proof of attendance at five meetings a week,make himself available for drug and alcohol screening or maintain weekly contact with his sarms recovery specialist.
at the osc hearing in november,otis testified he believed the sarms requirements were excessive and he did not have time to attend five meetings a week.according to an offer of proof by sarms recovery specialist anthony tucker,otis had been sober for quite some time,and consequently he was not required to attend drug and alcohol treatment classes but only to test and attend meetings.however,otis had not complied with those requirements.counsel for otis requested dismissal of the contempt charge based on otis inability to comply with the sarms requirements because of his work schedule.alternatively,counsel suggested the court admonish otis and modify his case plan to include less stringent requirements.
the court found the sarms order was valid,otis had the ability to comply with the order and he willfully disobeyed it.the court found otis guilty of four counts of contempt,sentenced him to three days in custody but stayed the sentence on the condition otis have no further noncompliant events.however,the court commented it was a little troubled by the sarms requirements because although otis was a recovering alcoholic,he had been sober for a substantial amount of time.the court modified the sarms order by requiring otis attend two,rather than five,meetings a week,submit to drug and alcohol screening and maintain contact with the recovery specialist.otis agreed to comply with the court modified order.
in a report prepared for the review hearing set for february,the social worker noted otis had expressed his reluctance in october to participate in services because the sarms requirements were too stringent.the social worker told otis to request a by sarms.otis was given an amended recovery services plan and had since been in compliance.
in january lenore tested positive for methamphetamine.at the hearing,the court ordered an evaluation of the home of relatives in georgia for olivia placement after olivia sister told the social worker she would be unable to continue caring for her.the court commended otis for complying with sarms,found he made substantive progress with his case plan and extended reunification services to the date.
in april the court set an osc re contempt hearing based on a sarms declaration that between march and march,otis had three unexcused absences from meetings failed to make himself available for drug and alcohol screening and failed to maintain weekly contact with his recovery specialist.at the hearing on april,otis unsuccessfully requested a continuance to retain new counsel.according to the stipulated testimony of recovery specialist tucker,otis was out of compliance with sarms from september to november.otis returned to sarms on november,agreed to participate in the program and complied with the requirements until february.since february,otis had not contacted tucker and was considered missing in action from the program.
otis testified he had not complied with the court sarms order since march.he understood there would be consequences for failing to comply.however,otis claimed the urine collection procedure was degrading,he did not need the program and he told his attorney he did not want to participate.counsel for otis requested the court dismiss the contempt charge and terminate otis from sarms.
the court took judicial notice of its previous findings and orders sentencing otis to three days in custody and staying the sentence.the court found otis guilty of contempt because the sarms order was valid and otis had the ability to comply with the order but willfully disobeyed it.the court imposed the previously stayed sentence of three days in custody and sentenced otis to an additional two days,to begin on april and end on april.
discussion 
otis contends the court had no authority to order incarceration based on his failure to comply with a reunification order not reasonably related to the problems that led to olivia dependency.he asserts the initial order for sarms,and the order at the hearing to continue sarms,were improper because he was a nonoffending parent who had no current problem with alcohol and who posed no risk to olivia the sarms requirements were burdensome,invasive and not reasonably related to the facts and the threat of contempt was unreasonable and prohibited by a statutory scheme that does not permit parents to be prosecuted in the juvenile court.
