the district court denied the petition of ismail ozgur yaman yaman for return of his two daughters,now,and,now,to turkey,pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,reprinted in,convention.
the two children have lived with their mother since,having lived with their mother and their father before that.the mother and two children have lived in the united states since april,and in new hampshire since may.there is no question that the habitual residence of the children was turkey,that yaman had been given custody of the children by the turkish courts,that their american mother,linda margherita yaman,linda margherita polizzi polizzi wrongfully removed the children in and then hid them,and that this prevented yaman from locating them and filing his petition for return until he recently found them.
the mother,polizzi,argued against return,asserting substantively different defenses under article of the convention,that the children were now settled in the united states and so could not be returned and under article,that the father had sexually abused his elder daughter a claim rejected by the turkish courts,and so return would pose a grave risk to the children.yaman has appealed,and we have expedited the appeal,as required by the convention.id.
in a carefully reasoned analysis,the district judge concluded that neither equitable tolling nor equitable estoppel applied to bar the mother from asserting the now settled defense and concluded the children were now settled.it held that it had no authority under article,then,to order the return of the children under the convention.in an alternate holding,it concluded that if it did have authority nonetheless to order return,it would not order return,based on the facts.
the district court also rejected the claims of sexual abuse under article.both parents appeal from those portions of the findings adverse to them.
as to the rejection of the article defense raised by the mother cross appeal,we hold that the district court committed no error of law and that its conclusions are well supported by the evidence.we reject the.
the article issues are serious and present issues of first impression for us.article of the convention provides that w here a child has been wrongfully removed from one contracting state to another or wrongfully retained in a contracting state and,at the date of the commencement of judicial proceedings,a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention,the child shall be return ed forthwith.convention.the convention further provides that even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year,the court shall also order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.id.
the questions presented by the father appeal are as follows 
whether equitable tolling applies to the period that triggers the availability of the now settled defense under article.
whether,as a matter of law,the conclusion that the child is now settled under article precludes a court from ordering return.
we hold that the convention does not allow a federal district court to toll equitably the period that must elapse before a parent can assert the now settled defense.in so doing,we join the second circuit,see lozano alvarez,cir,cert.granted in part,d,and differ from the ninth and eleventh circuits,see duarte bardales,cir furnes reeves,cir.the supreme court has granted certiorari as to this first question.lozano alvarez,d.
we also hold that the convention does not prevent the district court from ordering the return of now settled children,and the court erred in holding otherwise.the court,at that point,should analyze the return question under principles of equity consistent with the convention purposes,an analysis it undertook in its alternative holding.we review the alternative holding under an abuse of discretion standard,and find none.
factual background 
yaman and polizzi met in when yaman,a native and citizen of turkey,was a graduate student at wayne state university in detroit,michigan.the two were married in august in turkey,and then returned to the united states.
their first child,was born in the united states on march.shortly thereafter,yaman received a teaching appointment at the middle east technical university in turkey.the family moved to turkey.both polizzi and the child obtained dual united citizenship.the couple second child,was born in turkey on august,and is also a citizen of the united states and turkey.
yaman and polizzi began to have marital difficulties sometime in.in december,yaman and polizzi separated.yaman moved out of the family home the two children remained with polizzi.
in february,yaman filed for divorce in turkish family court polizzi filed in march.the children continued to live with the mother during the course of the divorce proceedings.on march,the family court issued an order granting yaman sole custody of the two children.polizzi appealed to the turkish supreme court of appeals.during the pendency of that appeal,the children continued to stay with the mother.
on april,the turkish supreme court of appeals upheld the decision of the family court awarding sole custody of the two children to yaman.polizzi appealed that decision as well.the supreme court of appeals issued a second decision affirming the judgment of the family court on july.on august,the family court entered its final ruling,finalizing the order awarding yaman sole custody,consistent with the decision of the supreme court of appeals.
without notice to the father or the court,polizzi left turkey with the children by boat in august.for help in escaping turkey,polizzi purchased the services of a child specialist.polizzi and the children first travelled to athens,greece polizzi continued to travel with the two children through several european countries before arriving in andorra.as polizzi was aware,andorra was and is not a signatory to the convention.polizzi remained in andorra with the two children from october to april.at no point did the mother inform the father of her or the children whereabouts.
on may,polizzi petitioned the united states department of state to issue the two children passports,again seeking a waiver of the consent requirement.polizzi refused to disclose her location to state department officials.the state department initially denied polizzi petition.it ultimately issued the children,direct return passports to the united states,although it cautioned that it does not and can not condone polizzi violation of the turkish custody order.
polizzi and the two children arrived in the united states in april.polizzi drove the children first to michigan,and then to missouri,before settling in new hampshire in may.
around august,yaman asked a friend to look for the children at polizzi mother home in michigan.in january,yaman filed an application under the convention with the central authority of turkey,saying he believed the two children to be residing with polizzi parents in michigan.in february,the central authority contacted the united states department of state.in january,the state department office of children issues deactivated yaman application,believing that the children were in europe,not the united states.in april,the state department sent yaman a letter informing him that the children had been issued passports for direct return to the united states.yaman forwarded that letter to the central authority of turkey.on may,the central authority requested that the office of children issues reactivate yaman application.after various attempts,the state department finally located the mother and children in new hampshire on december.the state department cautioned yaman against filing a petition with a new hampshire court before polizzi specific address could be confirmed,fearing that polizzi might flee.as of june,polizzi new hampshire address was still unconfirmed.yaman decided to move forward with the hague petition for return despite the lack of confirmation.
proceedings before the district court 
on june,yaman filed a petition in the district court for the district of new hampshire pursuant to article of the convention and the international child abduction remedies act,et icara,requesting an order to return the two children to turkey.yaman also requested provisional remedies to ensure that both polizzi and the two children remained in new hampshire throughout the course of the proceedings.on june,the district court ordered provisional remedies and appointed a guardian ad litem to issue a report on the two children behalf.
one month before the court scheduled evidentiary hearing,yaman filed a motion to preclude polizzi from asserting the affirmative now settled defense under article of the convention.yaman argued that polizzi should not be permitted to avail herself of t hat defense where she has,for years,actively and egregiously attempted to evade legal proceedings.the district court denied the motion.yaman yaman,d.in an order dated january,the district court explained that neither the text nor the drafting history of the convention supported the argument that article period was subject to equitable tolling.id.at.moreover,the district court observed,the executive branch had taken the position that equitable tolling does not apply.id.at.conceding that the courts of appeals were divided on the issue,the district court found the arguments in favor of the applicability of equitable tolling unpersua sive.id.at.last,the district court noted that the judicial decisions of other signatory nations supported the proposition that article now settled defense does not equitably toll.id.at.
on january,the district court commenced a bench trial,which included evening hearings.the district court heard testimony concerning,inter alia,the removal of the children from turkey,as well as the mother extensive efforts to conceal their location thereafter.most of these allegations went uncontested.yaman also testified as to his continuous attempts to locate the two children after they had been removed.
the court heard testimony from the mother about how settled the children were in the community,their friendships,their schooling,and her concealment of their location,among other things.the mother also gave testimony concerning her allegations of sexual abuse of the older daughter.polizzi testified that,during a january visit to her family in the united states,her grandmother,then in her early,thought she observed yaman massaging clitoris while changing her diaper.three months later,polizzi grandmother shared this with polizzi mother,who then relayed the incident to polizzi.polizzi mother insisted that polizzi leave turkey and return with the children to the united states.at that point,polizzi began to observe what she regarded as suspicious behavior by yaman.she remarked that yaman would sleep in a separate room with when would wake crying in the night.she claimed to have observed yaman on numerous occasions with an erection when holding.she alleged that she asked during a diaper change whether yaman had touched her,to which said yes.and she asserted that once said she did not want to go to her father because he had made a raspberry on her,made a red mark by blowing,gesturing at her genital area.polizzi testified she had evaluated by three different mental health experts in turkey,one in greece,and a pediatrician in the united states.
the court also heard testimony from the guardian ad litem for the children,who testified that his interviews with their teachers showed no red flags,and that other witnesses confirmed that the children were assimilating well.the guardian ad litem,after a thoughtful explanation,concluded the children were unable to provide a mature judgment about where they should live.the court also considered the guardian ad litem formal report and those of experts concerning each of the children.the court heard testimony from experts for the respondent and the petitioner,who did not interview the children the guardian ad litem had advised against it but had reviewed documents including reports prepared by experts who had the respondent psychiatric expert testified that the children were settled in the way that one would use the word in a common sense.he also said he could not form an opinion that the children were or were not sexually abused.similarly,the respondent pediatric expert expressed a concern the children had been abused,but was unable to conclude with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that they had.and likewise the petitioner expert formed an opinion that he could not conclude to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that was abused.he was also unable to conclude that had not been sexually abused.
the father also testified consistently with all of the assertions in his petition.he denied any sexual and described the turkish court orders and his search for his missing daughters,including use of the turkish and united states central authorities.yaman present wife,the mother of his son,also testified.yaman put on no evidence as to the children ability to resettle in turkey.
the district court denied yaman petition in an oral order from the bench after trial.yaman had made out his prima facie case for return,with polizzi conceding both that she had removed the children in violation of yaman custody rights and that the children were habitually resident in turkey immediately before they were removed.see convention.the district court also found that polizzi had concealed the children after removal,and that yaman had been diligent in his efforts to assert his rights under the convention the district court nevertheless denied the petition for return.
the district court rejected polizzi argument that,pursuant to article of the convention,return should be refused because it would pose a grave risk of harm to the children.as to the specific incidents alleged,the district court held that it had received no admissible evidence regarding polizzi grandmother alleged observation moreover,the district court found,there was substantial reason to doubt the accuracy of the grandmother report as to the other incidents alleged,the district court found that most admitted of benign explanations.for instance,a father sleeping with a crying child was not unusual behavior the district court found more disconcerting polizzi accusations concerning yaman having multiple erections when holding his daughter.but,on that issue,the district court reasoned that the one incident conceded by yaman could be explained without appeal to sexual arousal,morning erection,while polizzi further accusations were not credible.
as to the expert reports and testimony,the district court observed that,with one un persuasive exception none of the at least sixteen experts who evaluated the children or the record was able to conclude that past abuse was more likely than not.this included the various turkish experts who evaluated the children closer in time to the alleged incidents.while numerous experts had expressed concern,the district court noted that there is always concern when a parent is accused of sexual abuse.the district court concluded that,in its best judgment,polizzi actions were ones of a concerned but misguided mother.the district court noted that polizzi was acting under tremendous pressure from her mother 
the district court then found that the children were now settled,applying the totality of the circumstances test articulated by the ninth circuit in duarte,at.the district court assigned particular weight to the guardian ad litem testimony and report,describing it as the best evidence on this point.
having found that the children were now settled,the district court went on to hold that,in light of this finding,it lacked discretion to order the children return under the language of article.the district court reasoned that the text of article,when contrasted with the text of articles and,indicated that the drafters of the convention intended that courts be required to refuse the return of a now settled child.as to article of the convention,which clarifies that the convention various provisions do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time,convention,the district court reasoned that,although article makes quite clear that the convention does not in any way limit a court power to order return,a federal district court,unlike a state court,does not enjoy a general return power.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied heavily upon the drafting history of the convention,which,it thought,indicated that its drafters envisioned article discretion as extending only so far as a court is able to entertain a decision on the merits.because a federal district court is sharply limited in its ability to consider the merits of a custody claim,the district court inferred that it lacked the general authority to remove to which article refers.
recognizing the novelty of its sua sponte court distinction,the court went on to hold in the alternative that,even if it did have authority to order the return of a child now settled,it would not exercise that authority here.the district court articulated various considerations in favor of return,including the interest in a child being reunited with the parent from whom she w as wrongfully removed,the interest in effectively punish ing polizzi,and the interest in deter ring future clever abductors.on the other hand,the district court observed,the two children were of such ages that attachments in a community we re particularly important,remarking t he settlement issue would not be nearly so big in my mind if they were or or if they were three and five.moreover,the district court noted,although polizzi had made efforts to conceal the children location,it s aw very little evidence that she did anything that would be damaging to the children psyche.this was consistent with the district court more general observation that polizzi had acted under a mistaken but belief regarding the safety of the children.lastly,the district court stated that punishing the mother would have,at best,a very limited deterrent effect the district court expressed discomfort with rewarding the party more at fault here,remarking that i f it were just about which of these people should be rewarded or punished,if the children were chattel,it would award the children to yaman.but,the district court concluded,children are chattel and the convention does not treat them as such.
on february,yaman filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court denial of his petition.and,on may,yaman filed in a new hampshire state court a petition for expedited enforcement of the turkish custody order,pursuant to the new hampshire uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act.ann.a.

on,polizzi contends that the district court erred in denying her article grave risk defense.under article,a judicial authority is not bound to order return of a child where there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.convention.at trial,polizzi grave risk argument was based entirely on claims of past abuse.polizzi argues that the district court committed legal error by improperly requiring proof of past abuse to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.she argues also that the district court committed clear error when it found that yaman had not abused 
reasonable degree of medical certainty 
polizzi argues first that the district court improperly required proof of abuse to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.not so.as the district court correctly observed,a party opposing return based on article grave risk exception bears the burden of establishing that exception by clear and convincing evidence.e a danaipour i,at.the district court then held correctly that subsidiary facts here,past abuse must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence,see danaipour mclarey,cir danaipour ii,and that polizzi had not shown past abuse to be more likely than not.the court concluded that polizzi had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that return to turkey would pose a grave risk.
the district court did ask numerous expert witnesses whether they were able to conclude with a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether past abuse had occurred.such questioning of expert witnesses is not uncommon,even if not required,in the context of a grave risk inquiry.see danaipour ii,at noting that expert witness testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that past sexual abuse had occurred.moreover,the district court did not purport to base its conclusion just on the absence of expert testimony rising to that level of certainty.instead,it based this conclusion on its judgment that,having considered all available evidence,it was more likely than not that yaman did not at any time sexually abuse his children.
evidence of past abuse 
polizzi argues in addition that the district court committed clear error when it found that yaman had never abused his children.more specifically,polizzi accuses the district court of deploying an improper divide and conquer strategy,considering each abuse allegation in isolation rather than evaluating the evidence as a whole.see in re adan,cir.
the district court deployed no such strategy.as the district court observed,a number of the allegations against yaman involved conduct not at all out of the ordinary,sleeping with his crying daughter at night,responding yes when asked during a diaper change if her father had touched her pee pee.as to polizzi more troubling allegations,yaman multiple erections while holding,the district court specifically determined that yaman denials were credible and that polizzi accusations were not.the district court observed moreover that polizzi was under continuous pressure from her mother to leave her abusive husband and to return with the children to the united states.last,the district court noted that polizzi engaged in conduct that,although perhaps unwittingly,intimated to that she was being abused.taking all of these observations together,the district court found it more likely than not that polizzi was acting under a but misguided belief that her children had been sexually abused.
far from divid ing and conquer ing,the district court sensitively considered all the evidence and arrived at a comprehensive explanation it deemed more plausible than the one suggested by polizzi.the district court finding that yaman never abused his children finds ample support in the record.as such,it is not to be disturbed by this court on clear error review.see in re mcmullen,cir f indings of fact are not to be disturbed under clear error review if supportable on any reasonable view of the record quoting in re carp,cir.
yaman makes three arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court erred in considering whether his children were now settled,reasoning that the period that triggers the availability of article now settled defense is subject to equitable tolling.second,he argues that the district court erred in holding that it lacked discretion to order the return of a child now settled.third,he argues that the district court abused its discretion when it determined,in the alternative,that it would not order the return of the now settled children even if it had discretion to do so.
equitable tolling 
yaman argues first that the period that triggers the availability of article now settled defense is subject to equitable tolling that interpretation finds no support in the text of the convention.nor does it gain support from any extratextual source of evidence.
the text of article does not address equitable tolling explicitly.it does,however,suggest that equitable tolling does not apply.we repeat the relevant part of article 
where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of article and,at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the contracting state where the child is,a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention,the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.
the judicial or administrative authority,even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the proceeding paragraph,shall also order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.
convention.under the terms of article,return of a child wrongfully removed is thus mandatory unless at least one year elapsed between the date of the wrongful removal or retention and the date on which proceedings commenced,and the child is shown to be now settled in its new environment.there is no dispute here that one year has elapsed.
article notably does not use a trigger such as the date the petitioning parent discovered or could have reasonably discovered the child location.that decision evidences on the part of the drafters of the convention a desire to have a clear trigger point for assertion of the defense the date of wrongful removal or the date in retention cases of wrongful retention.see lozano,at it would have been a simple matter,if the state parties to the convention wished to take account of the possibility that an abducting parent might make it difficult for the petitioning parent to discover the child whereabouts,to run the period from the date that the petitioning parent learned or,could reasonably have learned of the child whereabouts.but the drafters did not adopt such language.alteration in original.
from the text,we think it clear article period does not operate as a statute of limitations.as the second circuit observed in lozano 
unlike a statute of limitations prohibiting a parent from filing a return petition after a year has expired,the settled defense merely permits courts to consider the interests of a child who has been in a new environment for more than a year before ordering that child to be returned to her country of habitual residency.
the courts which have viewed this language as a statute of limitations,as we discuss later,have been concerned that to do otherwise would be inconsistent with the convention emphasis on prompt return.we find no textual support for that view and think the concern may be dealt with otherwise.even if a child is found now settled,an authority retains discretion to weigh against that finding of settledness considerations such as concealment before deciding whether to order return.article thus does provide a mechanism to prevent misconduct from being rewarded without resort to equitable tolling.see id.t he way the provision functions renders this sort of equitable relief unnecessary.
drafting history 
article drafting history further supports the conclusion that the period is not subject to equitable tolling.
the history shows equitable tolling was explicitly discussed as a limitation on asserting the now settled defense,and that it was rejected.the earlier preliminary draft convention,as set forth by the official reporter,provided for equitable tolling explicitly,but was not adopted.see elisa pérez vera,report of the special commission,in conférence de la haye de droit international privé,actes et documents de la quatorzième session,enlèvement,actes et documents.as a general rule,the preliminary draft convention required return if less than six months elapsed between removal and the commencement of proceedings.preliminary draft convention adopted by the special commission,in actes et documents.that general rule was subject,however,to the following qualification 
w here the residence of the child was unknown,the period of six months referred to in the previous paragraphs shall run from the date of the discovery of the child,subject to the proviso that the total period shall not exceed one year from the date of the breach.
this approach in the preliminary draft was ultimately rejected in favor of the approach contained in article.the approach had two benefits in the drafters eyes first,it eliminated the considerable difficulty of determining the date the child location was or could have reasonably been discovered.see official report,in actes et documents,official report.second,it established a minimum time period before an authority could consider whether a child was now settled.see weiner,uprooting children in the name of equity,fordham int l.t he difficulties encountered in any attempt to state this test of integration of the child as an objective rule resulted in a being fixed which,although perhaps arbitrary,nevertheless proved to be the least bad answer to the concerns which were voiced in this regard.elisa pérez vera,explanatory report,in actes et documents,explanatory report.
executive branch interpretation 
the executive branch has interpreted the convention as we do in at least two settings.first,in the solicitor general brief in lozano,the united states reasoned that article period does not function as a statute of limitations,and it is therefore not subject to equitable tolling.br.for united states as amicus curiae,lozano alvarez,may,wl,at cert.pet.lozano amicus br.the united states observed that article text and drafting history lend further support to that conclusion.id.at.finally,the united states noted that article already provides a mechanism for taking into account considerations such as concealment,namely the discretion it reserves to an authority to order the return of a child even if settledness is shown.id.at second,although yaman says the executive branch interpretation has not been consistent,that is not so.see skidmore swift.observing that the weight of the executive branch position in a particular case depends in part upon its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.even before the lozano amicus brief,the executive branch had taken a consistent position.
in a legal analysis of the convention for the senate committee on foreign relations,hague international child abduction convention text and legal analysis.legal analysis,the department of state adopted what is an admittedly somewhat different but not inconsistent tone,remarking that it is highly questionable whether a parent who conceals her child should be permitted to benefit from such conduct absent strong countervailing considerations.id.at.that remark,however,is easy to reconcile with the current position so long as one concedes,as the united states does,that article reserves for an authority the discretion to weigh such considerations against a finding of settledness when deciding whether to order return.
more difficult to reconcile is a united states central authority usca answer to a questionnaire circulated to signatories by the permanent bureau of the hague conference on the practical operation of the convention.see hague convention on private international law,collated responses to the questionnaire concerning the practical operation of the hague convention of october on the civil aspects of international child abduction,prelim.doc,available at.abd usca responses.given an invitation to comment on any other matters which they may wish to raise concerning the practical operation of the convention,the usca responded 
the usca supports the concept of equitable tolling of the filing deadline in order to prevent creating an incentive for a taking parent to conceal the whereabouts of a child from the other parent in order to prevent the timely filing of a hague petition.
in contrast to the lozano amicus briefs,the usca response contains no analysis of the convention text or drafting history.see skidmore,at observing that the weight of an executive branch position depends also on the thoroughness evident in its consideration and the validity of its reasoning.moreover,the usca statement that it supports the concept of equitable tolling is more a statement of policy preference than of legal analysis.yaman,d at see also official report at noting that the united states voted against the period.
sister signatories 
courts of other signatory nations have most commonly held that equitable tolling does not apply to the period that triggers the availability of the now settled defense.in cannon cannon,ewca civ,eng,the court of appeal for england and wales rejected equitable tolling as too crude.id.courts in canada,hong kong,and new zealand have also held that the period that triggers the availability of the now settled defense is not subject to equitable tolling.see kubera kubera,bcca,hkec secretary for justice,nzflr.
sister circuits 
in its carefully reasoned opinion in lozano,as described,the second circuit held that article period is not subject to equitable tolling.at.by contrast,in furnes reeves,cir,the eleventh circuit considered the period to be a statute of limitations.in duarte bardales,cir,the ninth circuit,too,considered the period as a statute of limitations.in addition,the ninth circuit appealed to the overarching intention of the child abduction,reasoning that permitting a parent to benefit from concealment would not only encourage child abductions,but also encourage hiding the child from the parent seeking return.id.to this argument,there are two responses.first,as the second circuit observed in lozano,article also has the apparent purpose of protecting a child interest in remaining in a place she is settled,parental misconduct aside,at as such,appeal to intention s or purpose s is not enough to settle the question of whether equitable tolling applies,see easterbrook,statutes domains,chi,observing that statutes pursue numerous goals simultaneously.second,the ninth circuit reasoning does not account for the fact that article already provides a mechanism for deterring misconduct in the form of the authority it reserves to a court to order the return of a child found now settled.
we join the second circuit views.
authority to order return of a now settled child 
the evidence supports the district court conclusion that the children are now settled,and yaman does not seriously contest that holding on appeal.yaman argues that the district court erred when it concluded that it lacked authority to order the return of a child found to be now settled.we agree.the district court reasoned that,even if the convention reserves such discretion to a state court,a federal district court is prohibited from ordering the return of a now settled child.this conclusion,in our view,is not supported by the convention text or history,and is contrary to the view of the executive branch and the views of the other circuits.see blondin dubois,cir recognizing discretionary authority to return now settled child see also asvesta petroutsas,cir recognizing discretionary authority to return child even if one of convention affirmative defenses is established miller miller,cir same friedrich friedrich,cir same feder evans feder,cir same.
under article,a judicial or administrative authority shall order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.convention,emphasis added.to say that an authority shall order return unless a child is now settled is not to say that an authority is prohibited from ordering the child returned if settledness is found.
we understand the district court to have concluded that it lacked discretion to order the return of a now settled child for two reasons.firstly,the district court reasoned that article language contrasted with the language of articles and.articles and contain express reservations of discretion.article contains no such express reservation.reasoning that the drafters of the convention had demonstrated the capacity to draft expressly to permit discretion,the court inferred from article lack of such an express reservation that no reservation of discretion was intended.secondly,the court was concerned about the particular division of jurisdiction between state and federal authorities in the united states,unlike many foreign jurisdictions.given the much greater role of the state courts in child custody and welfare matters,it felt this result much better fit the limits on federal jurisdiction 
as we read them,articles and contain express reservations of discretion to refuse to order return so as to qualify the express requirements to order return contained elsewhere in the convention.by contrast,because the convention contains no express requirement to refuse to order the return of a child now settled,there is no need to expressly reserve discretion so as to qualify any such requirement.
as the second circuit concluded in blondin,article allows but does not,of course,require a judicial or administrative authority to refuse to order the repatriation of a child just on the basis of settledness.at.in reaching that conclusion,the second circuit treated the language of article as plainly permissive.see also lozano,at noting that t his interpretation of article is further bolstered by article.
article,by contrast,states that notwithstanding the return provisions of article mandating return in certain circumstances,the court is not bound to order the return of a child if an article defense is established or if the court finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.convention.
it is consistent with the convention overall structure that article leaves it within a court discretion whether to order the return of a now settled child.as the second circuit explained in lozano,the default presumption under the convention is that a child shall be returned to the state from which she originally was wrongfully removed.at emphasis in original.the convention then goes on to specify various circumstances in which it is within a court discretion to refuse to order return.under article,for example,a court is not bound to order the return of the child if there is a grave risk that return would expose the child to harm.convention,emphasis added.similarly,under that same article,a court may also refuse to order the return of the child if the child objects and is of a sufficient degree of maturity.id.emphasis added.and likewise,under article,return may be refused if return would conflict with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.id.emphasis added.in each instance,it is within a court discretion to refuse to order return if particular circumstances are shown.at no point,however,is a court bound to so refuse.
in interpreting article within the context of the grant of authority to federal courts in icara,we presume that congress was aware of federal courts broad equitable powers and,in the absence of any a clear statement to the contrary,that congress intended those powers to be available in hague convention cases.see cia.petrolera caribe,arco caribbean,cir establishing a default presumption that congress is aware of federal courts inherent equity powers and does not intend to limit those powers.to be sure,prior to enactment of the implementing statute,federal courts had no such authority under the convention as to order international return of abducted children.but when congress assigned federal courts responsibility for resolving abduction cases,we assume that congress intended them to bring their full toolkit to the assignment.there is no language in the implementing statute suggesting otherwise.indeed,congress exhibited an intention not to limit available remedies by making clear that the convention does not supplant remedies under other laws.h.
read against this backdrop of federal courts broad equitable powers and the other articles of the convention,article in its own terms confers upon a federal district court the authority to order the return of a now settled child.we add that the language of article of the convention reinforces our reading.according to article,t he provisions of this chapter do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.convention,emphasis added.
the district court reasoned that,unlike a state court,a federal court does not enjoy the power to which article refers.the district court distinction is not based in the convention text,which throughout refers generically to authorit ies.it also has no basis in the text of icara,which states that t he courts of the states and the united states district courts shall have concurrent original jurisdiction of actions arising under the convention.a.the district court relied primarily on the drafting history of article.
we have considered whether principles of federalism or comparative competence would have led congress to make state law the sole avenue for the return of settled children.under the district court view of the matter,a parent seeking the return of a settled child must go to state court or convince a federal court to exercise pendent jurisdiction in order to enforce a return based on a foreign custody determination.this would be consistent with the the virtually exclusive primacy of the states in the regulation of domestic relations.united states windsor,d alteration in original quoting ankenbrandt richards,d blackmun,concurring in the judgment.as the supreme court has recognized,the federal government,through our history,has deferred to policy decisions with respect to domestic relations.id.
nevertheless,we are doubtful that congress intended for this traditional separation of authority to apply in cases of international child abduction,which are matters not just of family law but also of international relations.to the contrary,congress decided to bring federal courts into the arena by granting them concurrent jurisdiction over hague convention actions.a.in addition,authorizes federal courts to order provisional remedies in hague convention cases.and the implementing statute goes further,authorizing the federal government to issue regulations to carry out the convention and requiring the state department to coordinate on child abduction cases.c.this is not surprising because the federal government is the usual venue for decisions bearing on foreign relations.foreign trade council natsios,cir,aff sub nom.crosby foreign trade council,d the constitution foreign affairs provisions have been long understood to stand for the principle that power over foreign affairs is vested exclusively in the federal government.
polizzi raises an argument quite similar to the district court,claiming that the article merely serves to clarify that the convention does not limit whatever power to return an authority might have under other laws.even if this reading of article were correct a point we need not decide the other powers not limited by article include the power to order the return of a settled child.we find that power reasonably implicit in both article and congress grant to federal courts of jurisdiction over hague convention actions,which we presume was enacted with awareness of the broad equitable powers that those courts customarily enjoy.
a federal court has the more limited authority to order the return of a child who was wrongfully removed or retained despite her being now settled.
executive branch interpretation 
the executive branch has consistently interpreted article as conferring upon an authority the discretion to order the return of a child found now settled.in the solicitor general brief in lozano,the united states asserts,a district court has equitable discretion to order a child returned even if she has become settled in her new environment.cert.pet.lozano amicus br.at.identifying the source of that authority,the united states explains,the convention expressly provides a mechanism other than equitable tolling to avoid rewarding a parent misconduct discretion to order the return of a child,even when a defense is satisfied.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted emphasis added.more specifically,a court retains equitable discretion under article to order that a child who is now settled in the united states should nonetheless be returned id.at emphasis added.
in these arguments to the supreme court,the united states articulates the same position it did as amicus before the second circuit in lozano,where it concluded that a court retains equitable discretion to order a child return at any time,even if the child is now settled.mem.br.for united states as amicus curiae at,lozano,cir see also id.at article contemplates that a finding of settlement could be outweighed by other equitable factors.explaining the nature of a court residual discretion under article,the united states explained,b y using the phrase equitable discretion,we mean to invoke broadly a court inherent equitable authority.id.at emphasis added.
this interpretation is consistent with the view expressed by the state department in its analysis of the convention,where it remarked 
if the alleged wrongdoer concealed the child whereabouts from the custodian necessitating a long search for the child and thereby delayed the commencement of a return proceeding by the applicant,it is highly questionable whether the respondent should be permitted to benefit from such conduct absent strong countervailing considerations.
legal analysis.at see also id.under article,the court is not obligated to return a child when return proceedings pursuant to the convention are commenced a year or more after the alleged removal or retention and it is demonstrated that the child is settled in its new environment.emphasis added.
in the solicitor general brief,the united states characterized article as underscor ing the authority conferred upon a court by article to order the return of a child now settled.cert.pet.lozano amicus br.at.in,the state department remarked tentatively that article provides that the convention does not limit the power of a judicial authority to order return of a child at any time,presumably under other laws,procedures or comity,irrespective of the child age.see legal analysis.at emphasis added.that is,however,not the present understanding of the executive branch.
it is clear that the executive branch has consistently interpreted article as conferring upon a court the authority to order,at its discretion,the return of a wrongfully removed child who is now settled.
the executive is well informed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting from this court interpretation of the convention,including the likely reaction of other contracting states and the impact on the state department ability to reclaim children abducted from this country

sister signatories 
courts of other signatory nations have held that the convention confers upon a court the authority to weigh considerations such as concealment when determining whether to order the return of a child now settled.in cannon,the court of appeals for england and wales remarked that even if settlement is established,the court could still order a return under the convention.ewca civ eng.similarly,in in re m,ukhl,appeal taken from eng,the british house of lords reached the conclusion that article does envisage that a settled child might nevertheless be returned within the convention procedures.id.the supreme court of ireland has arrived at a similar conclusion.see,ir ilrm ir.inferring existence of discretion to order return of now settled child from article.
sister circuits 
other circuits agree that the convention confers upon a federal district court the authority to order return even if a parent establishes a now settled defense.while no other circuit has addressed the now settled defense in particular,numerous circuits accept the general proposition that courts retain the discretion to order return even if one of the convention exceptions is proven.feder,at miller,at quoting feder accord friedrich,at a federal court retains,and should use when appropriate,the discretion to return a child,despite the existence of a defense,if return would further the aims of the convention.asvesta,at quoting friedrich.
we hold that the district court erred in finding it had no authority to order the return of a child found to be now settled.we recognize that,taken in isolation,the text of article can be read differently by different viewers.coupled,however,with the rest of the text of the convention,the convention purposes,the inherent equitable powers of federal courts,and the insights of the executive branch,we conclude that the convention confers upon a federal district court the authority to order,at its discretion,the return of a child found to be now settled.
district court alternate holding declining to order return under equitable powers 
in a fallback and serious argument,yaman says that even if the court retained authority to order return,the court alternative ruling is unsustainable,and the matter must be remanded.yaman argues that the court took its conclusion that children were now settled as the beginning and the end of its discretionary analysis of the return issue.yaman argues the court in essence adopted a presumption that disfavored return if the children were now settled.
there is very little law providing guidance as to how a district court is to weight the different factors as to return at this stage.the position of the united states is that this is a matter of equitable discretion 
in conducting that equitable assessment,the court could ultimately conclude that the abducting parent conduct in concealing the child whereabouts and any other equitable factors justify returning the child to the country of her habitual residence.deterring concealment and ensuring that abduction does not confer tactical advantages on the abducting parent are important animating principles of the convention.the court may therefore consider the abducting parent misconduct,together with any other relevant circumstances,such as whether return would not be harmful or disruptive even though the child has become settled,in deciding whether to order her return.
in addition,given that article contemplates that the child settlement could be outweighed by other equitable factors,it follows that article also affords the court discretion to dispense with the settled inquiry which can involve a inquiry into the child living situation when the court concludes that the circumstances justify ordering return regardless of the outcome of the settlement inquiry.for instance,the conduct of the concealing parent might be so extreme that return is called for irrespective of other circumstances.that authority is underscored by article,which provides that t he provisions of this chapter enumerating exceptions do not limit the power of a judicial or administrative authority to order the return of the child at any time.
cert.pet.lozano amicus,at alteration in original emphasis omitted citations omitted.the position of the united states refers to the equitable balancing of interests served by the convention as opposed to an independent inquiry into the best interests of the child.accord cannon,ewca civ.eng.t he exercise of a discretion under the convention requires the court to have due regard to the overriding objections of the convention whilst acknowledging the importance of the child welfare.the convention is based on the principle that the best interests of the child are well served when decisions regarding custody rights are made in the country of habitual residence.abbott.at.the convention also has as its purpose deterring child abductions,thereby prevent ing harms resulting therefrom.id.at.at the same time,article has as an additional purpose the protection of a child interest in remaining in a country in which she has lived for a substantial amount of time.lozano,at.
we believe yaman has not fairly read the court decision in wrestling with this difficult case.while a fuller explanation might have been helpful,it is well settled that the absence of a more detailed explanation does not amount to an abuse of discretion.see united states currier,cir observing that a district court failure to elaborate on the reason for reaching a particular determination need not imply that the court abused its discretion by ignoring the proper factors under the applicable balancing test quoting dente riddell,cir.this is especially so where,as here,it is clear that the district looked at a great number of factors and gave meticulous attention to the concerns raised by the case.see united states de la cruz,cir determining that d espite the lack of express findings,the record reflects the district court awareness of its responsibility to weigh the relevant factors and perform the applicable balancing test.yaman asks this court to remand to the district court with instructions to take into account a variety of interests,the interest in affording the parent a remedy for the abduction,the interest in deterring child abductions,the court considered explicitly each of those interests articulated by yaman before arriving at the conclusion that it did.in the end,yaman argument amounts to the claim that the district court ought to have assigned greater weight to the interests that spoke in favor of return.such relative weighting of interests by the district court,however,is not for this court to,and especially not on an abuse of discretion analysis.
we stress that this case does not involve a determination of custody.nothing in the case challenges the turkish court award of custody to yaman indeed,under article,a decision under this convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.convention.
we affirm the decision of the district court not to order return.
no costs are awarded.

for the purpose of keeping the two parties clear,we refer to the mother as polizzi.yaman has remarried,and his second wife is yaman.
at that point,polizzi attempted to procure passports for the two children at the united states consulate.the consulate informed polizzi that it was aware of the turkish family court order awarding sole custody of the two children to yaman,and,accordingly,refused to waive the requirement that both parents consent to the issuance of passports to minors.
as the district court noted,with one exception,discussed below,none of the expert reports concluded that abuse was more likely than not.
yaman admitted to once having an erection when holding,and to polizzi confronting him on that occasion.yaman attributed that incident to normal male physiology.he also admitted to making raspberries on arms,back,but insisted that he had never made a raspberry on her genital area.
on,polizzi challenges both of these findings,claiming that she and the children lived openly in andorra from october through april and in new hampshire since may and that yaman could have made additional efforts to discover her and the children location.this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error.whallon lynn,cir.here,the evidence in the record provides overwhelming support for both findings.polizzi engaged in substantial efforts to conceal her and the children location,including refusing to respond to emails,refusing to disclose their location to the state department,and,ultimately,moving to new hampshire where the family had no prior ties.at the same time,yaman was in continuous contact with central authorities in both turkey and the united states.yaman also sought assistance from interpol and the turkish police.as such,we agree with the district court that it is ludicrous for polizzi to suggest either that she did not conceal the children or that yaman slept on his rights under the convention.
the district court considered testimony from polizzi about the
