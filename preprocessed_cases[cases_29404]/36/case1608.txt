in this marital dissolution action,appellant joseph destein,challenges the amount of guideline child support awarded.in significant part,the court derived the award by imputing a rate of return to appellant separate property real estate,which was.appellant contends the trial court erred principally because it had no discretion to impute income to investment assets.because of the strong public interest in ensuring adequate financial support for children by their parents,we reject appellant request to graft this exception onto a statute whose clear text imposes no limitation on the court discretion to impute income when in the child best interests.we affirm the decision of the trial court.
procedural history 
joseph and patricia destein are the parents of four minor children.patricia petitioned for dissolution of the marriage in april,and by august the parties had entered into a marital settlement agreement that resolved issues of child custody,spousal support,and division of community property.left unresolved was the issue of child support,and in september patricia filed a motion for child support,requesting per month,later changed to so that the children can enjoy a substantially similar life style in my home as they do in joseph home.in his response,joseph asked the court to order patricia to pay child support of per month.on december,a final judgment of dissolution was entered,and five days later the trial court conducted a hearing on patricia motion for child support.ultimately,in january the trial court issued a tentative decision awarding patricia per month.a formal order was filed in february.joseph appeals from that postjudgment order.
throughout the marriage the parties and their children enjoyed a lavish lifestyle that allowed for expensive clothing,vacations,camps and private schooling.they lived with a fulltime housekeeper in a square foot home in san anselmo that sold in for million.the household expenses averaged approximately per month.
at the beginning of the marriage joseph was years old and retired.he had owned two successful risk management businesses,which he sold in for over million.with his separate property funds he purchased real property in nicasio and made other investments in securities.the nicasio property generated no income.
according to joseph,the couple relationship was in a state of deterioration for many years.they separated twice from to and in and reconciled.during the second separation,the parties devoted substantial energy to reaching an economic settlement,before reconciling.
in joseph sold the nicasio property at a profit of over million and acquired several other real properties in a exchange.only one of the new properties,the vineyard,generated any income in joseph received about as rental income.the other properties were designed for appreciation and included a vineyard that generated no income,two dilapidated commercial buildings in need of restoration,two pieces of raw land,and an office building used in part by joseph as his own office,with the remainder rented out to cover expenses.
during the marriage,joseph was not gainfully employed.he used the income from his investments to support his family and to pursue his interests in screenwriting and film making,from which he derived no income.joseph was also a syndicate member of lloyd of london from which he received some passive income in he received a cash distribution of.as patricia explained in her supporting declaration,the parties did not rely on joseph minimal income for their living expenses.they relied on joseph substantial wealth and property.
in his income and expense declaration,joseph listed assets totaling over million,including stocks,bonds and other securities million,retirement accounts million,and real estate million,including his personal residence valued at million.he listed his monthly expenses at with an annual income of only 
patricia worked throughout the marriage as a compliance consultant for a stock brokerage firm.in she earned about.after separation she increased her hours,and in her income rose to.in her supporting declaration,patricia asserted that her income was not sufficient to maintain the standard of living the children had enjoyed during the marriage.
the accountant report 
an accountant retained by patricia for purposes of the child support proceeding evaluated joseph assets and concluded that joseph annual income should be deemed to be.the accountant based this figure in part on joseph income of from lloyd of london plus rental income from the calplans wood vineyard.the accountant also calculated that joseph had available million in a retirement account that could be withdrawn.for the most part,however,the accountant determination of joseph ability to earn income was based on an estimated return of percent from joseph investments.those investments included just over million in stocks,bonds,and other securities and million in real estate excluding his residence 
as to the real estate,the accountant acknowledged that,except for the calplans wood vineyard,none of the properties generated income and most were being renovated requiring a significant outlay of cash.the accountant estimated the investment value of the real properties by using the price joseph had paid for the properties the year before,deducting the mortgage obligations,costs of sale,and the tax effects,and arriving at a liquidation value for the properties of million that could be invested and yield an estimated percent return.
the trial court decision 
the trial court awarded patricia child support in the amount of per month,finding this level of support in keeping with the lifestyle enjoyed by the family during the marriage.in calculating this amount,the court found that income of should be attributed to than what the accountant computed.unlike the accountant,the court did not use any income from joseph retirement plans,reasoning that joseph was only and ineligible to receive distributions before age.the court also used joseph actual income of from the vineyard plus from lloyd of london,not the used by the accountant.otherwise,however,the court followed the accountant calculations and imputed income to joseph of based on an estimated return of percent on joseph combined real estate and securities investments.
discussion 
imputing income 
on appeal,joseph argues that the trial court erred in imputing to him a hypothetical rate of return on his real estate investments when those investments do not produce income and would need to be liquidated to do so.joseph asserts that the trial court had no authority to enforce a particular investment strategy and should have based the child support calculation on his actual income of.joseph misunderstands the court order and underestimates its discretion to rely on earning capacity we reject his argument.
a.the earning capacity doctrine 
we begin with the observation that the statewide uniform guidelines for determining child support rest upon important principles,including a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life b oth parents are mutually responsible for the support of their children e ach parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability t he guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority c hildren should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children and c hild support orders in cases in which both parents have high levels of responsibility for the children should reflect the increased costs of raising the children in two homes and should minimize significant disparities in the children living standards in the two homes,subds.a b d g.
a crucial component for determining the amount of child support is,of course,each parent income.income,itself,is broadly defined the annual gross income of each parent means income from whatever source derived,subd.a.moreover,the court is not limited to the parent actual income.the court may,in its discretion,consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent income,consistent with the best interests of the children,subd.b.
the strong public policy in favor of providing adequate child support has led to an expansive use of the earning capacity doctrine in setting the level of support when consistent with the needs of the child.in re marriage of regnery d.historically,california courts limited consideration of a parent earning capacity in lieu of actual income to the narrow situation where the record demonstrated the parent was deliberately shirking family financial responsibilities by intentionally suppressing income or refusing to accept or seek gainful employment hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,to,italics in original philbin philbin d.philbin discussion of the ability to earn and the bad faith requirement preceded any statutory authorization for the concept.currently,family code section expressly authorizes the court to attribute income,without regard to deliberate attempts to reduce income.the philbin rule failed to survive the enactment of family code section.in re marriage of hinman th,d in re marriage of padilla th,d.
in padilla the supporting party resigned his job to open his own business,with the goal of increasing earnings.the trial court imputed income after specifically finding no bad faith motive in respondent actions.on appeal,the court upheld that decision.statutory commands and the inherent responsibility parents owe their children lead us to conclude the bad faith rule,as applied to child support can no longer be supported.once persons become parents,their desires for,personal job satisfaction,and other commendable goals must be considered in context of their responsibilities to provide for their children reasonable needs.if they decide they wish to lead a simpler life,change professions or start a business,they may do so,but only when they satisfy their primary responsibility providing for the adequate and reasonable needs of their children.in re marriage of padilla,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
with the demise of the bad faith limitation,parties have suggested other per se rules to limit application of the earning capacity doctrine to determine the level of child support.each has been rejected.so long as a parent has an earning capacity,that is,the ability and the opportunity to earn income,the trial court may attribute income.in re marriage of regnery,supra,d at.for example,in in re marriage of labass munsee th,d,the court rejected the supported party argument that for policy reasons,women who have primary custody of the children should never be subject to the income imputation provisions of family code section subdivision b in in re marriage of hinman,supra,th at page,d,the court refused to adopt a per se rule prohibiting the imputation of income to parents who refrain from employment in order to care for children.in in re marriage of dacumos th,d,the supporting party argued that it was an abuse of discretion to impute income to certain rental properties,because earning capacity is limited to income derived from employment and does not include imputed rental income.the court rejected this contention.noting that income is broadly defined without regard to its source,subd.a,the court applied the earning capacity doctrine to the ability to earn from capital as well as labor.see also county of kern castle th,d earning capacity applied when father spent entire inheritance and failed to invest it.
in each of these cases,the court did not minimize the concerns of the party opposing imputation.it simply rejected the contention that per se barriers should be erected in favor of designating the issues as legitimate factors for the court to consider in exercising its discretion.
this brief history provides context to the california supreme court most recent comment on the reliance on evidence of earning capacity in child support cases we decline to read into family code section,subdivision b,any limitation on the discretion vested in the trial court to consider earning capacity in determining the appropriate amount of child support when doing so would be in the child best interests.moss superior court cal th,d,see in re marriage of simpson cal th,d.
imputing income to joseph real estate investments 
in this case,the trial court imputed a rate of return to certain real estate assets,which were joseph separate property.a trial court decision to impute income to a parent for child support purposes based on the parent earning capacity is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.state of oregon vargas th,d in re marriage of hinman,supra,th at,d see in re marriage of simpson,supra,cal th at,d.under this standard,t he appellate court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the trial court it should determine only if any judge reasonably could have made such an order.citation.citation.in re marriage of hinman,supra,at,d.
joseph argues that the court abused its discretion because it was not entitled to impute investment earnings to historically assets.we reject this effort to create a per se rule.first,the test joseph would have us apply is neither workable nor logical.the facts in this case show the impracticality of a per se rule keyed to history.the real estate at issue was obtained by joseph in,only months before the parties separated,though long after problems had developed in the marriage which had focused the parties attention on the economic effects of a dissolution.the transaction was a exchange,in which the asset exchanged for this real estate was purchased by joseph before marriage and never produced income.which history is relevant under joseph proposed rule may the owner argue,as he has,that the investment has produced no income for the entire marriage or only that it has produced no income since it was obtained how lengthy a holding period is necessary before the asset is immune from imputation merely posing these questions demonstrates the difficulty of articulating or implementing a per se rule and the wisdom of treating an asset history as a factor to be considered,not a barrier to the exercise of discretion.
it is axiomatic that divorce unsettles many of the parties significant plans and assumptions,no matter how carefully crafted during the marriage.the court role is particularly dramatic in the child support area,where it is driven by the knowledge that the costs of supporting two households greatly exceed those of one.the legislature has directed that c hild support orders in cases in which both parents have high levels of responsibility for the children should reflect the increased costs of raising the children in two homes,subd.g.thus,the joint decision during marriage that one spouse will remain home and not earn income will not bar the court from ordering job training,job placement or vocational rehabilitation,so that,postseparation,the parent can contribute to the support of the children.in this light,it is difficult to credit joseph argument that a court lacks discretion to impute income to an asset because,during the history of the marriage,it did not produce income.
finally,the combination of the broad statutory grant of discretion in the earning capacity statute and the strong policy directives in favor of providing adequate support to children compel rejection of this per se rule.nothing in family code section,subdivision b,suggests that the court discretion to charge a reasonable rate of return to an investment asset depends on an history.a parent primary obligation is to support his or her children according to the parent station in life and ability to pay,subds.a d.the only statutory limitation on the court discretion to apply the earning capacity doctrine to investment assets is the best interests of the child,subd.b.
in a related argument,joseph contends that the trial court was not entitled to second guess his reasonable investment strategy.for the entire duration of the marriage,joseph successfully devoted the bulk of his separate property investments to growth,not income.the trial court must,he suggests,defer to that rea
