this appeal arises from the trial court postjudgment order denying the motion of appellant edward john cesnalis edward to terminate spousal support.the court found that edward and his former wife,glenda hill cesnalis glenda,had agreed in writing that glenda remarriage would not terminate her spousal support,and therefore edward had waived his rights under family code section section.under section,spousal support terminates by law upon the supported spouse remarriage unless the parties have agreed otherwise in writing.the trial court also found that edward removal of language from the relevant written glenda would have expressly terminated spousal support upon her remarriage estopped him from claiming that her remarriage terminated support.
we uphold the trial court findings that edward waived section regarding remarriage,and that edward was estopped from claiming that spousal support ended when glenda remarried accordingly,we affirm.
background 
edward and glenda were married on november.a little over seven years later,they separated and glenda filed for divorce.edward counsel drafted a stipulated judgment for dissolution of marriage stipulated judgment.shortly thereafter,the two parties and their attorneys met to discuss the draft.
at this meeting,glenda demanded that paragraph of the stipulated judgment,pertaining to spousal support paragraph,be modified.as originally drafted,paragraph stated in relevant part.spousal support.husband shall pay spousal support in the amount of per month,beginning october,and continuing until either party death,the remarriage of wife,or september,whichever occurs first,at which point spousal support will terminate absolutely.the duration of spousal support will not be modifiable under any circumstances,and the termination date stated herein is absolute,and no court shall have jurisdiction over the issue of spousal support,regardless of whether any motion is made on,before or after september.the parties stipulate that the marriage was one of short duration,and otherwise have bargained carefully for the termination of support contained herein.
glenda insisted that the words the remarriage of wife be removed from the list of terminating events in paragraph.
edward removed the remarriage language.edward also added other language reiterating the duration of support and moved the starting and ending dates of support back a month.paragraph now stated in relevant part.spousal support.husband shall pay spousal support in the amount of per month for a period of three years,beginning november,and continuing until either party death,or october,whichever occurs first,at which point spousal support will terminate absolutely.the duration of spousal support will not be modifiable under any circumstances,and the termination date stated herein is absolute,and no court shall have jurisdiction over the issue of spousal support,regardless of whether any motion is made on,before or after october.the parties stipulate that the marriage was one of short duration,and otherwise have bargained carefully for the termination of support contained herein.italics added.
the parties then agreed to the stipulated judgment with this redrafted paragraph,and the court entered the judgment on october.
glenda remarried on august.upon learning of glenda remarriage,edward moved unsuccessfully to terminate spousal support.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
there are two issues on appeal.first,did the trial court properly find that the parties agreed in writing that glenda remarriage would not terminate spousal support,and therefore that edward had waived section second,did the trial court properly find that edward was estopped from claiming that glenda remarriage terminated spousal support we find that the trial court ruled correctly as to both issues and will affirm the order.
written waiver of section 
section states except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing,the obligation of a party under an order for the support of the other party terminates upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the other party.the issue here is whether paragraph evidences an agreement between the parties to waive section.
two prominent,relatively recent decisions set forth the basic principles governing how a written agreement may waive the remarriage termination provision of section in re marriage of glasser d.glasser construing section substantively identical predecessor,civil code section,subd.b and in re marriage of thornton th,d thornton.those principles are as follows.
no particular words are required to waive section and make spousal support continue upon remarriage,but silence will not do.glasser,supra,d at.see also thornton,supra,th at,d.there must be a written agreement on the issue or the subject.see glasser,supra,d at.thornton,supra,th at,d see also in re marriage of sherman d.sherman.
section remarriage termination is not waived simply because the written agreement fails to include remarriage among the terminating events that are expressly mentioned.thornton,supra,th at,d.
nor is section overcome if the written agreement simply makes the spousal support provision nonmodifiable in general.glasser,supra,d at.thornton,supra,th at,d.this is because termination and modification are distinct concepts describing different ways to alter a support obligation.thornton,supra,th at,d in re marriage of benjamins th,d.
thornton provides that a written agreement to waive section s terminating provisions must be specific and express.thornton,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,as noted,no particular words are required,and extrinsic evidence is admissible to resolve whether a written agreement has waived the section remarriage termination provision.thornton,supra,th at,d glasser,supra,d at.see also emanuel emanuel d.emanuel steele langmuir d.steele sherman,supra,d at.lucas elliott th,d lucas.before such extrinsic evidence is properly admitted,however,there must be language in the written agreement reasonably susceptible to interpretation as a declaration of an intent that support continue beyond remarriage.glasser,supra,d at.emanuel,supra,d at.steele,supra,d at.sherman,supra,d at.
the party seeking to overcome a section remarriage termination bears the burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence,the requisite written agreement.thornton,supra,th at,d.
in applying these principles,the decisions display a dichotomy.on one side are those decisions,such as glasser and thornton,that do not find their written agreements susceptible to the admission of extrinsic evidence or sufficient to waive section on the other side are those decisions that do,such as steele and sherman.the written agreements in glasser and thornton stated,in boilerplate fashion,that spousal support payments were to be made over a designated term,and added,generally,that spousal support was.glasser,supra,d at.thornton,supra,th at,d.the agreements in steele and sherman,while they contained similar boilerplate,were more tailored in critical ways.in steele,the agreement provided that spousal support would continue until death,remarriage or the expiration of years,and was to be deemed,regardless of any change of circumstances,except for the contingencies contained herein.steele,supra,d at.and in sherman,the agreement stated that the amount of support,the method of payment and the terms and conditions of termination of support,all as previously specified,shall not be modifiable by the parties or by any court on any ground.sherman,supra,d at,italics omitted.as we shall explain,the written agreement here comes down on the steele and sherman side of things 
paragraph of the stipulated judgment is the relevant written agreement here.it is more specific than the spousal support agreements in glasser and thornton.the specificity is centered on the duration of support and the limited circumstances that can end it.under the wording of paragraph,edward shall pay spousal support for a period of three years beginning november,and continuing until either party death,or october,whichever occurs first,at which point spousal support will terminate absolutely.for good measure,paragraph adds that t he duration of spou
