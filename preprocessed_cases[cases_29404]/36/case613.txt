appellant kim shimkus kim appeals from a postjudgment order granting the request of respondent jeffrey shimkus jeff to terminate spousal support.she contends the court erred when it did not automatically admit declarations into evidence failed to apply the disentitlement doctrine found there was a change of circumstances warranting termination of spousal support and failed to require jeff to prove inability to work.she also claims procedural errors the court did not provide a statement of decision,failed to set out its analysis of the factors in family code section all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise specified,and failed to make findings as to its denial of attorney fees.
we conclude the court did not err when it refused to consider the declarations that were never offered into evidence.nor was it error to find the disentitlement doctrine did not apply.further the court properly found a change of circumstances allowing it to consider whether support should be modified.
however,in making its decision the court was required to consider all of the section factors.we can not determine whether it did so because it failed to issue a statement of decision.therefore,we reverse and remand for the court to consider all of the applicable section factors,issue a statement of decision,and to make findings as to its denial of attorney fees.
facts and procedural history 
the parties were married for almost years before they separated.the judgment of dissolution was filed in september.jeff was ordered to pay spousal support in the sum of per month,based on his gross monthly income of and kim gross monthly income of per month.jeff was also ordered to pay nonmodifiable spousal support,as a remedy to collect the equalization payment,payable at the rate of per month nonmodifiable support.jeff pensions were also divided.
in october jeff filed a request for order rfo to,among other things,terminate spousal support support rfo.in his declaration he claimed there would be a substantial change in circumstances boldface omitted in the next days when he retired from the fire department,thereby reducing his income.he was retiring at age because of the physical demands of the job and would be receiving a pension through the california public employees retirement system calpers of about per month he claimed this was a significant reduction in his base monthly payment in addition to the loss of overtime.he stated that his income would be insufficient to continue to pay support.
jeff set out kim income and stated he understood she had begun to draw on her portion of the calpers pension awarded in the judgment.he claimed,based on the reduction in his income,it would cause him substantial financial hardship if he had to continue to pay support.he further asserted kim increased income from the pension justified termination of support.
in opposition,kim filed an rfo for attorney fees and sanctions fee rfo.she stated the last support payment she received was in january.in addition,jeff had told her he would not pay any further support and had not made a payment in february.
at the beginning of the hearing on the rfo,the court stated each party would be able to present any and all evidence.kim lawyer requested the court rule first on her objections to the declarations of jeff and his counsel.the court replied it would take oral testimony and would rule on any objections made when questions were asked.kim attorney responded,okay.
in her opening statement,kim lawyer stated she would be presenting certain evidence from the declarations.at the end of kim testimony,the court inquired of her attorney,any other evidence and counsel replied,no,everything has been provided in the paperwork,your honor.the court did not respond.
during closing argument kim counsel argued jeff was in contempt due to his failure to pay spousal support,and thus he could not seek modification of the order.the court commented it understood case law held there had to be a finding of contempt,not just an allegation,and in this case there had been no such finding.when the court stated it required evidence to such effect,kim lawyer responded that the evidence was in kim declaration in opposition to the request.jeff counsel countered there was no such evidence before the court.
the court stated the evidence in the hearing was the testimony and documents admitted,and n othing else.kim lawyer argued that the declarations filed were in evidence,absent any objections.
when the court took the matter under submission,it stated it would look at all the pleadings and closely at california rules of court,rule.all further references to rules are to the california rules of court.kim counsel confirmed the court had not ruled on her objections to the declarations filed by jeff and his counsel and asked the court to review them,to which the judge replied he would.
in the order order granting the support rfo,as to the declarations,the court ruled the only evidence was that presented by oral testimony and exhibits introduced into evidence,characterizing the declarations as evidence.
the order terminated support as of january.the original judgment found jeff income was and kim was.after payment of spousal support and the nonmodifiable support,jeff income was and kim was.
the court further ruled 
at the hearing the evidence showed jeff income from his retirement is.this started in january.the evidence also showed that his average income in,before his retirement,was.
evidence showed kim present income was as follows from employment,from her son assistance,from her pension and the spousal support total,without the spousal support order,is.
court received evidence of two significant change of circumstance,the first jeff retirement and the second kim income from the pension plan.it can be argued that a retirement before the age of does not automatically result in a modification of support.it can be argued that the retirement was done for the sole purpose of not having to pay the support.this would force the court to look at jeff ability to earn.
in the case in re marriage of sinks d,where in the court indicated in a case such as this the court may have look at ability to earn but more importantly in its ruling it ordered that support should be reduced by the exact amount of increase in the supported spousal sic income,therein.it held,a ccordingly,we find the trial court should have,in the proper exercise of its discretion,reduced the support level by.otherwise,the wife will receive a per month windfall at the expense of the husband.footnote.
following the ruling in sinks,jeff income is irrelevant whether it is,or thousand the significant change in circumstances is the increase in kim income by.the proper exercise is to reduce the support dollar for dollar as in sinks.
this was the extent of the findings on the issue of spousal support modification.the court also ordered the parties to pay their own attorney fees and costs.
kim filed objections to the order.she asserted the court failed to issue a statement of decision or findings required under section and requested the court do so.the court did not take any action.
kim then filed a motion to vacate the order,on the same grounds on which she bases her appeal.within a few days thereafter and before the hearing on the motion to vacate,jeff served a proposed findings and order after hearing proposed findings.kim responded the court had already issued its findings and an order and further that the proposed findings were untimely.
at the hearing on the motion to vacate,as to alleged failure to issue a statement of decision,the court stated its minute order was sufficient,remarking it set out the court reasoning.
jeff attorney agreed the order was proper if it added findings on attorney fees,and suggested language to that effect.kim lawyer countered there had been no findings on attorney fees.
the court denied the motion to vacate and asked jeff to submit findings and order after hearing foah for the court review counsel did so.the foah was filed in june and was identical to the proposed findings except for the addition of findings on attorney fees,set out in checked boxes on the attorney fees attachment to the foah.
kim then filed lengthy objections,disputing the findings as to attorney fees and the marital standard of living there was no reply from the trial court.
additional facts are set out in the discussion.
discussion 
admissibility of declarations 
kim contends the court erred in not automatically admitting the declarations filed with the rfo and oppositions.although she advances several theories as to why these declarations were or should have been admitted,they do not persuade.
preliminarily,kim never explains the harm in excluding the declarations.she does not point to evidence on which she would have relied had they been admitted or how she has been prejudiced.under code of civil procedure section,we may not reverse a judgment unless an error was prejudicial and a different result was likely in the absence of the error.prejudice is not presumed.and it is not our responsibility to comb through the record to locate possible errors.
but even on the merits the argument fails.kim cites code of civil procedure section,which allows affidavits to be used in connection with some types of motions.elkins superior court cal th.she then relies on code of civil procedure section,that provides any written direction of the court and not included in a judgment is an order and an application for an order is a motion,and thereby concludes the rfo were motions,for which declarations are permissible.
even so it is irrelevant whether the rfo is a motion or some other form of action.section instructs that in a hearing on a motion or order to show cause,except under limited circumstances,the parties stipulation or good cause,live testimony is required,subds.a,b.and the court made it clear the hearing would be conducted using live testimony.
at the beginning of the hearing,the court told both counsel jeff would be able to present his evidence and kim would then have the same opportunity.when kim counsel mentioned her objections to jeff declarations,the court stated,i be hearing the testimony orally,so you can make the objections when they ask the questions,to which kim lawyer responded,okay.this made it clear kim needed to present live testimony as to the evidence in her declarations,and she had every opportunity to do so and to question jeff as to the statements in his.
moreover,had kim wanted the declarations admitted,she merely needed to move to do so or seek a stipulation for admission.she understood this because she stipulated to admit the income and expense declarations.and she refused to stipulate to admission of the other declarations without the court first ruling on her objections.
kim makes much of elkins superior court,supra,cal th,which she cites for the proposition that declarations,which are hearsay id.at,are not admissible in dissolution trials.elkins stated declarations are allowed for certain family law motions under code of civil procedure section but not trials.id.at.but elkins was decided before enactment of section requiring live testimony for motions,added by stats,ch.
likewise,kim reliance on miller miller d,which states an affidavit properly supports a motion for increased support,is inapt.this case substantially predates the enactment of section.
kim argues section and code of civil procedure section are not mutually exclusive.this may be so.nevertheless,as with any evidence,a declaration must be marked and offered and is subject to objections before admission.
kim also stresses the fact that declarations are required when filing an rfo rule she concludes based on this requirement that logically,the declarations must be admitted into evidence.she points to rule c,which allows for objections to declarations,contending there would be no reason for this provision if declarations were not automatically in evidence.this argument is flawed.
as noted,the parties may stipulate that declarations be admitted,in conjunction with or in place of live testimony.and declarations may be offered into evidence.further,the court may,for good cause,disallow live testimony and rely on declarations.but these options do not equate to automatic admission of declarations.
moreover,as kim admits,the purpose of a declaration is to give notice to the opposing party of the basis of the rfo.see rule g an rfo must contain facts sufficient to notify the other party of the declarant contentions in response to the request for order and in support of any relief requested.
kim claims portions of the order were not supported by live testimony.for example,she points out there was no live testimony regarding attorney fees.therefore the court must have relied on the declarations.if so,this was improper.
in section.of the opinion we discuss the failure of the court to make sufficient findings on attorney fees and remand the matter back so such findings can be made.these findings must be based on testimony or evidence in the income and expense declarations admitted by stipulation,since that was the only evidence before the court.
jeff reliance on evidence in the declarations in opposition to kim motion to vacate the order has no effect on our decision.it does not mean the declarations were in evidence or should have been under the facts of this case.
in sum,the declarations were not automatically in evidence nor did the court err in not admitting them under the circumstances of this case.
disentitlement doctrine 
kim contends the trial court should have applied the doctrine of disentitlement to deny jeff request to terminate spousal support.she bases this on the fact jeff had not paid spousal support for several months before the hearing.thus,she argues,he had no right to seek to have the support modified.she maintains the court erred when it ruled there had to be a finding of contempt before the doctrine applied.we are not persuaded the court erred.
there is no evidence jeff ceased making support payments.although kim declarations in opposition to the support rfo and in support of her fee rfo state jeff stopped paying support beginning in february,that evidence was not admitted and kim failed to cite to any testimony to that effect.
even had this evidence been before the court,kim claim fails.although,contrary to the trial court understanding,case law instructs there did not have to be a contempt finding guardianship of melissa th,court could apply doctrine without formal judgment of contempt,the record makes clear the court would not have relied on the disentitlement doctrine,given that it terminated support as of january.
disentitlement is based in equity.san francisco unified school dist.ex.rel.contreras first student,th,disentitlement is a discretionary tool that may be applied when the balance of the equitable concerns make it a proper sanction.we review the court exercise of its equitable powers for an abuse of discretion.ho hsieh th.an abuse of discretion occurs when,in light of applicable law and considering all relevant circumstances,the court ruling exceeds the bounds of reason.citations.citation.ibid.the court did not abuse its discretion.
change of circumstances 
applicable law and standard of review 
a prerequisite to modification or termination of spousal support is a material change of circumstances.in re marriage of khera sameer th.change of circumstances means a reduction or increase in the supporting spouse ability to pay an increase or decrease in the supported spouse needs.it includes all factors affecting need and the ability to pay.in re marriage of west th.
the trial court has broad discretion to decide whether to modify a spousal support order.citation.in re marriage of tydlaska th.in exercising that discretion,the court must consider the required factors set out in section in re marriage of left th.the court has discretion as to the weight it gives to each factor in re marriage of cheriton th,and then the ultimate decision as to amount and duration of spousal support rests within its broad discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of its discretion.citation.in re marriage of left,at.failure to weigh the factors is an abuse of discretion.in re marriage of cheriton,at.
kim argues neither jeff early retirement nor her drawing on her portion of jeff pension were material changes of circumstances automatically triggering termination of spousal support.again,we are not persuaded.
pension payments 
the court found kim drawing on her share of jeff pension was a material change of circumstances.relying on a footnote in sinks,supra,d,the court used the monthly pension payment amount as a direct offset,dollar for dollar,against any spousal support jeff might have to pay.
kim claims the court erred in finding this was a material change of circumstances.she argues the court misapplied sinks and should have relied instead on in re marriage of dietz th dietz.we disagree.
in sinks,in the original judgment the court awarded spousal support to the wife and retained jurisdiction over the husband pension.when the husband was he was threatened with termination and chose to retire instead with a full pension.the administrator of his pension plan applied to have the court divide the parties respective shares.the husband sought to have his spousal support modified based on a reduction in his income.sinks,supra,d at.
in denying modification,the trial court stated that,at,the husband was without any health problems.it considered his ability to earn rather than his actual income.sinks,supra,d at.
the court of appeal affirmed,but modified the amount of support,decreasing it by the amount the wife had begun receiving from the pension,holding the trial court abused its discretion by failing to do so.it noted the wife had stipulated to the reduction and stated that if that was not taken into consideration,the wife would receive a windfall at the expense of the husband.sinks,supra,d at,fn.
in dietz the stipulated dissolution judgment provided for the husband to pay the wife spousal support.it also divided the retirement accounts,giving the wife of the plans and any increase or decrease in value.years later,the court granted the husband request to modify spousal support,finding there was a material change of circumstances because the wife was now old enough to draw retirement payments without penalty and certain securities she received in the judgment had appreciated.the court of appeal reversed,holding that the wife rights to access the retirement accounts on a basis and to any increase in their values were insufficient,without more,to constitute a material change of circumstances.dietz,supra,th at.
the dietz trial court relied heavily on in re marriage of schmir th schmir,in which the wife argued her ability to make withdrawals from her retirement account is not a change in circumstances because the parties must have contemplated when they entered into their support agreement the wife would reach the age when she could begin making withdrawals from the account without penalty.therefore her reaching the requisite age is not a change in circumstance but merely an aspect of the same circumstance existing at the time of the original support order in.id.at,italics fn.omitted.the appellate court disagreed,stating a dopting the wife line of reasoning would mean that as a matter of law the supporting spouse attainment of retirement age could never constitute a change of circumstance for purposes of a motion to modify a support order.ibid.
dietz agreed that a supporting spouse attainment of retirement age may constitute a material change of circumstances for purposes of a motion to modify a support order,depending on the circumstances of a given case.the loss of income as a result of a supporting spouse retirement at an appropriate age might be such a case.we do not agree,however,that such a proposition establishes as a matter of law that a supported spouse attainment of the age by which retirement accounts divided in a marital settlement agreement might be accessed without penalty automatically constitutes a material change of circumstances.dietz,supra,th at.
dietz,however,is distinguishable.the spousal support judgment at issue here specifically considered only the parties gross monthly income although the judgment included a division of husband pension,it did not consider any future payments in calculating the amount of spousal support.thus,in this case,even though the judgment contemplated kim would ultimately receive her share of the pension,her increased income from the pension is a change of circumstances.
further dietz stated there might be a case where the trial court could properly exercise its discretion to impute reasonable withdrawals from retirement accounts as additional income for purposes of modifying spousal support.dietz,supra,th at.we conclude this is one such time.
the monthly addition of the pension payment is a decrease in kim needs,falling within the definition of a change of circumstances.in re marriage of west,supra,th at.thus,the court did not err in finding kim receipt of pension payments was a material change of circumstances.
jeff retirement 
jeff retired when he was after over years as a firefighter.his last classification was as a fire captain paramedic.during his tenure he suffered some injuries,including an injury to his lower back,causing his work status to be changed to permanent station a ry.he also sustained two cervical injuries,the latest in approximately.the injury to his neck,which jeff described as pervasive,caused constant pain requiring him to change his personal lifestyle.jeff testified,i retired because i was too old to do the job adequately.he described the physical requirements of his job,including weights of various pieces of equipment he could have to carry.jeff elected not to retire on disability,but to put in his years.
the normal retirement age of a firefighter is,tit,subd.a c is highest specified age to retire if person is entitled to benefits under government code section,subd.a section applies to firefighters.
kim contends we can not consider this because these alleged facts were not admitted in evidence and jeff did not make this argument in the trial court.she is mistaken.the code section and regulation are laws,not facts.additionally,in his opening statement,jeff stated he was at the age of retirement.and in his closing argument he argued was not the normal retirement age for a firefighter.so jeff is not advancing a new theory or new facts,and we may consider this claim.carmona lincoln millennium car wash,th,fn.
kim argues jeff actual role as a captain was primarily administrative.but there was no evidence presented to the court to support this claim.kim cites only to a statement in a declaration that was not admitted into evidence.
we conclude jeff did not retire early.although is the common generally accepted normal retirement age in re marriage of reynolds,th,reynolds see sinks,supra,d at,dis.opn.of work,government code section,subdivision a and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a c plainly state is the normal retirement age for a firefighter as a result,we conclude jeff is subject to the rules applying to those who retire at.
for example,reynolds,supra,th stated no one may be compelled to work after the usual retirement age of in order to pay the same level of spousal support as when he was employed.id.at.in that case the husband retired at and sought to modify or terminate spousal support.the trial court reduced support but based the new amount on the husband earning capacity instead of earnings.
the court of appeal reversed,stating using earning capacity was error because it would require the husband to work beyond the normal retirement age.the capacity to earn standard may only be applied where there is evidence of the ability,opportunity,and willingness to work.reynolds,supra,th at.where there is a bona fide retirement,it may be considered a material change of circumstances justifying a modification of spousal support.id.at.just as a married couple may expect a reduction in income due to retirement,a divorced spouse can not expect to receive the same high level of support after the supporting spouse retires.ibid.
but the mere fact jeff retired does not ipso facto require modification or termination of his spousal support.as stated above,th
