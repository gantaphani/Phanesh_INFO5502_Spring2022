william appeals from an order denying him reunification services in dependency proceedings concerning angelique c.the juvenile court relied exclusively on the reunification bypass provision in welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,which permits the court to bypass reunification services if a parent relationship with a sibling of the minor has been permanently severed appellant contends that this provision does not apply to a parent who has voluntarily relinquished parental rights to the sibling.he further contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the bypass findings,that the trial court applied the wrong burden of proof,that because the trial court continued the disposition hearing more than six months past the detention the court should have ordered reunification services,and that the court abused its discretion in not ordering services.we affirm.

on july,the court began the contested disposition hearing,which was not completed until august.in the disposition report dated july,the social worker recommended that receive reunification services.initially,the social worker recommended against services for appellant because he was on parole in new mexico and would not have consistent contact with angelique in an addendum dated july,the social worker stated that after submitting that recommendation,the social worker was informed that the father was entitled to services.counsel for the agency asked for reunification services for both and appellant the district attorney representing angelique asked the court to bypass reunification services for both and appellant.

the court received an addendum report that attached records from the children,youth and families department of new mexico department regarding angelique brother ryan.these records show the court granted the department custody of ryan when he was observed by medical personnel to have unexplained burns on his hand and foot.on september,the court in new mexico terminated appellant and parental rights to ryan.

the court ordered that reunification services be provided to,but not to appellant.finding appellant parental rights to ryan had been terminated,the court said,the court must then decide whether or not he has made a reasonable effort to treat the problem that led to ryan removal from him.the court is unconvinced that he has made reasonable efforts.
discussion 
section,subdivision b 
the court ordered reunification services for appellant bypassed under section,subdivision b because appellant parental rights to angelique sibling had been permanently severed.appellant contends that the bypass of reunification services under this subdivision applies to involuntary terminations,not voluntary relinquishments of parental rights.
section provides in relevant part except as provided in subdivision b,or when the parent has voluntarily relinquished the child and the relinquishment has been filed with the state department of social services,or upon the establishment of an order of guardianship pursuant to section,whenever a child is removed from a parent or guardian custody,the juvenile court shall order the social worker to provide child welfare services to the child and the child mother and statutorily presumed father or guardians.subdivision b provides that reunification services need not be provided to a parent when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,any of certain enumerated exceptions.subdivision b describes the exception at issue here that the parental rights of a parent over any sibling or of the child had been permanently severed,and this parent is the same parent described in subdivision a,and that,according to the findings of the court,this parent has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to removal of the sibling or of that child from the parent.
the evidence presented at the disposition hearing established that ryan was the subject of a dependency petition in september and that in september the department in new mexico filed an amended motion for the termination of appellant and parental rights.during those proceedings,they informed the agency that they were willing to relinquish their parental rights and they filed a relinquishment and consent for adoption.
appellant argues that permanently severed,as used in subdivision b,means an involuntary termination of parental rights,and that this construction is supported by the plain meaning of severed,the legislative history,and public policy.in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.day city of fontana cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.people lawrence cal th,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.day city of fontana,supra,cal th at,d,people lawrence,supra,cal th at,d.
here,at issue is the meaning of the phrase the parental rights had been permanently severed as used in section,subdivision b.to sever means to put or keep apart divide especially to remove as a part by or as if by cutting and to become separated.dictionary as of.appellant parental rights to angelique sibling were permanently severed when,following appellant voluntary relinquishment,the new mexico court terminated his parental rights to ryan.thus,under the plain language of section,subdivision b,the court could order bypass reunification services to appellant.
in this state parental rights may be severed through the comprehensive dependency scheme of section et or under family code provisions for freedom from parental custody and control,et and for adoption,et.examining the language of section,subdivision b and giving the words permanently severed their usual and ordinary meaning,we find the wording of subdivision b does not distinguish between a parent who has voluntarily relinquished the minor sibling and a parent who,after a series of hearings in the dependency system,has had his or her parental rights to the minor sibling terminated under section 
justice kennard made this same observation in renee superior court cal th,d.before october,the provisions of subdivision b were found in subdivision b,which provided reunification services need not be provided to a parent or guardian when the court finds,by clear and convincing evidence,any of the following that a the court ordered termination of reunification services for any siblings or of the child because the parent or guardian failed to reunify with the sibling or after the sibling or had been removed from that parent or guardian pursuant to section and that parent or guardian is the same parent or guardian described in subdivision a,or b the parental rights of a parent or guardian over any sibling or of the child had been permanently severed,and that,according to the findings of the court,this parent or guardian has not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems that led to the removal of the sibling or of that child from that parent or guardian.
on august,the supreme court interpreted the clause as applicable only to subpart b of section,subdivision b.the court said,if we have failed to discern correctly the legislature intent in enacting the statute,that body may clarify the statute accordingly.renee superior court,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.in her dissenting opinion,justice kennard said that the clause should apply to subpart a as well as subpart b.justice kennard observed,subpart b also applies when parental rights are severed outside of the dependency system.this occurs when a child has been abandoned or voluntarily relinquished for adoption,or when a third party brings an action to sever parental rights after the parent has been convicted of a felony or is seriously mentally ill,et id.at,d,italics added.
shortly thereafter,in response to renee,the legislature amended the bypass provision by an urgency measure effective october.stats,ch.the amendment divided former subparts a and b of subdivision b into separate provisions,subdivisions b for a and b for b,conforming the provision to justice kennard interpretation of the statute.in the new subdivision b,the phrase permanently severed remained.
we hold that subdivision b of welfare and institutions code section applies when a parent rights to a minor sibling or half sibling are severed due to a voluntary relinquishment of those rights.as appellant voluntarily relinquished his parental rights to angelique sibling,the trial court properly found appellant came within the by
