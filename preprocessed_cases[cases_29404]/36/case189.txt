one wednesday afternoon,several students at colonial elementary school reported to their teacher that,a classmate,had brought a gun to school.during the ensuing investigation,school administrators twice held in the principal office for questioning.during the second detention,law enforcement officers also quizzed the child.mother,jennifer wofford,was not contacted until the police had departed.
wofford claims that the school failure to notify her violated her rights to due process under the fourteenth amendment.she also alleges that the detainments violated fourth amendment right to be free from unlawful seizures.the district court dismissed these claims.
we now affirm.school officials must have the leeway to maintain order on school premises and secure a safe environment in which learning can flourish.disciplinary procedures can undermine educators ability to best attain these goals.imposing a rigid duty of parental notification or a per se rule against detentions of a specified duration would eviscerate the ability of administrators to meet the remedial exigencies of the moment.the constitution does not require such a result.
an order dismissing a claim under.b and an award of summary judgment are reviewed de novo.we apply the same legal standard as the court below and construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the.mylan,matkari,cir charbonnages de france smith,cir.
on the eve of thanksgiving in,a teacher at colonial elementary school in botetourt county,virginia,called assistant principal rosa with some disquieting news.several students had reported that their classmate had brought a gun to school.rosa immediately located the accused pupil and escorted her to the assistant principal office.in the office,rosa repeatedly questioned about the allegation.permitted rosa to search her book bag and her classroom desk.finding no weapon,rosa escorted to the school bus that was waiting for her.
on the monday following thanksgiving,the assistant principal,now accompanied by principal evans,continued to investigate the incident.the two principals spoke with the children who had initially made the allegation.several of them maintained that had brought a weapon to school the week before.one of these pupils,josh bane,said he had seen throw a black handgun into the woods adjoining the school.their concerns rekindled,the school officials contacted the police.rosa and evans summoned to the office once more and renewed their inquiries about the weapon.during the questioning,complained of nausea and requested the presence of her mother.neither school official obliged,however,and the investigation continued.
three detectives arrived at the school in the middle of the morning.they spoke with four accusers before interviewing the student herself in the assistant principal office.in the presence of the school officials,they quizzed about the allegation once more.in response to the officers inquiries,the pupil repeatedly denied bringing a gun to school.on several occasions she asked for her mother,but the officers and school officials did not contact wofford.even alleges that her interviewers ignored her request to visit the restroom.while two officers continued their interrogation,detective markham sought out josh bane.bane showed the officer and rosa where he saw discard the gun.markham swept the school grounds for a weapon,but found nothing.
rosa,evans,and markham recall the questioning lasting about fifteen minutes,by contrast,claims to have been with the police for at least an hour and a half.despite requests,her mother was not contacted while the police were at the school.on his way back to the station,markham called wofford to inform her that her daughter had spoken to the police.mother arrived at the school shortly after receiving this news.she waited a further forty minutes before retrieving her daughter from the principal office.
wofford and filed suit against evans,rosa,the botetourt county school board,markham,and other unknown officers of the county sheriff department.they pressed several constitutional claims under.first,they asserted that the school disciplinary procedures violated wofford right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.second,they claimed that had been seized by school officials and police officers in violation of the fourth amendment 
the district judge dismissed the due process claim pursuant to.b.he permitted the fourth amendment claim to proceed but eventually dismissed it on summary judgment.wofford and press both claims on appeal.
it is now a commonplace that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.tinker des moines.cmty.sch,d.but the supreme court has never held that the full panoply of constitutional rules applies with the same force and effect in the schoolhouse as its does in the enforcement of criminal laws.new jersey,d powell,concurring.indeed,school officials have been afforded substantial leeway to depart from the prohibitions and procedures that the constitution provides for society at large.see,bethel sch.dist.fraser,d permitting the punishment of a public school student for using lewd speech,at.declining to require a warrant supported by probable cause for searches of students by school officials ingraham wright,d finding no constitutional requirement of notice or a hearing prior to the administration of corporal punishment.
such leeway is particularly necessary when school discipline is involved.the court has noted the substantial interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in the classroom,at.educators must be able to respond effectively to the disciplinary exigencies of the moment.they must also be able to tailor these responses to the peculiar remedial needs that exist in particular schools.the supreme court has long recognized that educators are best situated to identify those needs and optimize their implementation.the education of the nation youth is primarily the responsibility of parents,teachers,and state and local officials,and not of federal judges.hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d.
with these injunctions in mind,we decline to announce a requirement of parental notification or a ban on detentions of a certain length when school officials are investigating a serious allegation of student misconduct.such strictures would be particularly inappropriate when,as here,several students corroborate the accusation and an eyewitness shows the investigators where the transgression occurred.
the appellants proposed rules would force educators to choose between abandoning their preferred method of discipline altogether or complying with burdensome procedures decreed by federal courts.the consequences of inaction in the face of dangerous conditions can be grave.teachers and administrators might face liability for omissions that lead to student injury.see generally johnson dallas indep.sch,cir discussing the circumstances under which school officials may be liable for shooting deaths of students.and under appellants proposed rule,the consequences of action would be as serious for educators as the consequences of inaction.an administrator contemplating discipline would face the threat of a lawsuit with all its attendant diversion of energy and resources from educational pursuits.
appellants protest that,in the age of cell phones and,a rule requiring parental notification would hardly burden school officials.they also suggest that student welfare would be improved if parents were present during questioning.but these rejoinders miss the mark.when faced with imminent danger to the safety of their students,school officials may well find an immediate inquiry in the absence of a parent a necessary investigatory step.federal courts should be wary of removing such devices from the disciplinary with the blunt instrument of constitutional decree.it would be a misfortune to exchange the informality of the school setting for the adversarial atmosphere of formalized procedure.although the rule appellants urge may appear clear,it invites a series of derivative questions what efforts must school officials make to contact parents must both parents be alerted may off
