this dispute arises in independent adoption proceedings commenced by a birth mother,sharon sharon,and her former domestic partner annette annette to effect annette adoption of joshua now three and a half years old who,like his older brother zachary now six years old and previously adopted by annette,was conceived by artificial insemination of sharon and born during the partnership the question presented is whether an independent adoption in which the birth parent does not agree to termination of her parental rights is legislatively authorized and,if so,whether the statutes are constitutional.the court of appeal granted a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to permit sharon to withdraw her consent to,and to terminate,the adoption.for the following reasons,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the cause for further proceedings.
background 
sharon and annette attended harvard business school together and were in a committed relationship from through mid.in,after being artificially inseminated with sperm from an anonymous donor,sharon gave birth to zachary.with sharon consent and approval,annette petitioned to adopt zachary in a second parent adoption,using official forms and procedures that expressly provided that sharon consented to zachary adoption by annette but intended to retain her own parental rights the trial court approved annette adoption petition,and annette has since been one of zachary two parents.
three years later,in,sharon was inseminated again with sperm from the same anonymous donor and gave birth to joshua.on august of that year,sharon signed an independent adoption placement agreement agreement,which begins note to birth parent this form will become a permanent and irrevocable consent to adoption.do not sign this form unless you want the adopting parents named below to adopt your child.the agreement goes on to recite sharon permanent and irrevocable consent to the adoption on the day after i sign the agreement.
the agreement also recites that,upon the court approval of the agreement,sharon will give up all rights of custody,services,and earnings with respect to joshua.however,a written addendum to independent adoption placement agreement addendum,a form developed by the california department of social services cdss,was signed by sharon and annette on the same date as they signed the agreement.the addendum stated sharon intent,as joshua birth parent,to retain parental rights and control of joshua while placing him with annette for the purpose of independent adoption.these were essentially the same procedures and forms sharon and annette had used for zachary adoption 
subsequently,annette filed a petition to adopt joshua as a second parent with sharon.the petition stated that sharon,as birth mother of the children zachary and joshua,consents to this adoption and will execute a limited written consent to the child joshua adoption in the manner required by law.the petition also stated that sharon intends to retain all her rights to custody and control as to said child.in april,the san diego county department of health and human services hhs,acting in its capacity as an agency licensed by cdss under the family code to investigate and report upon proposed independent adoptions,recommended that the court grant annette adoption petition.
annette and sharon relationship has been somewhat volatile.apparently owing to continuing difficulties,sharon repeatedly requested postponement of the hearing on annette adoption petition.in august,sharon asked annette to move out of the family residence,which annette did.each retained new counsel.in mediation,the parties agreed on a temporary visitation schedule affording annette time with both boys,but they could not reach an agreement respecting permanent custody or visitation.
on october,annette filed a motion for an order of adoption respecting joshua,contending,inter alia,that sharon consent had become irrevocable pursuant to section and that the adoption was in joshua best interest.
after a family court mediator recommended that sharon and annette share custody and that annette have specified visitation,sharon moved for court approval to withdraw her consent to the adoption.she contended there was no legal basis for the adoption,that her consent had been obtained by fraud or duress,and that withdrawal of her consent was in joshua best interest.hhs subsequently filed a supplemental report with the court,noting that sharon had moved to withdraw her consent but had not done so within the statutorily specified period for revocation.hhs further reported that annette had shared in joshua medical expenses and in the planning and handling of his daily care since birth,that annette had a close and loving relationship with joshua as his second parent,and that annette relationship with joshua was similar to her relationship with zachary.finding that adoption continued to be in joshua best interest,hhs again recommended that annette petition to adopt joshua be granted.
in late november,the court ordered interim visitation,encouraged the parties to try to agree on an ongoing visitation schedule,and appointed counsel for joshua shortly thereafter,sharon obtained a domestic violence restraining order against annette and moved to dismiss the adoption petition.she argued,again,that the adoption was unauthorized by statute and also that annette lacked standing to adopt joshua.joshua counsel also moved to dismiss the adoption petition,on the ground that sharon and annette original counsel had not complied with her statutory obligations as an attorney representing both the birth and prospective adoptive parents in an independent adoption.see.the court denied both dismissal motions.although it did not separately discuss sharon request for permission to withdraw consent,the court noted that sharon had not attempted to withdraw her consent within the time required by law and that resolution of the adoption petition was likely to be based on joshua best interest.
thereupon,sharon filed a petition for a writ of mandate,joined in by counsel for joshua,challenging the denial of her motion to dismiss.in a divided opinion,the court,citing section,held that,except for stepparent adoptions,an adoption where a consenting parent does not relinquish all parental rights has no statutory basis.we granted annette petition for review.
discussion 
the right to adopt a child,and the right of a person to be adopted as the child of another,are wholly statutory.estate of sharon cal.california adoption statutes appear in division of the family code,which is divided into three parts.part provides definitions applicable throughout.part addresses adoption of unmarried minors,and part adoption of adults and married minors.the part with which we are concerned,part,is in turn divided into several chapters.chapter et contains general provisions.subsequent chapters deal with agency adoptions et,independent adoptions et,intercountry adoptions et,and stepparent adoptions et.
as noted,in petitioning to adopt joshua,annette has proceeded under the independent adoption provisions.pursuant to the current statutory scheme,birth parents can consent to an independent adoption by entering into an adoption placement agreement with a prospective adoptive parent,see also,tit,subd.b.the birth parents have days in which to revoke this consent,subd.a.if they fail to do so,their consent becomes permanent and irrevocable,subd.c,subds.a,b,subd.a.
once the adoption placement agreement has been signed,the prospective adoptive parent may petition for adoption,subd.a c.the court clerk must give cdss notice of the petition,subd.a,and the petitioner must file a copy of the petition with cdss.
subsequently,it is incumbent on cdss to investigate the proposed independent adoption,subd.a and ascertain whether the child is a proper subject for adoption and whether the proposed home is suitable for the child,see also,tit,subd.b.cdss interviews the petitioner and the birth parents,see also,tit.within days after the petition is filed,cdss must submit to the court a full report of the facts disclosed by its inquiry with a recommendation regarding the granting of the petition,subd.a see also,tit,subd.a.a copy of cdss report is given to the petitioner.although the report is not binding,the court is to accord due weight to cdss expertise.san diego county of pub.welfare superior court cal d.assuming other statutory prerequisites are met,if the court is satisfied that the interest of the child will be promoted by the adoption,the court may make and enter an order of adoption of the child by the prospective adoptive parent or parents,subd.c.
annette argues that these statutes authorize the superior court to finalize her adoption of joshua,because she has complied with the substantive and procedural prerequisites for an independent adoption.sharon contends that the adoption is not authorized,because section mandates full termination of birth parental rights in every independent adoption.
section provides the birth parents of an adopted child are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,and have no right over the child.the section does not appear in the chapter devoted to independent adoptions ch,et,but is,rather,one of the general provisions appearing in chapter of part of division of the family code.
the rule is that the adoption statutes are to be liberally construed with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice.such a construction should be given as will sustain,rather than defeat,the object they have in view.department of social welfare superior court cal d,see also adoption of barnett cal d,adoption of mcdonald cal d,in re santos cal.consistently with these principles,we previously have concluded that the legislature did not intend section nearly identical precursor to bar an adoption when the parties clearly intended to waive the operation of that statute and agreed to preserve the birth parent rights and responsibilities.marshall marshall cal.nothing in section text,context,history,or function justifies departure in this case from the established rule that rights conferred by statute may be waived unless specific statutory provisions prohibit waiver.bickel city of piedmont cal th,fn,d.
waiver of statutory rights 
in bickel city of piedmont,supra,cal th,d,bickel,we held that a party benefited by a statutory provision may waive that benefit if the statute does not prohibit waiver id.at,fn,d,the statute public benefit is merely incidental to its primary purpose id.at,d,and waiver does not seriously compromise any public purpose that the statute was intended to serve id.at,d.see also,anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.the principles underlying bickel are well established.as we have recognized for over a century,the law will not compel a man to insist upon any benefit or advantage secured to him individually.knarston manhattan life ins.cal.accordingly,a party may waive compliance with statutory conditions intended for his or her benefit,so long as the legislature has not made those conditions mandatory.murdock brooks cal,see also wells,fargo enright cal.
applying these established principles to determine whether in this case section bars application of the waiver doctrine,we must ascertain whether the statute provisions are for the benefit of the parties to an adoption petition or are instead for a public purpose,and whether there is any language in the statute prohibiting a waiver.bickel,supra,cal th at,d.
addressing the latter point first,we immediately observe that section contains no language prohibiting the parties to an independent adoption from agreeing to waive its provisions.rather,section contains a single sentence the birth parents of an adopted child are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,and have no right over the child.nor need we move beyond the statute plain language in order to discern its primary purpose.by its terms,section exists to relieve birth parents of duties towards and all responsibility for,the adopted child and to assure adoptive parents of exclusive parental control by ending birth parents right over the child from the time of the adoption.section thus affords all the parties to the ordinary adoption an incentive for concluding it.but nothing therein,or in any other statutory provision,prohibits the parties to an independent adoption from waiving the benefits of section when a birth parent intends and desires to coparent with another adult who has agreed to adopt the child and share parental responsibilities.
since section provisions are for the benefit of the parties to an adoption petition and the section contains no language prohibiting a waiver bickel,supra,cal th at,d,we conclude that section declares a legal consequence of the usual adoption,waivable by the parties thereto,rather than a mandatory prerequisite to every valid adoption.bickel,supra,at,d.
such a conclusion accords with our previous pronouncements respecting the essential elements of an adoption.the adoption laws always have made a fundamental distinction between the ordinary legal consequences of an adoption and what provisions of the law are essential and therefore mandatory.in re johnson cal.in johnson,for example,we held that civil code former section provision for the examination of a child under the age of consent by the judge before the child is adopted should not be deemed indispensable to the validity of the adoption proceeding.in re johnson,supra,at.in so holding,we noted it is necessary that there should be a substantial compliance with all of the essential requirements of the law under which the right of adoption is claimed but,in determining what provisions of the law are essential and therefore mandatory,the statute is to receive a sensible construction,and its intention is to be ascertained,not from the literal meaning of any particular word or section,but from a consideration of the entire statute,its spirit and purpose.id.at.
of course,one who claims that an act of adoption has been accomplished must show that every essential requirement of the statute has been strictly complied with estate of sharon,supra,cal.at,but sharon points to no california decision stating or even implying that termination of birth parental rights and responsibilities under section is among these essential requirements.
while california adoption statutes nowhere concisely define adoption,they do state the essential elements of a valid adoption.a fter careful consideration of the question as to what requirements are essential,the conclusion was stated in in re johnson,supra,cal,as follows the proceeding is essentially one of contract between the parties whose consent is required.it is a contract of a very solemn nature,and for this reason the law has wisely thrown around its creation certain safeguards,by requiring,not only that it shall be entered into in the presence of a judge,but also that it shall receive his sanction,which is not to be given until he has satisfied himself of these three things.that the person adopting is ten years older than the child.that all the parties whose consent is required do consent,fully and freely,to the making of such contract.that the adoption contemplated by the contract will be for the best interest of the child adopted.these requirements are there held to be jurisdictional.unless they coexist,the proceeding for adoption is insufficient,the attempted contract is invalid,the judge is without power to approve it,and there is no lawful adoption.estate of sharon,supra,cal.at,citing several cases.
thus,in current statutory terms,the essential elements of every valid adoption are a voluntary and informed parental consent to the adoption except where the parent has surrendered or has been judicially deprived of parental control a suitable adoptive parent at least years older than,or in a specified preexisting family relationship with,the child see,and a judicial determination that the interest of the child will be promoted by the adoption.when these essential elements are present,the objective of the adoption statutes to protect the interests of both the natural or legal parent s and the child through the consent and best interests requirements is not frustrated when statutory provisions like section are treated as nonmandatory.patt,second parent adoption when crossing the marital barrier is in a child best interests berkeley women,discussing former.
the court of appeal majority failed to recognize this distinction between essential elements and ordinary legal consequences,asserting that the statutes governing independent adoptions require a relinquishment of parental rights and mandate that the parental rights of the birth parent be terminated.in fact,the statutes contain no such mandates.
independent adoption means the adoption of a child in which neither the department nor an agency licensed by the department is a party to,or joins in,the adoption petition.in addition to the essential elements of all adoptions set out above,the independent adoption statutes require parental consent after notice and advisement,opportunities under specified conditions timely to revoke consent or with court approval to withdraw it,selection of the adoptive parent or parents by the birth parent or parents personally,advice to the birth parent of his or her rights by an adoption service provider or licensed agency,execution of an adoption placement agreement satisfying specified requirements on a form prescribed by cdss,administrative investigation by cdss or its delegate,an appropriate petition filed with the superior court,usually in the county in which the petitioner resides,and an appearance before the court by the prospective adoptive parents and the child.nowhere does any mandate or requirement of relinquishment of a birth parent rights and responsibilities appear.
most people who place their children with unrelated adoptive parents presumably desire to be relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,as section declares,once the adoption is final.but,as noted,section neither prohibits a birth parent and another qualified adult from jointly waiving application of the statute in order to coparent an adoptable child,nor prohibits a court under such circumstances from ordering an otherwise valid adoption.see bickel,supra,cal th at,d.
decades ago,we held that civil code former section,the predecessor statute to family code section,was no bar to second parent adoption of a was then not expressly provided for by statute.marshall marshall,supra,cal.at,marshall.we agree with the dissenting justice in the court of appeal that the considerations we treated as dispositive in marshall,which did not include the marital status of the parties,are fully present in the instant case and lead to the same result.
in marshall,the second husband of a widowed mother adopted her two minor children.when the couple later divorced,they agreed the stepfather would pay support for the two children,but that he would surrender his adoption of them and their mother would readopt them.on the mother petition and with the father consent,a decree was entered purporting to accomplish the mother readoption of her children.thereafter,the superior court entered interlocutory and final orders for child support.marshall,supra,cal.at.one year later,the father moved to modify the orders by striking the provision for child support.the superior court granted the motion on grounds that,by the time the orders issued,it had lacked jurisdiction to award the child support,because the mother readoption of the children had changed their status so that they were no longer the children of the parties to the divorce action.marshall,supra,cal.at.
we reversed,holding that the superior court had erred in its determination that the earlier child support orders were void as beyond the court jurisdiction.marshall,supra,cal.at.in reaching our conclusion,we addressed the validity and effect of the prior proceeding where the mother had purported to adopt her own children.noting that the adoption statutes then,as now,did not contain a definition of the word adoption id.at,we characterized that proceeding as one by which the adopting parent assumes a parental relationship toward the child of another id.at.reasoning that a natural mother of a child could legally adopt such child only in a case wherein her parental relationship had theretofore been severed as a matter of law ibid,we considered whether the stepfather prior adoption of the children had had the effect of legally severing the mother parental rights and responsibilities.as relevant here,we held it had not,notwithstanding the provisions of family code section predecessor,civil code,former section,that the parents of an adopted child are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the child so adopted,and have no right over it.marshall,supra,at.
in declining to construe section predecessor as having severed the mother parental rights to her children,we noted in marshall that it was plain from the record of the adoption proceedings,including the terms of the mother consent and of the adoption order,that the parties did not intend to sever the parental relationship between the mother and the children when effecting the latter adoption by the mother new spouse.marshall,supra,cal.at.
thus,we held in marshall that although no express authority therefor is to be found in the code,nevertheless a husband and wife may jointly adopt a child pursuant to the procedure therein prescribed,the result of which is to make the child,in law,the child of both spouses.marshall,supra,cal.at,citing in re williams cal.section predecessor was not,we held,intended to apply to a situation such as this,and to effect a result so plainly opposite to that which was intended by the parties.marshall,supra,at.
in marshall,we thus effectively read second parent adoption into the statutory scheme,by approving a type of second parent adoption,stepparent adoption,which at that time the adoption statutes did not expressly authorize.marshall,supra,cal.at.in so doing,we necessarily determined that relinquishment of the birth parent rights was not essential to adoption and that section predecessor was not mandatory.
contrary to the view of the court of appeal majority,our determination in marshall that the stepfather adoption had not severed the mother parental rights was essential to our conclusion that the trial court had had jurisdiction to enter the child support orders at issue and had erred in setting them aside as void.our invalidation of the trial court order vacating the support orders was based on our conclusion that the mother purported readoption of her children had been an utter nullity marshall,supra,cal.at,as,therefore,was the parties effort thereby to sever the stepfather parental relationship ibid.in order to reach that conclusion we had to determine whether or not the stepfather prior adoption of the two children had the effect of legally severing the mother parental relationship with them.id.at.it is on the answer we,that notwithstanding the provisions of civil code,section,the stepfather prior adoption of the minors had not severed the mother parental rights ibid.that annette relies.in relying on marshall pronouncement that family code section predecessor was not intended by the legislature to apply to a situation such as this,and to effect a result so plainly opposite to that which was intended by the parties marshall,supra,at,annette thus relies on part of our essential reasoning,not on dictum.see generally consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d.
marshall is factually apposite as well.just as family code section is the clear successor to civil code former section,the language and forms developed by cdss and used in this case to effect and document annette adoption of joshua are comparable to those used by the parties in marshall.in marshall,the stepfather petition for adoption recited that he was a fit person to be allowed joint custody and control of the children along with the mother,and the petition prayed for a court order that the stepfather shall jointly together with the mother be adjudged on such adoption as having the status of the natural father of said minors.marshall,supra,cal.at,italics omitted.in consenting to the adoption,the children mother stated that their stepfather would adopt the minors,my children,as his own natural children and in conjunction and jointly with me act,maintain and have the legal status of a father and jointly with me maintain the relationship of a parent to said minors herein mentioned.id.at,italics omitted.
similarly,sharon signed an adoption consent form stating her intention to retain coparental rights and responsibilities and permitting annette to assume coparental rights and responsibilities.annette signed adoption forms clearly stating her intention to accept coparental rights and responsibilities for joshua to be shared with sharon.we conclude that,just as its predecessor was not intended by the legislature to effect a result so plainly opposite to that which was intended by the parties in marshall,supra,cal.at page,section was not intended to bar annette adoption of joshua.
acknowledging that marshall supports annette claim,justice brown nevertheless chides us for read ing contemporary norms into a decision conc.dis.opn.of brown,post,d at,at see also id.at,at.in a similar vein,sharon takes the position that whatever the factual and legal parallels between marshall and this case,marshall did not consider either unmarried adopting parents or adoptions and therefore is too factually and legally different to be relevant.we disagree.although we mentioned in marshall that the adoption involved was by a husband,we said nothing to suggest we regarded the presence of marriage as bearing on our implicit treatment of section predecessor as waivable and not mandatory.see marshall,supra,cal.at.
california adoption statutes have always permitted adoption without regard to the marital status of prospective adoptive parents.section provides that a n unmarried minor may be adopted by an adult,and an adult may adopt a child so long as he or she is at least years older than the child,subd.a.section defines prospective adoptive parent as a person who has filed or intends to file a petition to adopt a child who has been or who is to be placed in the person physical care none of these statutes mentions marital status.under these circumstances,no justification appears for treating section differently in this case than we did its predecessor in marshall 
in the years since marshall was decided,the legislature has reorganized and reenacted the adoption statutes and amended them many times,inter alia,to acknowledge stepparent adoptions and define them as an adoption of a child by a stepparent where one birth parent retains custody and control of the child.in doing so,the legislature has neither repudiated marshall nor expressly excepted stepparent adoptions from application of section.there is a strong presumption that when the legislature reenacts a statute which has been judicially construed it adopts the construction placed on the statute by the courts.wilkoff superior court cal d.that is because,w hen the legislature amends a statute without changing those portions that have previously been construed by the courts,the legislature is presumed to have known of and to have acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.people atkins cal th,d.moreover,when comprehensively reorganizing the adoption statutes in,the legislature replaced the version of section predecessor that we construed in marshall,civil code former section,with another version containing immaterial changes,former.in so doing,the legislature expressly stated that it did not intend thereby to lose legislative history or judicial precedent including necessarily marshall applicable to statutory provisions replaced by this act,former,subd.e see generally stats,ch.
thus,for more than years,the legislature has acquiesced in marshall treatment of section predecessor,implying that an adoption court may order an otherwise valid adoption in which the parties plainly have stated their intention to waive section benefits.
we long have recognized that if the legislature enacting a specific adoption provision did not intend compliance with that provision to be jurisdictional,strict and literal adherence to the letter and form of that statute is not required to effect a valid adoption.estate of johnson,supra,cal.at,see also adoption of baby girl th,d.as noted,section contains no mandate or requirement of termination.rather,the statute simply describes how birth parents ordinarily are relieved of all parental rights and duties after an adoption.because the legislature presumptively was aware of marshall treatment of civil code former section as waivable,its retention of parallel language in family code section requires that we construe the present provision in conformity with the established judicial interpretation.malcolm superior court cal d.
on their face,moreover,the adoption statutes reveal the legislature understanding that while ordinarily t he birth parents of an adopted child are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,and have no right over the child,adoptions based on modified application of that principle,wherein one birth parent retains custody and control of the child,referencing stepparent adoptions,may exist.see also nancy michele d,fn.judicially recognizing the same with respect to second parent adoptions.sharon acknowledges that for us to construe section literally as a general provision mandating termination of all birth parents rights in every adoption would be contrary to the stepparent adoption provisions.but she contends that,nevertheless,section must apply to all chapter independent adoptions,regardless of the parties intent.
certainly the stepparent adoption provisions contain no such suggestion.those statutes neither expressly nor impliedly bar an independent adoption by a second parent that preserves the child legal relationship with one birth parent.in fact,the stepparent adoption provisions make no mention of independent adoption.contrary to justice brown assertions see conc.dis.opn.of brown,post,d at,at,that the legislature,when defining stepparent adoption,noted that one birth parent retains custody and control of the child neither logically nor historically implies an intent to confine to the stepparent context our implication in marshall,supra,cal,that a birth parent consenting to an adoption may waive termination of her parental rights.the scant legislative history available suggests that the legislature,when originally adopting that language,sought only to relieve cdss predecessor of certain administrative burdens in adoptions that were being conducted by stepparents moreover,any suggestion that the statutory availability of stepparent adoption implies legislative disapproval of other kinds of second parent adoption is belied by the possibility of second parent adoptions being effected through agency procedures.see et 
administrative construction and practice 
established administrative construction and practice to which we owe substantial deference buttress the aforestated legal arguments for reversal.while taking ultimate responsibility for the construction of a statute,we accord great weight and respect to the administrative construction thereof.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,see also styne stevens cal th,d,administrator interpretation of a statute he is charged with enforcing deserves substantial weight.cdss has adopted the view that a petition or an application for a limited consent or limited relinquishment adoption,in which a birth parent,or adoption parent,simultaneously retains parental rights and consents to the adoption,agrees to the adoption,or designates the adoptive parent of his or her child to be an unrelated adult,is to be reviewed on its merits pursuant to the california family code.cdss,all county letter,see ante,fn.
deference to administrative interpretations always is situational and depends on a complex of factors yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d,but where the agency has special expertise and its decision is carefully considered by senior agency officials,that decision is entitled to correspondingly greater weight id.at,d.cdss indisputably is familiar with the independent adoption provisions as well as with the entire scheme of the adoption law it enforces,and its interpretation of section comes from authoritative legal and policymaking levels of the agency.accordingly,this is a case in which the administrative construction would appear to be entitled to great weight.in any event,as it is not clearly erroneous,we owe substantial deference to cdss views of section as waivable and of second parent adoptions as valid under the independent adoption laws.kelly methodist hospital of california cal th,d.
public policy 
several important considerations of public policy also buttress our conclusion.precisely how many second parent adoptions have been granted in california over the years is difficult to know,partly because adoption proceedings are generally confidential see et,but published materials suggest they number to that the second parent adoption procedures promulgated by cdss under the independent adoption statutes have received such widespread acceptance and have been so extensively used speaks not only to their utility in the modern context,but to their effectiveness in promoting the fundamental purposes that adoption has always served.
fundamental purposes of adoption 
the basic purpose of an adoption is the welfare,protection and betterment of the child,and adoption courts ultimately must rule on that basis.reeves bailey d.while the child best interest is an elusive guideline that belies rigid definition,obviously overall i ts purpose is to maximize a child opportunity to develop into a stable,adult.adoption of michelle d.that there are a variety of costs if a legal relationship with a second parent is not that can be both financial and emotional is well recognized.doskow,the second parent trap,supra,juv.at.second parent adoption can secure the salutary incidents of legally recognized parentage for a child of a nonbiological parent who otherwise must remain a legal stranger.
second parent adoptions also benefit children by providing a clear legal framework for resolving any disputes that may arise over custody and visitation.our explicitly recognizing their validity will prevent uncertainty,conflict,and protracted litigation in this area,all of which plainly are harmful to children caught in the middle unmarried couples who have brought a child into the world with the expectation that they will raise it together,and who have jointly petitioned for adoption,should be on notice that,if they separate,the same rules concerning custody and visitation as apply to all other parents will apply to them.
in addition,second parent adoptions offer the possibility of obtaining the security and advantages of two parents for some of california neediest children,including many with special needs for whom a second parent adoption may constitute the closest conceivable counterpart of the relationship of parent and child available.adoption of barnett,supra,cal d at.the same is true as regards thousands of others in foster care for whom it is state policy to seek permanent adoptive placement 
we need not review here the nonlegal benefits of adoption for children,parents,and society as a whole,nor need we assume,either as a policy or factual matter,that adoption is necessarily in a child best interest adoption of kelsey cal th,d,in every case.we may observe,however,that neither the court of appeal nor any party or amici curiae has suggested that,where an adoption would be in a child best interests,second parent adoption differs categorically from other types of independent adoption in its ability to achieve adoption practical ends.
amicus curiae proposition legal defense and education fund suggests that to affirm the statutory permissibility of second parent adoption would offend the state strong public interest in promoting marriage.we disagree.this case involves independent adoption,a procedure that is not limited to married persons.unmarried persons always have been permitted to adopt children.see ann,ed,haymond burch,commrs.annotators any adult may adopt any eligible child,same.more generally,justice brown argues at some length that our decision today trivializes family bonds.conc.dis.opn.of brown,post,d at,at see generally id.at,at.to the contrary,our decision encourages and strengthens family bonds.as justice scalia has noted,the family unit accorded traditional respect in our society includes the household of unmarried parents and their children.michael gerald,fn,d.
justice brown purports to discern a legislative insistence that the adopting parent have a legal relationship with the birth parent conc.dis.opn.of brown,post,d at,at,but she cites no authority for the existence of such a requirement,and we know of none.established legislative policy bases parent and child rights on the existence of a parent and child relationship rather than on the marital status of the parents.johnson calvert cal th,d,discussing uniform parentage act see also the parent and child relationship extends equally to every child and to every parent,regardless of the marital status of the parents.
the court of appeal recited that in and,the legislature considered,but did not adopt,a bill that would have provided that two unmarried adults may adopt a child,thereby implying that the legislature had considered and rejected the possibility of such adoptions.see assem.bill reg.sess,hereafter assembly bill.not so.although the court of appeal remark correctly describes assembly bill,a bill introduced in that session,it misleads to the extent it invites readers to assume the legislature inaction on the bill reflected a rejection of its substance.
assembly bill dealt with adoption by single persons,as well as by unmarried couples,and was promulgated to nullify a proposed cdss regulation that the bill proponents perceived would inhibit both.see assem.bill,subd.c excluding potential adoptive parents on the basis of marital status is not in the best interests of the children who are eligible for adoption.the proposed regulation giving rise to assembly bill would have barred agency recommendation of any adoption by an unmarried person or persons.see notice of proposed changes in regulations of the california department of social services cdss cal.reg.notice register,proposing adoption of,tit.promulgated in response,assembly bill would have added to the family code a new section explicitly restating what is already implicitly provided in sections and,that any otherwise qualified single adult or two adults,married or not,may adopt a child.see assem.bill.after the proposed regulation was withdrawn,the responsive bill,assembly bill,which had passed the assembly committee on the judiciary by a vote of,died in the inactive file.assem.bill,assem.final hist.reg.sess.

in sum,adherence to the court of appeal construction of section as precluding second parent adoption would unnecessarily eliminate access to a duly promulgated,adoption process that has become routine in california eskridge hunter,sexuality,gender and the law and that is fully consistent with the main purpose of the adoption statutes to promote the welfare of children by the legal recognition and regulation of the consummation of the closest conceivable counterpart of the relationship of parent and child department of social welfare superior court,supra,cal d at.
settled familial expectations 
the court of appeal implication that california courts lack jurisdiction to grant second parent adoptions potentially called into question the legitimacy of existing families heretofore created in this state through established administrative and judicial procedures.such families are of many types.
although second parent adoptions may involve children conceived,as in this case,by artificial insemination others involve children placed directly by their birth parents or private agencies with two unmarried adoptive parents.see generally hollinger,adoption law and practice placing children for adoption,through.others involve dependent children,often with special needs because of prior abuse or neglect,who were placed by public agencies with an unmarried parent whose partner later became a second adoptive parent.still others are kinship adoptions,in which a grandparent or other relative became a second legal parent of a child whose very young mother was unable to raise the child on her own.such adoptions also have involved children born in other countries and adopted either in their country of origin or in california by an unmarried adult whose partner later became a second adoptive parent.hollinger,adoption law and practice,supra,through.established practice in california thus has created settled expectations among many different types of adoptive families affirmance would unnecessarily risk disturbing these.
affirmance not only would cast a shadow of uncertainty over the legal relationships between thousands of children and their adoptive parents contrary to the clearly stated intention of all interested parties,but potentially could prompt some adoptive parents to disclaim their established responsibilities.indeed,as the court of appeal dissenter noted,perpetuating the court of appeal opinion would invite attempts to nullify completed second party adoptions in myriad species of litigation including disputes,inheritance contests and withdrawals of entitlements to previously available health and pension benefits,both governmental and private.the ultimate financial and emotional losers will be children who are the intended beneficiaries of the adoption laws.
sharon errs in asserting that,even if we were to affirm,persons who previously had completed a second parent adoption would have remedies such as compliance with the domestic partner registration provisions et if they wish to ratify the earlier proceeding.domestic partner registration constitutes no such panacea.with an exception for some seniors,california domestic partner registry is open only to couples,and not to heterosexuals,subd.b.
registered domestic partners,moreover,must have a common residence,subd.b,thus excluding qualified adoptive parents who might live apart for reasons having no bearing on whether an adoption is in a particular child interest.similarly,blood relatives can not register,and therefore can not adopt,as domestic partners,subd.b,even though many modern adoptions are kinship adoptions.see hollinger,adoption law and practice,supra,placing children for adoption,through.and families that have moved out of state,or where one adoptive parent has died,will not be able to seek ratification as domestic partners even for parents who are legally qualified to register as domestic partners,undertaking a would pose financial hardship and painful legal uncertainty no parent should have to face these kinds of choices,and no child should be placed in this kind of needless jeopardy.
nothing on the face of the domestic partnership provisions,or in their history as revealed in the record,states or implies a legislative intent to forbid,repeal,or disapprove second parent adoption or cdss forms and procedures facilitating such.thus,contrary to justice brown assertion,the legislature conferring on domestic partners the right to adopt a child of his or her partner as a stepparent rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added,far from confirm ing its understanding that second parent adoption was not available conc.dis.opn.of brown,post,d at,at,simply streamlines the adoption process for a subset of those who already were accessing second parent procedures,much as occurred in when the legislature streamlined stepparent adoption itself.see ante,fn.domestic partner registration does not broadly secure for california children the benefits of the availability of second parent adoption,nor does it eliminate the uncertainty the court of appeal decision created for existing second parent adoptees and their parents.
ii.constitutional considerations 
sharon,in opposing review,specified two additional questions whether annette adoption of joshua would violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers and whether the adoption would violate sharon due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.
separation of powers 
in promulgating forms and procedures to facilitate second parent adoptions,sharon asserts,agency of the executive branch of our state improperly engaging in the equivalent of legislation.she cites three court of appeal cases discussing child visitation,apparently for the proposition that courts should leave innovation in adoption policy to the legislature.see west superior court lockrem th,d west nancy michele,supra,d.nancy curiale reagan d.curiale.with that proposition generally,we do not disagree.but,as discussed,second parent adoption is the status quo in california,not an innovation.
the cases sharon cites are not apposite.they all address the jurisdiction of california courts to award visitation to a de facto parent none addresses the validity of an adoption annette is not seeking custody of joshua on the basis of her past relationship as caregiver to him,nor on any other equitable theory.rather,she seeks finalization of an independent adoption,with at least partial custody as one of its incidents.in passing on the validity of these adoption proceedings,we have no occasion to address de facto parenthood.
in any event,in suggesting that de facto parenthood involves policy questions best left to the legislature see west,supra,th at,d nancy,supra,d at.curiale,supra,d at,the courts in the cases sharon cites did not hold that any judicial action in this area would be unconstitutional.and to the extent each relied partly on a de facto parent failure to adopt the child involved,they impliedly recognized the viability of second parent adoption under existing statutes.see west,supra,at,d nancy,supra,at.curiale,supra,at.see also in re guardianship of th,d.the court of appeal in nancy,citing our marshall decision for support,expressly found nothing in these provisions that would preclude a child from being jointly adopted by someone of the same sex as the natural parent.nancy,supra,at,fn.
sharon concedes the legislature authorized cdss to promulgate for use in the independent adoption process a form adoption placement agreement,subd.b that includes a consent to the adoption,subd.c,but urges that cdss has no power by regulation or otherwise to add to or detract from the rules for adoption prescribed in the civil now family code adoption of mcdonald,supra,cal d at.as we have explained at length,however,in interpreting the independent adoption statutes to permit parental consent to a second parent adoption where the procedural prerequisites thereto and the essential elements of a valid adoption are satisfied,cdss does not add to or detract from those statutes but,rather,construes them reasonably.
due process 
sharon in her brief on the merits expressly refrains from arguing that annette adoption of joshua would violate her due process rights,but in opposing review she suggested this case presents that question.she cited in support troxel granville,d troxel,wherein a plurality of the high court held that a washington state statute providing that any person may at any time petition for visitation of an unrelated child,and that the court may order such visitation when it is in the child best interest,violated the birth mother substantive due process rights.
troxel is readily distinguishable.most fundamentally,troxel was a visitation case,whereas this case involves an adoption,and in california the statutes and procedures governing adoption are different from those governing visitation.compare generally with.the washington statute at issue in troxel provided specifically that a ny person may petition the court for visitation rights at any time and that courts may award visitation whenever visitation may serve the best interest of the child,italics added.calling this language breathtakingly broad,the high court noted it effectively permits any third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parent children to review.troxel,supra,at.california law provides for no such freestanding visitation proceeding.nor is annette just any person,she is a prospective adoptive mother.
the statute at issue in troxel did not require parental consent or a finding of parental unfitness,and it was that fact,primarily,that led to its invalidation.see troxel,supra,at.while sharon now wishes to terminate these proceedings,she does not deny that she originally joined annette in invoking the superior court adoption jurisdiction or that she failed to revoke her consent within the prescribed statutory period,subd.b.
in short,troxel neither involved nor discussed adoption.nor,as discussed,are the california adoption statutes subject to the constitutional criticisms the high court leveled there against washington visitation statute.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that neither due process nor the doctrine of separation of powers constitutes a bar to annette adoption of joshua.consequently,section does not prevent the superior court from proceeding to a best interests analysis of annette petition.
iii.fraud and duress 
as noted at the outset of this opinion,in requesting approval to withdraw her consent to the adoption,sharon,in addition to the statutory and constitutional objections reviewed above,argued to the trial court that she had signed the adoption consent form under fraud,undue influence,and duress and that the original adoption attorney representing her and annette had failed to obtain a signed waiver regarding conflict of interest.in her writ petition,sharon reprised these arguments.
with a few statutory exceptions not relevant here,a legal parent valid consent is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an adoption,regardless of the child interests.see matter of cozza cal,disapproved on another ground in adoption of barnett,supra,cal d at.where a parent consent to adoption is obtained through fraud or duress,the consent is not voluntary and the jurisdictional prerequisite to a valid adoption is lacking.adoption of kay d.see also in re yoder cal,order of adoption may be set aside for fraud,mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.since the court of appeal agreed with sharon statutory argument,it had no occasion to address the superior court implicit rejection of her contentions respecting fraud and undue influence.we shall remand the cause to permit the court of appeal to address this issue in the first instance.see navellier sletten cal th,d,lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hosp.cal th,d.
subject to the court of appeal resolution of this remaining issue,the superior court on remand may validly exercise its discretion to order annette adoption of joshua under the independent adoption statutes if it concludes that the administrative procedures,including a section waiver,duly established thereunder have been complied with and that all statutory prerequisites are satisfied.sharon retains the right to oppose finalization of the adoption on the ground that new circumstances make it contrary to joshua interests.see county of los angeles superior court d.we take no position on such outstanding factual questions,and nothing in this opinion should be taken by the court below on remand to indicate a view as to whether adoption is in joshua interests.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the majority principal recognizes second parent adoptions as valid in unremarkable.at least other jurisdictions have already done so krause meyer,what family for the century am.comp,fn,including the highest courts of three sister states,ante,d at,fn,at,fn,citing adoption of tammy,matter of jacob,adoption of.i join fully in that holding.
i part company with the majority,however,over its interpretation of family code section section,which states that from the time of adoption,the birth parent shall have no right over the child.i would hold that the parties to an adoption may waive section in the limited circumstance of a second parent adoption.this is sufficient to resolve the case.unfortunately,the majority does not stop there but makes the additional holding that section is a nonmandatory consequence of an adoption and can be waived whenever the parties agree to do so,ante,d at,at.under the majority approach,section termination of the birth parents rights in any type of merely those that seek to add a second be waived by mutual agreement,thus permitting a child to have three or more parents.
this makes new law,not only here but nationwide.other those states that have already validated second parent not taken this step,adoption of,supra,at,fn.declining to characterize a vermont statute as directory rather than mandatory see also in interest of angel lace,construing a similar wisconsin statute as mandatory.i find this authority persuasive.see singer,statutes and statutory construction ed,the manner in which similar statutes in other states have been construed may be an element bearing upon this question.unlike the majority,but in accordance with our sister states,i would hold that our statute can be waived in the limited circumstance of a second parent adoption.just as it has not been necessary to declare similar provisions to be directory to affirm second parent adoptions in other states,it is not necessary to make new law to uphold second parent adoptions in california.
i can not fathom why the majority has deliberately chosen a rationale that is unnecessary to the disposition of this case and that has been avoided by other jurisdictions,but i do understand and fear the effect of the majority additional holding to put at risk fundamental understandings of family and parentage.tomorrow,the question may be how many legal parents may a child have in california and the answer,according to the majority opinion,will be as many parents as a single family court judge,in the exercise of the broadest discretion in our law,deems to be in the child best interest.
as stated,i do concur in the judgment.but for the reasons that follow,i will not join the majority opinion.
if it is true that you ca get where you going if you do know where you been,then it should come as no surprise the majority finds itself in uncharted territory.the majority claims without any citation that e stablished,ante,d at,at administrative interpretation and practice by the california department of social services cdss supports its affirmance of second parent adoptions.it is quite simple,as detailed below,to verify cdss interpretation and practice during the relevant period.unless established is redefined to mean very recent,the historical claim made by the majority can not be defended.
the first petitions for second parent adoptions were filed in the early.between that time and,with only a brief exception,cdss maintained a policy of opposing any petition for adoption in which a child is to be adopted into an unmarried couple.doskow,the second parent trap parenting for couples in a brave new world juv.the lone exception to this policy lasted only a few months and was promptly reversed when pete wilson became aware of the change and ordered cdss to return to its original policy.id.at fn,citing cdss,all county letter,rescinding cdss,all county letter.the original policy then continued in force until november.doskow,supra,juv.at see cdss,all county letter.thus,contrary to the assertion in the majority opinion,cdss had an established and administrative interpretation and practice of opposing second parent on its interpretation of section lasted for well over a decade.doskow,supra,juv.at see also notice of proposed changes in regulations of the cdss,cal.reg.notice register,proposing adoption of,tit.moreover,that policy remained in effect until the year before this litigation commenced.accordingly,any claim that cdss policy has for some time,ante,d at,at supported second parent adoption is demonstrably incorrect.
even if the new cdss policy had not been of such recent vintage,the majority ought to have steered clear of substantial reliance on it.the majority correctly recites that deference to administrative interpretation is situational and depends on a complex of factors,ante,d at,at,quoting yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.but the majority then fails to apply those factors.where an agency like cdss is merely construing a controlling statute,the weight of the agency interpretation will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted,quoting skidmore swift.
analysis of the appropriate factors here would counsel caution,not a kowtow to the agency recent change in policy.cdss consideration of the applicable statutes was hardly thorough the all county letter announcing the policy reversal is less than one page long and nowhere indicates it was issued in accordance with the administrative procedure act.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.the validity of cdss reasoning is impossible to evaluate the all county letter simply announces a reversal in policy,without providing any supporting reasons,and rejects the prior policy based solely on the fact that it was an underground regulation inconsistent with the administrative procedure act.cdss,all county letter,supra.this indicates merely that the prior rule was promulgated in an impermissible manner,not that it misinterpreted the statute,kings rehabilitation center,premo th,d underground regulations are rules which only the government knows about.the new cdss policy plainly is not consistent the all county letter abandons policy and had been in effect less than months prior to the institution of this action.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,agency interpretation of statute for almost years is.nor is cdss policy reversal reasonably contemporaneous with the adoption of the relevant statutes.kelly methodist hospital of california cal th,fn,d.
in short,none of these factors supports the majority conclusion that the policy reversal would appear to be entitled to great weight and merits substantial deference,ante,d at,at.accordingly,i would not make such a claim.the significance of the policy reversal,in my view,is that we are no longer bound to defer to cdss established and policy of disapproving second parent adoptions.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,a vacillating position is entitled to no deference.we need not and ought not torture settled administrative law to go further than that.
as stated above,i conclude that in the limited circumstance of a second parent adoption,the parties may waive section requirement that the parental rights of the birth parent be terminated.unlike the majority,however,i do not rest my conclusion that section can be waived in this limited circumstance on the theory that it is merely directory.
the designation of a statute as either mandatory or directory must be made with reference to the statute purpose.people mcgee cal d.designating section as nonmandatory or directory means that the termination of parental rights at the time of adoption is immaterial and involves only a matter of convenience.francis superior court cal d.designating section as directory also means that it may be waived at the will of the parties.in re johnson cal.this,of course,is the view advanced by the majority,which states that the termination of parental rights in section is not for a public purpose but instead is for the benefit of the parties to an adoption petition and thus is waivable by the parties thereto,ante,d at,at.this analysis is contrary to our precedents,contrary to legislative policy,and has predictably unfortunate consequences.
now that section has been classified as directory,the parties to every type of adoption are free to disclaim its effect whenever they choose.any number of consenting adults may thus agree to adopt the same child,so long as a single family court judge finds the adoption is in the child interest.see,ante,d at,at.nothing in the family code would be left to prevent a child from having three or four or a village worth of legal parents,so long as all the parents agree to waive section and a sole family court judge sometime,somewhere,finds the adoption to be in the child interest.in re johnson,supra,cal.at,a directory provision is to be complied with or not in the discretion of the judge.inasmuch as there is n o higher discretion than that vested in a trial court resolving a petition of adoption matter of bewley cal,the majority all but guarantees new and even bizarre family structures.
the majority discounts this possibility as n onsense,claiming that w hile cdss has for some time treated section as waivable,such scenarios have not materialized,ante,d at,at.i do not find this comforting.nothing in cdss policy states that section is nonmandatory.rather,the new cdss policy,like this separate opinion,permits section to be waived only in the limited circumstance of a second parent adoption.in any event,it is far too soon to gauge the effect of the recent reversal in cdss policy,which as justice brown points out postdates the adoption agreement in this case.conc.and dis.opn.of brown,post,at,fn,at,fn.the regime the majority announces today has not yet been tested here.
however,it does not take much imagination to predict what that regime will look like.commentators have recognized that a child may end up with any number of parents when family structure becomes a matter of private ordering.king,solomon revisited assigning parenthood in the context of collaborative reproduction ucla women,king unlike the nuclear family model,families of consent can include one,two,or more parents.the available empirical evidence supports this prediction.an alaska superior court finding that a similar statute was directory was followed quickly by an adoption in which neither natural parent severed ties with the child.accordingly,the child now has three legal parents.patt,second parent adoption when crossing the marital barrier is in a child best interests berkeley women,italics added patt.moreover,at oral argument,annette counsel informed us that superior courts in this state have already allowed a child to have more than two legal parents,apparently based on counsel theory that section is merely directory 
since i am not a legislator,my own views as to whether children should be allowed to have three or more legal parents are not relevant here,although it does appear that such arrangements are highly problematic.see shapo,matters of life and death inheritance consequences of reproductive technologies hofstra,the facts of michael gerald,d highlight the practical difficulties of a divided authority and a disrupted family unit that may result from more than two legal parents.the existence of multiple parents would also make more difficult the resolution of disputes that may arise over custody and visitation,as well as conflicts over other parental rights and responsibilities,ante,d at,at.in any event,the important the one the majority deliberately that e xisting law recognizes a maximum of two parents per child.king,supra,ucla women at.indeed,no commentator of whom i am aware shares the majority agnosticism as to whether there exists an overriding legislative policy limiting a child to two parents,ante,at,fn,at,fn.liebler,are you my parent are you my child the role of genetics and race in defining relationships after reproductive technological mistakes depaul health care,i suggest that the statutory requirements that children can have only two parents be changed sheldon,surrogate mothers,gestational carriers,and a pragmatic adaptation of the uniform parentage act of me,fn.innumerable state and federal statutes are premised on a maximum of two parents katz,ghost mothers human egg donation and the legacy of the past albany,the premises underlying the legal definitions of parent and nonparent have been that a child should have no more than two legal parents see also michael gerald,supra,at.plur.opn.of scalia,california law,like nature itself,makes no provision for dual fatherhood.moreover,numerous provisions of the family the sections cited by the the legislature intended to limit a child to no more than two legal parents.in fact,this intent is made manifest in section itself,which terminates the birth parents rights from the time of the adoption.since a child can have no more than two birth parents see,subd.b see also johnson calvert cal th,fn,d,section ensures that the child does not acquire more than two through the process of adoption.the majority unique unwillingness to acknowledge section role in limiting a child to no more than two parents defies common sense 
the majority contention that section does not speak to parental numerosity,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.is not only very hard to understand,but is also flatly contrary to our precedents.in estate of jobson cal,we construed the predecessor to section in a situation where the biological father sought a partial distribution of his decedent son estate.the decedent,however,had been adopted by his maternal grandparents years before.in rejecting the biological father claim,we explained the operation of the statute these various rulings seem to establish the doctrine that the effect of an adoption under our civil code is to establish the legal relation of parent and child,with all the incidents and consequences of that relation,between the adopting parent and the adopted child.this necessarily implies that the natural relationship between the child and its parents by blood is superseded once we have reached the conclusion that the effect of an adoption under the code is to substitute the adopting parent for the parent by blood,we must give to that conclusion its logical results.from the time of the adoption,the adopting parent is,so far as concerns all legal rights and duties flowing from the relation of parent and child,the parent of the adopted child.from the same moment,the parent by blood ceases to be,in a legal sense,the parent.his place has been taken by the adopting parent.estate of jobson,supra,cal.at,italics added.
i read estate of jobson as confirming the pivotal role of section predecessor in limiting the number of legal parents a child may acquire through an adoption.and i do not think mine is an idiosyncratic reading.those quoted by the majority recognized that section protects the child from the burden of owing duties and obligations to two families.patt,supra,berkeley women at.thus,by gratuitously holding that section is nonmandatory,the majority guts that protection,to the detriment of children generally.
the majority claims to agree that courts should leave innovation in adoption policy to the legislature,ante,d at,at.but the claim rings hollow by classifying section as directory,this court has usurped the legislature power to limit a child to no more than two parents and has bestowed it instead on an individual family court judge,who may assign a child as many legal parents as the lone judge deems in the child best interest.in my view,that is a breathtaking innovation in adoption policy.a change of this scope should be decided only by the legislature or the people by initiative.williams north carolina.
to the extent the majority believes itself compelled to classify section as directory in order to authorize second parent adoptions in california,it is mistaken.our case the same case law the majority purports to allow the parties to an adoption to waive the effect of section,as long as the waiver did not seriously compromise the provision public purpose.second parent adoptions,by definition,pose no threat to the legislative policy limiting a child to no more than two legal parents.hence,under our existing case law,it is enough to say that section does not bar second parent adoptions generally or this proposed adoption in particular.
we begin with our rules for construing the family code.although the law of adoption is wholly statutory estate of sharon cal,t he rule is that the adoption statutes are to be liberally construed with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice.such a construction should be given as will sustain,rather than defeat,the object they have in view.department of social welfare superior court cal d.the main purpose of adoption statutes is the promotion of the welfare of children by the legal recognition and regulation of the consummation of the closest conceivable counterpart of the relationship of parent and child.adoption of barnett cal d.
a second parent adoption promotes the welfare of children by formalizing in law a relationship that already exists in fact between the child and the prospective parent.moreover,it does so without compromising the public purpose,set forth in section,of limiting a child to no more than two parents.therefore,in this limited circumstance,the parties should be permitted to waive the requirements of section and avoid the termination of the birth parent rights.
there is ample precedent for permitting a limited waiver of statutes that serve important public purposes.after all,this is the analytical model we employed in cowan superior court cal th,d,cowan.this is also the analysis we approved in bickel city of piedmont cal th,d,bickel.and,this is the analysis we invoked most recently county of riverside superior court cal th,d,county of riverside.none of these cases even uttered the words mandatory or directory.
in cowan,we held that a criminal defendant under certain circumstances may waive the benefit of a statute of limitations to a lesser offense than that charged,even though the statute existed partly to achieve certain public benefits.cowan,supra,cal th at,d,bickel,supra,cal th at,d.we described the operative waiver as one that is knowing,intelligent,and voluntary is made for the defendant benefit after consultation with counsel and does not handicap the defense or contravene any other public policy reasons motivating the enactment of the statutes.cowan,supra,cal th at,d.
similarly,in bickel,we observed that developers could waive the benefits of the permit streamlining act if the administrative record shows that the applicant has made a knowing,intelligent,and voluntary waiver in circumstances where the applicant might reasonably anticipate some benefit or advantage from the waiver,and if the waiver does not seriously compromise any public purpose that the act time limits were intended to serve.bickel,supra,cal th at,d.
finally,in county of riverside,we upheld a limited waiver by a probationary deputy sheriff of the public safety officers procedural bill of rights is yet another law established for a public reason.county of riverside,supra,cal th at,d.this waiver,once again,was limited to the circumstance where enforcement of the waiver would not particularly undermine the public purpose of the act.id.at,d.
unlike the majority,i would find it sufficient to apply cowan,bickel,and county of riverside here and permit the parties to a second parent adoption to knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waive the termination of parental rights otherwise required by section,inasmuch as the waiver would not contravene,compromise,or undermine the statute public purpose.conditioning,auburn union school dist.th,d strict compliance with mandatory provision is unnecessary where every reasonable objective of the statute has been satisfied.
construing section in this manner is not only consistent with our canons of construction generally,it is also consistent with our precedents in the area of adoption law.in marshall marshall cal,which nowhere mentions the terms directory or mandatory,we permitted the parties to waive the predecessor to family code section in an analogous circumstance.we held that a stepfather adoption of his wife children did not terminate her parental relationship with the children,notwithstanding the provisions of civil code former section,on the ground that the parties to that adoption did not intend thereby to sever the parental relationship between the mother and the children.marshall,supra,at.but,rather than make the provision waivable in all circumstances,we merely recognized a limited waiver to permit a husband and wife to jointly adopt a child pursuant to the procedure therein prescribed,the result of which is to make the child,in law,the child of both spouses.id.at.had marshall intended to make the provision directory,it would not have been necessary to limit our holding,as we did repeatedly,to the circumstances of this case id.at,and a situation such as this id.at.
in my view,marshall construction of civil code former section was grounded on the circumstance that the stepparent adoption did not contravene,compromise,or undermine that provision public purpose,which we had discussed previously in estate of jobson,supra,cal.marshall thus supports the validity of second parent adoptions involving unmarried persons,which similarly do not undermine section public purpose.a fair reading of marshall refutes the notion that we have ever deemed civil code former section its be directory.
the majority remaining justifications for classifying section as directory are similarly without merit.
the majority appears to reason that because section is not jurisdictional,it can not be classified as mandatory,ante,d at,at.the majority has made a common mistake.a typical misuse of the term jurisdictional is to treat it as synonymous with mandatory.witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.but for the legislature to declare that a section is mandatory does not necessarily mean that a failure to comply with its provisions causes a loss of jurisdiction to make any decision whatever.liberty mut.ins.acc.com.d.hence,the fact that section is not jurisdictional does not shed light on whether it is nonetheless mandatory.county of santa clara superior court cal d,fn.
likewise,it is irrelevant that compliance with section is not an essential element of every valid adoption,ante,d at,at.section,of course,is not even intended to apply to every valid adoption.for example,section would not apply where the birth parents are deceased or have otherwise had their rights terminated,and does not apply at all in agency adoptions.see,et that section does not apply in some circumstances,though,has no bearing on whether it is mandatory in the circumstances in which it does apply.not surprisingly,the majority offers no authority to the contrary.
the majority also lacks support for its artificial distinction between a mandatory prerequisite to an adoption,ante,d at,at and a legal consequence.id.at,at.in particular,nothing in in re johnson,which addressed the validity of an adoption where the minor child was not examined by the judge under civil code former section,supports the claim that the adoption laws always have made a fundamental distinction between the ordinary legal consequences of an adoption and what provisions of the law are essential and therefore mandatory,ante,at,at,quoting in re johnson,supra,cal.at.consequences,like prerequisites,can be mandatory,west shield investigations security consultants superior court th,d mandatory consequences of emancipation.in fact,much of law involves attaching mandatory consequences to a particular constellation of facts.that section may describe a consequence rather than an element of an adoption thus has no bearing on whether it is mandatory.
in sum,nothing in law or policy justifies the majority evisceration of the important public purpose underlying section,the legislative declaration and case authority that a child needs no more than two legal parents.
second parent adoptions by unmarried persons are consistent with california law.i would apply that settled law to decide this case.it is disappointing that,in reaching the same result,the majority has instead upset fundamental legislative policy concerning family structure,substantially altered administrative law concerning deference to executive agencies,and rendered unrecognizable our own case law concerning the distinction between statutory provisions that are mandatory and those that are directory.i can therefore join only in the judgment.
this case raises questions concerning the past,present and future of california adoption law.regarding the past,i agree that we should not disturb settled familial relationships.regarding the present,annette may deserve partial custody based on estoppel.the most important question,however,is whether the california department of social services ought to continue authorizing these second parent adoptions in the thousands of cases that will arise in the future.the legislature has heretofore required a legal relationship between the birth and second parent,and i would defer to this rule and bar second parent adoptions that violate the statutory scheme.
i.the legislature has precluded second parent adoptions except in limited circumstances 
this case turns on whether we deem family code section directory or mandatory.the statute provides t he birth parents of an adopted child are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,and have no right over the child.ibid.as a general rule,adoption extinguishes the rights of the natural parents forever,although stepparenthood provides a narrow exception to this rule.estate of cleveland th,fn,d.this norm reflects the imperative that there should not be any ambiguity about who is a child real parent.t he effect of an adoption is to establish the legal relation of parent and child,with all the incidents and consequences of that relation,between the adopting parent and the adopted child.this necessarily implies that the natural relationship between the child and its parents by blood is superseded.the duties of a child can not be owed to two fathers at the same time.estate of jobson cal,italics added jobson.the majority asserts the legislature has merely described,rather than prescribed,this transfer of parental authority and responsibility,which is thus merely one option for the birth and adopting parents involved.twice in the past decade,however,the legislature has indicated otherwise.
the logical starting point for construing section is section,which concerns the adoption of an adult person rather than a child.the text is nearly identical t he birth parents of a person adopted are,from the time of the adoption,relieved of all parental duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted person,and have no right over the adopted person,subd.a.in,the legislature added subdivision b to section,which provides,where an adult is adopted by the spouse of a birth parent,the parental rights and responsibilities of that birth parent are not affected by the adoption.stats,ch.if,as the majority claims,there is no statutory restriction on second parent adoptions,subdivision b is superfluous.
but the legislature perceived no superfluity.on the contrary,t he purpose of this bill is to create an exception to the automatic severance of relationships.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.the senate judiciary committee analysis quoted section in observing existing law provided that a birth parent retains custody and control when a stepparent adopts a child.see stepparent adoption means the adoption of a child by a stepparent where one birth parent retains custody and control of the child.thus,no special subdivision b was needed for section because section served that purpose.there was no counterpart to section to provide for second parent adoptions of adults section,subdivision b,therefore conformed the law for these circumstances.it is unclear why such distinctions were drawn between a stepparent adoption of minors and a stepparent adoption of adult children of spouses but the distinctions seem unnecessary and outmoded.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.the amendment to section indicates stepparenthood was the only context in which the ordinary transfer of duties and rights from birth parent s to adoptive parent s did not occur.
the legislature confirmed its understanding that second parent adoptions were not a universal option when it allowed registered domestic partners to participate in this procedure.as the senate rules committee analysis explained,this bill expands california law on domestic partnerships by conferring on domestic partners various rights,privileges and standing conferred by the state on married couples including t he right of a domestic partner to adopt a child of his or her partner as a stepparent.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.section,subdivision f,now provides that f or the purposes of this chapter,stepparent adoption includes adoption by a domestic partner.
against these two expressions of legislative limits on second parent adoption,the majority offers a letter issued by the california department of social services on november,the letter,abolishing any marital requirements for second parent adoption.see,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.the letter purports to invalidate prior letters expressing a different policy which it characterized as an underground regulation inconsistent with the administrative procedure act an apt description for the letter itself.the administrative procedure act hereafter apa,et.establish es basic minimum procedural requirements for the adoption,amendment,or repeal of administrative regulations.ibid.the apa requires the government agency offering the regulation to provide,inter alia,a copy of the proposed regulation a statement of reasons for the adoption,amendment,or repeal of a regulation identification of every study justifying the change a description of alternatives to the proposal and the agency reasons for rejecting those alternatives.the apa also provides for public input through either a public hearing or written comments.because the california department of social services failed to observe these procedures,the letter did not comply with the statutory requirements,and is thus as much an underground regulation as any former rule.
the letter fails in substance as well as procedure.government code section,subdivision a,requires a n ecessity for the rule,to effectuate the purpose of a statute,court decision,or other provision of law that the regulation implements,interprets,or makes specific subdivision e requires r eference to the statute,court decision,or other legal provision.the letter provides neither of these.furthermore,the regulation must be in harmony with,and not in conflict with existing law,subd.d.since,as noted,the legislature has provided only narrow exceptions to family code section,the letter arguably conflicts with the law as it then existed.nevertheless,the lesson of the majority opinion is that administrative agencies need not follow the dictates of the legislature or this court,we will follow them.the california department of social services violation of the statutory law thus serves as its retroactive justification.
ii.neither marshall nor waiver principles support prospective validation of second parent adoptions outside the statutory scheme 
against the expressed intent of the legislature,the majority abrogates any requirements for second parent adoptions,relying on our decision in marshall marshall cal,marshall and the principle that parties may waive rules imposed primarily for their benefit.neither justification supports the majority conclusion.
the court in marshall retroactively authorized a second parent adoption by the new husband of a widow and held that a husband and wife may jointly adopt a child the result of which is to make the child,in law,the child of both spouses.marshall,supra,cal.at,italics added.the majority both disregards the context and finds the italicized language immaterial,concluding instead that the opinion authorizes adoption by any couple wishing to adopt,regardless of marital status.this reads contemporary norms into a decision,when the prevailing precedents deemed marriage the most important relation in life,and one in which the state is vitally interested the public policy relating to marriage is to foster and protect it,to make it a permanent and public institution,to encourage the parties to live together,and to prevent separation and illicit unions.deyoe superior court cal.
moreover,the legislature subsequently enacted former section of the civil code,which contained four separate references to an adoption by a where one natural parent retains his or her custody and control of the child.italics added.had the legislature deemed stepparenthood immaterial,it would not have specifically included the italicized language.accordingly,even if the marshall court had been indifferent to the existence of a marital commitment,the legislature was not.the legislature has since added an entire chapter of statutes expressly regulating stepparent adoptions,et these provisions reflect the legislature understanding that it was creating a special procedure for adoption and an exception to the general rule set forth in family code section.section,subdivision f,confirms this understanding.
the legislature also recently extended to registered domestic partners the opportunity to follow the stepparent adoption procedure.unlike the legal landscape,where there was no statutory authorization for a child to live with a birth parent and a second parent,the law currently provides that opportunity to all couples who comply with the statutory prerequisites by formalizing their relationship.
thus,even if the marshall court lacked any legislative guidance,we do not.the legislature has twice prescribed the terms by which a child may gain a second parent without losing the first only where the two parents are related by marriage or domestic partnership.this court has no authority to reject the legislative rule for one it deems preferable.
at most,marshall supports annette claim as we vindicated the intent and expectations of the marshalls,perhaps so too should we vindicate the original intent and expectations of sharon and annette.but retroactive authorization of the adoption in marshall did not create a prospective rule that any second parent adoption would be valid.even if it had,subsequent legislation established that this option is available only to those couples who marry or form a domestic partnership,nullifying any contrary expectation or assumption.the majority may have justification for applying equitable principles to preserve a family attachment already created,but it has no basis for prospectively abrogating a legislative scheme that has stood for more than years.
the majority also asserts that the section transfer of authority from birth parent to adoptive parents is optional,because it amounts to a benefit for the parents themselves.but section is but one of many rules governing adoption that exist to effect not the preferences of the adults but the welfare of the child,and thus society itself.the majority reconstruction of section ignores this imperative.
in addressing the questions of whether the statute is designed to benefit the parties or the public,the majority construes the provision as a primarily private benefit to the parents only through a selective citation of the text.perhaps birth parents often wish to be relieved of all duties towards,and all responsibility for,the adopted child,ante,d at,at,quoting.after all,many people may wish to limit their duties and responsibilities.but this disregards the second part of the statute,which deprives the birth parent of any right over the child.a rule that strips both duties and rights from one party is not primarily intended to benefit that party.
nor is the argument that the law is primarily designed for the benefit of the birth and adoptive parents any stronger,for it suffers from the same defect.the law both deprives the birth parents of their rights and imposes duties and responsibilities on the adoptive parents.in terms of the legal position of the parties,therefore,they swap places in a game.there would be no point for the legislature to specify terms if the adoption were nothing more than a mutually contract between two adults or couples.
but it is not.the agreement is for the benefit of the child,not of the parents or persons making it.estate of grace d,see also adoption of barnett cal d,the main purpose of adoption statutes is the promotion of the welfare of children.we have explained how a complete transfer of duties and rights is necessary to prevent the confusing position of multiple lines of parental authority.we thus announced the general imperative from which the marshall court and then the legislature carved exceptions that f rom the time of adoption,the adopting parent is,so far as concerns all legal rights and duties flowing from the relation of parent and child,the parent of the adopted child.from the same moment,the parent by blood ceases to be,in a legal sense,the parent.jobson,supra,cal.at.
this rule prevents the child from being burdened with a conflict between the birth parent s and adoptive parents s.if the agreement were simply a means for the birth and adopting parents to effect their private preferences,the law could authorize all permutations of divided rights and duties.the legislature has concluded otherwise,insisting on an unambiguous transfer of authority unless the birth parent and adopting parent have formally joined together to forge a common future.
iii.the majority trivializes family bonds 
the majority reliance on a mutual waiver imports the principles of the marketplace into the realm of home and family,which was once thought to represent a haven in a heartless world of interactions.lasch,haven in a heartless world.the family is the area where people act not in accordance with specifically contracted agreements but the duties of the heart.parents are not simply utility maximizers.raising a child is,like hope,a task of the spirit.it is so much more than an aggregation of services.
parenthood instead is the opportunity and responsibility to join the web of human connectedness through which we touch the past,the present,and the future.the relationship of parent and child is the most fundamental bond humans share and the influence of family in determining what kind of people we become is profound.society has a considerable stake in the health and stability of families,because it is upon the burke calls the little we rely on not only to nurture the young but to provide the seed beds of civic virtue required for citizenship in a community.the family teaches us to care for others,and to moderate berns,the first amendment and the future of american democracy.all tasks which will be hampered if the family is simply a collection of individuals united temporarily for their mutual convenience and armed with rights against each other.schneider,moral discourse and the transformation of american family law.the arduous,educational process of raising a child requires not a spirit of contractualist autonomy,but a spirit of adult commitment and sacrifice.hafen,individualism and autonomy in family law the waning of belonging byu.
the majority,irretrievably committed to its view of parenthood,declines to interpret section to effectively preclude a child from having more than two parents and at oral argument annette counsel asserted no such limit should exist.such a position is consistent with the stunted view of parenthood as purely ministerial and consent slips and providing health insurance.but this is the least part of being a parent,as anyone who has ever seen a newborn resting securely in her father hand can understand and anyone who has sat up late at night awaiting the safe return of a newly minted teenage driver knows.the nature of parenthood renders eminently reasonable any legislative provision requiring that adopting parents share a common residence with each other and the adopted child.see,subd.b.parenthood requires more than a telephone and a checkbook.
the united states supreme court has found parental authority constitutes a game.michael gerald,d.parental authority can not not be divided because it goes beyond ministerial functions the parent direct s the child activities make s decisions regarding the control,education,and health of the child and exercises the duty,to prepare the child for additional obligations,which includes the teaching of moral standards,religious beliefs,and elements of good citizenship.id.at,quoting cal.fam.law b,fns omitted.devolving these responsibilities on a multitude of parties would lead to a variety of conflicts and inconsistencies,as justice baxter correctly notes.see conc.dis.opn.of baxter,ante,d at,at.
the limit is one point on which proponents of proposition and assembly bill.agree.the legislature insistence that the adopting parent have a legal relationship with the birth parent reflects the fact that the adoptive parent relationship with the child does not exist in a vacuum but is related to the parents relationship with each other.justice thurgood marshall wrote for a unanimous supreme court in holding it was proper to distinguish between formerly married and fathers in granting only the former the right to veto an adoption by the mother new husband.quilloin walcott,d.t he state was not foreclosed from recognizing this difference in the extent of the commitment to the welfare of the child.ibid.this commitment enables the courts,as well as those most personally involved,to make certain knowing they will at times be what to expect.hafen,the constitutional status of marriage,kinship,and sexual privacy balancing the individual and social interests.
the law permits single individuals to adopt a child on their own because one parent is better than none.it does not follow,however,that two unrelated parents are better than one.the majority cites the legislative policy that adoption or guardianship is more suitable to a child than is foster care,ante,d at,fn,at quoting welf,as adoption is a more permanent relationship than foster care.however,if the birth parent has a relationship with a second parent,and then a third,and then a fourth,the child may be worse off than if the birth parent had simply raised the child alone.the choice in second parent adoption cases is not between adoption and foster care.the birth parent in such circumstances is willing and able to continue expressing parental responsibility.if the two adults are uncertain whether the second parent will be a permanent resident of the household,the adoption ought to wait until they are ready for that commitment.
there is a tension within the law as to whether legal standards should reflect ideal behavior or simply the mean the majority,however,refuse to impose even a standard of the mean.couples who raise children together do predominantly have a formal legal relationship with each other.it is not a standard that individuals can not reach absent heroism,and every californian adult has access to such a relationship.today decision maximizes the and personal convenience of parents,but poorly serves the state children who deserve as much stability and security as legal process can provide.
independent adoptions,et are those in which no agency,state or private,joins in the adoption petition,although the state does have a role in investigating,evaluating and commenting upon the petition.see.further unlabeled section references are to the family code.
the phrase adoption refers to an independent adoption whereby a child born to or legally adopted by one partner is adopted by h
