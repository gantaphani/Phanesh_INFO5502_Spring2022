dewayne,the noncustodial father of john,appeals the juvenile dependency court dispositional order denying his request to place john with him in tennessee.dewayne contentions fall into two categories a challenge to the court finding that such placement would be detrimental to john welf,and a challenge to rulings concerning the interstate compact on the placement of children icpc,et.we conclude the court erred by finding that john placement with dewayne would be detrimental within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section,abused its discretion by denying dewayne request for a continuance of the dispositional hearing pending completion of a home evaluation through the icpc process or some other means,and erred by concluding that an icpc report was required before placing john with dewayne.
background 
detention and jurisdiction 
in september,when john was and years old,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a dependency petition alleging his mother,physically abused him.the petition did not mention dewayne,instead listing john stepfather as an alleged father.at the detention hearing,the court struck the stepfather name from the petition and added dewayne name.john was detained in polinsky children center for about one week,then moved to the home of his maternal grandmother,where his,was also detained.
reported that dewayne was john father,was subject to a child support order and had provided medical insurance for a while but had never paid any child support.dewayne told the social worker that he had been in contact with john for one year after a hiatus,and the earlier lack of contact was not on his part.according to dewayne,in john had a broken leg and would not say how it happened,while claimed that john had fallen.dewayne also said that gets in pure rage and john had told him that she shook just three weeks after the dependency petition was filed,the social worker obtained a criminal clearance for dewayne showing that he had no criminal record.the social worker concluded that placement with dewayne was a viable option but an icpc report would have to be completed before dewayne home could be considered.
on october,dewayne counsel asked that john be placed with dewayne,asserting that he was a nonoffending,noncustodial parent,and placement would not be detrimental.counsel also requested expedited icpc proceedings.the court granted the latter request and gave the agency discretion to detain john with an approved relative with notice to john counsel.
on october,john was detained with his aunt,with whom he wished to live.on the same date,was detained with her parents and john stepfather.on october,john told the social worker that he did not want to live with dewayne because dewayne lived in the country.on november,the social worker reported,the agency has not submitted icpc and it appears that one will not be needed,as john does not desire to live with dewayne.on november,the juvenile court entered a true finding on the petition and granted dewayne supervised visitation.
disposition 
at the november,dispositional hearing,the court amended the petition to state that dewayne had been adjudicated john father by a tennessee court.dewayne counsel requested a continuance pending completion of an icpc report,and repeated his request for john placement with dewayne as a nonoffending,noncustodial father.the court said that it would not place john with dewayne and close the case,so an icpc report was required.it noted that there had been little contact between dewayne and john,john did not want to move,there was a reunification plan for,and dewayne was out of state,making him,to some degree,an unknown entity and services would be necessary to ensure john safety and the success of a placement with dewayne.it further stated that its order for icpc proceedings could not be implemented before the jurisdictional findings due to john age,those proceedings could not be expedited it would take approximately a month or six weeks to receive the icpc report and john could be in another placement without foreclosing the possibility of future placement with dewayne.the court denied the continuance request and ordered that the icpc report be prepared and submitted as soon as possible.
after the court received the agency reports into evidence,dewayne counsel moved for a directed verdict,arguing that the agency had not met its burden of showing detriment by clear and convincing evidence.alternatively,counsel requested a continuance for an icpc report or a home evaluation by some other method.the court denied the motion.after listening to the social worker testimony,it incorporated its earlier remarks and stated that john had serious problems that could be addressed in san diego,where he had a sibling relationship and an extended family,and he did not have an ongoing relationship with dewayne.it therefore found detriment and ordered john placed with relatives.
ii.detriment 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a states when a court orders removal of a child pursuant to section,the court shall first determine whether there is a parent of the child,with whom the child was not residing at the time that the events or conditions arose that brought the child within the provisions of section,who desires to assume custody of the child.if that parent requests custody,the court shall place the child with the parent unless it finds that placement with that parent would be detrimental to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a evidences the legislative preference for placement with the nonoffending noncustodial parent.in re austin th,d.
the juvenile court must make the detriment finding by clear and convincing evidence.in re luke th,d in re isayah th,d.we review the record in the light most favorable to the court order to determine whether there is substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find clear and convincing evidence that the children would suffer such detriment.citations.clear and convincing evidence requires a high probability,such that the evidence is so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.citation.in re luke,supra,th at,d.
here,the court based its detriment finding on john wishes,his need for services,his relationship with and members of his extended family in san diego,his lack of a relationship with dewayne,the paucity of information about dewayne,and reunification plan.these factors do not support the finding.
at the inception of this case,john was and years old and was months old.they were detained together for only days before he was moved to his aunt home.in re isayah,supra,th at,d.the only evidence concerning the sibling relationship was that early in the case the social worker reported that john refused to talk to her because she would not let him hold and also that the social worker testified that john had asked to see and dewayne had stated his concern that john wants to stay wherever is.the social worker also testified that dewayne was willing to facilitate sibling visitation and she did not know whether sibling visitation had occurred.these facts provide no support for a finding that there was a high probability that moving to tennessee would have a devastating emotional impact on john.in re luke,supra,th at,d.nor is there any support for the proposition that a move away from his extended family in san diego would be detrimental to john ibid.or that a move would prevent from reunifying.
by the time of the dispositional hearing,john was nearly years old.while,at that age,he was entitled to have his wishes considered,he was not entitled to decide where he would be placed.in re luke,supra,th at,d.furthermore,his wishes were unclear.both the social worker and john counsel said that he wanted to live with his aunt.the social worker reported that john told her that he did not want to live with dewayne because dewayne lived in the country.at the dispositional hearing,she testified that she did not ask john what he meant by this statement,she could not see his facial expression during the conversation,and john aunt
