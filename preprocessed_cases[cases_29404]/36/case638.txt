christian appeals a dispositional order placing him on probation and ordering him to reside with his mother in honduras.we agree with christian that the court abused its discretion in finding that returning to honduras was not in his best interests for the purpose of petitioning for relief from deportation under united states code section as a special immigrant juvenile sij,but that returning to honduras was in his best interests for the purpose of selecting a disposition.accordingly,we will reverse the dispositional order.
factual and procedural background 
on march,christian was arrested for selling cocaine base.the following day,a wardship petition welf,subd.a was filed alleging that christian,aged,sold cocaine base health,subd.a.the probation department requested his detention pending a hearing based on the charges,the need to protect the minor,and concerns that the minor was likely to flee in order to avoid the court jurisdiction.the probation officer stated that immigration officials had been notified of christian custody status.on march,the juvenile court ordered that christian be detained pending pretrial.
on march,an immigration detainer notice of action was faxed to the juvenile hall from the department of homeland security dhs stating that christian had a prior felony conviction or had been charged with a felony offense,that he had illegally the country after a previous removal,and that the immigration officer had obtained an order of deportation or removal.the detainer requested that juvenile hall maintain custody of the minor for a period not to exceed hours beyond the time when he would otherwise be released to allow dhs to take custody of him.attached to the detainer was a warrant of,dated september,stating that christian was subject to removal or deportation based on a final order by an immigration judge.
on april,the petition was amended to allege that christian possessed a controlled substance.on the same day,christian admitted that he had possessed a controlled substance as alleged in the amended petition.in the course of taking his plea,the juvenile court stated,if you are not a citizen,your plea of guilty may result in your deportation,exclusion from admission or denial of naturalization as a citizen.do you understand christian stated he understood.christian counsel also indicated that she had discussed the matter with christian and she was satisfied he understood the immigration consequences of his admission.
the probation officer prepared a report in advance of the dispositional hearing.according to the probation officer,christian stated he had traveled from honduras to the united states months earlier without his mother permission.after arriving in oakland,he had been earning a week.he sent some of the money home and used the rest to pay for rent,food,and clothing.christian told the probation officer he had completed the fourth grade in honduras,but for financial reasons could not continue his education.he said he had frequently smoked marijuana while in honduras.he denied any other drug use.the probation officer reported that he had spoken with christian mother,who was not forthcoming and provided very limited family history.she confirmed that appellant had grown up in the family home in honduras,that the family was very poor,and that they could not afford to send christian to school.she wanted christian to remain in the united states so that he would have the opportunity for a better life.she said christian had never been in any trouble before.
the disposition report continued,the undersigned asked the minor and his mother if he had ever been in trouble with the law and they said no.however,ice immigration,customs and enforcement officials reported to the undersigned and faxed a copy of the ice detainer on and a department of homeland security warrant dated.on,the minor was arrested by border patrol in tucson,arizona.on,ice transported and placed the minor in a home in chicago,illinois.on,the minor awol from the shelter and without permission from ice authorities.on,denver,co police arrested the minor for drug possession.on,ice took custody of the minor and transported the minor to houston,texas for deportation hearings.on,the minor was deported back to his home country of honduras via american airlines.
the probation department recommended that the court order the minor be released to the custody of the immigration,customs and enforcement agency.based on his prior involvement with the department of homeland security,ice has federal jurisdiction over the minor.the minor has violated federal law by the united states without proper documentation or authorization.the department of homeland security has the ability and authority to transport,place and reunite the minor with family.the probation officer believed christian would abscond if released,that he would not benefit from any services offered,and that it was in his best interest to be reunited with his family in honduras.
on april,christian counsel filed an alternative disposition memorandum requesting that he be removed from the custody of his parents and placed in an placement.on the same date,counsel filed a memorandum arguing that christian was eligible for sij status 
at the contested dispositional hearing on april,the court placed christian on probation under the supervision of the probation department and ordered him to reside with his mother.after noting that christian had days credit,the court ordered christian to serve days.his term at juvenile hall will end this coming friday,may.at that point he may be released.since his parents are not here for him to return home,then child protective services should be called to take him into custody.the court also made the finding necessary to enable christian to petition the united states citizenship and immigration service for classification as a special immigrant juvenile.
the following day,the court heard the matter again to clarify wardship orders.the court stated,so the record is clear,wardship is declared on the minor behalf.the minor is placed on probation.the conditions of probation include that he serve days in custody.after the probation officer informed the court that probation had contacted child protective services and they told him they would not take custody of a ward,the court stated christian would be ordered to reside with his parents.when christian counsel asked for clarification as to whether the court is defacto releasing him to ice or is he just being released,the court stated,he being released.and i would ask for probation to follow the standard procedures that are followed when a minor is being released from custody and parents are unavailable to pick them up.the court reiterated that the probation department was being ordered to follow standard procedures with respect to unaccompanied or abandoned minors.
on the same date,christian filed a timely notice of appeal.while the appeal was pending,the united states citizenship and immigration service granted christian petition for special immigrant juvenile status in response to our request for supplemental briefing,the parties explained that the minor had been released to ice on may and that he remains in the custody of the secretary of health and human services.
discussion 
the appeal is not moot.
although the issue was not initially raised by the parties,our request for supplemental briefing asked the parties whether any proceedings or other developments during the pendency of the appeal have rendered the appeal moot.respondent argues that the appeal is now moot because the court can not grant any effective relief.the supplemental brief explains,this court can not grant effective relief because appellant is in the custody of federal authorities,is pursuing a federal path to citizenship or residency status,and apparently has been granted sij status.it is not even apparent that appellant is still present within california.thus,it is unclear whether a california juvenile court could still exercise meaningful supervision over appellant.appellant original proposed remedy in this case,remand to the juvenile court,may no longer be possible,and is
