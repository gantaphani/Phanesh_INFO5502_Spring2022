more than three years after entry of judgment,maria leslie filed an action under family code section alleging her former husband,byron georgiou,breached his fiduciary duty to her during the dissolution proceedings by not disclosing the true value of a community asset divided in the marital settlement agreement msa,his prospective referral fee in federal class action securities litigation against enron corporation enron.the family court granted georgiou motion for summary adjudication,determining section does not authorize a postjudgment action,and alternatively,the action was untimely under the statute statute of limitations,subd.d.leslie challenges the order,contending both rulings are incorrect.
we conclude section does not authorize leslie action,and thus we are not required to address the alternative ruling.because the prospective referral fee was not concealed,but rather the parties litigated the issue and the judgment fully adjudicated the asset,leslie recourse was an action to set aside the judgment,or a portion thereof,within the limitations period specified in the relevant portion of section,subdivision f.because her action was untimely,the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
leslie and georgiou married in and separated in.georgiou filed for dissolution that year,and a bifurcated judgment terminated the marital status in.
georgiou is an attorney,and in he entered into an of counsel relationship with milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach llp milberg weiss which entitled him to a referral fee of percent in class action litigation in which georgiou secured the plaintiff and the firm was designated lead counsel.
in milberg weiss entered into a contingency fee agreement with the regents of the university of california the regents,which was ultimately designated the lead plaintiff in federal class action securities litigation against enron.on a sliding scale,the agreement authorized attorney fees of between and percent of the recovery.
in february leslie and georgiou entered into an msa.before signing it,leslie knew of georgiou referral fee agreement with milberg weiss,that the firm had thus far recovered approximately billion in settlement funds,the largest recovery to date in a class action,and the firm would be submitting a request for attorney fees in federal district court under its fee agreement with the regents.it is undisputed that georgiou did not give leslie a copy of the fee agreement.
leslie deposed darren robbins,a milberg weiss partner designated most knowledgeable about georgiou relationship with the firm.her attorney questioned robbins on whether the firm had a fee agreement with the regents,but he did not ask robbins what percentage of fees the regents had agreed to pay the firm,nor did he ask for a copy of the agreement.in any event,robbins testified the federal district court must approve a fee award based on a variety of factors,and it is not bound by a fee agreement.
robbins also testified georgiou was entitled to a referral fee from milberg weiss in the enron litigation,but there was a dispute as to the amount of the fee.robbins said,i would not imagine any scenario under which georgiou would receive less than three percent.robbins also said the firm hoped to obtain attorney fees substantially exceeding the largest securities class action fee award to date of million,as that award was based on a much smaller recovery than achieved in the enron litigation.robbins estimated milberg weiss would obtain fees by the end of.
in a settlement conference brief,leslie gleaned that georgiou referral fee may be between and million,presumably based on a potential fee award to milberg weiss of million.she acknowledged,however,that the firm intended to seek far more than million,and that georgiou intended to vigorously argue he was entitled to a full percent referral fee.
the msa divided the prospective referral fee unequally.leslie agreed to accept percent of the fee,in exchange for approximately million in other assets and debt relief.she received the family home,even though it was georgiou separate property,eight townhomes that produced net monthly income,a roth ira and retirement accounts.he received percent of his referral fee,life insurance policies,loan receivables,business interests,and substantial credit card and other debt.according to georgiou,leslie was taking everything that was certain.
the msa was incorporated in a judgment of dissolution entered on december.about a month later,milberg weiss submitted its fee application to the federal district court in the enron case,requesting percent of the ultimate recovery of approximately billion,pursuant to the terms of its fee agreement with the regents.in september the federal district court issued a lengthy order granting the request as reasonable and awarding milberg weiss million in fees.
milberg weiss then negotiated a percent referral fee with georgiou.in september georgiou paid leslie million for her percent share of the fee,which caused her to realize his fee exceeded the top range of million she anticipated when she entered into the msa.in november she learned she was entitled to an additional million 
leslie retained a new attorney,and in november she filed a motion under section,subdivision d,to set aside the judgment of dissolution based on her mental incapacity.a motion under this provision must be filed within two years after the date of entry of judgment.ibid.she argued her former attorney insisted that she enter into the msa so he could get paid,and implied she was under duress because she had not been taking psychotropic medications as prescribed by her physicians.in september after retaining yet another attorney,leslie dismissed the motion.
on december,however,leslie filed this action under section for georgiou breach of his fiduciary duty of disclosure.the gist of the action was that georgiou deceived her into believing his potential referral fee would be between and million,by not providing her with a copy of the fee agreement between milberg weiss and the regents and inventing or exaggerating a dispute with the firm over the amount of his referral fee.she argued that had she known the terms of the fee agreement,she could have calculated that milberg weiss stood to obtain a fee award.leslie sought either percent or percent of the referral fee pursuant to section,subdivisions g and h 
georgiou moved for summary adjudication,arguing her action was untimely because she did not file it within three years from the date she had actual knowledge that the transaction or event for which the remedy is being sought occurred,subd.d.leslie argued her action did not accrue until september when she learned the amount of georgiou referral fee and realized he had understated his potential fee in breach of his fiduciary duty.
the court determined,sua sponte,that relief for breach of fiduciary duty under section is not legally available in a dissolution judgment action.the court interpreted section to authorize an action in only three instances during an intact marriage in conjunction with a dissolution proceeding or after the death of a spouse.
the court also found that section,subdivision e,under which a judgment may be set aside for mistake,provided leslie sole recourse,but such an action was not viable because the statute limitations period was long expired.alternatively,the court determined that even if section applied,her action was barred by the statute limitations period since she knew when she signed the msa that she did not have a copy of milberg weiss fee agreement with the regents.
discussion 
istandard of review 
leslie contends the court erred by granting summary adjudication.she asserts the court misinterpreted section to authorize an independent action for breach of fiduciary duty only in an intact marriage.

applicable duties during dissolution proceedings 
spouses have fiduciary duties to each other as to the management and control of community property,subd.b,subd.e.i n transactions between themselves,a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other,subd.b.
the fiduciary duties expressly extend throughout dissolution proceedings,subd.c.from the date of separation to the date of the distribution of the community or asset or liability in question,each party is subject to the standards provided in section,as to all activities that affect the assets and liabilities of the other party,subd.a.a full and accurate disclosure of all the parties assets and liabilities must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage,subd.c.it reasonably follows that a spouse who is in a superior position to obtain records or information from which an asset can be valued and can reasonably do so must acquire and disclose such information to the other spouse.in re marriage of brewer federici th.
further,each party has a continuing duty to immediately,fully,and accurately update and augment that disclosure to the extent there have been any material changes,subd.c.the final declaration of disclosure shall include a ll material facts and information regarding the valuation of all assets that are contended to be community property,subd.b.the formulation of a marital settlement agreement is not an ordinary business transaction,resulting from an arm length negotiation between adversaries.rather,it is the result of negotiations between fiduciaries required to openly share information.in re marriage of brewer federici,supra,th at.
postjudgment remedies for breach of fiduciary 
there are,of course,postjudgment remedies for breach of the fiduciary duty of full disclosure during dissolution proceedings.within the first six months after entry of judgment,the court has discretion to set aside a judgment under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b on the grounds of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.in re marriage of varner th.historically,c ourts have also been held to have inherent power to set aside a judgment,even after the period of code of civil procedure section has passed,if the parties have been deprived of the opportunity to litigate their claim.id.at.
further,i n,a chapter entitled relief from judgment was added to the family code,added by stats,ch.in adopting this chapter,the legislature found t he law governing the circumstances under which a judgment can be set aside,after the time for relief under section of the code of civil procedure has passed,has been the subject of considerable confusion which has led to increased litigation and unpredictable and inconsistent decisions at the trial and appellate levels,subd.d.rubenstein rubenstein,supra,th at.
section,subdivision a,acknowledges that california strong public policy of ensuring the fair division of community property can only be implemented with full disclosure of community property.section also provides b it occasionally happens that the division of property,whether made as a result of agreement or trial,is inequitable when made due to the nondisclosure or other misconduct of one of the parties.c the public policy of assuring finality of judgments must be balanced against the public interest in ensuring proper division of marital property,and in deterring misconduct.italics added.section et applies to dissolution judgments adjudicating support or division of property entered on or after january,and as to such judgments all prior law on equitable relief is preempted,subd.a hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group,hogoboom.
section sets out the exclusive grounds and time limits for an action or motion to set aside a marital dissolution judgment.in re marriage of rosevear th,italics added.unlike traditional equitable law where laches is the only time limit on relief,section et accommodates the public policy interest in putting an end to litigation and ensuring the finality of family law judgments by setting absolute deadlines on obtaining a post judgment.once the period expires section,relief is not available and the judgment is effectively final for all purposes.hogoboom,supra.
under section,there are six grounds to set aside a judgment,or portion thereof,including actual fraud,perjury,duress,mental incapacity,mistake,and the failure to fully disclose the value of assets under section et,subds.a f.upon vacating the judgment,in whole or in part,a trial court is empowered to make an unequal distribution of the concealed assets,in the interests of justice.rubenstein rubenstein,supra,th at.
subdivision e of section states that a s to stipulated or uncontested judgments or that part of a judgment stipulated to by the parties,a set aside motion may be based on mistake,either mutual or unilateral,whether mistake of law or mistake of fact.here,the family court determined leslie action was controlled by subdivision e of section,based on opinions holding that a judgment of dissolution may be set aside under that provision for the breach of the fiduciary duty of full disclosure.in re marriage of varner,supra,th at in re marriage of brewer federici,supra,th.these opinions,however,were based on a previous iteration of section.in,the legislature amended section to specify as a ground for relief the f ailure to comply with the disclosure requirements of chapter commencing with section,subd.f.
leslie,however,waited too long to pursue relief under section.an action based on the failure to disclose shall be brought within one year after the date on which the complaining party either discovered,or should have discovered,the failure to comply,subd.f.likewise,a action for actual fraud is subject to a limitations period of one year from the date of actual or implied discovery,subd.a.leslie discovered in september that georgiou obtained a referral fee substantially higher than she alleges he alluded was possible and she did not file her action until december.
with the applicable section limitations period expired,leslie relied on section.subdivision a of section provides a spouse has a claim against the other spouse for any breach of the fiduciary duty that results in impairment to the claimant spouse present undivided interest in the community estate,including,but not limited to,a single transaction or a pattern or series of transactions,which transaction or transactions have caused or will cause a detrimental impact to the claimant spouse undivided interest in the community estate.
section,subdivision d,provides that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty shall be commenced within three years of the date a petitioning spouse had actual knowledge that the transaction or event for which the remedy is being sought occurred.section,subdivision d,provides that a n action may be commenced under this section upon the death of a spouse or in conjunction with an action for legal separation,dissolution of marriage,or nullity without regard to the time limitations set forth in paragraph.leslie claimed this is an independent action subject to the limitations period,rather than an action brought in conjunction with the dissolution proceeding.
the family court determined section authorizes an independent action only during an intact marriage.subdivision f of section provides any action may be brought under this section without filing an action for dissolution of marriage,legal separation,or nullity,or may be brought in conjunction with the action or upon the death of a spouse.italics added.while california
