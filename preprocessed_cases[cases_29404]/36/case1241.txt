in this juvenile dependency matter,stephanie mother appeals from an order of the juvenile court identifying adoption as the permanent placement goal for her sons roland and gabriel and directing the santa clara county department of family and children services department to attempt to locate an appropriate adoptive family for the children.welf,subds.b,c.mother argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court findings that the boys are probably adoptable and that they are difficult to place for the reasons specified.the department urges us to dismiss the appeal,arguing that mother contentions are premature and that the order is not appealable.
we conclude that the order is an appealable order and,given recent amendments to section,subdivision c,mother appeal is not premature.on the merits,however,we reject mother contentions and affirm the order.
background 
roland and gabriel lived with mother and their infant.on march,social workers went to mother home,found the children abused and neglected,and took them into protective custody.the department recommended bypassing services to mother due to her previous failure to reunify with two older children,subd.b.roland and gabriel father waived his right to reunification services.at the disposition hearing on september,the juvenile court denied reunification services,ordered supervised visitation with mother,and set a section hearing to select a permanent placement plan for roland and gabriel 
roland and gabriel both had behavioral problems.they were first placed together in a foster home but soon had to be separated because they fought viciously with each other,constantly scratching and punching until they drew blood.roland was very angry and often had uncontrollable tantrums.during visits with mother the boys were aggressive with each other and with mother.roland cursed at mother and slapped her in the face.gabriel sometimes completely ignored her.mother was usually unable to control them.
in the department first report prepared for the section hearing,the social worker described roland as a cute boy,with dark brown eyes and the cutest fade hair cut.he is energetic and playful at times.at other times he was violent and aggressive.the social worker noted that he screams,kicks,cusses,and hits and breaks toys that belong to other foster children during his tantrums.during these tantrums roland hits anyone who is in arms length.roland also hurts himself by scratching his face.his behavior was such that the foster parent wanted roland removed from the foster home.the foster parent had agreed to keep him only until a new placement could be located.roland behavior also caused him to be removed from two daycare facilities and placed in a therapeutic daycare facility where he could receive attention.roland was healthy,although he needed dental work that was being deferred until he was older.he was developmentally on target in the areas of height,weight,and motor skills.he had some speech problems,described as a tendency to slur his words and some trouble pronouncing words.
gabriel was five years old by this time.his foster parent reported that he had adjusted well to the placement,that he loved to help around the house,and that he followed the daily routine very well.he tended to control the other children,telling them what to do and disciplining his younger half brother.gabriel was struggling to keep up in kindergarten but the school principal believed that gabriel might not need special education since he was a young kindergartener he might catch up with another year of kindergarten.gabriel was generally healthy and was on track as far as his height and weight were concerned.he had recently had some wheezing that was being treated with an inhaler.the report described gabriel as a green eyed,light brown haired little boy,who,when you see him,you just want to squeeze his cheeks.he is very friendly and energetic he is helpful with his brothers during visits.
neither child was in a stable placement.no prospective adoptive home had yet been identified.the department recommended foster care,noting both of the children are very cute and people are drawn to them the first time they see them.this worker assessment is that in the future it will likely be possible to place both children in an adoptive home and terminate parental rights.at this point,however,neither of the children are in concurrent homes and both of them are experiencing significant behavior problems.neither of the children placements are stable,and while the department is working on stable adoptive homes,this stage has not been reached yet.it is therefore this worker recommendation that the children remain dependents of the court,and that the children,roland and gabriel participate in a plan of long term foster care until a nurturing adoptive home is secured.
the department filed two addenda to its first report.in the last of the two,the department changed its recommendation from one of long term foster care to a permanent plan of adoption and termination of parent visitation.the report noted the benefits adoption would provide and stated that it would be beneficial if the children could be placed together.the department would like an opportunity to be able to find such an adoptive home.although it may not be easy to find adoptive parents that are capable of meeting all of the children needs,it is not impossible.in fact,this worker was notified on that there is a possible concurrent placement for the sibling group.although in her first report the social worker felt that the boys behavior should be addressed before seeking an adoptive placement,the social worker now felt that it would be most beneficial to begin the adoption search now,and not wait for the children behavioral improvements it is this worker assessment that such permanence could provide stability that initiate sic positive behavioral and emotional changes.it is for these reasons this worker believes that the plan of adoption is in the children best interests.this worker will recommend a permanent plan of adoption,but will not recommend that the parents parental rights be terminated until an adoptive home is secured.the social worker hoped that terminating mother visitation would help improve the boys behavior.
the court adopted the findings and orders recommended in the department final report,which included the finding b y clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights would not be detrimental to the children.the juvenile court also adopted the finding that roland and gabriel had a probability of adoption but were difficult to place because they were members of a sibling group and because roland was then being evaluated for the presence of a diagnosed medical,physical,or mental handicap.the court identified adoption as the permanent placement goal and ordered the department to make efforts to locate an appropriate adoptive family for a period not to exceed days.mother has timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
appealability 
the juvenile court order was made pursuant to subdivisions b and c of section the subdivision c order.the department contends that such an order is not appealable because it merely defers the selection of a permanent placement plan.according to the department,until the juvenile court makes that selection,there is nothing to appeal.mother contends that the order,like all postdispositional orders in dependency proceedings,is appealable.we begin our analysis by examining the order in its statutory context.
under subdivision b of section,the juvenile court may do one of four things at the time of the section hearing terminate parental rights and free the child for adoption,identify adoption as the goal and order the department to try,for no more than days,to locate an appropriate adoptive home,appoint a legal guardian,or order that the child be placed in foster care,subd.b.in order to select adoption as the permanent placement plan,the juvenile court must make the findings required by subdivision c.under subdivision c,if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child is likely to be adopted,it must terminate p
