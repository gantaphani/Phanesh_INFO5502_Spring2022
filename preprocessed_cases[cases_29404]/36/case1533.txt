this is an unusual dependency case,and perhaps that is why it has run a full course,resulting in an order terminating parental rights,without anybody recognizing that it never should have been one.stephanie and john,the parents of,are apparently small time crooks however,there is no suggestion they were bad parents.there is no evidence they abused or neglected,nor that they had any debilitating mental impairment or substance abuse problems.the sole reason that came into the dependency system was that neither stephanie nor john was available to care for him when stephanie was arrested and incarcerated for credit card fraud on that sole basis,the court sustained a dependency petition erroneously,as it turned out,because there was neither any allegation nor any evidence that stephanie was unable to arrange for care of during her incarceration.such inability is the key fact that allows the court to take jurisdiction over the child of an incarcerated parent when there are no other grounds for doing so.and here there were none.
although the jurisdictional order was itself appealable,and stephanie failed to file such an appeal,she contends the issue may be raised for the first time here,because her prior failure to do so was the direct result of ineffective assistance of counsel.we agree.the record in this case demonstrates that stephanie had not one,but two sisters willing to assume care of during her incarceration.one of those sisters came from missouri to assume immediate custody of after the detention hearing,and later took custody.the orange county social services agency ssa is now touting her as a prospective adoptive parent.moreover,by the time of the jurisdictional hearing,john had contacted ssa and requested be placed with his mother.thus,the record in this case strongly suggests that stephanie had several options for care of during her incarceration,and there simply could be no satisfactory explanation for her attorney failure to focus on that fact as a means of defeating the dependency petition.people pope cal d.
our resolution of stephanie appeal obviates the need to consider the issues raised in john appeal.the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to give ssa an opportunity to cure the deficiencies in the jurisdictional allegations and prove that neither stephanie nor john can arrange for care of during any remaining period of time in which they are both incarcerated.
was two years old when he was detained by ssa on november.at the time of his detention,was reported to be healthy and happy and to communicate well and be very verbal.stephanie and john,who had been staying at a residence inn for approximately two weeks,had left there with michelle,the year old of stephanie sister,while they went to south coast plaza for dinner and shopping.at that time,stephanie had been in california for about a month,and john perhaps a little less.according to stephanie,she and john had been separated for some time while living in missouri,and after she and had relocated to california to live with her sister,john had followed her.they had gone out to dinner to discuss their relationship.
as it turned out,the credit card number used to rent the room at the residence inn did not belong to john or stephanie.the innkeeper,who had checked the validity of the credit card number when john and stephanie checked in they had only the number,and not the actual card,became suspicious after john and stephanie began charging an unusual amount of food and other items to their room account.they even requested that hotel staff purchase groceries for them from the store and place the grocery bill on their room account.as a result of the innkeeper more thorough check,it became clear that john and stephanie had stolen the credit card number and were using it without authorization.the innkeeper contacted the police.
when the police arrived,they found only michelle and in the room.a records check revealed that michelle had an outstanding warrant for her arrest,and she was taken into custody.was also taken into custody,although stephanie sister cheryl,arrived at the hotel while police were still there,saying that stephanie had requested she take home with her.the police believed that cheryl had stolen property in the trunk of her car,and took her to the police department as well.however,she was later released.
stephanie was arrested the next day,having checked into a different hotel with the stolen credit card number.she was taken to the orange county jail.john whereabouts were unknown.
stephanie sister cheryl spoke with the social worker the day after was detained.she stated her desire to have placed with her,and lamented her inability to pick up earlier so none of this would happened.cheryl stated she had resided in california since,and was currently residing in the costa mesa motor inn.she had had no contact with stephanie for the years prior to stephanie arrival in california.cheryl admitted to a criminal record of a petty theft with priors but had been released from parole in march of.
on december,ssa filed a juvenile dependency petition alleging that came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for two reasons,failure to protect welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b and no provision for support welfare and institutions code section,subdivision g.on december and,the court appointed counsel for stephanie and for,and held a detention hearing.stephanie sister,shalonda,traveled from missouri to testify at the hearing and request that be released to her custody.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court ordered detained pending the jurisdictional hearing,and authorized ssa to release him to any responsible adult relative or suitable adult as deemed appropriate.
ssa released to shalonda on december,after the detention hearing.stephanie and had lived with shalonda for some period of time before they came to california,and many of things were still at her home.shalonda was allowed to take to missouri with her,but was ordered to have him back on january,for the jurisdictional hearing.shortly after was released to shalonda,ssa began arrangements for long term placement of with shalonda.
when interviewed by the social worker,stephanie admitted she had no one to blame but herself for her own situation,although she also made clear she had no idea that michelle was on parole and had a warrant out for her arrest when she left in michelle care.stephanie had a prior criminal history which included arrests for forgery,counterfeiting and writing a bad check.her only conviction,however,was for involuntary manslaughter in,which she described as occurring in the context of an abusive relationship.she spent six months in jail and completed three years probation.she stated that she wanted to live with shalonda during her incarceration.when the social worker pointed out that visitation would be unlikely if she were in jail in california and was living in missouri,stephanie said she would be willing to sacrifice visitation if it meant that could remain in the care of family rather than being placed in a foster home.
shalonda remained in regular contact with ssa during initial visit with her.however,she and unfortunately missed their flight to california for the jurisdictional hearing and had to take a later one.she had her sister,cheryl,contact ssa to report the problem and assure them that will be here this evening.in light of that delay,the court continued the jurisdictional hearing and took the issue of john default under submission.shalonda did not actually present in court until the afternoon of the following day.in response to that lapse,the court ordered placed in a foster home in california.
prior to the jurisdictional hearing,ssa had made extensive efforts to contact john in both california and missouri.on january,john contacted the ssa absent parents search unit and left a message stating he had received their letter.the next day,john spoke with the social worker.he was described as argumentative,but stated he wanted placed in the home of his own mother,lillian john gave the social worker a number where he could be reached,but when she tried to contact him at that number on january,it had been disconnected.
the jurisdictional hearing was held on january.stephanie was present in custody and was represented by counsel.john did not appear and his default was entered.
the social worker testified at the jurisdictional hearing.she was asked the basis of her opinion that was at substantial risk of physical harm or illness due to the conduct of stephanie and john.she replied that stephanie had a history of criminal activity,and that she still had charges pending against her in missouri for which she would be extradited.the social worker also mentioned that stephanie had left in the custody of relatives who also had criminal histories.when asked to explain how stephanie criminal activity put at risk of illness,she stated that it put him at risk of suffering the consequence of his mother being arrested,being separated from her,and that while that was not a physical illness,it did have consequences adverse to his.
the social worker also mentioned that just that morning she had received information suggesting that was not current on all his immunizations,although she acknowledged on that he was not suffering from any illness as a result.the social worker also acknowledged on that she had no support for the allegations that stephanie and john had abandoned when they left him with michelle for the afternoon,or that they were remiss in not providing michelle with medical consent forms and a means of support during the anticipated brief term of their outing.she agreed that those allegations could be stricken.
in argument,stephanie counsel challenged only count of the petition,based upon section,subdivision b failure to protect.however,he actually conceded that the section,subdivision g count failure to provide,was applicable in this case i think that the language of that statute is clear and provides for precisely this type of problem,when a parent is incarcerated and unable to care for the child.that statute is on point.italics added.
the court dismissed count of the petition,based upon section,subdivision b failure to protect.thus,count of the petition,based upon section,subdivision g failure to provide was the only remaining basis for jurisdiction.as amended,it alleged the following,the child resided with mother and father at the residence inn in costa mesa for approximately one month prior to november.prior to this date,the family resided in louis,missouri.on november,the child was left alone in a motel with a babysitter who had a warrant out for her arrest,and was taken into custody by officer balsis of the costa mesa police department.on november,at the time the babysitter was arrested,the child parents were shopping at south coast plaza with a stolen credit card.on november,the mother was arrested for using stolen credit cards and booked at county jail,booking number.the father whereabouts are unknown.
the trial found the allegations of the petition,as amended,true by a preponderance of the evidence.at that point in the hearing,counsel for asked the court to take evidence establishing john was presumed father,to facilitate placement with john mother,who had also expressed a desire to take him.the court did so,and declared john to be the presumed father.the court,however,refused to release to any relatives at that time.instead,it ordered ssa to investigate john mother as a potential placement.was continued in foster care.
stephanie was given a reunification plan during her incarceration,which included regular telephone contact with s.she served a brief sentence in orange county,and was then extradited to missouri to face charges pending there.at the hearing in august of,ssa reported that stephanie had performed satisfactorily and recommended that her services be continued for an additional period.it was anticipated she would be paroled from her missouri incarceration in september of.ssa report noted that t he undersigned believes the child mother has the potential to provide a safe and appropriate home for the child if she is,as she states,to be released on september,after her parole hearing.however,if the child mother is not released in the near future,the undersigned believes the child should be placed with relatives in missouri.ssa also informed the court that shalonda was again being considered as a placement for 
the court ordered the additional period of reunification for stephanie,but she was not released on parole as anticipated.remained in foster care until the hearing.
the hearing was held in january of.at that time,ssa recommended termination of parental rights.while it acknowledged that stephanie had completed her case plan,her release date was june of with only a possibility of parole in june of.consequently ssa believed there was no substantial probability of reunification within the next.ssa was considering placement with several relatives at that time.john had not yet resurfaced.
the court terminated reunification services and set the matter for a section hearing.it ordered that a writ advisement be sent to both parents,and that a search declaration be prepared regarding john whereabouts,if appropriate.the writ advisement for john was returned to the court marked attempted address not known.
ssa filed a section report in june of.by that time,had been placed with shalonda,and ssa was discussing adoption and guardianship with her.shalonda was unsure she wanted to adopt,because she had been told that missouri adoption law would require her to deny any contact between stephanie and until turned.shalonda did not wish to be put in that position as she felt it would be in best interests to continue contact with stephanie.ultimately,shalonda said she would be willing to adopt despite her reservations,and ssa recommended her as a prospective adoptive placement.
john resurfaced in june of,and requested counsel.counsel was appointed and entered a general denial on his behalf.counsel subsequently filed a petition pursuant to section,arguing that john had not been given proper notice of the hearing.it also alleged that john now had a job and a home in missouri,and was ready,willing and able to take custody.the court granted a hearing on the petition,but ultimately denied it.
at the section hearing,the court found that was likely to be adopted and that none of the statutory exceptions to adoption applied.it consequently had no choice but to select adoption as the permanent plan and to terminate parental rights.
welfare and institutions code section provides in pertinent part that any child who comes within any of the following descriptions is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court which may adjudge that person to be a dependant child of the court g the child has been left without any provision for support physical custody of the child has been voluntarily surrendered pursuant to section of the health and safety code and the child has not been reclaimed within the day period specified in subdivision e of that section the child parent has been incarcerated or institutionalized and can not arrange for the care of the child or a relative or other adult custodian which whom the child resides or has been left is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child,the whereabouts of the parent are unknown,and reasonable efforts to locate the parent have been unsuccessful.italics added.
stephanie contends that there was no basis for the juvenile court to take jurisdiction in this case,because ssa had pleaded and proved only that she had been incarcerated,but not that she was unable to arrange for care of s.she further argues that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to recognize and assert that defect at the time.we agree on both counts.
although a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is usually raised by way of a writ of habeas corpus,it may be effectively raised as part of an appeal in the rare case where the appellate record demonstrates there simply could be no satisfactory explanation for trial counsel action or inaction.people pope,supra,cal d.as this court has previously explained,such a claim,made as part of the appeal,may be asserted even after the order terminating parental rights at the section hearing.in re eileen th,d.
in this case,counsel error is patent.at the jurisdictional hearing,he actually conceded that section,subdivision g was applicable to this case,based upon a clear misstatement of what that subdivision requires.counsel stated i think that the language of that statute is clear and provides for precisely this type of problem,when a parent is incarcerated and unable to care for the child.that statute is on point.italics added.but that is not at all what the statute says.the cited provision requires that the incarcerated parent be unable to arrange for the child care.that is a huge distinction.
there is no go to jail,lose your child rule in california.see,in re brittany th,d this appears to be a case where an incarcerated parent was destined to lose her child no matter what she did.we can not condone such a result.if stephanie could arrange for care of during the period of her incarceration,the juvenile court had no basis to take jurisdiction in this case,and ssa simply had no say in the matter.in re aaron d.additionally,it is irrelevant that stephanie had not already arranged for care at the time of her incarceration.instead,the issue is whether,as of the time of the jurisdictional hearing,she could arrange for the care.in re aaron,supra,d at.
but even assuming counsel characterization of the law was a mere misstatement,and he actually understood its specific requirements,the record also demonstrates there could be no satisfactory explanation for his failure to raise the issue.stephanie had not one,but two sisters who had expressed an immediate willingness to take in the wake of her incarceration.one of them,shalonda,flew out from missouri to seek custody of at the detention hearing,and immediately thereafter took back to missouri with her.the record strongly suggests she remained willing to take during the entire pendency of this case.those facts alone would be sufficient to compel a conclusion that stephanie was in a position to arrange for care.
although ssa concedes the record demonstrates stephanie had contact with both of her sisters shortly after was detained,it nonetheless argues there was no evidence stephanie actually offered any specific plan for care during her incarceration.without such a plan in evidence,ssa asserts there was no basis for stephanie counsel to argue the point,and thus no basis for us to conclude the representation was ineffective.there are three very significant flaws in that argument.
first,the issue to be determined in this case under section,subdivision g was whether stephanie could arrange for care,not whether she had already done so.there was certainly ample evidence in the record to demonstrate that stephanie could have made those arrangements with either one of her sisters.even john had offered his mother as a placement by the time of the hearing.
additionally,even assuming it was ssa,and not stephanie,who specifically made the arrangements for care with shalonda,the obvious inference is that it was through stephanie contacts,and not pure chance,that ssa was able to get in touch with that sister.indeed,the record here demonstrates that from the beginning,stephanie was telling ssa she wanted to live with her missouri sister until stephanie got out of jail.
second,ssa,and not stephanie,had the burden of proof as to each fact necessary to sustain the jurisdictional petition.thus,ssa had the initial burden of establishing that stephanie could not arrange for care.stephanie was not required to demonstrate anything,and she might have prevailed without making any factual showing at all.in fact,on this record,we would have no problem concluding that ssa failed to sustain its factual burden.
third,ssa argument implicitly suggests that stephanie attorney had no obligation to consider this issue unless stephanie herself first took action to indisputably establish its factual basis.as we have already noted,however,that is not the way the relationship works.it is the attorney role to analyze the client legal position and suggest a strategy or recommend issues that should be explored.in this case,even if there were not already significant evidence of family members ready to step in,the obvious question for the attorney to raise was do you have someone who can care for while you are in jail 
nothing in section,subdivision g even requires an incarcerated parent such as stephanie to prove affirmatively the suitability of her caretaking arrangements.it requires only that she be able to make the arrangements.if ssa wishes to challenge the suitability of those arrangements,it must proceed under a different clause of subdivision g,providing that jurisdiction is also appropriate where a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child resides or has been left is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child,the whereabouts of the parent are unknown,and reasonable efforts to locate the parent have been unsuccessful.of course,the fact that this provision requires not only proof of an unsuitable placement,but also that the parent can not be located,suggests that even if the initial arrangements do not work out,an incarcerated parent who certainly could be located would have the opportunity then to make other arrangements.
finally,in the circumstances of this case,we can not agree with ssa contention that the claim of ineffective assistance was waived as a matter of law.ssa relies upon in re meranda th,d,for the proposition that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on an appeal from a later appealable order.however,meranda speaks only in generalities,arguing in the abstract that due process will usually be protected even if the court enforces a waiver of ineffective assistance of counsel in a prior phase of the case.
as explained in in re janee th,d,the meranda rule is not absolute.t he crux of meranda is that the waiver rule will be enforced unless due process forbids it.the case conceded the critical role in ensuring an accurate and just decision played by a capable appointed counsel meranda,supra,th at,d but noted significant safeguards built into this state dependency statutes which tend to work against the wrongful termination of a parent right to a child even though a parent may be unrepresented or poorly represented id.at,d.those safeguards include a focus on return of the child during the reunification period,independent judicial review every six months,and notice to a parent of all proceedings and the right to counsel at all stages.id.at,d.thus in the usual case,application of the waiver rule will not offend due process.
this case,however is not that usual one.as we have explained,the record demonstrates the error here was entirely legal,and quite fundamental.stephanie counsel simply misunderstood the statute and neglected to assert her right to control placement,and thus to defeat jurisdiction.as pointed out in in re eileen,supra,th.at,d,the parent is hardly in a position to recognize,and independently protest,her attorney failure to properly analyze the applicable law.if we had some reasonable expectation that parents could do so,we would not need to hire attorneys for them at all.the fact of the matter is,stephanie was in jail,relying upon her counsel to spot the holes in ssa legal position.he simply failed to do so,and instead essentially conceded the sufficiency of ssa pleading and the applicability of section,subdivision g at the jurisdictional hearing.
additionally,at least one court has held that counsel failure to point out the inadequacy of a petition at the jurisdictional hearing would waive the defect for purposes of appeal as well.in re shelley th,d,but see in re alysha th,d.thus,if we were to conclude that stephanie only appellate remedy to challenge the jurisdictional issue was a direct appeal from that order,an appeal which is arguably waived by virtue of that very same ineffective assistance,we might be implicitly concluding she has no real remedy at all,that the error,o
