factual and procedural background 
deanna has a history of drug abuse.she has four children michael,now an adult,born in,born in and cody,born in.in may the children were removed from deanna custody after they were found wandering the streets unsupervised and dirty,and her home was found unsuitable for children.deanna was offered reunification services and the children were returned to her,but she was unable to comply and in august they were removed again.was eventually placed with vincent,her biological father.in february the court terminated deanna parental rights to cody,along with those of his biological father,and no appeal was taken.in vincent adopted cody and the court terminated its jurisdiction over the first dependency action.
vincent nonetheless allowed cody and to live with deanna,at least sporadically.in september the children were living with vincent when the agency learned his home lacked proper plumbing,and cody and had not bathed in more than a week and appeared at school dirty.the health department condemned the home as a safety hazard.vincent agreed to a voluntary services case plan but before the agency implemented it he was arrested for vandalism.it appears that on september the children were delivered to deanna,and they remained with her until october when she left the state.deanna left with the maternal grandmother and cody with,who was then years of age and could not provide adequate care for him.vincent was released from jail on october,but he did not retrieve the children.
on october,the agency placed cody and in foster care and filed petitions on their behalves under section,subdivision b the parents whereabouts were unknown.when the social worker asked cody where he and had been living,he said,w e mostly stayed with vince,but went back and forth between him and my mom.he said his mom did have a house so she would visit them where they lived with vincent.since vincent arrest,cody had been staying with deanna at a motel and at the home of a friend of deanna.he wanted to live with deanna even though she had no permanent housing.he did not want to live with vincent because of physical abuse.
the social worker wrote in the jurisdictional and dispositional report that d espite losing parental rights of cody,deanna has maintained a parental relationship with this child.cody and have a close bond with their mother and hope to eventually return to her care.the social worker recommended that vincent be offered reunification services for both children and deanna be offered services only for because her parental rights over cody were previously terminated.
on november the court continued the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing because the parents whereabouts remained unknown.the following day,deanna telephoned the social worker and explained she had left town for a few weeks and went to virginia to get my thoughts clear.deanna told the social worker that vincent adopted cody only so she could continue to have contact with him,and cody and had stayed with her for a year,prior to her being evicted.
on november the court again continued the jurisdictional hearing,noting vincent whereabouts remained unknown.on november vincent appeared,but deanna was not present.attorneys for deanna and cody moved for her designation as his presumed mother,and the court denied the motions without prejudice.the court again continued the matter.
deanna first appeared at a special hearing on december,during which the court set a briefing schedule for the presumed mother issue.in january deanna and cody submitted memoranda of points and authorities in support of their motions.cody memorandum stated vincent allowed the children to live with deanna soon after jurisdiction in the prior proceedings was terminated,and cody is in an adoption that has failed and there is an opportunity for him to live with his mother as his mother has continued to be an important person in his life.deanna memorandum stated that after termination of her parental rights over cody in she continued to maintain regular custody of cody.the motions sought reunification services for deanna to assist her in gaining custody of cody.
the agency opposed the motions,citing section,subdivision i.at a special hearing on february,the court denied the motions as improper collateral attacks on the earlier judgment of termination.
at a contested jurisdictional and dispositional hearing on february,the court sustained the petition,declared cody a dependent child and continued him in foster care.the court ordered vincent to comply with his case plan for cody and,and ordered deanna to comply with her case plan for r.the court,however,also ordered the agency to evaluate deanna home for possible placement of cody,explaining that i f she can qualify as a foster mom she could be the foster mother.additionally,the agency informally agreed to facilitate visitation between deanna and cody.the agency was concerned about deanna drug use and refusal to voluntarily undergo drug testing,and the court ordered her to report to the substance abuse recovery management system program.
discussion 
ipresumed mother status 
deanna and cody contend the juvenile court erred by determining that as a matter of law she can not be deemed a presumed mother in this proceeding because of the earlier termination of her parental rights over him they cite family code section,subdivision d,under which a man is a presumed father if he receives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.california differentiates between the rights of presumed,natural and alleged fathers,and p resumed father status ranks the highest.only a statutorily presumed father is entitled to reunification services under section,subdivision a and custody of his child under section.in re mary th,d.
the paternity presumptions are driven,not by biological paternity,but by the state interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family.citation.the familial relationship between a nonbiological father and an older child over two years of age,resulting from years of living together in a purported relationship,is considered more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity and should not be lightly dissolved.in re salvador th,d.
the scope of family code section,subdivision b has been expanded by case law to include granting presumed mother status to a nonbiological parent under certain circumstances in elisa,supra,cal th at page,d,the court held a lesbian was the presumed mother of twins born to her domestic partner,because she took them into her home and held them out as her natural children.in in re salvador,supra,th at pages,d,the court held that a woman who raised her half brother as her son from the age of three was his presumed mother under family code section,subdivision d,particularly since the boy believed she was his mother and that her biological children were his siblings.
deanna and cody cite no authority for the designation of a biological mother,whose identity is of course known,as a presumed mother.they assert she is entitled to presumed mother status in this action because after her parental rights were terminated in,cody continued to live with her and she held him out to be her biological son.
in rejecting that argument,the juvenile court relied on secti
