peggy sue mother appeals from an order granting custody of her minor son to her former husband,timothy slayton,father.we affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
the parties were married in.their first child,timothy,was born in.the child whose custody is at issue,turhan,was born in january.
in may,father left the marital residence,and in june he petitioned for dissolution.the court ordered the marriage dissolved in may.turhan continued to reside with mother,with visitation granted to father.
on december,apparently while serving an eviction notice,the police found turhan,who was then four years old,alone at mother residence.turhan was taken to child protective services and subsequently released to father.on december,father applied for and was awarded temporary custody of turhan in an ex parte proceeding.mother petition to regain custody was denied after a full hearing on march.
discussiona.standard of review 
the standard of appellate review of custody and visitation orders is the deferential abuse of discretion test.citation.the precise measure is whether the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the order in question advanced the best interest of the child.in re marriage of burgess cal th,d.
propriety of ex parte change in custody 
mother first contends the ex parte order of december,awarding temporary custody to father did not comply with family code section section because it was not supported by sufficient evidence to justify emergency removal of turhan from her custody.section authorizes a court to make an ex parte order granting or modifying custody where there has been a showing of immediate harm to the child or immediate risk that the child will be removed from the state of california.
there appear to be no decisions construing the immediate harm to the child provision of section.however,the legislature has clearly indicated that it considers the failure to provide adequate supervision of a child to be a serious and urgent matter.penal code section,subdivision a requires certain categories of persons to report child abuse or neglect and requires that the report be made immediately or as soon as is practicably possible by telephone general neglect of a child,as defined in penal code section,subdivision b includes the negligent failure of a person having the care or custody of a child to provide adequate food,clothing,shelter,medical care,or supervision where no physical injury to the child has occurred.italics added.the fact the legislature has elected to require the immediate reporting of a failure to provide adequate supervision supports the conclusion that such a failure should qualify as immediate harm for purposes of section.
in support of his ex parte application for custody,father submitted a declaration setting forth these facts on december,father received a telephone call from mother,who said turhan was missing.father went to mother residence and saw the police arresting mother for leaving turhan unattended.mother said she had asked a neighbor to watch turhan,but the neighbor denied this when father questioned her.the police directed father to child protective services,where turhan was released to him and he was told to apply for an ex parte order granting him custody.
thus,the court on december,had before it facts showing mother had failed to provide adequate supervision for turhan,mother had been arrested for that conduct,and turhan had been in the custody of child protective services until he was released to father.we can not say the trial court could not reasonably have concluded that the order in question,temporarily granting custody to father,advanced the best interest of the child.in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th,d.
moreover,even if mother were correct that the facts were not sufficient to support an ex parte change of custody under section,mother had adequate opportunity to litigate the custody issue when the court held a full hearing on march.at that hearing,mother testified concerning the december,incident as follows she and turhan were both ill.turhan fell asleep,and mother decided to go out to get some medication for herself.she tried to arrange for a neighbor to watch turhan but got no response when she knocked on the neighbor door.she decided to try to go to the store,although she had no car.when she came back,turhan was missing.she called the police and was told turhan had been taken to child protective services.she decided it would be better to allow father to take custody of turhan than to leave him with child protective services.
mother further testified that she had pled no contest to child endangerment.she denied having left turhan alone on any occasion other than december.
the court at the march hearing also heard testimony of david whitfield,who had been appointed to mediate the custody issue.whitfield testified that he conducted mediation sessions in may,january,and february.in the course of these sessions,he interviewed both parents,both children,a child protective services social worker,and a psychologist.
according to whitfield,mother said she would leave turhan home alone from time to time.he had serious concerns about mother judgment based on her willingness to leave turhan unattended and on his observations of her during the mediation sessions.he also had the impression mother was not emotionally or psychologically stable.he believed she had an obsessive preoccupation with her former relationship with father and might be using turhan as a tool to continue interacting with father.whitfield also testified that turhan had expressed a preference for father.
on this record,we can not say the court abused its discretion in denying mother request to regain custody.the court stated it had definite questions regarding mother judgment.those concerns were not unreasonable in light of the december incident and whitfield testimony.
moreover,notwithstanding its concerns,the court remained open to reconsidering the matter.the court several times stated it was willing to appoint an expert to conduct a custody evaluation pursuant to evidence code section and to review the matter after receiving the evaluator report accordingly,even if mother were correct that the court should not have granted custody to father ex parte,she suffered no ultimate prejudice as the same result was supported by the record at the full evidentiary hearing.
alleged improper delegation of authority to mediator 
mother next contends the trial court effectively delegated its authority to whitfield,the mediator,when it followed his recommendation that custody remain with father after the march,hearing.first,mother cites the fact the court denied her request that it personally interview turhan and instead relied on whitfield report of his interview with turhan.
mediation of custody issues is mandatory,subd.a.the report of a mediator in a custody case is evidence to be weighed with all other evidence in re marriage of rosson d,disapproved on another point in in re marriage of burgess,supra,cal th,fn,d.thus,the court properly could rely on whitfield report of his interview with turhan.the court certainly had the option of personally interviewing turhan,with the consent of the parties.see,tarling tarling d.however,there is no absolute requirement that minors always be interviewed in re jack d.
in fact,the court is only required even to consider the preference of the child if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent preference as to custody,subd.a.we are not aware of any reported decision holding that a child of five years,such as turhan,is of such capacity.as the court in this case pointed out,it was doubtful whether a child could realistically determine his own best interest.we therefore find no abuse of discretion in the court failure to interview turhan.
mother also argues the court reliance on whitfield deprived the parties of the right to representation by counsel.apparently,she refers to the fact that whitfield did not include counsel for the parties in his interviews.
a mediator has authority to exclude counsel from participation in mediation proceedings if,in the m
