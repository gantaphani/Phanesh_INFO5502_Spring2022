dooha testified at the hearing and stated that she had been a child welfare worker for years.for the past years,she had worked in the adoptions unit.her job sometimes involved finding placements it also involved supervising the placement until the adoption was completed.she stated that she had worked with hundreds of children and probably chosen the placement for dozens of them.she added that she had placed many children and had placed two other highly children in the past five years.she remarked that the severity of the medical needs of these two children was similar to those of 
the court asked dooha the following in comparison with the other two children that you were able to get adoptive parents for and,would her needs exceed or are they less than these other two special needs dooha responded one of them,i think,would be fairly equal to what disabilities are.the other child,it very interesting because in the beginning i might have said they were very comparable,but the other child just as she got older truly blossomed.you know,although she may have walked late or responded to things late,she did develop.so it difficult to know when they are just infants what their potential will be.but one of the children that i placed in utah i would say would be very comparable to.
dooha testified that she determined that was adoptable.when coming to this decision,she visited with,spoke with the social worker at the recovery center,and met with supervisors.she stated that she,cage,luk,and two others discussed and decided that she was adoptable.she said that in the past both luk and she had worked together and found homes for children,and they both were confident that there were families out there who would care for.the case was assigned to luk to find a home.she stated that she believed the parental rights had to be terminated prior to locating a family because there are a lot of families out there who do want to take a risk if a child is not freed according to dooha,prospective families do not want to invest the time if there is a chance the child will not be placed with them.dooha supervisor signed the adoptive placement assessment,which stated that they decided that was adoptable 
dooha acknowledged that would have to be off the trach before she could be placed with a family because she needed to be suctioned every minutes,and nobody can,except care,do that.she elaborated but part of what we do is assess when she is ready to leave that with the medical needs that she has would has there been a history of people with those needs finding adoptive homes and there have been.and that what we based our decision to find her adoptable.dooha emphasized that strengths were that she was a very charming little child.she got a very nice personality.she not a fussy baby she added that she responds to stimuli and plays with toys.
the court concluded that the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that is adoptable.the court explained has the benefit of a very experience d child welfare worker,dooha.there five different people working on this particular adoption case.wayne luk does make the point that some families will not consider placement of a child unless parental rights are already terminated.i not rushing to terminate parental rights for that purpose,but i do want this child situation assessed as quickly as possible given her tender age and her special needs so that the appropriate parent or set of parents are trained to deal with her special needs,which will have to happen here,and that this child gets into a stable family situation as soon as possible.and i do agree with the analysis that it would be good if we can identify that kind of person before the child is released from the current institution she in,that is the children recovery center.so the court does make a finding by clear and convincing evidence that.is adoptable and that there is a likelihood that she will be adopted.the court terminated parental rights.
mother filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
mother sole issue on appeal is that the juvenile court erred in terminating her parental rights because there was insufficient evidence to support its finding that is adoptable and is likely to be adopted within a reasonable period of time.
at the selection and implementation hearing held pursuant to section,a juvenile court must make one of four possible alternative permanent plans for a minor child the permanent plan preferred by the legislature is adoption.in re ronell a.th,italics omitted.a juvenile court may terminate parental rights and order a child placed for adoption only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the minor is likely to be adopted within a reasonable amount of time,subd.c see also in re zeth cal th.this is a low threshold,as the court must merely determine that it is likely that the child will be adopted within a reasonable time,subd.c in re th.
the issue of adoptability focuses on the minor on whether the child age,physical condition,and emotional state might make it difficult to find someone willing to adopt him or her.in re sarah th.the child need not already be placed in a potential adoptive home,nor must a proposed adoptive parent be waiting.see in re brian th.
on appeal,we review the factual basis for the trial court finding of adoptability and termination of parental rights for substantial evidence.in re josue th.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal,we look to the entire record to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the juvenile court.we do not pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses,attempt to resolve conflicts in the evidence,or determine where the weight of the evidence lies.rather,we draw all reasonable inferences in support of the findings,view the record in the light most favorable to the juvenile court order,and affirm the order even if there is other evidence that would support a contrary finding.citation.when the trial court makes findings by the elevated standard of clear and convincing evidence,the substantial evidence test remains the standard of review on appeal.citation.the appellant has the burden of showing that there is no evidence of a sufficiently substantial nature to support the order.citations.in re cole t
