plaintiff tammy cabral appeals from an adverse judgment entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend a demurrer addressed to her original complaint.plaintiff alleges that her former husband james cabral is substantially delinquent in payments of spousal and child support.to prevent her from enforcing these obligations plaintiff alleges that james and his sister mary soares induced their mother to change her will to leave to mary the of her estate that she had previously designated to go to james,with the understanding that mary would subsequently get that money to him.the mother,edwina cabral,has now died and her estate includes real property with an estimated fair market value in excess of.we conclude that the trial court correctly sustained a general demurrer to the complaint which seeks to reach of the value of the estate,but that it erred in refusing to grant leave to amend to correctly plead a cause of action under which plaintiff ultimately may be entitled to prevail.
background 
plaintiff complaint alleges that as of november james was delinquent in paying spousal and child support in the approximate amount of,and that since he has on several occasions been found in contempt for the failure to pay his support obligations.the complaint alleges that james has taken various steps to avoid enforcement of the support obligations,including not having a regular job with wages and working in a way that he would be paid in a manner that prevented plaintiff from enforcing the support obligations.the complaint continues,until shortly before her death,the will of edwina cabral provided that her three children would each receive a interest in her estate,which included the family home in newark,california with a free and clear market value in excess of,so that james would have received enough money to pay the past due support obligations in full.defendants mary soares and james cabral realized that the interest of james cabral would end up getting used to pay the past due support owed to plaintiff.in order to prevent that from happening,those defendants conspired and agreed to have the will modified shortly before edwina cabral died.the modification was to have the interest of james cabral instead get paid to mary soares so that she would end up with a two thirds interest.the intent of this arrangement was that mary soares would take the interest of james cabral,that mary soares would then hold that money,and that mary soares would then later get that money to james cabral in a manner to prevent plaintiff from receiving it for the past due support obligations.
the complaint further alleges that edwina will was so modified on may,with a bequest to james of the paltry sum of,that edwina died less than two months later,that the will was filed with the probate court in july,and that mary is the executor under the will paragraph,the final introductory paragraph of the complaint,reads in full as follows the last minute change in the will of edwina cabral very shortly before her death was probably done at a time when edwina cabral was not aware of what she was doing,was not mentally competent,was subject to undue influence by mary soares and james cabral,and was not the true expression of her intent since she had always previously expressed that she wanted to leave her estate to her three children in equal shares of each.the change was therefore not really a knowing and intelligent change by edwina cabral,but was a manipulation by mary soares and james cabral.alternatively,if edwina cabral was aware of what was being done,then she also was doing it for the purpose of defrauding plaintiff and of manufacturing a charade to have the money go to james cabral through mary soares in a way that was designed to keep plaintiff from being paid what the court ordered james cabral to pay for support.
the complaint contains five causes of action,the first alleging that t he last minute change to the will of edwina cabral was a fraudulent transfer within the meaning of the uniform fraudulent transfer act,et.the second cause of action alleges that the family home should be held in a constructive trust for plaintiff benefit up until and to the extent required to pay the past due support obligations in full and the third cause of action alleges that the property should be held in a resulting trust.the fourth cause of action seeks declaratory relief as to the rights and liabilities of the parties,including the rights of plaintiff to be paid from the interest that james cabral has in the estate and the property.plaintiff contends that she is entitled to enforce the support obligations against the property and other assets of the estate.the purported fifth cause of action is entitled conspiracy and alleges damages in an amount that equals the amounts owed to her by defendant james cabral,as well as attorneys fees and costs incurred herein.the prayer seeks compensatory damages,a judicial determination james cabral have a interest in the estate of edwina cabral and that plaintiff be allowed to execute against those assets to the extent needed to be paid in full for support obligations,both past,present,and future,and other relief.
the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to this complaint without leave to amend,with the following explanation this court lacks jurisdiction of plaintiff claims.plaintiff claim for declaratory relief seeks to contest the validity of the second will and must be brought in the probate court as a will contest.code of civil procedure.plaintiff other claims are dependent upon her claim that the second will should be set aside.plaintiff cites no authority allowing her to avoid the requirements for a will contest by phrasing her claims as tort claims.harootenian harootenian cal d.
plaintiff moved for reconsideration of this order,arguing that the court had incorrectly accepted defendants mischaracterization of her claim as arising out of a will,whereas the claim in fact is based upon an agreement between james and mary to hinder and defraud creditors and thus supports a fraudulent conveyance cause of action.the court tentative ruling was to grant the motion and to grant leave to amend the complaint to state a claim,if possible,based on an alleged agreement between defendant james cabral and any heir of edwina cabral to secretly transfer assets received from decedent estate to defendant james cabral.after argument,however,the court denied the motion for reconsideration on the ground that there were no new or different facts to support the application under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.the court acknowledged its authority to hear a motion for reconsideration on its own motion,but declined to do so with this explanation the court remains convinced that plaintiff can not proceed directly against mary soares based on decedent decision to exclude james cabral from her will.and,the court is not persuaded that a viable claim can be made against mary soares and james cabral based on an alleged agreement between them unless and until james receives some distribution of assets,in which case the family court assignment order appears to provide an adequate remedy.
the assignment order to which the court referred is an order entered in the family law department in the proceedings giving rise to the support orders against james.the court assigned to plaintiff until such time as the judgment herein is fully satisfied or this order is amended a ll rights to payment that james has from any third party including any right to payment that james may have now or in the future from mary soares or from joseph cabral or from any other source that relates to the will of edwina cabral,the estate of edwina cabral,any assets or funds from the will estate of edwina cabral.
