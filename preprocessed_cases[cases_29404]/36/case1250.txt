the father of a child was engaged in the business of cabinet installation.prior to his separation from his wife,he rented a home with sufficient space to house his business operation.after the separation,he continued to live in that rental home and to operate his business therefrom.he also took in a roommate,who paid per month in rent.the father collected the rent from the roommate and applied it towards the total rental bill.he construed as his own personal rent and allocated to his business operation.when the court determined the amount of child support the father would have to pay,it took the monthly payments from the roommate into consideration.the father contends that the court erred in doing so.we disagree and affirm the child support order.the monthly payments may be construed as either sublease income or a special circumstance to be considered when evaluating the cash flow available to provide for the child.
in addition to challenging the child support order,the father expresses deep concern over the manner in which the court system handles child custody matters and,specifically,how it allocates child custody time as between parents.in an articulate and impassioned oral argument,the father asked this court to order changes in the system and the standards by which child custody awards are determined.the father misapprehends the function of the appellate court.we are here to determine whether the trial court erred in applying existing law to the facts before it and in fashioning the child support order from which the father has perfected an appeal.it is not the function of the appellate court either to address matters from which no appeal was taken or to write new law.as we explain in greater detail below,we do not address the father many concerns that do not pertain to the child support order from which the appeal was taken.
bradford smith the father and parvaneh smith the mother were married in and had a son in.by the time the boy was three years old,the father and mother were suffering substantial marital difficulties.they separated and dissolution proceedings ensued.the father and mother became embroiled in a heated dispute concerning child custody and child support.
in may,the county of orange,represented by the district attorney office,sought payment of child support on behalf of the child.the father opposed the request.in his september,income and expense declaration,the father stated that he had earned in the preceding months and lived with his child and a friend.
in september,the court ordered the father to pay per month in temporary child support,beginning september.the order stated that c hild support had been ordered without benefit of a full evidentiary hearing and would be redetermined de novo at a subsequent hearing.
on november,the father and mother agreed to a shared custody schedule and a stipulation and order on order to show cause was entered accordingly.per the custody schedule,the father would have custody of the child from thursday through either sunday evening or monday evening alternating every other week and the mother would have custody from either sunday evening or monday evening until thursday morning.
on december,the father filed an order to show cause pertaining to child support.he requested that the amount of child support he paid be reduced to zero.he explained that he had been planning to resolve the child support issue after the custody issues were resolved.however,the father decided he could not wait any longer.he stated the reason i am pursuing this now is that the dmv is threatening to take away my drivers license as a result of this injustice by the court.
the orange county department of child support services county filed a motion seeking child support on march.again,the father opposed the motion,requesting that he pay nothing for child support.in his may,income and expense declaration,the father stated that he was a cabinet installer who had earned in the preceding months.on july,he filed a declaration wherein he stated that he lived in a rented home from which he operated his business.the declaration implied that he had at least one roommate and that he claimed a portion of his rental costs as a tax deduction with respect to his business.
the findings and recommendation of the commissioner were entered on july.the commissioner recommended that the father pay current child support of per month and a child support arrearage of,payable at the rate of per month beginning july.the commissioner found that the father had a roommate who paid rent,but did not find that the roommate rental payment constituted income to the father.on the other hand,she found that the father deducted a portion of his rent as a business expense on his tax return and that the amount of the deduction should be add ed back in because the deduction increased his cash flow.
the matter remained unresolved several months later and was heard before a judge.the judge granted the father request to file a new income and expense declaration and directed him to submit a declaration listing any facts and legal argument that would support his argument that the court ought not utilize the child support guidelines.the father filed his declaration on december.in that declaration,the father focused primarily on the mother behavior and what he called institutional prejudice and bias.
the judge expressed his ruling in a minute order dated december.he established the amount of the child support arrearage as and ordered the father to pay child support including arrearages in the amount of per month,beginning january.he also directed the county to prepare a formal order and a proposed statement of decision.
on april,the father filed his objections to the county proposed statement of decision and order.in his objections,the father stated,among other things,that he had a roommate with whom he had shared his rental home from a few months after the separation until the present time.the father explained the rental arrangement thus the father share of the monthly rent is,his roommate share is,and is expensed by the father business,which occupies the garage and the largest bedroom and is deducted as a business expense on his income tax filings.he also asserted that his monthly income for was,whereas the mother monthly income for was.
by minute order dated april,the judge rejected the proposed statement of decision and rendered his own.in the statement of decision,the judge found that in the father had netted per month and that the court was adding to that per month in rental income.the statement of decision provided more fully the father is a carpenter.he has rented a house since prior to his separation from the mother.he rented a house that would be large enough to accommodate his business.about two months after the parties separated,in,the father sublet a room in the house to a roommate for per month.capitalization omitted.the statement of decision also indicated that the court had considered reducing the amount of the child support arrearage but decided to exercise its discretion against doing so.
the court formal order was entered april.the father thereafter filed a motion for a new trial based on the inclusion of the rental as income.the father argued that the commissioner had already summarily disposed of the issue of whether his roommate rent might be considered income the father said that the judge raising of the issue amounted to an unfair surprise.furthermore,the father claimed that there was no evidence to support the finding that he had sublet a room to the friend.the father explained the father shares the residential portions of a rental home equally with his roommate.there is no evidence that respondent has any personal use of the roommate rent the father simply forwards the roommate rent directly to the landlord.the father acknowledged the accuracy of the court finding that he had rented the house,large enough to accommodate his business,prior to his separation from the mother.
the court,by minute order dated june,denied the motion for a new trial.it expressed alternative grounds therefor.first,it reiterated the finding that the father had sublet a portion of the leasehold and that the roommate rental payment constituted income to the father.second,it stated in the alternative that there were special circumstances under family code section,subdivision b that made it appropriate to consider the roommate rental payments in setting child support.in addition,the court stated that the statement of decision was amended to include the ruling on the motion for a new trial 
on july,the father filed his notice of appeal from the april,order.
discussiona.scope of appeal 
in his opening brief,the father acknowledges that he appeals from the april,order.at the same time,he seems to attack innumerable rulings made throughout the course of the proceedings,and indeed the entire concept of the proceedings themselves.he contends that his constitutional rights were repeatedly trampled and the rulings and proceedings were inequitable.he focuses most particularly on the proceedings that took place during a stretch,stating,the decision of the court for the period of march through november,is an abuse of discretion because it is a grave miscarriage of justice.he requests that this court reverse the child support order in whole from march,through november.
we are uncertain just how many separate orders the father intends to challenge within that period.however,the father does make clear that,at a minimum,he is challenging numerous orders granting continuances,orders pertaining to child custody and child support,and the court failure to appoint counsel to represent him,even though paternity was not at issue.
the father admits that the november,stipulation resulted in an arrangement whereby he had custody of the child for about percent of his waking hours and percent of his total hours and that the schedule has not materially changed.however,he remains disgruntled by the,temporary custody arrangement,which gave him less time with the child than he later received under the stipulation.the father says,the court erred when it restricted his equal custody of the child during the period between march and.the decision must be reversed because it was prejudiced by that error.
as we shall discuss,some of the father challenges to prior orders may have been preserved,to the extent that those prior orders materially affect the final order of april.however,the father challenges to other,orders have not been preserved.
some of the orders made prior to april,such as those establishing the percentage of custody time,are reflected in the guideline child support amount.to that extent,they are also reflected in the april,order.similarly,prior orders establishing arrearages may continue to be reflected to a degree in the april,order.to the extent that those prior orders affect the final order,they also may be challenged on appeal.this is so because the reviewing court may review the decision and any intermediate ruling,proceeding,order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party code civ.however,as we will show,the father has not demonstrated error with respect to that final order or its underpinnings.
as to other orders made over the years,it is insufficient for him to state in a general way that the proceedings have been consistently biased,prejudiced,inequitable or violative of constitutional rights.it is the appellant burden to demonstrate the existence of reversible error.citation.del real city of riverside th,d.as part of that burden,the appellant must identify each order that he asserts is erroneous,cite to the particular portion of the record wherein that ruling is contained,and identify what particular legal authorities show error with respect to each challenged order.mccomber wells th,d.the father has failed to meet this burden.
in addition,the father has not told us why he waited so long to make his challenges to the various,orders.as the county points out,the father has not explained why his purported appeals from the various orders are not time barred.see,code civ,reviewing court not authorized to review any order from which an appeal could have been taken county of yolo worrell d,fn.award of temporary child support is appealable.in his reply brief,the father states simply that the various orders were not appealable.however,he neither cites to any portion of the record identifying the particular orders he asserts are not appealable nor provides citation to legal authority with respect to their appealability.having failed to support his argument with citation to the record or to legal authority,it is waived.del real city of riverside,supra,th at,d schubert reynolds th,d akins state of california th,fn,d.
we recognize the fact that the father is appearing without the benefit of legal counsel.however,we are unable to ignore rules of procedure just because we are aware of that fact.when a litigant is appearing in propria persona,he is entitled to the same,but no greater,consideration than other litigants and attorneys citations.further,the in propria persona litigant is held to the same restrictive rules of procedure as an attorney citation.nelson gaunt d,fn.omitted see also gamet blanchard th,d.
order taking rental payments into consideration for child support calculation 
unfair surprise 
at the outset,we address the father argument that he was unfairly taken by surprise when,in december,the judge raised the issue of whether the payments should be construed as income to the issue the father says was not pending.we disagree with the father characterization of events.in her july,findings and recommendation,the commissioner specifically addressed the significance of the rental situation,and in particular,whether the roommate payments constituted income to the father.she stated therein court finds that father shares his home with another party who pays rent and will not include that as a part of father income.instead,the commissioner recommended that the amount of rent the father deducted as a business expense should be the amount that was taken into consideration in determining income.
however,it appears the findings and recommendation of the commissioner were not adopted.they never became the final order of the court.therefore,the issue of the effect of the rental arrangement on the father income remained undecided in december.the matter needed to be resolved and we are unpersuaded by the father argument that his rights were violated when the judge addressed it.
similarly,the father asserts that he was unfairly taken by surprise when the court applied the special circumstances rule of family code section,subdivision b against him.the father contends t he issue of applying special circumstances against him was not raised until his motion for a new trial.and then it was raised by the court therefore,application of the special circumstances exception against him was not at issue in this case.fn.omitted.
again,we disagree with the father characterization of events.in his offer of proof filed december,the father himself specifically raised the application of family code section,subdivision b.he did so before the april,order was entered and before the new trial motion was filed.even though the father did not raise section,subdivision b for the purpose of arguing against himself,he nonetheless put the application of the special circumstances rule in issue.that being the case,we can not countenance his claim of surprise.
furthermore,the father cites no authority for the proposition that a trial court can not amend its statement of decision after a new trial motion has been brought.it is the appellant obligation to cite legal authority to demonstrate error.mccomber wells,supra,th at,d.he did not do so.having addressed the father procedural arguments,we turn to the substantive issues involved.
general principles 
in reviewing the child support order,we bear certain principles in mind.first,child support awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.we observe,however,that the trial court has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation citation.furt
