renne appeals the judgment terminating her parental rights to her son,carl,carl,under welfare and institutions code section carl also appeals the judgment and renne and carl have each joined in the other appeal appellants argue parental rights should not have been terminated because the court did not consider whether the prospective adoptive parents would meet carl educational needs the prospective adoptive parents plan to home school carl constituted a legal impediment to adoption the court refused to hear evidence pertaining to carl specific educational needs,denying him due process the court should have admitted evidence on the issue of whether the section,subdivision c d exception to terminating parental rights applied and terminating parental rights was not in carl best interests.they also argue the court should not have summarily denied carl section modification petition brought after parental rights were terminated.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
carl has cerebral palsy,severe quadriparesis,a seizure disorder,and an uncontrolled and severe psychomotor delay.because of his disabilities,he will always require total care.he has lived at the children convalescent hospital in san diego since,when he was four months old.at the time of the july section hearing,he was almost eight years old,but had the emotional maturity of an child.
in march,when carl was three and years old,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed a section petition on his behalf.the petition alleged his parents had refused to provide him with necessary treatment and had left him without adequate support.the court made a true finding on the petition,declared carl to be a dependent,and removed him from parental custody.however,because father was incarcerated and renne failed to reunify with five other children,the court provided no reunification services and scheduled a section hearing.
a social worker assessed carl to be adoptable because a volunteer at the hospital,lynn,wanted to adopt him.based on that assessment,in november,the court found carl was adoptable and terminated parental rights.the parents separately appealed.in an unpublished opinion,in re carl,filed april,this court reversed the judgment terminating parental rights on the ground that the agency preliminary assessment of lynn did not comply with section,subdivision i because it contained no information about whether she had a criminal background or any referrals for child abuse or neglect,and did not address her parenting skills,her capacity to meet carl needs,or her understanding of the legal or financial responsibilities of adoption.we directed the court to hold a new section hearing after the agency submitted a proper assessment report to the court.
lynn adoption application was subsequently denied because she had a criminal record and a history with child protective services.after another prospective adoptive placement failed,the court instituted a permanent plan of foster care in january.
by july,the agency had located the family as a prospective adoptive family for carl.the family lived outside of sacramento and has cared for profoundly disabled children since.
in october,the family expressed an interest in adopting carl and sent an application to the agency.their son was also significantly developmentally disabled and attended the same school as carl.in november,the court scheduled a section hearing.
in december,carl filed a section modification petition seeking an order preventing his removal to a placement outside of san diego county.he asserted he had a strong relationship with lynn,the family wished to adopt him,and that he would be able to continue with the services and education he was receiving if he remained in san diego.after a lengthy hearing during which the court heard testimony on the issue of whether carl best interests would be better served by placement with the family or the family,the court denied the petition.carl appealed.in march,the agency informed the juvenile court that this court had upheld the lower court orders indicating that the agency had authorization to move carl to the adoptive home.the court scheduled a new section hearing and ordered that carl remain in the convalescent hospital until the issues raised at that hearing were resolved.
in may,carl filed another section modification petition seeking an order keeping him in san diego county.in his petition,he asserted that the family had completed their adoption evaluation and that it was in his best interests to remain in san diego.that petition was apparently scheduled to be heard at the same time as the section hearing.at the section hearing,however,the court indicated that it would address the issues raised in the section modification petition after it determined whether parental rights should be terminated.
the section hearing occurred in june and july.after hearing two days of testimony,the court issued a written ruling prohibiting carl and renne from producing evidence showing that the education carl would receive in san diego furthered his best interests to a greater extent than being home schooled by the family would.on july,the court terminated parental rights after finding that carl was adoptable because the family wanted to adopt him and had been approved for adoption and that none of the section,subdivision c exceptions applied.
immediately after the court terminated parental rights,carl filed a section modification petition seeking to modify the order the court had just issued he sought to remain in the hospital in san diego until the family had received their foster care license or had been approved as an adoptive home.the court denied the petition,finding that carl had not established changed circumstances.carl and renne separately appeal.
discussion 
iadoptabilitya.the juvenile court sufficiently assessed the prospective adoptive parents ability to meet carl needs 
appellants assert the judgment should be reversed because the court did not consider whether the family would meet carl educational needs.
the juvenile court may terminate parental rights only if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that it is likely the child will be adopted within a reasonable time,subd.c in re jennilee th,d.clear and convincing evidence requires a finding of high probability.the evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.it must be sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.citations citations.in re jerome th,d.review of a determination of adoptability is limited to whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence.in re lukas th,d.
the question of adoptability posed at a section hearing usually focuses on whether the child age,physical condition,and emotional state make it difficult to find a person willing to adopt that child.in re sarah th,d.if the child is considered generally adoptable,we do not examine the suitability of the prospective adoptive home.in re scott th,d.however,where the child is deemed adoptable based solely on the fact that a particular family is willing to adopt him or her,the trial court must determine whether there is a legal impediment to adoption.see,in re sarah,supra,th at,d.
here,all parties agree carl is adoptable only because the family is willing to adopt him.appellants assert that under these circumstances,the juvenile court must consider whether the family is suitable and,specifically,whether the family can meet carl special educational needs.
the agency disagrees.citing to in re scott,supra,th,d,in re sarah,supra,th,d,and in re th,d,the agency asserts that the inquiry is limited to whether there are any legal impediments to adoption under family code sections,and.family code sections,and respectively provide that a prospective adoptive parent must be at least years older than a child unless certain exceptions apply,a child older than must consent to adoption,and a prospective adoptive parent not lawfully separated from a spouse must obtain consent from the spouse.the agency further argues the question of the family suitability to adopt is an issue reserved for subsequent adoption proceedings.
we agree with the analysis in the cases cited by the agency that,as a general rule,the suitability of the prospective adoptive family does not constitute a legal impediment to adoption and is irrelevant to the issue of whether a child is likely to be adopted.in re scott,supra,th at,d in re sarah,supra,th at,d in re,supra,th at,d.if an inquiry into the suitability of prospective adoptive parents were permitted at the section hearing,many hearings would degenerate into subjective attacks on those prospective adoptive result not envisioned by the statutory scheme.in re scott,supra,th at,d.those types of inquiries might also discourage people from seeking to adopt,a result that would contravene the strong public policy favoring adoption.
however,the issue before this court is very is the proper scope of the inquiry by the juvenile court in determining the adoptability of a child who will require intensive care for life the children in the cases cited by the agency were generally adoptable,rendering the availability of prospective adoptive parents irrelevant to the adoptability findings.in re scott,supra,th at,d in re sarah,supra,th at,d in re,supra,th at,d.those courts did not address the proper scope of the inquiry the juvenile court must make when the child in question is adoptable only because one family is willing to adopt,nor did those courts determine the nature of the inquiry required where the child in question is completely developmentally disabled.thus,in re scott,in re sarah and in re are not on point and do not assist our determination of what the scope of the court inquiry should be to properly assess the adoptability of a child like carl,who will require total care for life.
a child who is specifically adoptable and who will need total care for life is at high risk of becoming a legal orphan if parental rights are terminated and the prospective adoptive family is later determined to be unsuitable this could occur if the courts analyze only whether there is a legal impediment to adoption,as indicated by in re scott,in re sarah,and in re to avoid rendering a total needs child a legal orphan,the assessment of the adoptability of such a child must necessarily include some consideration of whether the prospective adoptive parents can meet that child needs,since if the prospective adoptive parents can not meet the child needs,the child can not properly be found to be adoptable.the question becomes the extent of the inquiry to be conducted by the juvenile court at the section hearing in such a case.
the statutory scheme requires the agency to provide the court with a preliminary assessment of the eligibility and commitment of the prospective adoptive parents for the section hearing.that assessment includes a social history,screening for criminal records and prior referrals for child abuse or neglect,together with an assessment of the capability of the prospective adoptive parents to meet the child needs,and whether they understand the legal and financial rights and responsibilities of adoption,subd.g,subd.i,subd.b.
appellants argue that the phrase the capability to meet the child needs includes an assessment of the prospective adoptive parents specific educational plan.we disagree.although in order to meet a child needs,the parents must educate the child,there is no authority requiring the court to assess the specifics of how the child will be educated.because the agency obligation is to provide only preliminary information,the court inquiry should also be preliminary,and need not include an assessment of specific educational plans.
in our view,an inquiry into the prospective adoptive parents specific educational plan is not appropriate.parents have many options for how they provide an education for their child.they may send a child to public day school or continuation school or classes.admittedly,certain educational plans are better than others.the educational opportunities provided by public schools differ from student to student depending on multiple factors that may affect a particular student ability to learn.board of education rowley,d.public school districts vary widely in quality.some parents consider private education to be generally better than public education.home schooling has advantages and disadvantages.an inquiry into the prospective adoptive parents plan to educate could very easily degenerate into assessing which school districts are better or who could afford to send a child to the better private school.this is neither a necessary nor appropriate inquiry at a time when the court is conducting only a preliminary assessment of whether the child educational needs will generally be met.
further,there is no requirement that the state provide specialized educational services to disabled children to maximize each child potential commensurate with the opportunity provided to nondisabled children.board of education rowley,supra,at.if no such requirement is placed on the state,no such requirement may be placed on parents.simply stated,what the prospective adoptive parents must show is that they intend to educate carl.the court need make no further inquiry at the section hearing.
having concluded the court need not look at the specific educational plan,we turn to whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that the family would educate carl.the evidence amply supports that finding.
the family has been providing a home for disabled children since.their square foot home has one wing specially designed to accommodate profoundly disabled children.
the family has raised to special needs children.doing so is second nature to them.they have two total needs adopted children.the children play inside and outside and have access to a pool and a therapy whirlpool.the family takes the children on outings three times a week to visit family members who have children and also take them on special or recreational outings a few times a month.the children visit local ponds and feed the birds.
the family chose to home school their children in order to reduce their risk of exposure to bacteria and viruses,which the social worker thought was sensible.the social worker believed carl would thrive in the home of the family.
carl pediatrician believed carl should receive an education comparable to the education he was receiving in san diego the evidence showed the family would provide such an education.the charter school and the special education teacher who worked with the family were going to duplicate,to the extent possible,the education carl was receiving in san diego.the professionals involved were skilled and had treated children who had needs similar to carl.they believed they could meet carl needs and indicated they would order specific equipment for him if necessary.the charter school has funding available for each child that enabled the school to purchase a significant amount of equipment and toys for each child.further,a teacher would come to the home on a monthly basis to set up appropriate lesson plans.
appellants contend reversal is required because the court refused to consider carl educational needs at all.appellants base this argument on the court statement that w hat i am specifically not finding is whether carl needs are going to be met in the home.i ca make that finding because,based on my written ruling yesterday,which was based on the limited legal authority that i am aware of,i limited that inquiry at the hearing.and,therefore,i precluded counsel from i think counsel really wanted to do is for the minor and the mother,is to challenge that decision that the home would be appropriate.and my ruling prevented them from doing that.
this statement must be considered in context.the court referred to its written ruling from the previous day.that ruling limited appellants ability to introduce evidence showing that the family educational plan would not be in carl best interests.in other words,the court was not going to allow evidence as to which educational plan was superior.the court did not limit the ability of any party to show that the family did or did not intend to educate carl.further,the court had previously found that the agency made a threshold showing that carl educational needs would be met.the court sufficiently considered whether the family would educate carl,which is all that is required at the section hearing.substantial evidence supports the finding that the family would meet carl educational needs.
b.the plan to home school carl does not constitute a legal impediment to adoption 
appellants assert the judgment should be reversed because the plan to home school carl constitutes a legal impediment to his adoption by the family.they argue the individuals with disabilities education act et the idea requires that carl attend public school.
congress enacted the idea to address the special educational needs of children with disabilities.the impetus for the idea arose from the efforts of parents of disabled children to prevent the exclusion or expulsion of disabled children from public schools.school committee of the town of burlington,massachusetts department of education,d burlington.the idea ensures that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living.d a.
the crux of appellants argument is that the idea requires parents to send their disabled children to public school.they cite no authority that supports this proposition to the contrary,parents rights to direct their child upbringing is a compelling right ranked among the most basic of civil rights.citation.american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d.a statute that would require a parent to place a child in public school would be an unconstitutional deprivation of the parents liberty rights to determine how their child should be educated.pierce society of sisters.people turner,d supp.
in any event,the idea does not require that parents place their children in public school.the idea requires participating state and local educational agencies to assure that disabled children and their parents or guardians are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education to such disabled children.burlington,supra,at,italics added see also a.the purpose of the idea is to prevent school officials from removing a disabled child from a public classroom.burlington,supra,at.it is a requirement imposed on state and local educational agencies,not parents.indeed,the educational choice made by the parents for a disabled child need not meet the standards required by the idea.florence county school district four carter,d.simply stated,the idea prevents state and local agencies from excluding disabled children from public school it does not govern the actions of parents who choose to home school their children.
appellants argue the family could not home school carl because his special advocate casa had the sole right to make educational decisions on his behalf.their argument implies the court order that the casa makes educational decisions for carl continues in perpetuity,unless changed by the court.they are incorrect.
a court may limit the parents ability to make educational decisions on their child behalf,subd.a.if the court does so,it appoints a responsible adult to make the educational decisions,subd.a.however,under that section,the court may limit the right of a parent to make educational decisions only when the child is a dependent,subd.a.once carl is adopted,he will no longer be a dependent child and the appointment of the casa to make educational decisions will necessarily end.the casa preference is therefore irrelevant.
appellants maintain that carl individualized education program iep requires that he attend a public school.they are incorrect.an iep is a comprehensive statement of a disabled child educational needs and the specifically designed instruction and related services that will meet those needs.burlington,supra,at.it is developed by a school official qualified in special education,the child teacher,and the parents.ibid.it guides the school system as to how the child will be educated.however,parents may disregard the iep and educate their child in a manner different from that specified by the iep burlington,supra,at.florence county school district four carter,supra,at.thus,the family may disregard the current iep.
moreover,an iep is reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary.d.because carl last iep was dated october,he would have been due for a new iep in october,three months after the section hearing.that new iep would take into account the family wish to home school him.the decision to home school is not a legal impediment that prevents adoption.
carl due process rights were not violated when the court refused to hear evidence on the educational programs available in san diego county 
appellants assert the judgment must be reversed because carl due process rights were violated by the court refusal to allow him to produce evidence about his educational needs 
procedural due process pertains to notice and the opportunity to be heard.in re crystal th,d.due process rights exist at the section hearing.in re jeanette th,d.however,the right to present evidence is limited to presenting relevant evidence of significant probative value to the issue before the court.id.at,d.
as discussed above,the issue at the section hearing is whether the prospective adoptive parents intend to educate the child.the hearing does not involve a qualitative assessment of the best possible way to provide that education.carl counsel acknowledged that the testimony she sought to introduce was relevant to the issue of which educational plan would be better for carl she stated,i ca,in all frankness,say that we can give this there would be evidence to this court that the home is totally void in benefit to carl educationally.i not suggesting that.in other words,carl was not seeking to introduce evidence that the family was not going to educate him,which would have been allowed under the court ruling he was seeking to introduce evidence that he believed the education he would receive in san diego would be superior to that he would receive in the home.because this is not relevant to whether the family would meet carl need to receive an education,the court properly excluded it.carl due process rights have not been violated.
the exception to terminating parental rights set forth in section,subdivision c d does not apply 
appellants assert the court committed reversible error by refusing to allow them to produce evidence regarding the applicability of the section,subdivision c d exception.
section,subdivision c d provides that parental rights should not be terminated when,t he child is living with a relative or foster parent who is unable or unwilling to adopt the child because of exceptional circumstances,that do not include an unwillingness to accept legal or financial responsibility for the child,but who is willing and capable of providing the child with a stable and permanent environment and the removal of the child from the physical custody of his or her relative or foster parent would be detrimental to the emotional of the child.
appellants argue the court should have considered the section,subdivision c d exception in light of carl relationship with lynn.they acknowledge that this exception is not precisely applicable because lynn is neither carl relative nor foster parent,he was not living with her,and he would not be removed from her custody.they urge us,nonetheless,to find error in the juvenile court refusal to consider the exception.the plain meaning of section,subdivision c d does not allow us to do so.
we begin by examining the words of the statute if the statutory language is not ambiguous,then we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.in re austin th,d see also franzosi santa monica community college dist.th,d.there is nothing ambiguous in section,subdivision c d thus,its plain language governs.it applies only when the child is living with a foster parent or relative who
