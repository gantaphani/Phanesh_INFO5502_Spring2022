in this juvenile dependency case,melinda mother appeals from the court finding at the review hearing that reasonable reunification services had been provided.at the hearing,the court also ordered a continuation of reunification services to which mother had no objection.because the juvenile court order continuing reunification services was not adverse to mother interest,we conclude that she is not an aggrieved party and that the finding of reasonable reunification services is not directly appealable.however,because we recognize that such a finding may have negative consequences at subsequent hearings,we also conclude that the finding may be reviewed on a petition for writ of mandate.we therefore treat mother appeal as a writ proceeding,and in reaching the merits conclude that substantial evidence supports the juvenile court finding and deny the writ.
factual and procedural background 
the minor first came to the attention of the department of children and family services the department in september.she was nine years old and had been abandoned by her mother.the minor was living with her father girlfriend hereafter the caretaker who reported the child sexual abuse by her father and uncle.the minor was ordered detained by the juvenile court,and her father and uncle were arrested for the sexual abuse.
at the detention hearing in early october,the court ordered that the minor receive counseling.she was placed with the caretaker shortly after the detention hearing.the department was able to locate the mother,who appeared in court on october.she received appointed counsel at that time.
at the hearing on january,the juvenile court declared the minor a dependent of the court.the court ordered that she continue to be placed with the caretaker,that family reunification services be provided for both parents,and that the minor participate in individual counseling to address sexual abuse and abandonment issues.the court learned that the minor was on a waiting list for counseling,and that the caretaker planned to enroll the child in her health plan.the court also ordered that the minor and her mother participate in conjoint counseling when the minor therapist determined it to be appropriate.mother was ordered to participate in parenting classes and individual counseling to address anger management.she was permitted weekly monitored visits,which the department had discretion to liberalize.the juvenile court ordered the department to assist in obtaining victim assistance funds so that the minor would not have to remain on a waiting list for counseling.
on june,at the first review hearing,the department reported that mother was in compliance with her case plan she had completed her parenting classes,continued weekly individual counseling,and was consistent in visiting her daughter.the social worker reported that he had just learned from the caretaker that the minor was not yet enrolled in individual counseling because the counseling center required a copy of the court order.
counsel for mother then requested a contested hearing on the issue of the minor counseling,which was a precondition to conjoint counseling.the hearing was set for june.in the interim,the minor met with a counselor who scheduled her for weekly individual therapy sessions.the department also located a therapist to conduct the conjoint counseling,it increased mother monitored visits from one hour per week to three hours per week,and recommended unmonitored and overnight and weekend visits.
at the contested hearing on june,the social worker testified that he had received the case in late february and was aware of the order for individual counseling for the minor.he learned in late april or early may that the prior social worker had asked the caretaker to enroll the minor in counseling,but that enrollment was not accomplished because the caretaker had not provided the appropriate court order to the counseling center.he faxed the necessary order to the center and made calls.he also arranged for conjoint counseling,which was to begin within the next days.
at the conclusion of the social worker testimony,mother attorney requested that the court find that the department had not provided reasonable reunification services and that the court order reunification services to be extended for five months,calculated as the period from disposition to the present.the court inquired so are you just asking for,in essence,another five months in addition to the family reunification services we are already recommending counsel answered yeah,i guess i am.the court denied the request.while acknowledging that there had been delays due to the caretaker failure to get the minor into therapy,the court nevertheless found that the social worker albeit late,finally picked up the ball and started running to get the counseling sessions in place.the court therefore found that mother had been provided all of the reunification services that the department had been ordered to provide at the disposition hearing.
the court further found that mother had fully complied with the case plan,but that returning the minor to mother custody at that time would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child safety,protection,physical or emotional.the court ordered that mother have unmonitored visits,and gave the department discretion to place the minor with mother within the next reporting period if appropriate.the department was also given discretion to allow overnight and weekend visits.the court ordered that individual and conjoint counseling continue.in addition,the court made a finding that there was a substantial probability that the minor may be returned to her mother within the next six months,and set the matter for a review hearing in december.
mother appealed from the order of the court dated june,finding that petitioner has provided mother and minor with reasonable family reunification services since dispositional orders were entered by the court on january.after the parties filed their briefs,the department moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court finding that reasonable reunification services had been provided is not directly appealable.
discussion 
the juvenile court finding that reasonable reunification services had been offered is not directly appealable it must be challenged by way of a petition for writ of mandate 
t he scope of a party right to appeal is completely a creature of statute.in re daniel th,d.the legislature has complete control over the right to appeal and may restrict,alter or even abolish that right.ibid.to govern appeals in dependency proceedings,the legislature has enacted welfare and institutions code section which provides a judgment in a proceeding under section may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment,and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment a dispositional order constitutes an appealable judgment.in re daniel,at,d steve superior court th,d.thus,pursuant to section,the juvenile court dispositional and following orders are directly appealable,with the exception of an order setting a selection and implementation hearing under section,which is reviewable only by petition for extraordinary writ,subd.l,cal.rules of court,rule b dwayne superior court th,d in re cicely th,d.
mother claims that her appeal is authorized by section.the question before us is whether section authorizes an appeal of a finding contained within an order after judgment.we conclude that the language of section,which authorizes an appeal from an order after judgment,does not authorize an appeal from the isolated finding in this case that reasonable reunification services had been provided.compare permitting appeal of an order after judgment with cal.rules of court,rule b b permitting a writ challenging the juvenile court findings and orders.we also recognize,however,that the issues determined within an order after judgment may not be challenged after the time for appeal has passed.for this reason,we further hold that a juvenile court finding contained within an otherwise unappealable order after judgment may be challenged by petition for writ of mandate.our conclusion both fosters a substantive and meritorious review by the appellate court of all significant juvenile court findings and comports with the strong public policy against protracted litigation in dependency cases.in re nicholas th,d.
the juvenile court is required to make numerous specific findings throughout the dependency process.for example,when family reunification services have been ordered,the court is required expressly to make a finding at each subsequent hearing as to whether reasonable services have been provided during each review period,subd.a b,subds.e f.when the juvenile court makes a finding that reasonable services were provided,a parent or legal guardian may not be immediately impacted by that finding.here,for example,mother was not aggrieved by the finding that reasonable reunification services were provided,given that services were continued for at least another six months and no negative consequence flowed from the reasonable services finding.we do not believe that section permits a party to appeal a finding in the absence of an adverse order resulting from that finding.accordingly,we conclude that there is no right to appeal a finding that reasonable reunification services were provided to the parent or legal guardian unless the court takes adverse action based on that finding,because,in the absence of such action,there is no appealable order resulting from that finding.
it is important to note that mother does not challenge the nature or adequacy of the reunification services ordered.nor does she challenge the juvenile court order to continue such services.additionally,mother does not challenge the court order that her daughter not be returned to her based on its finding that doing so would be detrimental to the child safety,protection,physical or emotional.mother does not contest the court finding of detriment,nor does she contend that her daughter should have been returned to her at the review hearing.indeed,our conclusion would be different if the court had found that the child return to mother would be detrimental to her because mother had not availed herself of services provided when mother contended that the department had failed to provide her with reasonable services.in that event,the juvenile court order that the minor not be returned to mother would be premised on its finding that reasonable services had been provided,and a direct appeal from that order would be appropriate and necessary to address the issue.see in re cicely,supra,th at,d orders made at six and review hearings are immediately appealable.
had mother contended that the juvenile court took some adverse action against her on the basis of its reasonable services finding,this case would be similar to steve superior court,supra,th at pages,d,where the reviewing court held that the father failure to appeal from the order made at the review hearing,which contained findings that reasonable services had been provided and that the father failure to participate in the services was prima facie evidence that return of the child to the father would be detrimental,precluded later review of the order on a petition for extraordinary writ.where the two findings of reasonable services and detriment are intertwined,we agree that any challenge to those findings would be waived by the parent failure to timely appeal the review order which contained those findings.the cases relied on by mother,where courts addressed reasonable services findings on appeal,likewise involved challenges to interrelated findings that resulted in some negative consequence to the parent.see in re julie th,d mother challenged reasonable services finding in the context of an appeal from the order made at the review hearing that mother had not made satisfactory progress and that this lack of progress required strictly limited visitation with the children in re kristin d.mother challenged sufficiency of reunification services on appeal in the context of additional claims that the reunification plan itself was inadequate and that the court failed to exercise its jurisdiction concerning visitation.
nor are we persuaded that in re alvin th,d requires us to hold that the reasonable services finding here is appealable.in that case,after the father pled no contest to a petition alleging he had abused his son alvin,the juvenile court ordered the father and son to participate in conjoint counseling after alvin completed eight sessions of individual counseling.the court also ordered the father to participate in individual counseling and a parent education class.id.at,d.alvin did not wish to visit his father,and both the court and social worker recognized that visitation would probably not take place without conjoint therapy.but there was a delay before alvin individual counseling began.id.at,d.at the review hearing,the court found that returning alvin to his father would create a substantial risk of detriment to alvin physical or emotional.the court also found that the father had complied with his case plan and that reasonable reunification efforts had been made because any delay in commencing alvin counseling was caused by the caretaker scheduling and transportation difficulties.the court ordered six additional months of services and set a review hearing.id.at,d.
the father appealed the order made at the review hearing and specifically challenged both the findings that reasonable reunification services had been provided and that returning alvin to him would create a substantial risk of detriment.the appellate court held that no substantial evidence supported the finding that reasonable reunification services were offered and vacated that finding,but otherwise affirmed the review order.in re alvin,supra,th at,d.though the appellate court did not address appealability of the court reasonable reunification services finding,we do not believe that such a discussion was necessary,given that the finding of whether reasonable services had been provided appears to have been intertwined with the finding of detriment.in affirming the juvenile court finding that it would be detrimental to return alvin to his father custody,the appellate court expressly cited the issue of i nsufficient counseling to address alvin emotional trauma as one element of substantial evidence supporting the finding.id.at,d see also father argument that the despite the presence of additional evidence supporting a finding of detriment,that finding should nevertheless be reversed in order to hold the department accountable,because the absence of reasonable services to address visitation and alvin counseling needs have put him in a catch in which there will always be evidence of detriment.thus,as in steve,the alvin court acknowledged the connection between the finding of detriment and the failure to provide reasonable services.here,in contrast,the reasonable services finding stands alone it was not connected to the finding of detriment by the juvenile court.
indeed,mother is challenging only the reasonable services finding.the juvenile court took no action adverse to mother on the basis of its specific finding that reasonable services had been provided to her.the court made no finding of detriment based on mother participation or lack of participation in services.to the contrary,the court found that mother was in compliance with the case plan and was complimentary of her progress.the order was favorable to mother the court continued reunification services for another six months,gave the department discretion to return the minor to mother within that time period and specifically found a substantial probability that the minor would be returned to mother within that time period.
despite our conclusion that a reasonable services finding,by itself,is not appealable,we recognize that postdisposition orders in dependency proceedings are comprised of numerous findings and that many of those findings are premised on related findings which have been made during previous hearings.generally,the findings made at each the extent they are against a parent or legal guardian interest in form the basis of an adverse order which is immediately a
