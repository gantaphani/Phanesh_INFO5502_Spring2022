the business sold as expected.each party received a payment of and a promissory note for,to be paid off at percent interest over six years.each,accordingly,received quarterly payments of just under.in any event,and irrespective of any other amounts received by sylvia,under the settlement agreement,til agreed to pay family support to sylvia in the amount of per month effective january,through march.that sum increased to per month effective april,through august,and then decreased to per month as of september.it is not clear why the sum decreased as of september,but it seems likely that the decrease reflected the expectation sylvia would be receiving payments on the promissory note from the sale of the business.the parties also recognized til actual income fluctuated,and further agreed support would be reviewed every six months and adjustments made as appropriate.
four months later,til support obligations were reduced to,in part because the parties son was then living,full time,with til,and in part because til income had decreased.the amount of support was calculated through the dissomaster program.for purposes of calculations through the dissomaster,til gross monthly income was shown as in wages and income,and each party was charged with in other taxable income,representing payments of both interest and principal on the promissory notes.two months later,the parties son moved back into sylvia household.some adjustments to the amount of support appear to have been made,and til thereafter paid sylvia somewhere between and support per month.later support negotiations also assumed each party was receiving in other taxable income.
the idea originally had been that sylvia would pursue a degree in elementary school education with the goal of becoming an elementary school teacher.her plans were delayed for various reasons,but she graduated from sonoma state university in may,obtained a substitute teaching credential in december,took additional required courses during,and passed the cbest test in august.sylvia then decided to change her career path and instead go into real estate sales.
in june,til filed a motion to modify support,complaining sylvia was not making reasonable academic progress as contemplated by the marital settlement agreement,and asserting his income had dropped.sylvia responded,complaining til had not paid the full amount of support required by the marital settlement agreement.in the end,the parties stipulated that til motion would be dropped from the calendar,that he would pay sylvia on or before february,plus an additional nondeductible support by the same date.the parties further agreed til support payments would be per month.the parties stipulated that either party was entitled to seek judicial review of the support award by motion or orders to show cause set to be heard on or after september.their stipulation was incorporated into an order entered on may.
the promissory notes were paid off in spring.although the result was an immediate drop in income of per month,sylvia did not seek a modification of the support order.
motion for modification of support 
in early,til filed another motion to modify support.he pointed out that the may order allowed him to seek judicial review of the support order anytime after september.til asserted sylvia had been enjoying a standard of living equal to or in excess of his own,had abandoned her plans to become a teacher to go into real estate and had been licensed for almost two years.til asked the court to impute an income of per month to sylvia and to reduce support accordingly.
sylvia responded,stating the actions she had taken towards obtaining her teaching credential.she explained she had realized her income would be dropping in spring,and believed it would take another months for her to obtain her teaching credential.she had become concerned that because of her age and the competition she would face,she was effectively unemployable as an elementary school teacher.she felt she needed to do something to accelerate her capacity to generate income.she also felt that the flexible schedule she would enjoy as a realtor would allow her to continue to be available to the parties minor child.sylvia supervisor at her real estate office testified sylvia had the attributes to succeed in that field and was taking the actions that would allow her to succeed.the supervisor acknowledged sylvia had earned commissions of only during the last half of the previous year,and had earned no commissions during the first half of.the supervisor explained it generally took time for agents to develop business,stating her opinion that sylvia actually had done very well for her first year in real estate.
til also submitted a vocational assessment of sylvia,done by rachel hawk of,vocational expert services,that confirmed that teaching jobs would be difficult to obtain.hawk opined that sylvia was pursuing an occupational goal which appeared to be realistic for her.hawk believed sylvia should be able to earn a mean annual salary of after her second year of full time work in real estate and in her third year of practice.she reported that local research indicated some agents make nothing during the first year,and that agents needed to have substantial supplemental income for a year or two.finally,she wrote it was reasonable to expect sylvia to need a period of two years to fully establish her reputation and network of contacts in order to earn per year.
in the meantime,til income had continued to rise.he had earned in wages and compensation during.for,it was expected til would receive draws of twice a month,plus a vehicle allowance of,plus adjustments based on commissions earned.

the court declared itself puzzled by sylvia failure to save money,writing but by the same token,the court is at a loss as to how sylvia,over the past seven years,has been unable to accumulate any savings from the significant funds that she received from the sale of the community business.had sylvia made prudent use of those funds,the court strongly believes that she would be enjoying a lifestyle much closer to that of the marital standard of living than she is at this time.to allow sylvia current financial situation and lifestyle to govern this decision without considering the amount of funds she has gone through in the
