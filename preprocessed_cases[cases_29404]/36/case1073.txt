factual background and procedural history 
during the summer of,plaintiff and appellant jennifer chiba began a romantic relationship with singer and songwriter elliot smith aka steven paul smith.on august,chiba moved in with smith.the couple lived together until smith died intestate on october.the probate court appointed defendant and respondent marta greenwald administrator of smith estate.
i.the complaint 
on july,chiba sued greenwald for breach of oral contract,quantum meruit,declaratory relief and constructive trust.
the complaint alleged that chiba and smith entered into an oral agreement in august.chiba and smith allegedly agreed to live together,cohabitate and combine their efforts and earnings,share equally any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts whether individual or combined,and hold themselves out to the public as husband and wife.the complaint claimed smith promised to provide for chiba financial needs and support for the rest of her life in exchange for her domestic services as his homemaker,housekeeper,cook,secretary,bookkeeper and financial counselor,forgo ing any independent career opportunities.
in a separate paragraph,the complaint also alleged that chiba had agreed to be smith manager and agent for the purposes of arranging his booking and scheduling his appearances for musical performances and to carry out the preparation and production of his album in exchange for of the proceeds earned and received.
chiba claimed greenwald breached the agreement by refusing to pay her for performing her contracted services.chiba attached to her complaint a creditor claim in excess of million for the contracted services she rendered to smith and for the proceeds from his compositions,performances and albums.
ii.chiba deposition testimony 
in her deposition of september,chiba testified that her agreement with smith provided she would be his manager and agent responsible for booking and scheduling his appearances for musical performances.chiba confirmed that the agreement provided she would be specifically entitled to percent of the proceeds earned and received on all of smith performances and album sales.chiba also stated that she actually procured venues and negotiated performance fees for smith in new york and los angeles.
iii.the first amended complaint 
on november,chiba filed her first amended complaint,in which she omitted in its entirety the paragraph detailing her role and rate of commission as smith manager and agent.instead,she added the terms manager and agent to the list of her duties as homemaker,housekeeper,cook,secretary,bookkeeper and financial counselor.
iv.referral to the labor commissioner 
on december,greenwald moved to stay the action and refer the matter to the labor commissioner to resolve whether the contract involved the services of a licensed talent agency with respect to the taa.the trial court granted the motion on january.
on november,the labor commissioner determined that chiba and smith had entered into one integrated agreement that included the performance of unlawful procurement activities mixed in with activities for which a talent agency license was not required.according to the labor commissioner,the fact that chiba ha d abandoned her prior claim for commissions for her procurement activities was essentially irrelevant to the validity and enforceability of the alleged oral agreement between her and smith.because chiba was not a licensed talent agency,the labor commissioner found the oral agreement was void from its inception,in its entirety and that chiba had no enforceable rights.
trial de novo 
on march,the trial court lifted the stay,granted chiba request for a trial de novo from the labor commissioner ruling,and consolidated the trial de novo into the existing case.
in its minute order,the court determined that greenwald demurrer to the first amended complaint would be treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court found chiba had pled inconsistently the tasks she allegedly performed for smith in the complaint and first amended complaint.it judicially estopped chiba from pleading that she acted as smith manager and agent for the purposes of arranging the booking and scheduling appearances for musical performances,and then omit ting these allegations in a subsequent complaint to avoid the legal consequences of these acts.the court gave chiba leave to amend to correct her inconsistent pleadings.
vi.the second amended complaint 
on april,chiba filed her second amended complaint,the operative complaint,which divided her agreement with smith into two separate parts the cohabitation agreement and the recording management agreement.
the cohabitation agreement consisted solely of chiba promise to be smith homemaker,housekeeper,cook,secretary,bookkeeper and financial counselor,forgoing any independent career opportunities.in consideration,smith agreed to provide for all of chiba financial needs and support for the rest of her life.
the recording management agreement consisted solely of chiba promise to be smith manager and agent for the purposes of arranging his booking and scheduling his appearances for musical performances,and to prepare and produce his albums.in consideration,smith agreed to give chiba percent of the proceeds.
in her second amended complaint,chiba conceded that she had not been and was not licensed as a talent agency,and was unaware that licensure was required under the taa.she further expressly conceded that her lack of a talent agency license rendered the recording management agreement void and unenforceable.in addition,chiba pled that she would not seek to enforce any of her rights under the recording management agreement.instead,she sought to sever the recording management agreement and to pursue all her remedies only under the cohabitation agreement.
vii.demurrer to the second amended complaint 
on june,the trial court sustained greenwald demurrer to the second amended complaint without leave to amend.
the court found inconsistency in the pleadings of the complaint and its amended versions.although the second amended complaint was found to be artfully pleaded,the court nonetheless determined the unlawful and lawful services chiba allegedly rendered to be inextricably intertwined.the court held that chiba had failed to correct the defect present in her first amended complaint and to demonstrate that the taa should not apply to the entire contract.
the court declined to sever the unlawful from the lawful activities of the contract,because the public policy rationale for the talent agencies act must be maintained and is applicable to all causes of action in the second amended complaint.as a result,the court found the contract void and dismissed the action.
viii.motion to vacate dismissal 
on july,chiba moved to vacate the dismissal based upon new case authority in marathon entertainment,blasi holding that with respect to an unlicensed talent agency the lawful and unlawful portions of a personal management contract might be severable.see marathon entertainment,blasi june.adfor supreme court opinion,see cal th,review granted,marathon.for supreme court opinion,see cal th.
on august,the trial court declined to sever the unlawful from the lawful acts contained in the agreement,because the activities which have been alleged would nevertheless be because they were mixed with activities which required a license and because of the overriding public policy of deterring unlicensed activities.even so,the court observed one of the things that did strike me about the marathon case it interesting that it went into a discussion of marvin marvin cal d,marvin because we have two people that lived together and never got married.the court found the existence of a marvin relationship in this case to be a complication because,unlike other taa cases that involved a purely commercial relationship,chiba was someone who has violated the talent agencies act and has done this in the context of her personal relationship with the deceased.the court ultimately found the underlying facts to be unlike marathon,but rather like waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d waisbren and the line of cases that have made up the talent agency law.
chiba timely appealed from the order dismissing the second amended complaint.
discussion 
the issue before us is whether the taa bars compensation for all services performed under an agreement which is in part a marvin agreement but in which a portion of the agreement is made void by the lack of a talent agency license.
standard of review 
on appeal from an order dismissing a complaint after the sustaining of a demurrer,we independently review the pleading to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,berger california ins.guarantee th,d.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,treat ing the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.aubry,supra,cal th at,d.we liberally construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties.code civ,kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d.
ii.the pleadings show chiba lacked a talent agency license 
the taa provides that n o person shall engage in or carry on the occupation of a talent agency without first procuring a license therefor from the labor commissioner.talent agency means a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring,offering,promising,or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists,except that the activities of procuring,offering,or promising to procure recording contracts for an artist or artists shall not of itself subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under this chapter,subd.a.
unlike talent agents,personal managers are not covered by the act.personal managers primarily advise,counsel,direct,and coordinate the development of the artist career.they advise in both business and personal matters,frequently lend money to young artists,and serve as spokespersons for the artists.citation.park deftones th,d see waisbren,supra,th at,d.however,if a personal manager even incidentally performs the occupation of a talent agency by soliciting or procuring artistic employment or engagements for an artist,the personal manager must comply with the licensing requirement under the taa.waisbren,supra,th at,d.the rationale for denying a personal manager recovery even for activities which were entirely legal is based on the public policy of the act to deter personal managers from engaging in illegal activities.citation.knowing they will receive no help from the courts in recovering for their legal activities,managers are less likely to enter into illegal arrangements.citation.in waisbren,the court observed one reason the legislature did not enact criminal penalties for violation of the act was because the most effective weapon for assuring compliance with the act is the power to declare any contract entered into between the parties void from the inception.citation.yoo robi th,d.
the labor commissioner has original and exclusive jurisdiction over issues arising under the taa.styne stevens cal th,d.in cases of controversy arising under the taa,the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the labor commissioner,who shall hear and determine the same,subject to an appeal within days after determination,to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo,subd.a.a hearing de novo literally means a new hearing,or a hearing the second time it is in no sense a review of the hearing previously held,but is a complete trial of the controversy,the same as if no previous hearing had ever been held a hearing de novo therefore is nothing more nor less than a trial of the controverted matter by the court in which it is held buchwald katz cal d,see yoo robi,supra,th at,d.
here,in her second amended complaint,chiba concedes that she was not licensed as a talent agency,that her lack of a talent agency license rendered the recording management portion of the agreement void and unenforceable,and that she would not seek compensation for services rendered that required licensure.the only issue is whether she may enforce the remainder of the agreement.
iii.the pleadings show the parties had a marvin agreement 
adults who voluntarily live together and engage in sexual relations are competent to contract respecting their earnings and property rights.such contracts will be enforced unless expressly and inseparably based upon an illicit consideration of sexual services marvin,supra,cal d at.whorton dillingham d.if a man and woman who are not married live together as husband and wife under an agreement to pool their earnings and share equally in their joint accumulations,equity will protect the interests of each in such property.marvin,supra,cal d at,citing vallera vallera cal d.
moreover,a promise to perform homemaking services is,of course,a lawful and adequate consideration for a contract citation otherwise those engaged in domestic employment could not sue for their wages citation.marvin,supra,cal d at,fn.marvin expressly rejected the argument that the partner seeking to enforce the contract must have contributed either property or services additional to ordinary homemaking services.ibid.
in this case,chiba has adequately pled a marvin agreement between smith and herself.they allegedly agreed to live together,cohabitate and combine their efforts and earnings,share equally any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts whether individual or combined,and hold themselves out to the public as husband and wife.further,chiba pled that smith promised to provide for her financial needs and support for the rest of her life in exchange for her domestic services as his homemaker,housekeeper,cook,secretary,bookkeeper and financial counselor,forgoing any independent career opportunities.the promise to perform these domestic services is lawful and adequate consideration for a contract.
having found a marvin agreement has been pled,we now determine whether the agreement can be severed.
iv.the trial court did not err in declining to sever the agreement 
where a contract has but a single object,and such object is unlawful,whether in whole or in part,or wholly impossible of performance,or so vaguely expressed as to be wholly unascertainable,the entire contract is void.however,w here a contract has several distinct objects,of which one at least is lawful,and one at least is unlawful,in whole or in part,the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.furthermore,although civil code section authorizes a court to sever the illegal object of a contract from the legal it does not require the court to do so.the decision whether to sever the illegal term of a contract is informed by equitable considerations.yoo robi,supra,th at,d.
here,the trial court found that there is only one agreement,whose lawful and unlawful objects are inextricably intertwined.chiba did not plead separate consideration for the lawful and unlawful portions until the second amended complaint,but that pleading was not consistent with the two previous iterations of the pleadings on that critical point.
while the dissent sets forth a number of reasons that would support severance in this case,none of those reasons requires severance.applying equitable considerations and the overriding public policy of deterring unlicensed activities,the court below rejected severance.it reasoned that the lawful activities alleged would nevertheless be because they were mixed with activities which required a license equity does not demand acceptance of the most favorable set of multiple conflicting versions of the facts set forth by a party in her pleadings.the inconsistencies in the pleadings,specifically with respect to the issues relating to severability,create a record on which the conclusion that the primary purpose of the parties in entering the agreement was the personal relationship,and that the illegal terms were secondary and could be abandoned while all of the other terms of the agreement remained enforceable,is not mandated.on that record we can not conclude that equity compelled severance in this case.
accordingly,the court did not err in declining to sever the agreement.
disposition 
the order is affirmed.greenwald is awarded her costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent,in order to explain why i differ from the conclusion reached in the majority opinion and also to clarify how this case appears fundamentally distinguishable from yoo robi a case i authored in,with justices woods and zelon concurring in that decision.
respondent and the majority opinion emphasize what the majority characterizes as inconsistencies in the pleadings,specifically with respect to the issues relating to severability.this evidently refers to the three complaints appellant original complaint,the first amended complaint,and the second amended complaint.as the majority opinion itself points out,the original complaint alleged the two contracts or clauses of a single contract the lawful and separate paragraphs.the first amended complaint dropped the paragraph reciting the unlawful contract but added the manager and agent services to the list of duties she performed as part of the marvin contract.finally,in the second amended complaint she alleged two separate cohabitation agreement and the management contract.but in this complaint appellant candidly conceded the second contract was unlawful and she was not entitled to recover any compensation based on that contract.thus,it was as if the second amended complaint only alleged a single marvin agreement.
in my view,the purported inconsistencies among these three pleadings are little more than a tempest in a teapot.this is unlike cases where appellants plead facts in an amended complaint which are the opposite of facts pleaded in the original complaint or omit facts from the second complaint which the trial court found had defeated their cause of action when included in the original version.here the original and second amended complaint were essentially the same.on the issue of severability,it makes no difference whether these were two contracts or two clauses of a single contract.in none of the complaints did appellant conceal or withdraw the true nature of the arrangement she was alleging.yes,she was in a marvin relationship with the deceased artist and there was an agreement she was to be compensated for her services in that relationship,and yes,she also was performing some management and agent services for him and she was to get a percentage of his revenues for those services.
perhaps most significantly,however,it is my view the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the original though it did so with leave to amend and consequently,any inconsistencies introduced in the later amended pleadings are irrelevant.merely because plaintiffs accept a trial court offer to amend their pleadings does not mean they concede the validity of the court ruling the original complaint was defective.as to allegations regarding the two contracts or clauses in the original marvin arrangement and the artist manager deal,in my view there is no problem warranting the trial court order sustaining a demurrer with or without leave to amend those allegations.those allegations appear in paragraphs and of the original complaint and read as follows 
in or about august,appellant and elliot smith,aka steven paul smith hereinafter decedent entered into an oral covenant and agreement hereinafter subject agreement by and through which the parties agreed that they would live together,cohabitate and combine their efforts and earnings and would share equally any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts whether individual or combined.appellant and decedent further covenanted and agreed with each other that they would hold themselves out to the public as husband and wife and that appellant would render her services as a homemaker,housekeeper,and cook to the decedent,and that appellant further would forego any independent career opportunities to devote her full time to decedent as a homemaker,housekeeper,cook,secretary,bookkeeper,and financial counselor to the decedent,in consideration for which decedent agreed to provide for all of the appellant financial needs and support for the rest of her life.
appellant and decedent further covenanted and agreed as part of the foregoing subject agreement,that appellant would also act as decedent manager and agent for the purposes of arranging the booking and scheduling appearances for musical performances by decedent as well as the preparation and production of an album of decedent performances,in consideration for which appellant would be specifically entitled to of the proceeds earned and received on all such performances and album sales.
at a minimum,these two paragraphs allege two independent clauses of a single contract,each with a different promised performance by appellant in return for a different form and measure of consideration.alternatively,they may be characterized as two separate contracts executed at the same time.but,for reasons explained below,whether considered separate clauses or different contracts,they are severable and the marvin arrangement is enforceable.
one of the alleged contracts or clauses qualifies as a partnership where appellant is to perform a variety of domestic and secretarial duties while the two hold themselves out as husband and wife.as consideration for appellant performance of these promised duties she is to share equally any and all property accumulated as a result of their efforts whether individual or combined and to be provided by the deceased her financial needs and support for the rest of her life.that contract or clause,if proven,is lawful and valid under marvin marvin 
the other contract or clause calls for appellant to serve as the deceased manager and agent and in that capacity to perform distinctly different functions and for a different measure of consideration.she is to arrange and schedule the deceased musical performances and prepare and produce his albums and as consideration for those activities is to receive percent of the proceeds earned and received from those appearances and albums.
depending primarily on the meaning of the term arrange,this latter contract or clause is arguably unlawful.that is because appellant never registered as a talent agent,yet the procurement of new concert dates is a function expected of an agent rather than a personal manager the remainder of the activities appellant promised to perform in this contract,on the other hand,do not require registration as a talent agent.merely scheduling musical performances someone else has solicited and obtained does not appear something only registered agents are licensed to do.moreover,the procurement of recording contracts is expressly exempted from the talent agent registration requirement 
nonetheless,the term arranging is susceptible to the interpretation it was contemplated appellant would solicit and obtain new concert dates.this is a function it would be illegal for her to perform without registering as a talent agent,something she admittedly had not bothered to do.furthermore,in her briefing and in her deposition as well,appellant has conceded the portion of the agreement in which she agreed to arrange performances violated the talent agencies act.the question of severability remains,however.that is,whether the contract or clause which promised appellant percent of the proceeds from the deceased concerts and record albums in return for work she did related to those concerts and albums infects the contract or clause which promised her a share in his income,however it was earned,along with lifetime support in return for her personal services in connection with their personal relationship.
the common law has long recognized contracts containing lawful clauses frequently can be severed from unlawful clauses contained in the same contract and those lawful clauses then enforced.as williston treatise emphasizes,w here as here not only is the consideration separable into legal and illegal portions,but the promises are also correspondingly apportioned,that is,where the agreement may properly be called divisible,recovery may be had upon the promises which are supported by the legal portions of the consideration.furthermore,if the legal portion of a bilateral contract is severable,legal promises on one side being wholly supported by legal promises on the other,and the illegal portion of the contract does not go to its essence,the legal part may be enforced.
the restatement likewise recognizes a contract unlawful in part is not necessarily unenforceable in its entirety,although it does not use the language of severability in doing so.if the parties performances can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents and one pair is not offensive to public policy,that portion of the agreement is enforceable by a party who did not engage in serious misconduct.
the common law principles sanctioning the severability of contracts and thus the enforcement of lawful clauses in contracts containing unlawful provisions have been codified in california.where a contract has several distinct objects,of which one at least is lawful,and one at least is unlawful,in whole or in part,the contract is void as to the latter and valid as to the rest.
the cases which have denied personal managers or other persons who failed to obtain a talent agent license any recovery under their contract with the artist,unlike the case before this court,failed to involve situations where the consideration was separable into legal and illegal portions,and the promises were also correspondingly apportioned instead they all involved attempts to recover as consideration a percentage of what the artist earned for the performance,album,or other artistic product the representative or other appellant claimed their contract entitled them to receive in return for promises to perform services related to that artistic endeavor.thus,the consideration and the promised unlawful performance were closely interrelated.
in some of those cases,the personal representatives have claimed they were owed a percentage of the artist earnings from the artist artistic product in return for professional services they rendered related to the artists artistic product other than or in addition to any services they may have rendered which only a registered talent agent is permitted to perform.in other words,even conceding they had procured the entertainment deal that made it possible for the artist to produce the product,they also did other things called for in their contracts that were not unlawful and thus they deserved a percentage of the earnings for those services.these attempts to gain partial recoveries under contracts as personal representatives have failed,however,in several them,park deftones waisbren peppercorn productions and yoo robi the latter which i authored for this court.
these opinions would apply and,if followed,deny appellant any recovery if she were still seeking to recover the at least some the deceased album sales and proceeds from past performances under the second contract or clause.such a claim would be based on the theory some part of the work appellant did under that contract or clause did not constitute unlawful services performed as an unlicensed talent agent,but rather lawful services which personal representatives are allowed to undertake.in that instance,she would be contending she should get a percent of the deceased earnings derived from her lawful services under that second contract or clause.
this is the sort of severance issue the supreme court is considering in the marathon case it also is the sort of severance this court refused to allow in yoo robi in the latter case,a personal manager who had knowingly failed to register as a talent agent procured concert dates for the band he was representing,a prohibited activity,but also negotiated recording contracts for that same artist.he only sought to enforce the contract as to the recording contracts and only sought his percentage fee for the revenues from the sales of those records.we rejected the manager argument the permissible activities and the revenues generated from those activities should be severed from the impermissible activities he performed under the contract with these artists i would agree we should do the same in this case,had appellant sought to sever the portion of this contract related to albums from the portion dealing with concerts.
but this is not the specie of severance appellant is seeking in this case.instead it represents a very different situation,a case of first impression,and quite distinguishable not only from yoo but from the marathon case still pending before the california supreme court.unlike these other cases based on professional services some lawful and some unlawful directly related to the artist products and to be compensated as a percentage of the earnings from those products,the marvin contract or clause in this case is based on the rendering of personal,housekeeping,cooking,bookkeeping,and the appellant and deceased were holding themselves out as husband and wife.it is compensated not as a percentage of revenues from concerts or albums on which appellant supplied services.instead compensation is to be based on a pooling of the parties accumulated derived from the deceased artistic products or from either party earnings as business executives or wait persons at a restaurant,or any other with the provision of lifetime support to appellant 
thus,this case presents a paradigm example of a contract which in the words of civil code section has two distinct objects,of which one is lawful,and one is unlawful,in whole or in part here the marvin clause has a distinct a completely distinct promised performance and promised that in the manager and agent clause.moreover,that clause and its distinct object is lawful,while only the manager and agent clause is in whole,but in part.
in the language of williston treatise,both the consideration and the promises in the two clauses of this contract are separable into legal and illegal portions.consequently,recovery may be had upon the promises which are supported by the legal portions of the consideration.likewise,applying the restatement test,the marvin agreement and the manager and agent clause clearly can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents and one pair the marvin pair of performances is not offensive to public policy so once again,that portion of the agreement is enforceable by a party who did not engage in serious misconduct.whatever might be said about appellant failure to register as a talent agent,it could not be characterized as serious misconduct,even had it been intentional rather than the result of her ignorance of these licensing requirements.consequently,the pair of performances embodied in the marvin agreement remains enforceable despite the illegality of a part of the performance appellant promised in the manager and agent clause of the contract.
to illustrate the point,imagine the first contract or clause was not a marvin contract but a straight home remodeling contract.the artist promises to pay the appellant to remodel his house.the artist dies after the house is remodeled but before he has paid the.then assume there also is another contract or clause in the arrangements between the appellant and artist providing the appellant is to act as an agent and representative for specified types of the artist artistic endeavors and th
