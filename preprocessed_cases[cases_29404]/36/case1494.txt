deborah mother appeals the judgment terminating her parental rights over amber,samuel,and destiny m.she contends the court abused its discretion by denying her modification petition welf,and by terminating her parental rights without receiving information about amber and samuel wishes,subd.h,deprived her of her constitutional right to call amber as a witness,and erred by failing to find the children would benefit from a continued relationship with her,subd.c a.we agree with the last contention.
background 
in august,when amber,samuel,and destiny were almost five years old,two and years old,and seven months old,the san diego county health and human services agency the agency filed dependency petitions because mother left destiny alone in a bathtub full of water,where she was found submerged and almost drowned.amber and samuel were detained in polinsky children center,and then with their maternal grandmother grandmother,and destiny was detained in a foster home.amber and samuel were then placed with grandmother and destiny was placed in a foster home.by november,destiny had also been placed with grandmother.
near the end of october,samuel started a day trial visit with mother.around thanksgiving weekend,mother relapsed into drug use.she moved into a residential treatment facility with samuel where she had contact with brett,amber and samuel father,in violation of the terms of the day visit.in january,she left the facility,took samuel to the home of her father grandfather,and left him there.samuel was then placed with grandfather.
around october,mother relapsed again she had one positive drug test.she residential treatment,left after two months,then returned to the treatment program in january.in august,she filed her section petition,requesting the court vacate its april,month review hearing order setting a section hearing and place the children with her or,alternatively,that it provide her additional services under section.as changes of circumstances or new evidence,she alleged that she had obtained suitable housing,maintained days of sobriety,graduated from domestic violence and drug treatment programs,completed a program for parents of sexually abused children and participated in therapy with amber and samuel.
the hearing on mother section petition and the section hearing took place from september through november.amber and destiny remain with grandmother,who wishes to adopt them,and samuel remains with grandfather,who wishes to adopt him.
section petition 
the juvenile court may modify an order if a parent shows,by a preponderance of the evidence,changed circumstance or new evidence and that modification would promote the child best interests.in re michael th,d.this is determined by the seriousness of the problem leading to the dependency and the reason for its continuation the strength of the and bonds and the time the child has been in the system and the nature of the change of circumstance,the ease by which it could be achieved,and the reason it did not occur sooner.in re kimberly th,d.after termination of services,the focus shifts from the parent custodial interest to the child need for permanency and stability.in re stephanie cal th,d.whether a previously made order should be modified rests within the dependency court discretion,and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is clearly established.in re michael,supra,th at,d.the denial of a section motion rarely merits reversal as an abuse of discretion.in re kimberly,supra,th,d.
here,in addition to nearly drowning destiny,mother abused drugs,engaged in a violent relationship with brett,and neglected the children despite a voluntary services contract beginning in september,a second voluntary contract beginning just before the inception of this case,and a reunification period extending over more than months,mother serious parenting deficiencies had not been fully remedied by the time of the section hearing.for example,her lack of empathy for the children was evident in her testimony that while amber and destiny had lived with grandmother for two years and were bonded with her,removing them suddenly from grandmother home would not be detrimental or cause any emotional harm moreover,although mother had sought information and advice from samuel therapist,mother did not understand samuel psychological difficulties and during a conjoint session had resisted samuel attempts to interact with her.
while by the time of the section hearing mother had completed domestic violence and sexual abuse treatment and the residential portion of her substance abuse program,for most of the dependency her visitation with the children remained supervised.her substance abuse had begun more than years earlier and while she had been clean for days,she had previously relapsed twice during the course of this case,once after more than days of sobriety.furthermore,the coordinator of mother drug treatment program testified that mother was in the early stages of recovery and mother sponsor testified that mother was only on step three of her step program.
the children had been out of mother care for more than two years,with the exception of samuel approximately trial visit.although the children enjoyed visits and amber and samuel loved and missed mother and called her mom,the children were attached to grandmother and grandfather.the social worker believed that returning the children to mother would greatly jeopardize their safety,stability,progress,and consistency and that while mother loved the children and had progressed,she would not be able to maintain her recovery activities and be the primary caretaker for her three active children.the court appointed special advocate casa also recommended against the children return to mother,noting that she was not ready to handle them on her own.finally,at the time of the hearing,mother was living in a sober living housing unit that would not accommodate the children,and the waiting time for a unit that would accommodate them was up to days.
the above facts lead us to conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by determining that while mother was progressing in treatment,return to her custody would not be in the children best interests.nor did the court err by concluding that section provision regarding services applies only after the selection of a permanent plan.
amber and samuel wishes 
section,subdivision h provides that at the section hearing,the court shall consider the wishes of the child.additionally,section,subdivision i states whenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to section shall be held,it shall direct the agency to prepare an assessment that shall include a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship,unless the child age or physical,emotional,or other condition precludes his or her meaningful response,and if so,a description of the condition.while there is some disagreement whether evidence of the child wishes must reflect his or her awareness that termination of parental rights is at issue compare in re diana th,d with in re leo th,d,it is clear that a direct statement from the child is not required where this is contrary to the child best interest id.at,d.
here,both amber and samuel expressed conflicting wishes about staying with grandmother and grandfather or living with mother.the social worker testified that she did not ask amber or samuel what permanent plan they would like because of samuel age and both children intense therapeutic needs,and that such a discussion should take place in therapy sessions and should be postponed so as to avoid more trauma and confusion.the social worker believed that amber and samuel would be emotionally unable to understand the permanency issue.both children therapists had told the social worker that before discussing a permanent plan with the children,they needed a decision from the court on that matter.samuel therapist testified that he had told her that he was not done living with grandfather,which meant that he was not ready to move.amber therapist testified that amber did not have the capacity to express an opinion abo
