in a child custody and support proceeding,a father was found to be in contempt of orders to pay the mother pendente lite attorney and expert fees.he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus,contending the family law court had improperly utilized mandatory presumptions,relating to the elements of knowledge and ability to pay,to find him guilty of criminal contempt.we conclude that,where ability to pay has already been determined by the family law court in making the order underlying the contempt,ability to pay is not an element of the contempt,but rather inability to pay is an affirmative defense.we further conclude the instant contempt proceeding is criminal in nature,and while a mandatory presumption may not be utilized to find an individual guilty of criminal contempt,a permissive inference may be utilized.because the family law court properly utilized a permissive inference of knowledge in determining guilt,we deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.

discussion 
ability to pay 
father contends present ability to pay is an element of the contempt charged against him.he contends mother failed to produce any evidence of his present ability to pay and the family law court utilized an unconstitutional mandatory presumption of ability to pay based on an earlier finding of ability to pay made at the time the underlying orders were entered.we reject these contentions.
as a general rule,the elements of contempt include a valid order,knowledge of the order,ability to comply with the order,and willful failure to comply with the order.anderson superior court th,d in re cassil th,d.however,where the order is a family law order for payment of support or attorney fees,and the family law court has already determined the alleged contemner ability to pay the underlying order,ability to comply with the order is not an element of the contempt.rather,inability to pay is an affirmative defense,which must be proven by the alleged contemner.in re mccarty cal.ability to pay becomes an element of the contempt only when the alleged contempt occurs many years after the underlying order.mery superior court cal d.
the rationale of such a rule is clear.it is not necessary for a wife on the hearing of a contempt proceeding for nonpayment of alimony to prove anything more than the making of the order and disobedience of it by her husband in refusing to pay the amounts which the court found he had the ability to pay when it made the order.she makes a prima facie case at the hearing by producing the original order,and by proof of the refusal of her husband to make payment according to its terms the proceeding in contempt is designed to punish the delinquent husband for disobeying the order of the court and to enforce obedience to it,and at the same time an opportunity is given him to purge himself of contempt by presenting any legitimate excuse he may have,and,if his excuse is that since the making of the original order he has become unable to pay the alimony required by it,it is incumbent upon him to prove that fact.he is in the best position to show why for any reason he has not obeyed the order,and it is his duty to do so as a matter of defense.it is not necessary for the wife to allege his ability to comply with the original order.the court had originally found that he had such ability in re mccarty,supra,cal.at.the rationale supports the rule where the alleged contempt occurs soon after the underlying order was entered.mery superior court,supra,cal d.the rationale does not support the rule where the alleged contempt occurs long after the underlying order was entered.ibid.ongoing spousal support contempt alleged for failure to pay amounts coming due ten years later.
this rule has been consistently applied by the courts of this state with one significant digression.in re rasmussen,in re risner d,in re sigesmund d.sorell superior court d.mossman superior court d.the digression commenced in when the court of appeal stated that one of the elements of contempt of an order to pay child support was ability to comply,which was required to be alleged in the affidavit and proven by the petitioner.warner superior court d.it is notable,however,that ability to pay was not at issue in the warner case.in response to warner,the legislature adopted code of civil procedure section,which expressly provided that ability to pay was not an element of contempt of an order to pay child support.of code legislation of cal.in,the court of appeal considered code of civil procedure section and held that ability to pay was an element of contempt of a child support order.in re feiock d.the appellate court further held that code of civil procedure section created an unconstitutional mandatory presumption of ability to pay.compare martin superior court d.code civ,is constitutional.
the matter was taken up by the united states supreme court.hicks feiock,d.the supreme court stated that whether ability to comply is an element of contempt or an affirmative defense is a matter of state law,and it was not free to overturn the state court determination.id.at.accord,moss superior court cal th,d,compare in re cassil,supra,th at,fn,d.in t
