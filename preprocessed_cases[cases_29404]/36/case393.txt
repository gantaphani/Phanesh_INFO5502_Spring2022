ruben raises a challenge under the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause on the basis of age and gender to two former sections of the immigration and nationality act,a and,which impose a residence requirement,after the age of fourteen,on united states citizen not on united states citizen they may transmit citizenship to a child born out of wedlock abroad to a.this precise question has not been addressed before,but the answer follows from the supreme court opinion in nguyen ins,d.there the court held that legitimation requirements for citizen fathers,but not for citizen mothers,did not offend principles of equal protection.assuming,as the court did in nguyen,that intermediate scrutiny applies to claim and rational basis review applies to his claim,we conclude that the residence requirements of a and survive.as this is what the district court held in a published opinion,united states,d,and we see no other error,we affirm.
was born in tijuana,mexico on october,to ruben trinidad,his united states citizen biological father who was sixteen at the time,and maria mercedes negrete,his states citizen biological mother.had been issued a certificate of citizenship on may,based on the fact that his villar paternal a united states citizen by birth.
his father and grandmother brought to the united states for medical treatment when he was two months old.he grew up in san diego with his grandmother and father.is not listed on birth certificate,but he acknowledged as his son by filing an acknowledgment of paternity with the civil registry in mexico on june.
on march,was convicted of importation of marijuana in violation of and and on june,he was convicted of two counts of illegal entry into the united states in violation of.he was removed from the united states pursuant to removal orders on numerous occasions october,april,june,june,october,and march.
he was arrested again on february,and this time was charged with being a deported alien found in the united states after deportation in violation of a and b.he sought to defend on the footing that he believed he was a united states citizen through his father.meanwhile,filed an application seeking a certificate of citizenship,which was denied on the ground that it was physically impossible for his father,who was sixteen when was born,to have been present in the united states for five years after his fourteenth birthday as required by a.the government filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of derivative citizenship for the same reason,which the district court granted.the court denied corresponding motion in limine,to be allowed to present evidence that he believed he was a united states citizen.
the district court found guilty following a bench trial on stipulated facts it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal.timely appeals his conviction.
when was born,a provided,in relevant part 
a the following shall be nationals and citizens of the united states at birth 
a person born outside the geographic limits of the united states and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien,and the other a citizen of the united states who,prior to the birth of such person,was physically present in the united states or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years,at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years.
a.section provided 
a the provisions of paragraphs to and of section a of this title,and of paragraph of section,of this title shall apply as of the date of birth to a child born out of wedlock if the paternity of such child is established while such child is under the age of years by legitimation.
c notwithstanding the provision of subsection a of this section,a person born outside the united states and out of wedlock shall be held to have acquired at birth the nationality status of his mother,if the mother had the nationality of the united states at the time of such person birth,and if the mother had previously been physically present in the united states or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.
thus,if a united states citizen father had a child out of wedlock abroad,with a states citizen mother,the father must have resided in the united states for at least five years after his fourteenth birthday to confer citizenship on his child.but a united states citizen mother had to reside in the united states for a continuous period of only one year prior to the child birth to pass on citizenship.it is this difference that claims makes an impermissible classification on the basis of gender and age.
in nguyen,the united states citizen father of a child born in vietnam to a vietnamese mother challenged imposition of different rules for obtaining citizenship depending upon whether the one parent with american citizenship is the mother or the father.there,the father complained about the affirmative steps a citizen father,but not a citizen mother,was required by a to take legitimation a declaration of paternity under oath by the father or a court order of paternity.assuming,without deciding,that the intermediate level of scrutiny normally applied to a classification applies even when the statute is within congress immigration and naturalization power,at,and drawing on justice stevens prior opinion in miller albright,d,the court identified two important governmental interests substantially furthered by distinction between citizen fathers and citizen mothers.the first is assuring that a biological relationship exists.id.at.mothers and fathers are not similarly situated in this respect the relation is verifiable from the birth itself in the case of the mother,while a father biological relationship to the child is not so easily established.the second interest is ensuring that the child and the citizen parent have some demonstrated opportunity or potential to develop not just a relationship that is recognized,as a formal matter,by the law,but one that consists of the real,everyday ties that provide a connection between child and citizen parent and,in turn,the united states.id.at.the mother knows that the child is in being and has immediate contact at birth such that an opportunity for a meaningful relationship exists,whereas,as the court put it,t he same opportunity does not result from the event of birth,as a matter of biological inevitability,in the case of the unwed father.id.at.unlike an unwed mother,there is no assurance that the father and his biological child will ever meet,or have the kind of contact from which there is a chance for a meaningful relationship to develop.the court emphasized that congress need not ignore these realities for purposes of equal protection,and found that the means requirements for an unwed citizen father to confer citizenship upon his substantially related to the objective of a relationship between parent and child,and in turn,the united states.id.at.
although the means at issue are different in this additional residence requirement for the unwed citizen government interests are no less important,and the particular means no less substantially related to those objectives,than in nguyen the government argues that avoiding stateless children is an important objective that is substantially furthered by relaxing the residence requirement for women because many countries confer citizenship based on bloodline jus sanguinis rather than,as the united states does,on place of birth jus soli.we explained the conundrum in runnett shultz 
one obvious rational basis for a more lenient policy towards illegitimate children of citizen mothers is that illegitimate children are more likely to be stateless at birth as the government notes,if the citizen mother is not a dual national,and the illegitimate child is born in a country that does not recognize citizenship by jus soli citizenship determined by place of birth alone,the child can acquire no citizenship other than his mother at birth.this policy clearly demonstrates a rational basis for congress more lenient policy towards illegitimate children born abroad to citizen mothers.
