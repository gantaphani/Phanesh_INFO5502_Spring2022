in february,sanford hired an attorney to commence legal proceedings for sanford to become morris guardian.a final judgment appointing guardian was rendered in the chancery court of rankin county,mississippi,appointing sanford as general guardian over morris,a minor,upon sanford taking the oath prescribed by mississippi law.see ann.sanford,however,never took the oath.no letters of guardianship were issued to sanford.
sanford hired another attorney,who assisted sanford in having morris federal payments redirected from morris aunt to sanford.although morris had use of the funds while in sanford care,sanford asserts that he provided additional financial support to morris.
before morris came to live with sanford,sanford purchased first colony life insurance policies insuring each of sanford three children that,like the policy insuring morris,each provided a death benefit and named sanford the primary beneficiary.in august,upon morris consent,sanford applied for,was approved,and purchased the policy on morris life through the same insurance agent sanford used when purchasing the first colony life policies on his children.on the policy application,sanford represented that he was morris guardian.
in january,morris was reported missing.a few weeks later,morris was found dead the coroner determined morris death was caused by drowning.in march,sanford filed a claim for the death benefit under the policy,which first colony denied.initially,first colony informed sanford that payment was denied because sanford was a suspect in morris death,although later first colony told sanford the denial was due to the fact that sanford lacked an insurable interest in morris life.first colony then commenced this action.
by affidavit,sanford explained his relationship with morris over the year that morris lived with sanford and his family.when sanford met morris during the first week of january,morris explained to sanford that he was homeless and sleeping in abandoned houses in batesville,mississippi.morris told sanford that no one in his family could help him,but that morris really wanted to work and to go to school.sanford believed that he could help morris,and asked morris if he would like to come to sanford home in florence,mississippi.morris said yes,and asked sanford to take him in.sanford offered him a room in his house,but morris preferred to live in a small apartment on sanford property.sanford agreed,and morris lived in the apartment under sanford control and supervision.
sanford states that he treated morris the same as he treated his own children,in that he provided morris a place to live,financially supported him over and above what morris received in benefits,provided morris with a car and insurance,paid for trips for morris,including flying him to houston for an astros baseball game,took morris out to eat,provided morris food at sanford home,bought morris clothes and other things he needed or wanted,gave him money for entertainment,helped morris find a job at the grocery store where sanford shops,took him to church,and introduced him to people with the church that he thought could help morris then and in the future.accompanying sanford affidavit is a photograph of sanford and morris together with morris wearing a suit sanford purchased for him.sanford assisted morris with opening a checking account and for him on the account.
sanford also took morris to visit mississippi college and hinds county community college,where they met with admissions staff.additionally,sanford assisted morris in applying for a scholarship at mississippi college,which morris received.morris instead chose to enroll in hinds community college,and sanford paid morris tuition in cash and with funds from sanford ministry,the young people in action ministry.included as proof are the scholarship award letter,a receipt for tuition to hinds community college,and copies of documents refunding to sanford morris tuition due to the fact morris was reported missing and never attended classes.
sanford worked with morris and assisted him in developing life goals and often discussed with him the importance of making good decisions and making something of himself and his life.in april,morris was in a car accident and needed medical treatment.at the hospital,sanford signed as the party responsible for morris and sanford paid medical bills incurred by morris related to the accident.
sanford hoped that morris would receive a college education and morris would assist sanford in the future with his youth ministry.sanford stated that he treated morris just like his own children when sanford brought morris into his home.as to morris,sanford stated that he intended to and did undertake all obligations and duties that a parent would owe to a child.
in rendering summary judgment in favor of first colony,the district court found sanford never became morris legal guardian sanford argument that mississippi law allows his substantial relationship with morris,which was engendered by love and affection,to establish an insurable interest in morris life was unavailing and sanford failed to show that an issue of material fact existed regarding whether he had a legal or economic interest in the continued life of morris rather sanford showed only the mere possibility or expectation of a future economic relationship,which under mississippi law is insufficient to establish an insurable interest.thus,the district court dismissed sanford claims for breach of contract and fiduciary duty.the district court declared the policy void and ordered first colony to return to sanford the premiums sanford had paid for the policy.sanford appeals.
