appellant los angeles county department of children and family services lacdcfs challenges the most recent decision by the riverside county juvenile court riverside court to reject transfer of a dependency case.the case involves four children who are in a permanent plan of foster care with their grandmother in riverside county.after the permanent plan was instituted,the riverside court transferred the case to los angeles county because the mother had moved there.the case bounced back and forth between the two counties five times over nine months before appellant initiated this appeal.all parties involved lacdcfs,as well as riverside county department of public social services rcdpss,the children and the mother agree that the case should remain in riverside county.
the principal issue is whether the riverside court improperly rejected the transfer from los angeles county on december,under california rules of court,rule a we also look more generally at the interplay of rules and and welfare and institutions code,section,with emphasis on the factor that must take precedence in any dependency proceeding the best interests of the dependent children.
as discussed below,we conclude that the riverside court ignored the clear procedural mandate of rule a when it rejected the transfer on december.further,although section does provide some support for the three transfers to los angeles county,the riverside court abused its discretion when it found that the december,transfer was in the best interests of the children.
statement of facts 
in august,rcdpss filed a section petition regarding the four children and an older sibling,alleging negligence and failure to protect,subd.b and no provision for support,subd.g,based on the mother drug use.the riverside court sustained the petition and ordered the children placed with their maternal grandmother.the court terminated reunification services to the mother in december.at the section hearing in march,the court chose foster care with the grandmother as the permanent plan.the mother moved to los angeles county in july.
on january,the social worker recommended that the dependency case of the older sibling be transferred to los angeles county because the sibling had left placement and moved in with the mother.however,the social worker specifically recommended that the dependency cases of the other four children remain in riverside county because they were in foster care placement with their grandmother in cherry valley.at the february,hearing,the mother requested that reunification services be resumed,but the trial court ordered no changes.

at the april,hearing,the trial court terminated dependency as to the older sibling because she had become a ward of the court pursuant to section.the court also ordered the cases of the four remaining children to be transferred to los angeles county,stating that i t does make sense to have those children here in this county with mother living in los angeles.it seems that the other section,the whole entire matter should have been kept together.the attorney for the minors acquiesced.the minute order incorrectly states that the four children had been placed with their mother and that their legal residence was in los angeles.

on july,the riverside court held a hearing.rcdpss indicated it wished to accept the transfer because the children had resided in riverside county since and the case had been transferred to los angeles county by mistake.however,the court reasoned that the mother was entitled to be evaluated for return of the children at each section review,that it would be unreasonable to have rcdpss conduct that review in los angeles,and that jurisdiction and venue are properly based on the mother residence.the court then accept ed the transfer in for the limited purpose of transferring the case back to los angeles county,citing the absence of a showing that jurisdiction in riverside county was in the best interests of the children.the minute order reads,court finds los angeles county to be legal residence.case ordered returned to originating county.
