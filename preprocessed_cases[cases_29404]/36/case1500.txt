discussion 
in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus lee asserts he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not object to his lack of notice and did not attempt to establish he was a presumed father.
preliminarily,the agency asserts lee did not have a constitutional right to effective counsel because he never established he was a parent within the meaning of section the family code and the welfare and institutions code differentiate between alleged,natural,and presumed fathers.in re zacharia cal th,d.alleged fathers have less rights in dependency proceedings than biological and presumed fathers.ibid.an alleged father does not have a current interest in a child because his paternity has not yet been established.in re joseph th,d.therefore,he is not a parent within the meaning of section.
however,lee did not attain presumed or biological father status because his counsel neither spoke with him before the section hearing to determine his wishes to be so declared nor took action to change his status.because he had counsel,he could not petition the court himself to change his parental status he was dependent upon his counsel to take action on his behalf.casey overhead door th,d.lee may proceed with his writ petition because counsel left him in the status of an alleged father.
although a parent right to counsel in dependency proceedings derives from statute,a parent has a constitutional right to counsel at some stages of those proceedings.lassiter department of social services,d.we determine whether a parent has that right on a basis and consider the factual circumstances and procedural setting of the case at the time the error is said to have occurred.in re meranda,supra,th at,fn,d.
to determine whether federal constitutional rights are implicated,we examine the private interests at stake the government interest and the risk that the procedures used will lead to an erroneous decision.lassiter department of social services,supra,at.a n indigent parent may in some cases have a due process right to counsel where the termination of parental rights may result.in re kristin th,d.this is because the parent interest at the termination of parental rights stage is extremely important the state shares with the parent an interest in a correct decision and the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the parent rights is insupportably high.lassiter department of social services,supra,at.under the facts of this case,he had a constitutional right to effective counsel.
to establish counsel was ineffective,lee must demonstrate counsel did not act in a manner expected of reasonably competent attorneys and the error was prejudicial.strickland washington,d.we review the matter to determine whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.people watson cal d.
lee contends appointed counsel was ineffective by not raising the issue of inadequate notice in a timely fashion.to act effectively or competently,an attorney must act diligently,with learning and skill,and have the mental,emotional,and physical ability reasonably necessary to perform such services.rules conduct,rule b.an attorney must have the learning and skill reasonably necessary to handle a particular matter.vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group.in other words,the attorney must be knowledgeable about the subject area.
in the dependency arena,a reasonably competent attorney knows that notice to an alleged father is critical because it enables him the opportunity to appear and assert a position,which includes establishing his paternal status,subd.b in re joseph,supra,th at,d.an attorney also must know the agency and the court have a duty to provide notice to parents of all hearings in dependency matters and the court has a duty to ask the mother as soon as possible the identities and addresses of all alleged and presumed fathers,subd.a.to act competently,an alleged father attorney must ensure the agency and the court performed their respective duties.
here,file contains no information about what efforts the agency took to locate lee,although the agency response to the writ petition contains documents showing the agency made a cursory attempt to locate lee in december,three months after it had filed the section petition.thus,the agency did not fully discharge its duties.however,although counsel allegedly received the file in march,she filed no section petitions on lee behalf to raise those issues,which is an act inconsistent with acts taken by a competent attorney.
an alleged father in dependency proceedings is entitled to notice,because notice provides him an opportunity to appear and assert a position and attempt to change his paternity status,subd.b in re joseph,supra,th at,d.notice affords him a reasonable time to make his appearance.in re emily th,d.the right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default,acquiesce or contest.in re antonio d,disapproved on other grounds in in re laura cal d.an alleged father is entitled to notice.
the agency does not address the merits of counsel competency,but asserts lee can not establish prejudice because his motion would have failed as the agency could not locate him with only his name.however,to establish prejudice,lee need not convince the appellate court that the ineffective assistance merits a reversal in which the trial court is directed to make things the way they would have been had the assistance been effective rather,a prima facie showing of prejudicial ineffective assistance is all that is required for the new hearing that reversal bring
