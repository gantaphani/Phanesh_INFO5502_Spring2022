joseph,father appeals from the order at the review hearing denying placement of his son,joseph,joseph,with his paternal aunt.
the principal issue in this case is whether,without qualification,the relative placement preference under subdivision a of welfare and institutions code section applies after the dispositional hearing through the family reunification period or whether subdivision d of that statute precludes application of the preference after the dispositional hearing unless a new placement is required.we hold that the relative placement preference applies at least through the family reunification period and that subdivision d of section expands,rather than contracts,the application of the preference.under the circumstances of this case,however,the dependency court failure to apply the preference at the review hearing and the court failure to state on the record its reasons for not placing the child with his aunt were harmless errors.
facts and proceedings below 
in june,joseph and his half sibling,shane,were detained and placed together in foster care because monica mother had an unresolved drug problem and failed to comply with the terms of a march voluntary family maintenance contract with dcfs in which she agreed,among other things,that her children were to have no contact with jesse,shane father.jesse has a history of domestic violence with mother and on one occasion of domestic violence joseph received a cut near his eye when he was pushed against a stove.a restraining order prohibited physical contact between jesse and mother.
father,who has a criminal record and a long history of heroin use,was paroled from prison in april and lived with mother until june.at the detention hearing on june,the dependency court ordered dcfs to assess the relatives who requested placement of the maternal grandparents and shane paternal grandmother.according to a july report,dcfs considered shane paternal grandparents and the maternal grandparents for relative placements,but for various reasons dcfs determined that these relatives were not able to provide care for the children at that time.the parents had two monitored visits each week,and the visits were going well.
in late june,father obtained a residence separate from mother.in early july,mother entered a residential drug treatment program.on july,the dependency court ordered dcfs to evaluate father home for placement of joseph and continued the matter.in its july report,dcfs recommended that joseph be released to father,noting that father was complying with the conditions of his parole and was testing negative for drugs.on july,the dependency court ordered joseph placed in father home.
on july,the court sustained dcfs petition as amended,declaring the children dependents of the court pursuant to section,subdivisions a serious physical harm and b failure to protect,based on the domestic violence between mother and jesse,the parents histories of substance abuse,father criminal activity,and mother failure to comply with her voluntary family maintenance agreement.shane was placed in foster care and joseph was placed with father,who was afforded family maintenance services.father also was ordered to participate in meetings twice a week and to comply with his parole conditions.mother was afforded monitored visits.
on august,dcfs detained joseph from father and placed him in his previous foster care home with shane,based on father use of heroin and his violent physical altercation with mother in joseph presence on august.on august,dcfs filed an amended petition containing the foregoing allegations.father admitted to dcfs that he had relapsed into heroin use.on september,the dependency court sustained the august petition,finding that joseph was a dependent of the court pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b.father was afforded monitored visitation and reunification services.he was ordered to attend a drug rehabilitation program with random testing,attend parent education,and comply with his parole conditions.
according to a january,status review report,dcfs learned on january that father was then in state prison.on january,father sister,deborah,told the social worker that father had been at her home and she had known that he had an outstanding arrest warrant,so she called the sheriff department and father was arrested in december.deborah and father parole officer also told dcfs that father had been using drugs until his arrest.father had not participated in any drug treatment programs and had last visited joseph in september.mother was not in compliance with her classes and her drug testing was sporadic.joseph was doing well in his foster home and showed no signs of stress or discomfort after being separated from mother.dcfs recommended termination of family reunification services and selection of a permanent plan of adoption.
on january,the dependency court continued the review hearing,subd.e to march.the court ordered dcfs to prepare a supplemental report as to whether any of mother relatives would be appropriate for placement.according to a march interim review report,mother suggested family friends,the,for placement.dcfs interviewed and rejected them because was not forthcoming about criminal history.dcfs also reported that joseph and shane had bonded with their foster parents,whom they regarded as their mother and father figure s.
at the march hearing,the court continued the review hearing to april for a contested hearing.upon the request of father counsel,the court also ordered dcfs to prepare a supplemental report on placement of joseph with his paternal aunt,deborah 
according to an april interim review report,a dcfs social worker spoke with deborah on april.deborah stated that upon father release from prison,he would be living with her.dcfs rejected placement of joseph with deborah due to father possibly residing in the home and that the siblings would be separated.joseph and shane have a close bond with each other and it would cause a hardship if either one of them are separated.the department has not received live scan information from deborah significant other.the department has no information on the other person that resides in the home.
at the hearing on april,father counsel stated that deborah lived in kern county in a closed community which is gated and private and very secure.it is entirely appropriate for children.they have a licensed day care facility on the premises.no one has come to deborah home to check her out.she has livescanned.she is a registered nurse.she is a mandated reporter.she indicated a willingness over a course of time to have the child reside in her home.father has a different address to move to immediately.i am,again,requesting that dcfs go out and inspect this home for appropriateness.these children do not have to be considered a sibling unit.the fathers do not get along and have not gotten along.i do see any reason that these children must be placed together.they were not placed together at the beginning.when we have an appropriate relative,she should be at least investigated thoroughly.
dcfs admitted that the paternal aunt passed live scan but dcfs had not received the live scan information for her significant other or other persons who lived in the home.father counsel responded that no one else lived in the paternal aunt home.
counsel for the children argued,the children are the most stable person in each other lives.i think they should be considered a sibling unit.moving one of them out of town,i do know if that is facilitating reunification.counsel for dcfs also stated that dcfs did not want to break up the sibling group at that time.
without objection,dcfs reports of january,march,and april were admitted into evidence.the court continued family reunification services for the parents but conditioned mother services on her relocating to a different sober living home.the court also informed the parents that if the children could not be returned home by october,the date of the hearing,reunification services may be terminated and the matter referred for selection of a permanent plan.at the end of the hearing,dcfs stated that it was in the process of assessing the home of mother family friends,the,as a possible placement and that it would have to get a criminal waiver for father counsel objected to placement with a stranger over the paternal aunt.the court noted the objection for the record.
father filed a timely notice of appeal from the april order,challenging dcfs refusal to make a home visit or to consider placement with the paternal aunt.
discussion 
father contends that the failure by both dcfs and the court to evaluate the paternal aunt for relative placement was prejudicial error under the relative placement preference of section,subdivision a.in response dcfs argues that section did not require dcfs or the dependency court to evaluate the paternal aunt on april,because under subdivision d of the statute,the relative placement preference applies at the time of the disposition hearing and thereafter only if a new placement of the child must be made.the parties agree that within the meaning of section no new placement needed to be made for joseph at the review hearing,so we express no view on that issue.
we reject dcfs contention that the enactment of subdivision d of section eliminated the relative placement preference after the dispositional hearing in circumstances other than when a new placement of the child must be made.as we explain below,neither the language of the amendment nor its legislative history supports dcfs reading of section,subdivision d.moreover,dcfs interpretation is contrary to the strong california policy in favor of relative placement.nevertheless,we affirm the dependency court order because any errors relating to the application of the preference were harmless.
i.the relative placement preference.
section,subdivision a states in relevant part in any case in which a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to section,preferential consideration shall be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative.preferential consideration means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated,subd.c.subdivision a further states that when a child is removed from his parents physical custody the court shall order the parent to disclose to the county social worker the names,residences,and any other known identifying information of any maternal or paternal relatives of the child and that the county social worker shall initially contact the relatives given preferential consideration for placement to determine if they desire the child to be placed with them.those relatives desiring placement shall be assessed according to the factors enumerated in subdivision a and t he county social worker shall document these efforts in the social study prepared pursuant to section.the relatives entitled to preferential consideration for placement are an adult who is a grandparent,aunt,uncle,or sibling,subd.c.
despite the mandate of section,subdivision a,dcfs contends that the addition of subdivision d to section stats,ch,eliminated the relative placement preference once the dispositional phase is completed except when the court is required to change the child placement.we disagree.nothing in section,subdivision d,states or implies such a result,the legislature intent as manifested in the legislative history of subdivision d is contrary to dcfs reading of subdivision d,and dcfs interpretation of the statute would thwart the strong california policy in favor of relative placement as manifested in section,subdivision a,and implemented in numerous california appellate decisions.
a.the meaning of section,subdivision d.
section,subdivision d,states in relevant part subsequent to the hearing conducted pursuant to section the dispositional hearing,whenever a new placement of the child must be made,consideration for placement shall again be given as described in this section to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable and who will fulfill the child reunification or permanent plan requirements.italics added.
the plain language of subdivision d states that when a new placement is required the procedures described in this section must be followed in the same way as when there is an initial placement,including the affirmative duty of the court,under subdivision a of section,to order the parents to disclose the names and pertinent family information of relatives and the obligation of the social worker to follow through on that information,contact all the relatives whose names have been provided,and evaluate those relatives desiring placement,subd.a.in contrast,at least through the reunification period,when a relative voluntarily comes forward at a time when a new placement is not required the relative is entitled to the preference and the court and the social worker are obligated to evaluate that relative but the court need not again order the parents to disclose other possible relative placements.
reading subdivision d as limiting rather than expanding or clarifying the situations in which the relative placement preference applies changes the meaning of the statute from an affirmative requirement of relative placement preference in cases of new placements to a prohibition against the relative placement preference in other situations.nothing in the language of subdivision d eliminates the relative placement preference when a qualified relative comes forward after the initial placement and during the family reunification period and seeks placement of the child.nor does subdivision d prevent a child welfare department from continuing to search for an appropriate relative placement after the child initially has been placed with a.
appellate court decisions have consistently held that the relative placement preference applies at least through the family reunification period.in re sarah th,d in re robert th,d in re jessica d.in re baby girl d.during the reunification period,the preference applies regardless of whether a new placement is required or is otherwise being considered by the dependency court.in re jessica,supra,d at.the dependency court should have applied the relative placement preference at the review hearing,at which no new placement was required or,in the absence of the relative request,would otherwise have been under consideration.this was the law at the time subdivision d was enacted and there is nothing in the plain language of the subdivision to change that law.
b.the legislative history.
in,the legislature added subdivision d to section in a package of amendments designed in part to strengthen the preferential consideration for placement given to relatives of a dependent child who has been removed from his or her home com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended july,at and in part to clarify current law regarding the preference for placement of dependent children with relatives.rules,off.of floor analysis,bill reg.sess,as amended april,at,quoting from a letter in support of bill from the california state association of counties.
because the legislature is presumed to be aware of existing judicial interpretations when it amends a statute estate of mcdill cal d,if the legislature intended to overrule the existing judicial interpretation of section the relative placement preference applies throughout the family reunification period regardless of whether a new placement is necessary or is otherwise under would have done so explicitly.it did not do so,however,and nothing in the legislative history of the amendments contains evidence of any such intent.on the contrary,the legislative history shows that the legislature intended to strengthen the relative placement preference,not to weaken it.
the legislation made a number of changes to the relative placement preference.for our purposes,the most significant change was an amendment to subdivision a which provided the county social worker shall further investigate the existence of other relatives for possible placement and document these efforts in the social study prepared pursuant to section bill,stats,ch.this requirement,read together with the addition of subdivision d affirmatively required the social wor
